CORNER. I WONDER WHO'S LEADING!

17
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,000
- LOOKS LIKE THE EVO-FOUR
IS TRAILING BEHIND! ( exclaims )

18
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,958
- ( all screaming )

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,083
- NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE
THROUGH THE CORNERS,

20
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,875
AT THE END OF THE DAY
YOU'RE STILL JUST AN EIGHT-SIX.

21
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,583
ANYONE DRIVIN' A JUNKER LIKE
AN EIGHT-SIX IS WAY BELOW ME.

22
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,458
I WOULDN'T RACE THAT GUY
EVEN IF HE BEGGED ME TO DO IT.

23
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,916
- BUT THE CAR THAT HE'S DRIVIN',
IT'S JUST MY OPINION THAT

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,375
THE EIGHT-SIX ISN'T
THAT GOOD ANYMORE.

25
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,250
- BUT WE DON'T LOSE.
NEVER HAVE. NEVER WILL.

26
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,666
LAN-EVO'S
THE MOUNTAIN PASS KING.

27
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,708
- WELL, NO ONE CAN REALLY KNOW
WHO THE WINNER OF THE RACE IS

28
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,541
UNTIL IT'S OVER.

29
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,291
- EVEN WITH A HEAD START,

30
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,916
THERE'S NO WAY HE'LL
KEEP THE LEAD

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,083
AFTER THE FIRST CORNER. SEIJI'S
EVO-FOUR IS WAY TOO POWERFUL.

32
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,500
- YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S TRUE,

33
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,333
BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN FULLY
ACCELERATE OFF THE LINE.

34
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,125
- YOU MEAN HE STAYED BEHIND
ON PURPOSE?

35
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,791
THEN THAT MUST MEAN
HE'S FOLLOWING "SIMULATION TWO".

36
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,708
- YOU KNOW HOW
AGGRESSIVE SEIJI CAN BE.

37
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,083
HE'S JUST TRYIN' TO BE CAREFUL.

38
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,291
- WHO NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL

39
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,125
WHEN YOU'RE GOIN' UP
AGAINST AN EIGHT-SIX?

40
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,916
"SIMULATION ONE" SHOULD BE
ENOUGH TO SMOKE THAT GUY.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,541
- NOT NECESSARILY.

42
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,958
SEIJI MAY BE A TOP-NOTCH
RACER, BUT HE'S NO GENIUS.

43
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,166
EVERY RACE HE'S BEEN IN
SO FAR HAS BEEN EASY,

44
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,625
MAKING HIS CONFIDENCE
HOLLOW AT BEST.

45
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,833
"SIMULATION THREE" IS MEANT
TO TIGHTEN THE BOLTS

46
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,375
IN THAT LOOSE MIND OF HIS.

47
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,208
DON'T LET ME DOWN, SEIJI.

48
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,916
ANYTHING BUT A WIN HERE BEFORE
THE SHOWDOWN WITH RYOSUKE

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,666
IS UNACCEPTABLE.

IT'S HOPELESS. HE'S DEAD.

56
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,791
- BASICALLY THE EVO-FOUR IS
A WRC RALLY CAR ON STEROIDS.

57
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,333
IT'S GOT A LIGHT FRAME,
TURBO ENGINE, FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

58
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,791
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

THIS SEIJI GUY DRIVIN' IT HAS
FIRST-CLASS TECHNIQUE.

60
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,875
I DON'T SEE ANY WAY
TAKUMI CAN BEAT HIM.

61
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,708
- DUDES, SHUT UP! I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN TAKE ANYMORE OF THIS

62
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,666
DOOM-N-GLOOM CRAP FROM YOU TWO!

YOU KNOW HOW HE WORKS.
HE'S UNDEFEATED!

69
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,833
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A RACE

00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,000

I DON'T THINK IT'S A

WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

87

88
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,625
A BOY.

89
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,916
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I LIKE YOU A LOT. .

BUT THE FEELINGS THAT
I HAVE FOR THIS BOY

91
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,958
ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

92
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,500
PLEASE, FORGIVE ME.

93
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,333
- THIS IS A FRIGGIN' JOKE.
I DON'T SEE ANY REASON

94
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,666
WHY I HAVE TO STAY COOPED UP

95
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,833
BEHIND THIS ANCIENT
EIGHT-SIX ANY MORE.

96
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,666
I CAN BARELY PUT MY FOOT ON
THE GAS WITHOUT BUMPIN' HIM.

97
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,541
I'M STARTIN' TO GET FRUSTRATED.

98
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,958
"FULL THROTTLE" IS THE ONLY WAY

99
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,250
MY EVO-FOUR KNOWS
HOW TO OPERATE.

100
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,750
USING "SIMULATION THREE"
AGAINST THIS JUNKER

101
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,125
IS TOTALLY USELESS.

102
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,458
SAVE IT FOR THE REAL TALENT
INSTEAD OF WASTING IT

103
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,666
ON THIS AMATEUR, KYOICHI!

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,333
- DON'T LET YOUR IMPATIENCE
DO YOU IN, SEIJI.

105
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,750
- MAN, I AM SO PISSED OFF?
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

106
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,416
WHY AM I LETTING THIS
GET TO ME?

107
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,791
- man 1: HEY, KEISUKE?
- YEAH?

108
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,041
- YOU TALK TO YOUR BROTHER?

109
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,291
I'M CURIOUS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
ABOUT THIS RACE.

110
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,041
- HE DIDN'T SAY MUCH.

111
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,250
THE ONLY THING HE TOLD ME

112
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,666
WAS TO STAND IN THIS
EXACT SPOT AND WATCH.

113
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,500
- THEN IT SOUNDS LIKE HE
MUST'VE HAD A GOOD REASON

114
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,541
TO TELL YOU THAT, HUH?

115
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,666
- YUP.

116
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,125
- I DON'T GET WHAT
THERE IS TO SEE.

117
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,916
THERE'S NO WAY THE
EIGHT-SIX CAN WIN.

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,416
I MEAN, COME ON,

119
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,583
THE KID'S GOING UP AGAINST A
LAN-EVO FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD.

120
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,708
- I'VE NEVER TOLD YOU THIS

121
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,333
BUT YOU'RE A REAL
KNOW-IT-ALL, KENTA.

122
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,083
AND YOU'D ASSUME
IT'S COMMON SENSE

123
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,416
THAT YOUR S-FOURTEEN IS
FASTER THAN AN EIGHT-SIX,

124
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,750
YET IT DIDN'T SEEM TO WORK OUT
FOR YOU VERY WELL NOW, DID IT?

125
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,208
- COME ON, TAKE
IT EASY, KEISUKE,

126
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,625
YOU'RE JUST TORTURING HIM.

127
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,833
THE RACE AGAINST THE EIGHT-SIX

128
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,708
WAS A GREAT LEARNING
EXPERIENCE FOR KENTA,

129
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,583
SO IT WASN'T A TOTAL WASTE, MAN.

130
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,875
- YEAH? WELL,
TOO BAD I DON'T CARE.

131
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,458
THE EMPERORS, OR WHATEVER
THEY CALL THEMSELVES,

132
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,041
ARE GONNA BE IN FOR A BIG
SURPRISE ONCE THIS RACE IS OVER.

133
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,875
TAKUMI FUJIWARA IS
AKINA'S DOWNHILL KING

134
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,750
AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

135
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,500
- THIS IS THE LONGEST
STRAIGHTAWAY

136
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,750
ON THIS ENTIRE COURSE.

137
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,916
IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE FOR ME TO
MAKE A MOVE IF I WANT THE LEAD.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,666
- IF YOU GET IMPATIENT
AND PASS THE LEADER TOO EARLY,

139
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,916
THEN IT'S ALL OVER.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,125
- DAMN IT!! THAT'S IT!
THIS PUNK'S GOIN' DOWN!

141
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,000
- THAT'S HOW EVERYONE'S
LOST TO THE EIGHT-SIX,

142
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,625
AND THAT INCLUDES MY BROTHER.

143
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,708
- SO IF YOU JUMP AHEAD,
YOU LOSE, HUH?

144
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,625
- GOOD. I WASN'T SURE IF YOU
COULD WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND

145
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,750
SUCH A PARADOX.

146
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,583
- SCREW IT! I'M GOIN' FOR IT!

147
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,166
SORRY, KYOICHI, BUT "SIMULATION
THREE" IS GONNA HAVE TO WAIT.

148
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,416
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO WIN
THIS RACE MY OWN WAY!

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,541
- HE'S FAST.

150
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,416
- ( chuckles ) THAT WAS EASY.

151
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,208
TIME TO SHOW THIS KID HOW
OUTCLASSED HE IS.

152
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,958
AS LONG AS I KEEP
THE ACCELERATOR DOWN,

153
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,875
YOU'LL BE JUST A FADING
GLIMMER OF LIGHT IN MY REARVIEW.

154
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,791
CATCH YA LATER, EIGHT-SIX.

155
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,916
- Narrator: INITIAL D.

156
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,875
INITIAL D.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,333
INITIAL D.

158
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,583
- man: IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN
DO TO MAKE YOU RECONSIDER?

159
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,375
THE TIME I SPEND WITH YOU
MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING.

160
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,958
I DON'T MIND IF YOU HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

161
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,083
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING.

162
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,416
AS LONG AS OUR RELATIONSHIP
STAYS THE SAME.

163
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I KNOW. HOW ABOUT IF I STARTED

164
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,083
GIVING YOU MORE
MONEY EVERY MONTH?

165
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,250
- COME ON, STOP IT.

166
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,291
THAT'S NOT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT, OKAY?

167
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,583
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED YOU.
YOU KNOW THAT.

168
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,583
AND DESPITE HOW DIFFERENT
OUR AGES ARE,

169
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,083
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
IT WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL

170
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,583
TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH SOMEBODY I LIKED,

171
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,458
BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT,
IT MAKES SENSE.

172
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,625
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE GIVING ME
ALL THOSE GIFTS.

173
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,333
NOW BEING WITH YOU
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

174
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:16,291
- DO YOU LIKE THIS BOY
AS MORE THAN JUST A FRIEND?

175
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,875
- I, UH, I THINK I DO.

176
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,875
I'M SORRY BUT THAT'S ALL
I CAN SAY FOR RIGHT NOW.

177
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,333
- WHAT? ARE YOU'RE KIDDING ME?

178
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,208
HE MADE A PASS
DURING THE STRAIGHTAWAY?

179
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,208
SEIJI'S IN THE LEAD,
GUYS! ( cheering )

180
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,875
- DAMN, I KNEW IT.

181
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,791
- SEIJI'S DRIVIN' LIKE HIMSELF
NOW! HE'S GOT THIS IN THE BAG!

182
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,875
- YEAH, THAT EIGHT-SIX
IS TOTALLY WEAK!

183
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,916
- boy 1: FOR SURE! AND I KNOW
HE MAY NOT LOOK IT,

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,958
BUT SEIJI HAS SOME
SERIOUS SKILLS.

185
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,583
THERE'S NO WAY HE'LL LOSE NOW.

186
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,750
- DUMBASS!

187
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,791
I WILL GIVE SEIJI SOME CREDIT.

188
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,916
HE'S MASTERED DRIVING HIS
LAN-EVO AT FULL SPEED.

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,708
HE ALSO KNOWS THAT
A FOUR WHEEL-DRIVE

190
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,416
HAS TO ENTER A CORNER
AT TOP SPEED

191
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,416
IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY
COMPLETE A DRIFT.

192
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,083
DURING THE DRIFT ITSELF,
YOU CAN ONLY CONTROL THE CAR

193
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,833
BY STEERING WHILE THE GAS PEDAL
IS SLAMMED INTO THE FLOOR.

194
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,875
YOU'LL FISHTAIL IF YOU
TRY TO CONTROL THE DRIFT

195
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,916
BY ONLY MANIPULATING THE GAS
PEDAL, LIKE YOU WOULD IN AN FR.

196
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,375
FULL ACCELERATION IS
THE ONLY WAY TO DRIFT

197
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,666
IN A FOUR-WHEEL-DRIVE.

198
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,708
THAT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECT
OF RACING IN A FOUR-WHEEL-DRIVE.

199
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,041
NO ONE WITH JUST MEDIOCRE SKILLS
CAN HANDLE A CAR AT FULL SPEED

200
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,500
THROUGH A DRIFT.

201
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,666
BUT ONCE YOU'RE ABLE TO
MASTER THE TECHNIQUE,

202
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,916
YOU CAN TURN ANY CORNER

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,666
YOU COME UP ON AT
RIDICULOUSLY HIGH SPEEDS.

204
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,333
I GUESS SEIJI DOES HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO KNOCK THIS KID OUT.

205
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,666
- ( tires screeching )

206
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,958
BUT, WHY AM I FEELING
SO ON EDGE?

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,458
- ENTER AT TOP SPEED AND TURN
WITH FULL ACCELERATION.

208
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,875
IT'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT MANEUVER

209
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,666
THAN THE SLOW-ASSED CRAB TURN

210
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,208
THE EIGHT-SIX HAS TO DO.
NOW WATCH AND LEARN.

211
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,666
BUT I GUESS HE'D HAVE TO
BE SOMEWHAT CLOSE

212
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,166
TO SEE IT WITH HIS OWN EYES.

213
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,375
I DOUBT HE'S ANYWHERE NEAR ME.
I WONDER IF HE'S GIVEN UP.

214
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,000
WHAT THE HELL?

215
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,541
I DON'T GET IT!
HE'S RIGHT ON MY ASS!

216
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,875
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? HOW WAS HE
ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH MY DRIFT?

217
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,416
HE'S BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.
HUH. NOW THIS IS A RACE.

218
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,333
- NOW I SEE. I WASN'T GETTIN'
IRRITATED BACK THERE

219
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,291
BECAUSE HE WAS STOPPING
ME FROM THE SPEEDS

220
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,791
I WANTED ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS.

221
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,750
I THINK I KNEW
WHAT WAS BOTHERING ME

222
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,958
BACK WHEN I WAS FOLLOWING HIM,

223
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,791
BUT FOR SOME REASON
I KEPT IGNORING IT.

224
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,583
I HATE TO ADMIT IT
BUT IT'S TRUE.

225
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,625
DAMMIT. I'M JUST NOT AS FAST
IN THE CORNERS AS HE IS!

226
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,625
- SO FAR, I'VE MANAGED
TO KEEP UP WITH HIS PACE.

227
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,541
- Seiji: THERE'S ONE
OTHER THING TOO.

228
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,666
THE STRAIGHTAWAYS HERE
ARE SHORTER THAN NORMAL

229
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,375
SO THE SEPARATION IN
POWER BETWEEN US

230
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,708
DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE.

231
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,416
BUT JUST WAIT. WE'RE COMIN' UP
ON THE HIGH-SPEED SECTION,

232
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,250
AND ONCE WE DO, I'M GONNA BLOW
THIS EIGHT-SIX OUTTA THE WATER!

233
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,375
THEY'RE ABOUT TO SEE
SOME MAGIC!

234
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,875
AT THE END OF THIS
LONG STRAIGHTAWAY

235
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,416
COMES A HAIRPIN TURN.

236
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,208
I'LL BE AT FULL THROTTLE,
READY TO MAKE MY MOVE.

237
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,958
AND THE REST WILL BE HISTORY.

238
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,291
HERE IT COMES.

239
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,625
I'M GONNA OUTRACE THIS KID
WITH MY TECHNIQUE ALONE.

240
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,125
I DON'T NEED THE POWER
OF MY CAR TO WIN.

241
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,750
- HOLY CRAP! HE'S REALLY FAST!

242
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,958
THE FASTEST
I'VE EVER GONE UP AGAINST.

243
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
- THEY SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

244
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,875
- ( tires screeching )

245
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,958
- boy 2: LOOK! HERE THEY COME!

246
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,625
THE LAN-EVO'S IN THE LEAD!
HE'S COMIN' IN FAST!

247
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,250
- THIS IS THE BEST SEAT IN THE
HOUSE. AKINA'S FIVE HAIRPINS!

248
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,916
- ( crowd cheers )

249
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,916
- MAN, WHAT INCREDIBLE POWER!

250
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,958
- YEAH, IT'S JUST LIKE A WORLD
RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP CAR!

251
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,291
- ( tires screeching )

252
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,416
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW FAR BEHIND THE EIGHT-SIX IS!

253
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,958
I'VE SEEN ALMOST ALL HIS RACES

254
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,250
AND HE'S NEVER HAD
THIS MUCH GROUND

255
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,208
TO MAKE UP GOIN' INTO HAIRPINS.

256
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,208
- WHO KNOWS? MAYBE
THE EIGHT-SIX WON'T BE ABLE

257
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,791
TO PULL OFF A WIN THIS TIME.

258
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,541
HIS CAR IS TOTALLY INFERIOR.

259
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,250
THERE HE IS!

260
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,500
- IT'S TIME TO START
USING THE DITCH.

261
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,958
- THAT WAS AWESOME!

262
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,458
- YEAH, I KNOW.
HOW DID HE TURN SO FAST?

263
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,666
- DID YA SEE THAT?

264
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,416
BUNTA'S SON WAS BEHIND THE
WHEEL OF THAT CAR.

265
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,750
- YOU'RE KIDDIN' ME, RIGHT?

266
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,458
I MEAN, DAMN,
IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

267
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,625
I WOULD'VE ASSUMED THAT
IT WAS BUNTA

268
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,875
STEERING THROUGH THAT CORNER.

269
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,833
JUST THE SOUND ALONE
SHOWS THE KIND OF TALENT

270
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,458
THAT KID REALLY HAS.

271
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,750
I SWEAR HE HAD TO HAVE REALLY
BEEN FLOORIN' THE PEDAL

272
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,291
THROUGHOUT MOST OF THAT DRIFT.

273
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,250
I'VE NEVER SEEN A TEENAGER
WITH THAT CALIBER OF SKILLS

274
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,666
UNDER HIS BELT!

275
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,541
- WELL, THE APPLE DOESN'T FALL
TOO FAR FROM THE TREE.

276
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,750
- YEAH, BUT
THAT SORT OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVING

277
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,000
CAN TEAR AN ENGINE TO PIECES
ALMOST AS IF IT WERE PAPER.

278
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,375
- ( grunts ) DAMN,
THESE TURNS ARE A BITCH!

279
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,541
I MAY HAVE LOST SOME TIME, BUT
NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

280
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,583
I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF CAR
YOU'RE IN,

281
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,000
ANYONE WOULD LOSE SPEED
ON THESE TURNS.

282
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,333
NOW THAT I HAVE
SUCH A HUGE LEAD,

283
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,000
IT SHOULD BE SMOOTH SAILIN'
ALL THE WAY TILL THE END.

284
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,416
WHAT THE...

285
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,583
- ♪ AS YOU KNOW, BABY,
STAY TONIGHT ♪

286

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,833

KIDDIN' ME!

289
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,166
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,875

293
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,916
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

294
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,166
I CAN'T EVEN SHAKE OFF
AN EIGHT-SIX?

295
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,625
WITH ALL MY POWER
AND TECHNIQUE,

296
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,041
THIS RACE SHOULD
BE OVER ALREADY!

297
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,291
YOU BASTARD.
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU PASS ME!

298
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,208
- THEY SHOULD BE HERE SOON.

299
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,083
- SO I WONDER WHICH ONE'S
GONNA BE IN THE LEAD.

300
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,416
MAN, THE LAN-EVO
OR THE EIGHT-SIX?

301
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,375
KEISUKE, YOU SAID THAT
IF THE LAN-EVO IS IN THE LEAD,

302
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,625
THEN HE'LL END
UP LOSING THE RACE,

303
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,916
BUT HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

304
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,750
- THAT'S EASY. FROM
MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

305
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,416
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO HE WON'T
LET YOU RUN AWAY WITH THE LEAD.

306
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,541
HE STICKS TO YOUR BUMPER
LIKE SUPER GLUE.

307
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,333
IF YOU LET HIM GET TO YOU
AND START RELYING ON POWER

308
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,333
THEN YOUR TIRES WILL START
TO LOSE AIR PRESSURE.

309
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,625
- I CAN'T GET THIS PUNK
OFF MY ASS!

310
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,500
- THE KEY HERE IS HOW
YOU USE THE TIRES

311
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,416
TO YOUR GREATEST ADVANTAGE.

312
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,125
ANYONE WHO JUMPS INTO THE LEAD
WITHOUT KNOWING THAT WILL LOSE.

313
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,958
- Seiji: MY FRONT TIRES
ARE LOSING PRESSURE.

314
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:30,916
THIS RACE IS PISSING ME OFF.
I CAN'T STAY FOCUSED!

315
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,208
DON'T PANIC, THOUGH.
THERE'S NO NEED TO FREAK OUT.

316
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,625
I CAN WIN THIS
AS LONG AS I KEEP MY LEAD.

317
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,666
I'M IN A BETTER POSITION
THAN HIM ANYWAY.

318
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,916
NO MATTER HOW FAST HE IS
IN THE TURNS,

319
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,916
HE STILL CAN'T GET
ENOUGH SPEED TO PASS ME

320
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,250
WHEN WE'RE OUT OF 'EM.

321
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,416
ONCE WE HIT THE LAST
STRAIGHTAWAY, I'M HOME FREE!

322
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,958
( sighs )

323
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,375
I WAS RIGHT.

324
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,750
DITCHING SIMULATION THREE
AND TAKING THE LEAD BACK THERE

325
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,125
WAS THE RIGHT MOVE.
I'VE WON THIS RACE, KYOICHI!

326
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:05,250
- ♪ I WANNA SAY TO YOU,
LET ME SAY AGAIN ♪

327
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,500
♪ I LOVE YOU
LIKE YOU ARE, BABY ♪

328

330

- Announcer: THE END IS NEAR!
WHAT DID TAKUMI DECIDE TO DO

331
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,625
DURING HIS TOUGHEST
RACE YET?

332
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,666
NEXT ON INITIAL D
SECOND STAGE.

333
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,458
- Takumi: HOLLOW VICTORY.

334
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:19,833
- Announcer: DON'T MISS IT!
