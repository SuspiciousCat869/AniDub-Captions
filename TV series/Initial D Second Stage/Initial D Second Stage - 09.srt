HEY, DAD. MIND IF I PULL OUT
THE HEATER? IT'S FREEZING.

19
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,875
- LAZINESS IS WHAT'S
MAKING YOU COLD.

20
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,375
YOU SHOULD TRY STAYING BUSY.

21
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,833
- YEAH, RIGHT. YOU SOUND JUST
LIKE MY PE TEACHER AT SCHOOL.

22
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,333
- ( car engine running )

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,291
- HUH?

24
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,666
NO WAY. YOU FIXED IT UP
ALREADY?

25
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,791
DOES IT RUN OR DID YOU
JUST CLEAN IT UP?

26
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,125
- 'COURSE IT RUNS.
BETTER THAN IT HAS IN A WHILE.

27
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,125
AND I PUT IN A NEW ENGINE, TOO.

28
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,500
YOU CAN START USING IT
FOR YOUR DELIVERIES AGAIN.

29
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,791
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I NEED TO TELL YOU, TAKUMI.

30
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,416
I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO USE SOME
OF YOUR OWN HARD-EARNED MONEY

31
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,916
TO FIX UP THE CAR THIS TIME.
SO FROM NOW ON,

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,208
YOU AND I BOTH
OWN IT, FIFTY-FIFTY.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,875
- BUT, IT WAS ME WHO BROKE
THE CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE.

34
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,208
ARE YOU SURE?

35
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,458
- YEAH BUT YOU DIDN'T BLOW
THE ENGINE ON PURPOSE.

36
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,375
IT'S OKAY, I KNOW
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

37
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,416
I HAD TO SPEND EVERYTHING YOU'VE
SAVED UP FROM YOUR PART-TIME JOB

38
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,916
AS WELL AS YOUR
MORNING DELIVERIES

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,583
IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.

40
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,875
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO FEEL
ATTACHED TO IT IF YOU WANT,

41
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,750
NOW THAT IT'S HALF YOURS.

42
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,916
ANYWAY, I'VE ALREADY
MADE UP MY MIND.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,083
THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING
TO BE FROM NOW ON.

44
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,791
YOU'D BETTER GET GOING, OKAY?

45
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,083
FINISH UP THOSE DELIVERIES
BEFORE THEY GET COLD.

46
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,916
- OH. RIGHT.

47
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,791
SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS FEELS WEIRD.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,291
- I INSTALLED A BUCKET SEAT,

49
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,125
SO YOUR EYE LEVEL'S GOING
TO BE A LITTLE LOWER

50
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,666
THAN YOU'RE USED TO.

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,458
WATCH, IN A FEW DAYS YOU WON'T
EVEN NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,416
- THE STEERING'S HEAVIER
THAN BEFORE.

53
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,416
SAME WITH THE CLUTCH.

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,916
- ( engine revs )

55
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,166
- ( gasps )

56
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:14,000
- WHEN YOU FIRST PUSH IN
THE CLUTCH THAT'S THE MOMENT.

57
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,500
THAT'S WHEN YOU
REALLY NOTICE IT.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,083
JUST HOW DIFFERENT IT FEELS.

59
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,291
- ( clock ticking )

60
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,833
- ( ticking echoes )

61
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,958
- GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR BUDDY
IN THE MERCEDES.

62
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,791
LUCK WITH YOUR BUDDY
IN THE MERCEDES.

63
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,666
WITH YOUR BUDDY IN THE MERCEDES.

64
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,208
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR BUDDY
IN THE MERCEDES.

65
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,541
- HOW DID HE FIND OUT?

66
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,250
OF ALL THE PEOPLE TO KNOW.

67
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:57,583
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
I'M SUCH A HORRIBLE PERSON.

68
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,958
IF THIS IS A DREAM,
PLEASE LET ME WAKE UP.

69
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,958
- ( tires screeching )

70
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,833
- MAN, THIS IS REALLY TOUGH
TO CONTROL. WHAT THE HELL?

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,166
- Kenji: WHAT?
- Iketani: WHAT?

72
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,208
- THE EIGHT-SIX
IS FIXED ALREADY?

73
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,875
- SERIOUSLY? HAVE YOU TAKEN IT
FOR A TEST DRIVE YET?

74
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:39,666
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

75
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,083
- HOW'D IT FEEL?

76
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,791
- I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS IT
PRETTY MUCH DROVE

77
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,416
LIKE ANY OTHER CAR DOES.

78
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,041
- ( both gasping )

79
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,250
- VERY FUNNY.

80
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,708
- WE KNOW THAT, DUDE. BUT THAT,
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE MEANT.

81
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,208
NOW STOP PLAYING DUMB WITH US.

82
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,250
- I BET ONCE THEY FIND OUT
HOW AMAZING THE NEW ENGINE IS,

83
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,250
THOSE TWO ARE GOING
TO GO ABSOLUTELY BANANAS.

84
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,125
- SO WHAT'S THE NEW ENGINE LIKE?
IS IT A BEAST?

85
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,791
- IS IT FAST?

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,458
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

87
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,666
I THINK THE TWO OF YOU ARE GOING
TO BE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

88
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,250
ONCE I TELL YOU THIS.

89
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,750
I GET THE FEELING THE NEW ENGINE
IS SLOWER THAN THE OLD ONE.

90
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,458
LIKE IT ISN'T QUITE AS POWERFUL.

91
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,958
- ( gasps )

92
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,625
- ( Itsuki singing )

93
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:26,375
♪ I'M A LONELY DRIVER,
THE KING OF THE MOUNTAIN PASS ♪

94
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,291
WHOA. THAT IS AN
AWESOME EIGHT-SIX.

95
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,875
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE NEVER
SEEN THIS ONE BEFORE.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,458
- Yuuichi: HEY, TAKUMI.

97
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,333
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID JUST NOW.

98
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,083
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOUR
NEW ENGINE LACKS POWER?

99
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,916
- OH, I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST
FEELS A LITTLE SLOWER TO ME.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,708
- BUT HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

101
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,291
SEE, YOUR DAD TOLD ME
THAT ENGINE'S PREMIUM.

102
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,708
BEST OF IT'S CLASS.

103
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,333
- UH, MY DAD
REALLY TOLD YOU THAT?

104
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,666
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DISAGREE
WITH HIM ON THAT ONE.

105
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,125
'CAUSE IT'S KINDA,
WELL, HARD TO CONTROL.

106
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,500
- SURE, I DON'T DOUBT THAT.

107
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,416
BUT ISN'T THAT BECAUSE
IT HAS MORE POWER

108
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,416
THAN YOU WERE USED TO
BEFOREHAND WITH THE OLD ENGINE?

109
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,125
SEE THE NEW ENGINE
SHOULD INCREASE YOUR POWER.

110
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,625
- HEY BOSS, DID YOU
GET A LOOK AT IT?

111
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,083
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
OF ENGINE IT IS?

112
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,750
- HUH?
- HAVE YOU DRIVEN IT?

113
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,333
- ME? NO.
I HAVEN'T BEEN NEAR IT.

114
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:18,958
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING
ON. I'M JUST GUESSING HERE.

115
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,000
WHAT IS GOING ON, BUNTA?

116
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:25,041
HOW CAN THE NEW ENGINE WE
PUT IN HAVE LESS POWER?

117
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,458
- Itsuki: WOW, IT'S GOT
A ROLL BAR AND A BUCKET SEAT.

118
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,916
THAT IS SO COOL.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,250
IF I HAD AN EIGHT-SIX
OF MY OWN,

120
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,125
I'D DO IT UP JUST LIKE THIS.

121
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:38,958
WHOA. OH, AND IT'S GOT
A BOOST METER TOO?

122
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,750
THAT MEANS, THIS EIGHT-SIX
IS A FREAKING TURBO.

123
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,208
THIS IS THE BEST CAR
I'VE EVER SEEN.

124
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,583
I WANT THIS LEVIN
SO BAD. I WANT IT.

125
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,916
( exclaiming in excitement )

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,208
- Kazumi: HEY.
WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING?

127
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,750
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ALL OVER MY CAR?

128
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,875
- WELL, YOU KNOW.
I WAS JUST ADMIRING IT.

129
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,750
IT'S A SWEET-ASS RIDE.

130
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,875
- SWEET-ASS RIDE? WHAT THE
HECK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

131
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,625
THIS THING'S ONLY
A DOMESTIC. WEIRDO.

132
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,958
BE HONEST WITH ME. I SAW YOU
MESSING AROUND WITH IT.

133
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,750
IS IT 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T
HAVE GUNMA PLATES?

134
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,916
- YOU OUT OF YOUR
FREAKING MIND?

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,125
YOU REALLY THINK
I'D DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

136
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:22,083
- HEY, TAKE IT EASY.
STOP YELLING. CHILL OUT.

137
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,541
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I LOVE EIGHT-SIXES. OKAY?

138
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,250
SO, GO AHEAD AND SUE ME.

139
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,666
AND WATCH WHAT YOU SAY.

140
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,458
US GUNMA PEEPS DON'T MESS
WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S CARS.

141
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,083
YOU GOT THAT? GOOD.

142
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,625
HOW RUDE.

143
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,791
- Wataru: KAZUMI.

144
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,875
IT'S OUR LUCKY DAY. I FOUND THE
HOTEL OUR AUNT'S WORKING AT.

145
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,583
OH, HEY.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

146
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,083
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. BY THE
WAY, GUNMA IS FULL OF JERKS.

147
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,125
- WHAT? HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
YOU JUST GOT HERE TODAY, SIS.

148
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,458
AND LIKE IT OR NOT,

149
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,291
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

150
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,958
SO PLEASE TRY TO HAVE A
LITTLE PATIENCE FOR ME, OKAY?

151
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,458
THIS ATTITUDE OF YOURS
WORRIES ME.

152
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,708
YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO
LEARN HOW TO CHILL OUT MORE.

153
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,958
THE WORK IS ONLY TEMPORARY,

154
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,208
BUT YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH
CUSTOMERS ALL DAY.

155
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,208
YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE
OUR AUNT LOOK BAD, DO YOU?

156
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,541
- I'LL BE FINE.

157
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,166
- LIKE, IF A
CUSTOMER'S BEING RUDE,

158
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,250
YOU CAN'T YELL OR ANYTHING.

159
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,291
- OKAY, I PROMISE. I'LL BE ON
MY BEST BEHAVIOR AT WORK.

160
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,875
BUT ONLY IF YOU PROMISE NOT
TO GO TO AKAGI FOR A SPIN

161
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,000
ON YOUR WAY HOME.

162
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,208
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S A DEAL.

163
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,916
I WOULDN'T WANNA GO UP THERE
ON A CROWDED SUNDAY ANYWAY.

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,083
- THINK I'LL FALL FOR THAT?

165
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,916
I CAN ALWAYS SEE
THROUGH YOUR LIES.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,333
I KNOW YOU CAME HERE TO RACE.
AKAGI'S FC, AM I RIGHT?

167
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:40,958
- THE FC?

168
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,916
I REALLY CAN'T SAY.

169
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,833
- Yuuichi: HEY, ABOUT
THAT NEW ENGINE.

170
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,541
I OVERHEARD TAKUMI
TELLING THE BOYS

171
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,666
IT WAS SLOWER THAN THE OLD ONE.

172
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,250
- YEAH.
- SO WHAT?

173
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,583
DID YOU SET IT UP THAT
WAY ON PURPOSE?

174
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,708
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

175
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,791
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WORK
THAT WOULD TAKE.

176
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,333
- I DON'T GET IT. WHAT DO
YOU HAVE UP YOUR SLEEVE?

177
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,541
- TAKUMI'S BASICALLY RIGHT.

178
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,750
AND WHAT HE SAID MAKES
PERFECT SENSE.

179
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,125
- HUH?
- OH, COME ON, YUUICHI.

180
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,958
GIVE ME A BREAK HERE.

181
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,500
THE ANSWER'S RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOUR BIG UGLY MUG.

182
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,000
- IT IS?

183
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,458
- FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOURSELF.
I'M GOING TO HANG UP.

184
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,250
TOO MUCH TO DO.

185
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,041
- BUNTA, WAIT. DON'T HANG
UP YET. I STILL HAVE TO...

186
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,458
- ( phone dialtone )

187
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,875
- WHAT IS WITH HIM?

188
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,000
- ( engine revving )

189
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,916
- MAN, IT'S BEEN DAYS.

190
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,958
DAMN IT. I STILL
CAN'T CONTROL IT.

191
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,166
- ( tires screeching )

192
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,833
- ( panting )

193
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,375
- CRAP. I'M GOING TO BE LATE
FOR WORK AGAIN.

194
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,041
WELL, LOOK WHO IT IS. IT'S THAT
GIRL WHO FREAKED OUT ON ME.

195
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,333
- INITIAL D.

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,666
- INITIAL D.

197
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,041
- I'LL TAKE SIX TO GO.

198
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,791
FIVE IN THE BAG AND I THINK
I'LL EAT ONE NOW.

199
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,916
- ALL RIGHT. THAT'S SIX-SIXTY
YEN. CAREFUL, IT'S HOT.

200
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,083
- MMM.

201
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,708
UH-OH. I'M TEN SHORT.

202
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,750
I'M SO SORRY, BUT IS THERE ANY
WAY YOU COULD BREAK A 10,000?

203
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,875
- I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
CHANGE TO COVER THAT.

204
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,416
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

205
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,458
- REALLY?

206
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,625
OH, NO.

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,125
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

208
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,500
- HEY, THANKS FOR DOING THAT.
I PROMISE I'LL PAY YOU BACK.

209
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,708
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

210
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,083
- BUT I WANT TO.

211
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,083
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SLEEP
AT NIGHT IF I DIDN'T.

212
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,875
LET ME KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU
SO I CAN MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

213
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,583
- OKAY. WELL, DO YOU SEE
THAT GAS STATION?

214
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,458
THAT'S WHERE I WORK.
I'M THERE MOST DAYS.

215
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,708
- I JUST STARTED A TEMP JOB
AT THE HOTEL IN TOWN

216
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,291
WHERE I'M STAYING.

217
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,708
MY AUNT WORKS THERE.

218
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,208
I'M RUNNING AN ERRAND
FOR HER RIGHT NOW.

219
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,541
- I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE
OTHER DAY. YOU'RE A NICE GUY.

220
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,000
- YEAH?

221
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,708
- I KNOW YOU'RE MAD
AND SORRY I WAS MEAN

222
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,750
BUT I WAS ACTUALLY HAPPY.

223
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,458
PEOPLE RARELY COMPLEMENT
MY BROTHER'S LEVIN.

224
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,625
- OH, SO IT'S YOUR
BROTHER'S CAR.

225
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,625
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW
ANYONE HERE IN GUNMA YET.

226
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:49,541
SO, I WAS STARTING TO GET KINDA
BORED AND A LITTLE LONELY TOO.

227
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,291
YOU AND I SHOULD HANG OUT
SOMETIME. I'M KAZUMI AKIYAMA.

228
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,208
- ITSUKI. ITSUKI TAKEUCHI.

229
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,583
- SEE YOU AROUND. BYE.

230
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,041
- ( heartbeat resonating )

231
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,416
- THIS FEELING. COULD IT BE?

232
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,625
AW, CRAP.

233
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,916
- SO, AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX
IS BACK, HUH?

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,375
- KENTA WAS TELLING ME HE SAW IT
DRIVE BY JUST THE OTHER NIGHT.

235
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,375
HE SAID IT HAD
THE FUJIWARA TOFU SIGN

236
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,208
RIGHT ON THE DOOR
AND EVERYTHING.

237
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,875
- IT KINDA MAKES ME WONDER.

238
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,250
THINK MAYBE HE PUT
IN A NEW ENGINE?

239
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,333
- I THINK WE SHOULD DO
A LITTLE SCOUTING.

240
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,500
- YEAH.

241
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,166
- ( car approaching )

242
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,500
- HEAR THAT?

243
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,833
- ( engine revving )

244
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,083
- I KNOW THAT SOUND.

245
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,416
- tires screeching )

246
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,250
- HEY BRO.
IS THAT HIM?

247
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,166
- YEAH. SOUNDS TO ME,
LIKE HE ISN'T FULLY ACCUSTOMED

248
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,000
TO THE NEW ENGINE YET.

249
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,958
LOOKS LIKE THE EIGHT-SIX
HAS BEEN REBORN AS A MONSTER.

250
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,291
- WELL, YOU WERE GONE
LONGER THAN I EXPECTED.

251
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,875
SO, DID ANYTHING HAPPEN?

252
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,708
- NOT MUCH.
I FINISHED MY DELIVERIES,

253
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,250
DROVE A FEW LAPS
AROUND THE PASS.

254
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,333
I GUESS I MUST'VE USED A LITTLE
MORE GAS THAN I MEANT TO,

255
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,791
'CAUSE THE TANK'S SITTING JUST
ABOVE EMPTY. SORRY ABOUT THAT.

256
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,500
- UH. I DON'T CARE.

257
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,958
- HEY, DAD?
- HMM?

258
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,166
- CORNERING IN THE NEW CAR IS
TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE.

259
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,000
IT CAME SO EASY
TO ME BEFOREHAND

260
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,208
BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE
I'M STRUGGLING

261
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,083
JUST TO GET THROUGH
A WHOLE TURN.

262
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,708
IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING.

263
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,875
I'VE BEEN TRYING A FEW
DIFFERENT THINGS,

264
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,416
BUT SO FAR IT'S NOT
GOING SO WELL.

265
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,250
- THAT'S THE ATTITUDE, SON.

266
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,833
RATHER THAN MESSING AROUND
WITH THE SUSPENSION SETTINGS,

267
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,291
YOU'RE CHANGING
UP YOUR TECHNIQUE

268
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,791
TO MAKE UP FOR THE GAP.

269
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,625
GO AHEAD AND STRUGGLE
WITH IT FOR A WHILE.

270
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,708
TRIAL AND ERROR IS AN IMPORTANT
PART OF THE LEARNING PROCESS.

271
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,375
GIVEN TIME, THIS CAR WILL
ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR TECHNIQUE

272
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,583
AND BEST OF ALL
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

273
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,416
YOU'RE STILL GROWING AS A DRIVER

274
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,333
AND THIS CAR IS
GOING TO BE A BIG HELP

275
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,666
IN YOUR JUMP TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

276
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,666
- ( Itsuki humming )
- HEY, ITSUKI.

277
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,666
- KAZUMI?

278
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,166
- I'M HERE TO PAY YOU BACK,
JUST LIKE I SAID I WOULD.

279
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,458
HERE. AND THAT SHOULD
MAKE US EVEN, OKAY?

280
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:58,250
- YOU REALLY SAVED ME YESTERDAY.
- YEAH?

281
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,333
- OH, GREAT.
WHO'S THAT?

282
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,375
- SEE YOU TONIGHT.

283
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,250
- ( laughs )

284
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,666
- SO, WHO'S THE CHICK?
EH, BUD?

285
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,333
- OH, SHE'S JUST
A FRIEND OF MINE.

286
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,833
- A FRIEND?

287
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,750
I THOUGHT YOUR MANTRA WAS
THAT RACERS DON'T NEED GIRLS.

288
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,041
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO

289
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,333
MISTER LONELY BOY RACE CAR
DRIVER ITSUKI, HUH?

290
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,208
ANSWER ME WHEN
I AM TALKING TO YOU.

291
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,833
- ( car honks )

292
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,291
- NO WAY. HE DRIVES A LEVIN TOO.

293
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,125
ITSUKI. OH MY GOSH,
IS THIS YOUR CAR?

294
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,791
- SURE IS.

295
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,583
- Kazumi: OH, ME?

296
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,666
WELL, I ACTUALLY GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL

297
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,000
JUST THIS LAST SPRING

298
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,375
SO, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I'M A YEAR OLDER THAN YOU.

299
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,750
- WHAT DID YOU DO
AFTER YOU GRADUATED?

300
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,083
- I WENT STRAIGHT OUT AND GOT
A JOB. WELL, SORT OF.

301
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,666
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH.

302
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,791
MY BROTHER'S ALWAYS
TELLING ME HOW IMPATIENT I AM

303
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,791
AND DON'T TELL HIM I SAID SO,
BUT HE'S RIGHT.

304
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,166
- YOUR BROTHER? YOU MEAN
THE ONE WITH THE EIGHT-SIX?

305
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,708
- MMM-HMM.

306
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,791
YOU MAY THINK IT'S WEIRD
BUT HE AND I HAVE BEEN

307
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,416
ATTACHED AT THE HIP FOREVER.

308
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,750
EVEN WHEN HE'D GO RACING.

309
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,583
HE'S GOOD. THEY SAY
HE'S THE FASTEST

310
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,916
DOWNHILL RACER IN SAITAMA.

311
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,833
WATARU'S DOWNHILL IS...
OH, SORRY. I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

312
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,958
MY BROTHER'S NAME IS WATARU.
HIS DOWNHILL IS PRETTY AMAZING.

313
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,333
MY DUMB BROTHER.

314
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,375
HE'S STARTING TO USE
ME AS AN EXCUSE,

315
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,375
TO COME UP TO GUNMA
AND RACE CARS.

316
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,458
IN FACT, HE'S PROBABLY
RACING A PASS EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

317
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,166
- Keisuke: SORRY, MAN.

318
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,458
YOU SEE, THE RED SUNS
HAVE A STRICT POLICY

319
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,333
AGAINST RACING IN AKAGI.

320
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,458
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IS IT
BECAUSE I DRIVE AN EIGHT-SIX?

321
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,458
- NO. IT'S BECAUSE
IT'S TOO EASY.

322
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,208
EVERY SINGLE RACER IN GUNMA
KNOWS THAT THE RED SUNS

323
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,250
DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
RACE ON THEIR OWN TURF.

324
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,125
SO IT'S REALLY NOTHING PERSONAL.

325
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,541
THERE IS ONE THING
I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THOUGH.

326
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,916
WE TAKE OUR EIGHT-SIXES
VERY SERIOUSLY.

327
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,791
IN FACT. GUNMA'S OWN EIGHT-SIX
IS A DOWNHILL SPECIALIST.

328
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,583
YEAH, OUR BOY HAS NEVER
LOST A SINGLE BATTLE.

329
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,041
- REALLY?

330
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,666
- HE BEAT EVERY CAR
HE'S OFFICIALLY RACED.

331
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,041
- HE HAS? EVEN MORE
POWERFUL CARS?

332
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,458
- YEAH.

333
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,708
- SO WHEN I BEAT YOU,
YOU CAN TELL ME

334
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,791
WHETHER OR NOT I'M BETTER
THAN THIS GOLDEN BOY OF YOURS.

335
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,166
- WATCH IT.

336
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,541
-IT'S OKAY, KENTA. WE DON'T
RACE HERE, SO FORGET IT.

337
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,458
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE

338
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,041
BUT TRY COMING BACK IN TEN YEARS

339
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,666
IF YOU WANNA TALK
TRASH TO KEISUKE.

340
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,166
YOU GOT THAT, DOUCHEBAG?

341
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,875
- FINE THEN.

342
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,958
- ( engine revs )

343
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,916
- I HATE TO DO THIS TO YOU

344
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,666
BUT YOU'VE LEFT ME WITH
NO OTHER CHOICE.

345
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,375
- IF YOU'RE THAT DESPERATE FOR
A RACE, WHY NOT, I'VE GOT TIME.

346
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,416
- YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

347
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,458
LET'S TEACH THIS JERK A LESSON
OR TWO IN REAL STREET RACING.

348
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,166
THAT SOUND.
HE'S GOT A TURBO.

349
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,625
- HE WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW ME
OUT OF THE CORNER.

350
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,416
HIS CAR'S POWER
IS EXTRAORDINARY.

351
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,916
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

352
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,500
IS IT REALLY AN EIGHT-SIX?

353
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,083
- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW
MUCH HORSEPOWER HE'S CARRYING

354
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,250
BUT THAT MUCH JUICE WOULD
USUALLY HURT HIS CONTROL

355
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,958
ESPECIALLY IN THE TURNS.

356
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,916
A TURBO IN THAT CAR
IS A LOOSE CANNON

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,083
BUT SOMEHOW HE'S FINDING
A WAY TO CONTROL IT.

358
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,375
DAMN IT. I CAN'T KEEP UP
ANYMORE. THIS SUCKS.

359
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,125
- ( engine revs )

360
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,625
- I MAY NOT KNOW AS MUCH AS MY
BROTHER WHEN IT COMES TO RACING.

361
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,208
BUT I KNOW ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE

362
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,541
WHEN I'M UP AGAINST
A REAL THREAT.

363
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,458
- YOU BETTER GET SERIOUS DUDE
OR I'LL LEAVE YOU IN THE DUST.

364
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,708
- Man: OH MAN,
THAT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD.

365
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:47,041
WE'RE REALLY LUCKY WE WEREN'T
GOING TOO FAST, YOU KNOW?

366
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,458
- YEAH.

367
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,041
- MAY NOT BE A BAD IDEA
TO PUT UP A WARNING REFLECTOR.

368
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,708
A CAR COULD EASILY CRASH
INTO US IN THIS BLIND CORNER.

369
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,625
- ( tires screeching )

370
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,750
- ( screams )

371
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,791
- ( theme song playing )

372
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

373
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,625
- Announcer: WATARU HAS
HEARD THE RUMORS

374
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,750
AND WANTS TO RACE GUNMA'S
OTHER EIGHT-SIX.

375
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,250
BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?

376
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,750
ON THE NEXT
INITIAL D, SECOND STAGE.

377
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,333
- THE EIGHT-SIX TURBO.

378
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:20,666
- Announcer: DON'T MISS IT.
