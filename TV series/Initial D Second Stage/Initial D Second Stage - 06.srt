- SO, YOU'RE THINKING TAKUMI
TOOK HIS SHOW ON THE ROAD

16
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,958
TO AKAGI?

17
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,083
- OH. THERE YOU ARE, BOSS. YEAH,
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT WE THINK

18
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,791
BUT WE'RE NOT SURE.

19
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,541
- HE WAS ACTIN' ALL KINDS OF
LOONY TODAY.

20
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,541
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS
MALFUNCTION WAS.

21
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,833
- DIDN'T WE HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE
FROM OUR TEAM WHO HEADED OUT

22
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,541
TO AKAGI THIS AFTERNOON?

23
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,000
WE COULD ALWAYS TRY
GIVING THAT GUY A CALL.

24
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,500
- NO, IF TAKUMI WENT
THERE TO BATTLE IT OUT

25
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,875
WITH THE EVO THREE,

26
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,458
THEN IT'S TOO LATE, THE
RACE WOULD ALREADY BE A GO.

27
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,041
- ( grunting )

28
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,208
I THOUGHT HE WAS OUT ON A
HOT DATE WITH YOU, NATSUKI,

29
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,625
JUST LIVIN' THE HIGH LIFE.

30
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,500
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOIN'?

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,583
- I'M SORRY, GUYS.

32
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,625
- NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE,
YOUNG LADY.

33
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,708
NOTHING THAT'S HAPPENED
IS YOUR FAULT.

34
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,416
BESIDES, WE DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE YET

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,416
IF HE'S EVEN ACTUALLY
RACING IN AKAGI.

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,458
HE COULD BE OFF DOING
WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE.

37
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,583
- TAKUMI.

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,166
- ( tires screeching )

39
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,083
- I HAVEN'T LOST THIS THING YET.

40
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,458
- HE PASSED THE EIGHT-SIX!

41
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,958
THIS RACE IS OVER.

42
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,458
- NO WORRIES NOW, BRO.

43
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,583
KYOICHI IS WAY TOO
CAREFUL TO LOSE HIS LEAD

44
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,583
ONCE HE'S GOT IT LOCKED IN.

45
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,000
- JUST 'CAUSE HE TOOK THE LEAD
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S LOCKED.

46
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,083
YOU CAN'T RELAX YET, KYOICHI.

47
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,458
THE EIGHT-SIX COULD TURN SOUTH
ON YOU REAL QUICK.

48
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,958
THIS RACE IS FAR
FROM OVER, MY MAN.

49
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,208
- I SEE 'EM!
HERE THEY COME, DUDES!

50
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,458
- THE EVO THREE.
- IT'S THE EMPEROR!

51
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,125
- WHERE'S THE EIGHT-SIX?
- RIGHT THERE!

52
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,708
- ( both gasping )

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,083
- HE'S STARTIN' TO MOVE
FASTER AGAIN.

54
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,708
I GET IT NOW.

55
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,041
SINCE HE DOESN'T KNOW
THIS COURSE,

56
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,208
THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD
ATTACK IT AT FULL SPEED

57
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,875
WHEN HE WAS LEADING.

58
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,041
BUT WHEN HE'S TAILIN' ME,

59
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,958
THE GUY CAN PREDICT WHAT'S AHEAD
BASED ON MY MOVEMENTS.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,666
WITH THAT PIECE OF
CRAP UNDER HIM,

61
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,958
I'M AMAZED HE'S
PULLIN' THIS OFF.

62
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,500
CONSIDERING THE ACCELERATION
GAP BETWEEN US,

63
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,958
HE'S GOTTA BE TURNIN' THESE
CORNERS WAY FASTER THAN I AM.

64
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,833
- ( engine accelerating )

65
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,458
- ( tires screeching )

66
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,791
- GOTTA GIVE IT TO HIM.

67
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,583
HIS CONTROL'S SOMETHIN'
OF A MIRACLE.

68
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,208
I KNOW IT'LL PUT A
HELLUVA STRAIN ON THE TIRES,

69
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,333
BUT I WONDER IF I SHOULD
SPEED UP NOW.

70
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,250
OR MAYBE I SHOULD WAIT
UNTIL THE NEXT STRAIGHTAWAY

71
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,833
TO KICK IT ON UP.

72
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,791
( scoffs ) THAT'S STUPID OF ME!

73
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,291
I ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER.

74
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,791
I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE
THE PACE AT ALL.

75
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,833
IT'D BE THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT
OF DUMB MOVES FOR ME TO DO THAT.

76
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,666
AS FAR AS I KNOW, THAT MIGHT
HAVE EVEN BEEN HOW SEIJI LOST.

77
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,750
A RACER AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME
CONTROLS TIRE STRAIN.

78
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,708
HE DOESN'T ENCOURAGE IT.

79
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,000
I'LL JUST STICK TO THE BASICS.
THAT'S HOW I'LL WIN THIS!

80
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,416
- THE GAP ISN'T
WIDENING ANYMORE.

81
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,958
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY
STARTING TO GET SMALLER.

82
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,250
- IT'S AMAZING. THE EIGHT-SIX
IS MOVING EVEN FASTER

83
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,333
THAN HE DOES IN AKINA.

84
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,833
- WHICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

85
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,791
- YEAH? AND WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY THAT?

86
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,291
- IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MID-SECTION
OF THIS COURSE.

87
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,916
IT CONSISTS SOLELY OF
MID-SPEED S-SHAPED CORNERS.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,750
IN THAT SECTION, THE DRIVER HAS
ONLY A FRACTION OF A SECOND

89
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,833
TO ACCELERATE FROM
ONE CORNER TO THE NEXT.

90
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,291
THEY HAVE TO BE CONSOLIDATED
IN THEIR MOVEMENTS.

91
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,083
- RIGHT.

92
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,958
- THE REST OF THE TIME ON THE
COURSE IS SPENT STRUGGLING

93
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,458
WITH THE CONSTANT G-FORCE
COMING IN FROM THE SIDE.

94
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,291
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO DO.

95
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,041
AND WITH THE MISFIRING SYSTEM
THAT KYOICHI HAS INSTALLED

96
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,166
ON HIS SOUPED UP EVO THREE,

97
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,250
HE'S GOT UNBEATABLE ACCELERATION
COMING OUT OF THE CORNERS.

98
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,583
SO THE EIGHT-SIX HAS TO
COMPENSATE FOR THIS ADVANCEMENT

99
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,208
BY ENTERING CORNERS AT A MUCH A
HIGHER RATE OF VELOCITY.

100
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,791
UTILIZING ITS LIGHTWEIGHT BODY

101
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,333
WHICH IS HIS ONLY
REAL ADVANTAGE,

102
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,125
HE WAITS UNTIL THE
LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT

103
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,791
BEFORE BRAKING ON EACH CORNER.

104
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,375
THIS GIVES HIM THE USE OF THE
GRIP ON ALL FOUR TIRES

105
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,833
TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM
CORNERING SPEED.

106
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,750
IF THE EIGHT-SIX DIDN'T ALREADY
TAKE ON THE QUALITIES

107
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,750
OF BEING AN EXTENSION OF
TAKUMI'S BODY

108
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,916
DUE TO ALL THE HOURS OF
PRACTICE HE'S PUT INTO IT,

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,333
WELL, THERE'S NO WAY HE COULD
HAVE POSSIBLY ACHIEVED

110
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,500
A MIRACULOUS PERFORMANCE
LIKE THIS ONE.

111
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,958
- THEN IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
HE HASN'T GIVEN UP YET.

112
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,708
- WITH THE FRAME OF MIND
HE'S IN,

113
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,666
HE MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO
GRASP THE CONCEPT OF GIVING UP.

114
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,875
HIS VERY BEING IS BUSY
BECOMING ONE WITH THE MACHINE.

115
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,041
THAT'S JUST HIS WAY.

116
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,291
- EVEN IF I CAN MANAGE TO
SHORTEN THE GAP AT THE CORNER,

117
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,875
HE WIDENS THE DAMN THING
ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS.

118
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,500
THAT'S THE POWER DIFFERENTIAL.

119
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,000
- ( phone ringing )

120
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,000
- HELLO, FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP.

121
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,833
OH. YUUICHI, IT'S YOU.

122
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,416
NO, TAKUMI ISN'T BACK YET.
HE'S STILL OUT.

123
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,541
SO WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

124
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,250
EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE
LOOKING FOR HIM

125
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,625
LIKE HE'S THE MISSING
LINK OR SOMETHIN'.

126
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,291
HE WENT TO AKAGI?

127
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,625
I SEE.

128
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,416
- I GOTTA GIVE IT TO YOU FOR
EVEN MAKING IT THIS FAR.

129
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,958
IT'S A REAL FEAT FOR ANYONE.

130
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,708
- SEE YA LATER.

131
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,500
- ♪ I'LL BE LIKE AN ANGEL ♪

132
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,291
♪ I WILL BE YOUR SHINING STAR ♪

133
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,291
♪ NOTHING HAS CHANGED AND ♪

134
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,041
♪ I CAN SAY ANOTHER TIME ♪

135
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,250
♪ TRY TO REMEMBER ♪

136
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,958
- THIS IS THE MOMENT,
THE END OF THE S-TURN SECTION.

137
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,666
I CAN KICK IT UP TO FULL SPEED
AFTER THE NEXT CORNER.

138
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,375
THIS IS WHEN THE
SERIOUS RACING STARTS.

139
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,291
AND IT'LL END THIS THING FAST.

140
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,458
- HIS STYLE CHANGED.

141
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,875
- FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT
I'M GONNA USE THIS FEINT,

142
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,208
AND FOLLOW IT UP WITH
AN AGGRESSIVE DRIFT.

143
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,041
THAT'LL SHOW HIM THAT
I'M SERIOUS AS HELL

144
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,083
ABOUT WINNING THIS RACE.

145
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,916
IT'S NOT A LONG STRAIGHTAWAY
BY ANY MEANS.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,791
BUT IT SHOULD BE LONG ENOUGH
TO SHAKE HIM OFF MY TAIL.

147
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,750
- INITIAL D!

148
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,458
- INITIAL D!

149
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,500
- HE'S TOO FAST,
I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH HIM.

150
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,083
MAYBE THIS IS IT.
THIS IS WHERE I LOSE IT.

151
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,041
IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE
TO CATCH HIM?

152
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,166
I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO IT.

153
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,083
- ( crashing )

154
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,625
- ( tires screeching )

155
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,625
- ( engine hissing )

156
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,458
- ( liquid dripping )

157
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,166
- ( sighs )

158
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,916
- HERE IN THE RACIN' WORLD
A BLOWN ENGINE MEANS ONE THING,

159
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,708
THAT YOU LOST.

160
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,625
BUT LIKE I WAS
TELLIN' YOU EARLIER,

161
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,708
I NEVER CONSIDERED THIS
THING A REAL RACE.

162
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,125
NOW YOU CAN ACCEPT THE REALITY
OF WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST.

163
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,708
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT
HOW DEAD YOUR CAR IS.

164
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,875
THE ENGINE'S SMOKIN' LIKE IT'S
BEEN COOKED ON A BAR-B-QUE.

165
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,333
I THINK IT MIGHT BE ABOUT TIME
TO SEND YOUR EIGHT-SIX

166
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,208
OUT TO PASTURE, BRO.

167
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,541
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW FAST
YOU CAN TURN A CORNER,

168
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,000
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
FAST CAR AND A SLOW CAR

169
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,625
IS JUST TOO MUCH.

170
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,833
WE'LL RACE AGAIN SOMETIME

171
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,333
WHEN YOU HAVE A MACHINE
THAT'S CAPABLE.

172
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,291
ONE THAT ACTUALLY DOES THE JOB.

173
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,541
- ( car approaching )

174
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,916
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

175
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,666
- NO, DUDE. I'M GOOD.
I DID WHAT I CAME HERE TO DO.

176
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,375
THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST
FOR FUN ANYWAY.

177
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,041
- FOR FUN?

178
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,541
THAT RACE SEEMED
A LITTLE TOO BREAK-NECK

179
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,208
FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS
JUST A GOOD TIME.

180
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,666
- TRUE ENOUGH. I T WASN'T
EVEN REALLY THAT MUCH FUN.

181
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,625
CONSIDERING THAT THE EIGHT-SIX'S
ENGINE BLEW UP

182
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,833
BEFORE ANY OF THE GOOD TIMES
COULD REALLY GET ROLLIN'.

183
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,333
- HE BLEW OUT HIS ENGINE!
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

184
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,625
- WHOA, DUDE, I THINK
THE EIGHT-SIX LOST.

185
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,750
- SERIOUSLY?

186
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,583
- THE RED SUNS, MAN,
THEY'RE IN SHOCK.

187
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,166
- HE BLEW HIS FREAKIN' ENGINE.

188
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,708
- THAT EVO THREE WAS JUST
TOO MUCH FOR HIM TO TAKE ON.

189
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,708
- GUESS IT WAS THAT
DIFFERENCE IN POWER.

190
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,500
- AND HE WAS UNDEFEATED
BEFORE TONIGHT.

191
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,541
- NEVER WOULD'VE SEEN
THIS COMIN'.

192
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,583
- I JUST KNEW OUR BOY
WOULD WIN THIS!

193
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,000
- GOIN' UP AGAINST KYOICHI
WITH AN EIGHT-SIX

194
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,458
WAS A SUICIDE MISSION
TO BEGIN WITH.

195
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,041
- EVERYTHING HAPPENED
LIKE WE EXPECTED IT TO,

196
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,125
BUT SOMETHING'S OFF.

197
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,500
I DON'T GET IT.

198
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,291
SOMEHOW, I'M UNSATISFIED
WITH HOW IT TURNED OUT.

199
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,083
MAYBE I EXPECTED ANOTHER ENDING,

200
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,166
OR SOMETHING MORE
FROM THAT EIGHT-SIX.

201
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,250
- Ryosuke: WE'LL SAVE OUR RACE
UNTIL NEXT WEEKEND.

202
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,958
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

203
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,458
- Kyoichi: ENJOY YOUR
CONFIDENCE WHILE IT LASTS, MAN.

204
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,708
'CAUSE I'M GONNA CRUSH YOU.

205
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,291
AND WHEN THE DUSTS
FINALLY SETTLES,

206
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,166
YOU'RE GONNA FIND THE EMPERORS
HAVING CONQUERED ALL OF GUNMA.

207
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,916
- ( wind blowing )

208
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,666
- MY BABY.

209
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,458
MY EIGHT-SIX.

210
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,458
- HEY, SON.

211
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,000
- OH. HEY, THERE, DAD.

212
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,625
DAD, I... I JUST...

213
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,666
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER,
ALRIGHT? FIRST THINGS FIRST.

214
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,291
WE GOTTA TOW IT.

215
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,791
- SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SON?

216
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,791
STOP GAWKIN' AT HER AND
GET IN THE CAB ALREADY.

217
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,250
- YEAH.

218
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,250
SO, HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

219
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,500
I MEAN, HOW'D YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THE WRECK?

220
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,500
- I JUST HAD A FEELING.

221
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,583
- YOU HAD A FEELING?
- YEAH.

222
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,083
- HEY, DAD. I GOT A QUESTION.
- YEAH, WHAT?

223
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,625
- I'VE BEEN SAVIN' UP SOME CASH
FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW

224
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,750
AND I SHOULD HAVE ABOUT
TWO GRAND IN THE BANK.

225
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,166
MAYBE IT'S NOT ENOUGH BUT I
WANNA TRY AND USE THAT MONEY

226
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,500
TO HELP REPAIR THE ENGINE,
IF THAT'S COOL.

227
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,750
- WELL, YOU'VE GOT A LOT MORE
THAN THAT, BUDDY.

228
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,958
AND, YOU'RE A HELLUVA LOT
RICHER THAN YOU THINK.

229
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,583
- WHAT?

230
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,791
- YOU'VE BEEN
DELIVERING THAT TOFU

231
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,250
EVER SINCE YOU WERE IN
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

232
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,041
I STARTED A SAVINGS ACCOUNT
IN YOUR NAME BACK THEN.

233
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,958
I MEAN, YEAH, I BORROW
A LITTLE BIT FROM IT

234
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,666
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

235
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,541
- GOOD. THEN I CAN USE
THAT MONEY FOR THE REPAIRS TOO.

236
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,541
- I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

237
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,916
- YOU THINK IT'LL JUST BE
TOO EXPENSIVE.

238
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,666
HOW MUCH WOULD THIS
KINDA THING COST, ANYWAY?

239
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,916
- IT'S NOT A MONETARY
ISSUE, TAKUMI.

240
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,583
'CAUSE THAT ENGINE
CAN'T BE REPAIRED,

241
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,458
NO MATTER WHAT YOU TRY.

242
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,833
SEE, THERE'S A SMALL PIN

243
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,041
THAT CONNECTS THE CRANKSHAFT
AND THE CON-ROD.

244
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,916
WELL, THAT PIN SNAPPED AND THAT
CON-ROD PUNCHED A BIG HOLE

245
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,875
IN THE ENGINE BLOCK
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

246
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,750
LIKE SOME KINDA MINI-EXPLOSION.

247
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,208
- IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

248
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,708
IF I HADN'T ACTED LIKE
AN IRRATIONAL IDIOT

249
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,041
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

250
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,625
- THAT ENGINE IS HISTORY.

251
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,583
WE NEED TO PUT IN ANOTHER ONE.

252
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,666
- WHAT? ANOTHER ONE?

253
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.

254
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,791
- ARE YOU GONNA USE AN ENGINE
FROM ANOTHER CAR

255
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,583
OR ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO
BUILD ONE FROM SCRATCH?

256
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,625
EVEN IF THE THING COULD
RUN AGAIN, WITH A NEW ENGINE,

257
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,750
THE CAR WOULD FEEL
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

258
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,333
AND ISN'T THAT BLOWN ENGINE
SOMETHING SPECIAL TO YOU?

259
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,500
I MEAN, YOU PUT SO MUCH TIME
AND EFFORT INTO BUILDING IT

260
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,125
OVER ALL THESE THE YEARS.

261
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,916
WE SHOULD REALLY TRY
TO FIX IT, I THINK.

262
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,375
LET'S BORROW THE MONEY IF
WE HAVE TO. I DON'T CARE.

263
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,416
I'LL DONATE EVERY DIME I MAKE
TO REPAIRING IT.

264
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,083
- ( chuckles ) COME ON, KID,
WE AREN'T THAT POOR, YA KNOW?

265
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,916
- YEAH, THEN WHY WOULD WE
HAVE TO USE THE ENGINE

266
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,541
FROM SOME OTHER CAR?

267
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,333
- LOOK, IF I COULD I WOULD...

268
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,791
TRUST ME, IF THERE WERE ANY
WAY TO FIX IT, I'D TRY,

269
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,375
BUT THAT SUCKER'S BEYOND REPAIR.

270
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,958
THAT ENGINE IS USELESS.
IT'S SCRAP.

271
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,833
AND THAT'S THE END
OF THAT STORY.

272
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,666
- ( phone ringing )

273
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,166
- TAKUMI STILL HASN'T
GOTTEN HOME YET.

274
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,083
I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

275
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,833
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
I JUST KNOW IT.

276
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,625
- TAKUMI, LISTEN.

277
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,583
YOU THINK YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED, DON'T YOU?

278
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,583
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
BEATING YOURSELF UP.

279
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,625
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT.

280
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,833
YOU JUST HAPPENED TO BE
THE ONE DRIVING IT WHEN IT BLEW.

281
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,541
I PROMISE YOU, SON,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

282
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,208
- ( crying )

283
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,666
- ( theme song playing )

284
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,583
- Announcer: GOODBYE, EIGHT-SIX.

285
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:15,250
NOW WE GOT THE EVO THREE
AND THE FC RACING IN AKAGI!

286
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,500
NEXT TIME ON
INITIAL D SECOND STAGE.

287
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,750
"BATTLE AT AKAGI!"
THE BLACK AND WHITE FLASH!

288
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,000
DON'T MISS IT!
