- DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE COMING.

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,166
- IT WAS JUST GETTING
INTERESTING.

22
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,416
SHAME WE COULDN'T FINISH.

THAT AGAIN SOON. UNTIL THEN.

25
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,250
DON'T ACT SO COOL, BUDDY.

26
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,250
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
RACER OUT THERE.

27
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,833
I'VE JUST GOT ONE MORE THING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO NOW.

28
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,000
- THEY DIDN'T NEED YOU
TO WORK ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON?

29
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,833
OH WELL. I GUESS YOU'RE NOT THAT
USEFUL AFTER ALL THEN, HUH?

30
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,875
- YOU'RE SO RUDE.
I GOT UP EARLY

31
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,083
AND WORKED THIS MORNING WHEN
THEY WERE SUPER BUSY.

32
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,333
PLUS, IT'S BEEN LIKE TWO WEEKS
SINCE I'VE HAD A DAY OFF

33
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,583
SO THEY LET ME GO
FOR THE AFTERNOON.

34
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,750
- OH YEAH?
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S OKAY.

35
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,541
- WHAT'D YOU COME HERE FOR
ANYWAY? I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU.

36
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,666
- HUH? WELL, I JUST WANTED TO
SEE HOW YOU WERE DOING,

37
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,416
THAT'S ALL.

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,666
MOM AND DAD HAVE BEEN REALLY
WORRIED ABOUT YOU LATELY.

39
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,083
- JUST TELL THEM
I'M DOING FINE

40
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,416
AND THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING
REALLY, REALLY HARD.

41
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,458
- IS THAT THE TRUTH?

42
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,375
UH OH, THE TANK'S
ALMOST ON EMPTY.

43
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,916
BETTER STOP AND FILL HER UP.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,750
- HEY, I KNOW OF A GAS STATION
NEARBY. MY FRIEND WORKS THERE.

45
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,541
LET'S GO TO THAT ONE.

46
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,291
- ( humming )

47
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,250
- JUST PULL HER FORWARD.

48
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,041
HEY.

49
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,791
- THAT'S ITSUKI. HE'S THE FRIEND
OF MINE I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

50
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,416
- WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
- TWENTY LITERS. HIGH OCTANE.

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,708
- SURE.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,250
- MAN, HER BROTHER'S
A GOOD LOOKING GUY.

53
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:03,041
- HMM. I'VE SEEN
THAT EIGHT-SIX TURBO BEFORE.

54
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,791
- SO, MY SISTER TELLS ME
YOU AND HER ARE FRIENDS.

55
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,791
DON'T YOU THINK SHE'S JUST A
LITTLE BIT TOO STRONG-WILLED?

56
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,541
- UH. NO, I WOULDN'T SAY
SHE'S TOO STRONG-WILLED.

57
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,958
- ENOUGH THIRD DEGREE.

58
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,833
GIVE HIM A BREAK AND DON'T
ASK HIM STUPID QUESTIONS.

59
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,041
- MY SISTER'S A GOOD GIRL, SO BE
NICE TO HER. CAN YOU DO THAT?

60
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,333
- OF COURSE.

61
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,041
- NOW I KNOW THIS IS KIND
OF A CHANGE OF SUBJECT,

62
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,666
BUT I'VE HEARD THAT GUNMA HAS
ONE OF THE FASTEST EIGHT-SIXES

63
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,250
TO RUN THE PASSES IN YEARS.

64
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,750
- HUH?

65
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,375
- FROM EVERYTHING THAT I'VE
HEARD ABOUT HIM HE'S GOOD.

66
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,791
AS IN UNDEFEATED GOOD.

67
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,791
- NOW I KNOW GUNMA'S A
PRETTY BIG PLACE AND ALL

68
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,125
BUT IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

69
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,041
SO, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE ME

70
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,541
ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THIS GUY.

71
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,125
- OF COURSE I DO.
HE'S LIKE MY BEST FRIEND.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,625
- WAIT, SERIOUSLY?
- OH, YEAH.

73
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,125
- YOUR NAME'S ITSUKI, RIGHT?

74
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,125
LOOK, I KNOW WE LITERALLY
JUST MET AND EVERYTHING,

75
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,500
BUT IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY
YOU COULD SET UP A MEETING

76
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,333
WITH HIM FOR ME?

77
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,250
I SURE WOULD APPRECIATE IT.

78
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,208
I'D JUST REALLY LOVE
TO PICK HIS BRAIN.

79
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,041
YOU KNOW, WE COULD SIT AROUND,
TALK SHOP ABOUT OUR EIGHT-SIXES.

80
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,416
- SURE, I CAN SET THAT UP.
HE'S A BIT SLOW,

81
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,083
BUT HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY.
YOU'LL LIKE HIM

82
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,416
ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT?
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE HE IS.

83
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,791
- REALLY?
- NO PROBLEM.

84
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,166
I'LL HOOK YOU UP.

85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,041
- I WAS PLANNING TO SEE HIM
TONIGHT ANYWAY,

86
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,958
SO THIS SHOULD WORK
OUT PERFECTLY.

87
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,458
- WOW. THAT'D BE GREAT.

88
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,083
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS.

89
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,500
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR FRIEND
ACTUALLY KNOWS THAT GUY.

90
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,583
I MEAN, TALK ABOUT
A STROKE OF LUCK, RIGHT?

91
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,333
I'M GLAD YOU AND ITSUKI
ARE BUDDIES NOW.

92
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,916
- LOOK, I DON'T LIKE THIS.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,250
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE ONLY
INTERESTED IN ITSUKI'S FRIEND

94
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,541
INSTEAD OF ITSUKI HIMSELF,

95
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,125
LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO USE
HIM OR SOMETHING.

96
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,750
- OH, COME ON, THAT ISN'T TRUE.
HE SEEMS LIKE A NICE ENOUGH KID.

97
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,541
- THEN WHAT ARE YOU MEETING
HIS FRIEND FOR, HUH?

98
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,000
- THERE'S NO REAL REASON.

99
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,791
I'M JUST INTERESTED IN
MEETING HIM, THAT'S ALL.

100
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,958
HE MUST BE PRETTY GOOD
TO HAVE WON ALL HIS RACES.

101
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,750
GUNMA'S A REALLY
COMPETITIVE AREA.

102
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,916
- WELL, I HOPE YOU DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,083
YOU KNOW HOW YOU ARE
WHEN IT COMES TO STREET RACING.

104
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,041
YOU END UP LOSING YOUR COOL
OVER NOTHING. IT'S EMBARRASSING.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,083
- Itsuki: COME ON, TAKUMI,
BE A PAL, PLEASE.

106
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,416
ALL I WANT IS FOR KAZUMI'S
BROTHER TO LIKE ME, THAT'S IT.

107
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,083
THIS IS LIKE THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME

108
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,750
TO SCORE SOME SERIOUS
POINTS WITH HER.

109
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,083
IT MAY BE MY ONLY SHOT.

110
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,583
- YEAH OKAY. I'LL BE
THERE. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL.

111
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,916
- I'M NOT INTERESTED IN RACING
THIS GUY, NO MATTER WHAT.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,333
THAT NEW ENGINE I'VE GOT
JUST ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

113
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,750
- DUDE, DON'T EVEN
WORRY ABOUT IT.

114
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,541
- I LEARNED MY LESSON AFTER
THAT WHOLE FIASCO

115
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,125
WITH TAKESHI AND THE NIGHT KIDS.

116
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,541
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE KAZUMI'S
BROTHER. HE'S A SUPER NICE GUY.

117
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,708
I THINK THE TWO OF YOU
ARE REALLY GOING TO GET ALONG.

118
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,583
THREE BEAUTIFUL EIGHT-SIXES
SIDE BY SIDE.

119
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,125
EVEN THOUGH MINE'S
TECHNICALLY AN EIGHT-FIVE.

120
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,125
- DAMN, HE'S YOUNG.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,750
- HEY, YOU KNOW THAT
EIGHT-SIX TURBO

122
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,250
THAT FILLED UP THIS AFTERNOON?

123
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,458
I'M PRETTY SURE
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.

124
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,833
IT MUST'VE BEEN BACK WHEN
I WENT TO SEE THE RED SUNS

125
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,083
RACE AGAINST TEAM EMPEROR.

126
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,416
- OH, YEAH?

127
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
- YEAH, IT HAD SOME
AMAZING UPHILL ACCELERATION.

128
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,416
GOT ME THINKING THAT SINCE
HER BROTHER'S OBVIOUSLY

129
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
A TALENTED DRIVER
WITH A SWEET CAR.

130
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,375
I DON'T KNOW, HE MAY NOT
BE TOO IMPRESSED WITH ITSUKI.

131
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,916
- OH AND THERE YOU
GO AGAIN, DUMMY.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,416
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO
DO YOUR SOCIAL LIFE MUCH GOOD

133
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,083
THINKING LIKE THAT.

134
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,666
- HUH?

135
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,125
- YOU DON'T SEE ITSUKI WORRYING
ABOUT SUCH INSIGNIFICANT THINGS.

136
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,458
A GUY WHO'S CLUMSY
BUT HAS A POSITIVE ATTITUDE

137
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,000
HAS THE UPPER HAND ON ANY GUY

138
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,291
WHO WORRIES ALL THE TIME.
YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO WORRY.

139
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,250
- Wataru: I HEAR YOU JUST
GOT A NEW ENGINE?

140
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,708
- OH YEAH DUDE, BUT GET THIS.
IT'S LIKE A CRAP-TON SLOWER

141
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,250
THAN THE OLD ONE USED TO BE.

142
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,708
- RIGHT, TAKUMI?
- MMM-HMM.

143
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,583
THAT'S WHY HE WON'T
BE RACING FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

144
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,125
AT LEAST UNTIL HE FIGURES OUT

145
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,583
HOW TO SQUEEZE SOME MORE POWER
OUT OF IT. I'M RIGHT, RIGHT?

146
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,416
- YEAH. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

147
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,666
- IS IT JUST A REGULAR
OLD FOUR-A-G OR WHAT?

148
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,708
- UH. HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
ALL THAT MUCH ABOUT ENGINES.

149
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,250
I MEAN THE POWER'S
PRETTY DECENT, I GUESS.

150
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,000
BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO CONTROL.

151
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,166
SO YEAH, WHATEVER KIND
IT IS, IT'S WEIRD.

152
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,708
- WELL, WOULD YOU MIND IF I
TOOK A LOOK AT IT FOR MYSELF?

153
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,375
- UH. NO.
GO AHEAD.

154
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,166
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

155
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,875
- HUH?

156
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,625
- THIS IS BIZARRE.
IT'S LIKE A FOUR-A-G ENGINE,

157
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,708
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

158
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,208
IF THIS IS SOME KIND OF
AN ELABORATE JOKE?

159
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,708
I'M SURE AS HELL NOT LAUGHING.

160
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:11,875
- WHAT?

161
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,750
- LOOK GUYS, I DON'T KNOW WHERE
IT IS YOU GOT THIS ENGINE FROM.

162
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,166
BUT TELLING ME IT'S SLOW
AND THINKING I WON'T NOTICE

163
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,500
IS FREAKING INSULTING.

164
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:25,583
- WAIT, I DON'T...
WHY'S HE SO MAD?

165
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,125
- WHO KNOWS?

166
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,041
- I THOUGHT SINCE
WE BOTH DRIVE EIGHT-SIXES

167
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,166
YOU'D BE STRAIGHT WITH ME.

168
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,375
SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

169
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,791
IS MY CHEAP TURBO NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

170
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,750
- I DESERVE AN EXPLANATION,
SO SOMEBODY START TALKING.

171
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,666
- WOULD YOU JUST STOP IT? I KNEW
YOU WERE GOING TO BE LIKE THIS.

172
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,666
- STAY OUT OF IT, KAZUMI.
THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

173
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,625
I'VE BEEN AROUND CARS
FOR A LONG TIME

174
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,208
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN
AN ENGINE LIKE THIS

175
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,250
USED FOR STREET RACING.

176
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,250
THIS IS AN ENGINE
DESIGNED FOR THE PROS.

177
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,041
- ( both gasp )

178
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,625
- I COULD SAVE UP FOR YEARS
AND I COULD NEVER EVEN DREAM

179
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,166
OF OWNING AN ENGINE LIKE THIS.

180
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,791
HELL, ANY STREET RACER I KNOW
WOULD SELL THEIR OWN MOTHER

181
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,333
IN A HEARTBEAT

182
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,666
TO HAVE AN ENGINE LIKE THAT
IN THEIR RIDE, MYSELF INCLUDED.

183
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,083
- SO WHAT?
BIG DEAL.

184
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,000
- I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHAT KIND OF ENGINE YOU HAVE,

185
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,208
BUT WHAT I DON'T GET IS WHY YOU
FELT THE NEED TO LIE ABOUT IT.

186
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,958
WHY NOT JUST ADMIT
YOU'RE FAST?

187
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,625
ALL I CAME HERE TO DO
WAS TALK AND TRADE CAR STORIES,

188
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,458
AND YOU LIED RIGHT TO MY FACE?

189
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,583
- HOLD ON.
WE'RE NOT LYING TO YOU.

190
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,250
- DUDE, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

191
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,666
I DON'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT
YOUR OPINION TO LIE TO YOU.

192
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,083
COME ON, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE, ITSUKI.

193
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,750
I'VE GOT NOTHING ELSE
TO SAY TO THIS GUY.

194
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,208
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

195
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,166
- FINE, RUN AWAY. JUST KNOW
I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET.

196
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:40,083
- UH, OH. TAKUMI'S STARTING
TO LOSE IT. THIS IS BAD NEWS.

197
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,791
- KAZUMI?

198
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,250
- WATARU, I...

199
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,875
- INITIAL D.

200
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,916
- INITIAL D.

201
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,208
- WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

202
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,791
ITSUKI INTRODUCED YOU TO HIS
FRIEND OUT OF THE KINDNESS

203
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,125
OF HIS OWN HEART,

204
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,958
SO YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE
TO THEM, RIGHT NOW. DO IT.

205
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,583
IF YOU'RE NOT MAN ENOUGH
TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY

206
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,583
THEN GET OUT OF HERE
AND DON'T EVER COME BACK.

207
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,958
- WHOA, SHE'S INTENSE.

208
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,833
- YOU JERK. HOW DARE YOU TALK
TO MY FRIENDS LIKE THAT.

209
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,000
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN
TO MAKE A LIFE FOR MYSELF

210
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,083
IN A PLACE WHERE
I BARELY KNOW ANYONE.

211
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,500
AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME
YOU SHOW UP IN MY LIFE,

212
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,666
YOU RUIN IT WITH
YOUR CHILDISH ISSUES.

213
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,666
- I UNDERSTAND. WELL, I GUESS
I BETTER GET GOING, THEN.

214
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,416
- ( engine starts )

215
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,333
- HEY BUD. I'M GOING
TO GET GOING TOO.

216
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,750
WHAT? DON'T DO THAT.
PLEASE, MAN.

217
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,083
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE ME
HERE ALL BY MYSELF.

218
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,416
- SORRY. GOOD LUCK.

219
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,833
- WAIT, NO.
TAKUMI. TAKUMI.

220
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,833
WAIT, COME BACK.

221
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,958
- OH MAN.

222
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,666
I REALLY DIDN'T SEE
THAT ONE COMING.

223
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,875
I GUESS MOVING TO GUNMA
WASN'T SUCH A BAD THING

224
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,666
FOR KAZUMI AFTER ALL.

225
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,916
BUT FOR ME...

226
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,833
( sighs )

227
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,958
I'M NOT SO SURE.

228
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,000
- ( car approaching )

229
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,583
- I'M SORRY.

230
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,666
MY BROTHER HAS A TENDENCY
TO ACT LIKE A REAL JERK

231
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,208
WHEN IT COMES TO RACING CARS.

232
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,166
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

233
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,041
- WHEN I SAW THE LOOK ON YOUR
FACES AFTER HE CHEWED YOU OUT,

234
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,500
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS
SOMETHING JUST CAME OVER ME.

235
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,291
MY ARM MOVED BEFORE
I KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

236
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,041
I HAVE A TEMPER. YOU CAN
PROBABLY TELL.

237
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,333
BUT HE DID DESERVE IT.

238
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,375
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT MAD OR ANYTHING.

239
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,583
YOU KNOW TO BE HONEST,

240
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,500
I WAS ACTUALLY KIND
OF GLAD WHEN YOU DID IT.

241
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,541
LOOK, YOU GOT UPSET. BUT YOU
WERE ONLY TRYING TO DEFEND US

242
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,458
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY
AWESOME OF YOU.

243
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,541
- WHY DID YOU STOP?

244
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,000
I WOULDN'T HAVE
CHASED AFTER YOU,

245
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,250
JUST IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING.

246
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,916
BUT SEEING THAT WE'RE
BOTH HERE NOW,

247
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,625
I WOULDN'T MIND PICKING UP
RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

248
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,416
- ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH ME. I GET IT, OKAY?

249
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,125
BUT THERE IS ONE
THING I NEED TO KNOW

250
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,333
AND I COULD REALLY USE
YOUR EXPERTISE.

251
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,416
I NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT THIS ENGINE.

252
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,125
I NEED TO KNOW IF IT'S REALLY
ALL THAT YOU SAY IT IS.

253
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,875
I CAN TELL IT'S NOT
A NORMAL ENGINE

254
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,708
BY THE WAY IT LOOKS AND FEELS

255
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,291
BUT IF WHAT YOU SAY
IS REALLY TRUE,

256
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,958
THAT IT HAS ENOUGH POWER TO BE
WORTHY OF THE PROFESSIONALS.

257
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,416
THEN I WANT TO KNOW
WHY I CAN'T REACH THAT POWER.

258
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,791
I DON'T KNOW ENGINES. YOU DO
AND I REALLY NEED SOME ADVICE.

259
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,750
- SORRY, MAN, BUT I'M HAVING
A HARD TIME BELIEVING YOU.

260
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,375
HOW CAN A RACER NOT KNOW EVERY
SINGLE INCH OF HIS OWN CAR

261
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,791
LIKE THE BACK OF HIS HAND?

262
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,416
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

263
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,250
WHERE THE HELL DID YOU
GET IT FROM ANYWAY?

264
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,416
- TECHNICALLY, THIS IS MY
DAD'S CAR AND HE'S THE ONE

265
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,708
WHO BOUGHT THE ENGINE NOT ME.

266
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,083
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING HE
DOESN'T WANT TO TELL ME.

267
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,583
AND THAT'S A LOT.

268
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,875
- I GUESS YOUR DAD MUST HAVE
A JOB IN THE RACING INDUSTRY

269
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,916
IF HE WAS ABLE TO GET HIS HANDS
ON A BLOCK THIS ADVANCED.

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,500
- NO, HE OWNS A TOFU SHOP.

271
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,791
- ( gasps )

272
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,791
HOW CAN A GUY MAKING TOFU GET
A PROFESSIONAL QUALITY ENGINE?

273
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,958
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU JUST
UP AND BUY FROM THE STORE

274
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,375
ON A WEEKEND.

275
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,333
YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE.

276
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,916
YOU SHOULD BE GETTING
PLENTY OF POWER OUT OF IT,

277
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,750
SO I'M JUST AS
CURIOUS AS YOU ARE.

278
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,666
DO YOU MIND DRIVING ME
AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE

279
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,041
SO I CAN TAKE A LISTEN?

280
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,125
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET
A GOOD FEELING FOR IT.

281
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,000
- ( music playing )

282
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,916
- SO? WHAT'S THE BIG PLAN?
HAVE ONE?

283
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,166
WELL, I FIGURED IT'D TAKE
AT LEAST A FEW WEEKS TO A MONTH

284
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,333
FOR HIM TO FIGURE IT
OUT ON HIS OWN.

285
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,625
THE BOY'S HAD MORE THAN
ENOUGH PRACTICE WITH IT.

286
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,458
- THOSE PARTS YOU ORDERED
ARRIVED AT MY SHOP

287
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,541
JUST THE OTHER DAY.

288
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,291
DON'T YOU THINK
WE SHOULD INSTALL THEM?

289
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,291
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT YET.

290
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,875
I WAS HOPING TO HOLD
OFF ON THOSE

291
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,375
UNTIL I GOT SOME SORT OF
REACTION FROM TAKUMI.

292
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,500
-HUH?

293
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,541
- IT'S GOOD HE'S TRYING TO
COMPENSATE WITH HIS TECHNIQUE

294
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,541
RATHER THAN GOING
FOR SOME EASY FIX.

295
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,958
BUT TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

296
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,333
I FIGURED HE WOULD HAVE
NOTICED BY NOW.

297
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,333
I GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

298
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,291
- SOMETHING'S OFF.

299
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,250
THE SHIFTING SEEMS TO BE
STALLING OUT THE ACCELERATION.

300
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,750
IT HAS PLENTY OF POWER
WHEN HE REACHES THE REV LIMIT,

301
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,166
BUT EVERY TIME HE UPSHIFTS,
HE LOSES A LOT OF TORQUE.

302
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,250
THIS ENGINE MUST BE
DEFECTIVE. IT'S A DUD.

303
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:37,416
THERE'S NO COMPARING IT
TO MY TURBO. BUT WHY?

304
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,333
THIS CAN'T BE
IT'S FULL POTENTIAL.

305
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:44,791
- ( tires screeching )

306
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,083
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

307
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,375
AGAIN? WHY?

308
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:08,000
OF COURSE. NOW I GET IT.
IT'S SO SIMPLE.

309
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,000
- ( sighs )

310
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,625
- WELL, GOOD NEWS.
I CAN TELL YOU WHY

311
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,083
YOU AREN'T GETTING
VERY MUCH POWER.

312
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,291
THE PROBLEM'S PRETTY SIMPLE

313
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,958
AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FIX IT YOURSELF.

314
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,208
THERE, YOU SEE THAT?

315
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,125
THE ISSUE IS WITH
YOUR TACHOMETER.

316
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,416
- TACHOMETER?

317
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,416
- IT'S NO GOOD. NOT
FOR THAT ENGINE.

318
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,791
IT DOESN'T GO HIGH ENOUGH.

319
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,083
THIS IS AN ENGINE THAT
GENERATES IT'S MOST POWER

320
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,416
AT A VERY HIGH RPM,

321
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,458
WHICH IS WHY THEY CALL IT
A HIGH-REV ENGINE.

322
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,208
PROFESSIONAL NATURALLY ASPIRATED
ENGINES ARE ALL LIKE THIS,

323
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,333
THAT'S WHY PROS
USE THEM EXCLUSIVELY.

324
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,041
YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE GETTING
A SURGE OF POWER

325
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,666
RIGHT BEFORE YOU SHIFT?

326
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,250
YOU'RE NOT REVVING IT
HIGH ENOUGH.

327
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,875
THAT RED LINE'S
A COUPLE THOUSAND REV'S SHORT.

328
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,958
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'VE
ONLY BEEN PUSHING IT

329
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,291
TO AROUND SEVENTY PERCENT
OF IT'S FULL CAPACITY.

330
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,875
IF I HAD TO GUESS WHAT
THIS ENGINE'S CAPABLE OF,

331
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:05,500
I'D SAY AT LEAST 10,000 RPM'S
EASY, IF NOT MORE THAN THAT.

332
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,041
A TACHOMETER THAT
ONLY READS UP TO 8000

333
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,041
IS CRIPPLING
THE CAR'S ABILITY.

334
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,916
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT EVEN COMING
CLOSE TO THE SWEET SPOT.

335
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,791
THIS PUPPY'S A CERTIFIED BEAST

336
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,583
COMPARED TO THE
EIGHT-SIX'S STOCK ENGINE.

337
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,083
IT'S CALLED A FOUR AG BUT IT
ACTUALLY HAS A FIVE-VALVE HEAD

338
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,416
THAT WAS ADAPTED FROM
THE NEWER ONE-OH-ONE SERIES

339
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,625
THEY JUST RELEASED.

340
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,250
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A V-V-T DEVICE THAT SWITCHES

341
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,458
THE VALVE TIMING AT BOTH
LOWER AND HIGHER RPM'S.

342
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,625
THE FACT THAT YOURS DOESN'T HAVE
ONE CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING.

343
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,250
THAT THIS BABY IS IN A
WHOLE OTHER CLASS

344
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,375
CALLED A SUPER HIGH-REV ENGINE.

345
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,541
WHILE WE WERE DRIVING,
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

346
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,583
SOMETHING ELSE I THOUGHT
WAS WORTH MENTIONING.

347
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,833
THE INSTRUMENT PANEL YOU HAVE
IS NOT ONLY CHEAP,

348
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,958
IT'S MISSING SOME IMPORTANT READ
OUTS YOU'LL DEFINITELY NEED.

349
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,291
AT THE VERY LEAST,

350
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,750
YOU'LL WANT THE WATER TEMP
AND OIL PRESSURE GAUGES.

351
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,500
WHOEVER IT WAS THAT DID
THE INSTALLATION ON THIS ENGINE

352
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,833
HAS AN IMPECCABLE KNOWLEDGE
OF ADVANCED AUTO MECHANICS.

353
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,791
BOTH THE TIRES AND THE BRAKES
ARE PERFECTLY BALANCED.

354
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,750
SAME GOES FOR THE BODY.

355
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,958
IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHY
WOULD THE INSTALLER

356
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,208
WANT TO LEAVE OUT
ESSENTIAL GAUGES?

357
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,791
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE
ANSWER I CAN THINK OF.

358
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,583
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY,
BUT THE ENGINES TRUE POWER

359
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,666
HAS BEEN SEALED
OFF ON PURPOSE.

360
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,416
- SEALED OFF ON PURPOSE?

361
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,458
- IT'S A PRETTY RELIABLE ALBEIT
SIMPLE WAY OF DOING IT.

362
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,000
WITHOUT A PROPER TACHOMETER,

363
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,750
A GOOD DRIVER WOULD NEVER MAKE
THE MISTAKE OF OVER-REVVING,

364
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,916
WHICH ELIMINATES THE POSSIBILITY
YOU'LL BURN IT OUT

365
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,958
BY GOING PAST THE RED ZONE.

366
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,666
IN ALL MY YEARS
OF BEING INTO CARS,

367
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,208
I'VE ALWAYS FELT A KINSHIP
WITH OTHER EIGHT-SIX DRIVERS,

368
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,541
BUT NEVER ONCE
HAVE I FELT ANY HOSTILITY.

369
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,250
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
I CAN SAY THAT ANYMORE.

370
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,791
ALL I CAN SAY IS, I REALLY WANT
TO BE THE ONE TO BEAT YOU.

371
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,458
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU'RE
HIDING UNDER YOUR HOOD.

372
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,625
THE FACT IS YOU'RE LACKING
THE BASIC ELEMENTS

373
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,208
ANY RACER WORTH HIS
SALT SHOULD HAVE.

374
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,750
WE'LL SETTLE THIS FEUD
SOON ENOUGH AND WHEN WE DO,

375
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,833
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO BRAG
ABOUT BEING UNDEFEATED AGAIN.

376
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,666
- ( engine revs )

377
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,958
- WHAT THE HECK DOES THAT MEAN?

378
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,000
I'M LACKING SOME
OF THE BASIC ELEMENTS.

379
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,833
- ( tires screeching )

380
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,833
- I THINK I'M IN SHOCK. I
ACTUALLY GOT SCARED BACK THERE.

381
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,208
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THE WAY

382
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,791
HE ENTERED THOSE CORNERS.

383
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,416
I'M SHOWING MY AGE.

384
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,125
IT'S OBVIOUS HIS BODY CAN HANDLE
A HECK OF A LOT MORE STRESS

385
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,583
THAN MINE CAN.

386
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,750
HE MAY BE IGNORANT
WHEN IT COMES TO CARS,

387
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,916
BUT HIS TECHNIQUE IS AMAZING.

388
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,291
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

389
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,833
IF I LOSE TO HIM,

390
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,791
THE REPUTATION I'VE WORKED
SO HARD FOR WILL BE SHOT.

391
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:07,000
MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE
DEPENDS ON THIS CHALLENGE.

392
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,083
- ( theme song playing )

393
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,791
- Announcer:
WATARU CHALLENGED TAKUMI.

394
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,666
AND THE BIG RACE
IS ABOUT TO START.

395
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,000
NEXT ON INITIAL D,
SECOND STAGE.

396
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,708
- Takumi: THE SEAL IS BROKEN.
- Announcer: DON'T MISS IT.
