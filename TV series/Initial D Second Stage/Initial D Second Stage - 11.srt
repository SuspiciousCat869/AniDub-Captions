- ITSUKI. MOVE IT.

18
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,166
GET YOUR BUTT IN GEAR.
COME ON.

19
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,083
- UH?

20
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,708
- HEY, KENJI, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

21
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,916
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU DUDE?

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,833
GET YOUR HEAD
OUT OF THE FREAKING CLOUDS.

23
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,583
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

24
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,166
- HE'S BEEN ACTING THIS WAY
FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW.

25
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,541
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE HE CAUGHT
THE DAYDREAM BUG,

26
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,666
TAKUMI JUST GOT OVER.

27
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,208
- COME ON.
I'M NOT THAT BAD.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,333
( exclaims in surprise )

29
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,750
KAZUMI. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

30
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,333
YOU GET THE DAY OFF?

31
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,541
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

32
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,583
- YEAH, GREAT. I HOPE I'M NOT
BOTHERING YOU AT WORK.

33
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,250
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

34
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,291
- SO, I WAS WONDERING WHAT
TIME YOUR SHIFT ENDED TODAY.

35
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,833
- OH, YEAH?

36
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,750
- SEE I'M FREE
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY,

37
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,583
AND I WAS HOPING WE COULD
MAYBE HANG OUT OR SOMETHING.

38
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,541
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT
GETTING OFF SOON

39
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,291
I CAN WAIT FOR YOU SOMEWHERE.

40
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,041
- HOLD ON. CAN YOU WAIT
HERE FOR A SEC? STAY HERE.

41
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,166
I'LL ONLY BE A MINUTE, MAYBE
TWO. JUST DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

42
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,750
HEY, BOSS!

43
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,291
SORRY BUT I GOT TO LEAVE
FOR PERSONAL REASONS.

44
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,041
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

45
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,125
- ITSUKI, WHERE ARE
YOU GOING? HEY, WAIT.

46
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,458
- HEY, YOU DON'T MIND
COVERING FOR ME, DO YOU PAL?

47
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,625
COME ON. HOP IN.

48
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,250
- ARE YOU SURE IT'S OKAY?

49
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,083
- IT'S SO OKAY. LET'S GO.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,250
- ( tires screeching )

51
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,833
- WELL, I GUESS I CAN GIVE
THE BOY A BREAK.

52
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,750
BUT JUST THIS ONE TIME.

53
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,041
- SO DUDE. WHO IS THAT GIRL?

54
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,583
IT CAN'T BE HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND.

55
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,375
- YEAH, I THINK IT MUST
BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

56
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,958
- THAT'S SUCH A LOAD.

57
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,375
OF ALL THE GUYS TO GET A GIRL,
YOU'D THINK IT'D BE ONE OF US.

58
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,166
NOT GOOFUS THE MAGNIFICENT.

59
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,458
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL
THAT LONELY DRIVER BULLCRAP

60
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,416
- YOUR BOSS ISN'T MAD
YOU LEFT WORK?

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,083
I DON'T WANT TO GET
YOU IN TROUBLE.

62
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,541
- I TOLD YOU, IT'S FINE. THE
GUYS ARE ALWAYS REALLY COOL

63
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,791
ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS.

64
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,500
THE BOSS MAY BE A LITTLE
TICKED WITH ME TOMORROW,

65
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,833
BUT HELL, I DON'T CARE.

66
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,083
THIS IS TOTALLY WORTH IT.

67
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,291
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET
KAZUMI OUT OF MY HEAD ALL DAY.

68
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,916
ALL I'VE WANTED IS TO SEE HER
AND HERE SHE IS.

69
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,000
SHE CAME TO SEE ME
ON HER OWN.

70
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,250
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO INVITE HER.

71
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,416
THAT MAKES ME SO FREAKING HAPPY.

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,416
THAT'S WHY LEAVING WORK
IS NO BIG DEAL.

73
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,833
EVEN IF I DO GET IN TROUBLE.

74
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,625
- IT'S FUNNY. WHEN I
WAS GROWING UP,

75
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,666
I WAS ALWAYS SPENDING TIME
WITH MY BROTHER.

76
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,166
- YEAH? THAT MAKES SENSE.

77
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,750
THE TWO OF YOU SEEM
LIKE YOU'RE PRETTY CLOSE.

78
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,958
- ONCE HE REALLY STARTED
TO GET INTO RACING,

79
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,375
I WOULD ALWAYS TAG ALONG
AS HIS SORT-OF SIDEKICK.

80
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,291
THERE WAS EVEN A TIME WHEN I
WAS ACTUALLY USING MY OWN SALARY

81
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,750
TO PAY FOR HIS
CAR EXPENSES. CRAZY.

82
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,416
- UH, YEAH.

83
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,208
- ONLY REASON I DID IT
WAS BECAUSE I COULDN'T THINK

84
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,375
OF ANYTHING TO DO FOR MYSELF.

85
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,666
IT WAS SO EASY TO JUST FOLLOW
HIM AROUND ALL THE TIME.

86
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,791
BUT THAT'S NO WAY TO LIVE.

87
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,333
WE'RE SO DIFFERENT. THERE'S NO
GETTING AROUND IT. AND ME?

88
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,916
I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,041
- MM-HMM.

90
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,125
- PROBLEM IS

91
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,750
THERE'S NOTHING I'M REALLY
PASSIONATE ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

92
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,125
I JUST NEED TO BE PATIENT
AND I KNOW I'LL FIND MY DREAM.

93
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:50,125
FROM THE MOMENT I GOT HERE,
I HAVEN'T HAD ANYONE TO TALK TO.

94
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,666
THAT'S WHY I'M SO GRATEFUL
TO HAVE MET YOU, ITSUKI.

95
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,625
- YEAH, ME TOO. I KNOW IT SOUNDS
CHEESY BUT I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

96
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,166
-THE TRUE POWER IS SEALED
AWAY ON PURPOSE.

97
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,791
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

98
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,916
AND IT'S A PROFESSIONAL
RACING ENGINE?

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,750
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON ANYMORE.

100
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,041
FINE THEN. I'M LACKING
BUT YOU WORK WITH WHAT YOU HAVE.

101
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,416
- IT GOT DARK QUICK.

102
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,625
I CAN DRIVE YOU BACK
TO THE HOTEL

103
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,583
AFTER WE FINISH DINNER, OKAY?

104
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,083
- HONESTLY, I DON'T WANT
TO GO BACK TONIGHT.

105
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,250
- OH THAT'S COOL, YOU CAN...

106
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,416
- ( gasps )

107
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,750
- SOMETHING REALLY CRAPPY
HAPPENED AT MY WORK TODAY.

108
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,125
- REALLY? WHAT?

109
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,291
- THERE'S THIS COWORKER
OF MINE WHO'S REALLY MEAN.

110
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,958
SHE'S ALWAYS BLAMING ME
FOR HER STUPID MISTAKES

111
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,916
AND SHE SPREADS LIES
ABOUT ME TO OUR SUPERVISOR.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,250
IT'S GETTING TO BE UNBEARABLE.

113
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,416
- WELL. DON'T WORRY AS LONG AS
YOU'RE FEELING DOWN,

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,291
I'LL STAY RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.

115
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,125
I DON'T CARE HOW LONG IT TAKES,
EITHER. YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

116
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,041
- Kazumi: THERE.

117
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,375
STEER INTO THE TURN WHILE
APPLYING LIGHT BRAKE PRESSURE.

118
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,541
- GOT IT.

119
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,708
- ( tires screeching )

120
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,625
- WHOA, YOU'RE PRETTY
GOOD AT THIS.

121
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,125
- THANKS. I'M GETTING THERE.

122
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,708
- ( tires screeching )

123
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,708
- I GOT TO SAY, KAZUMI,

124
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,125
YOU'RE A MUCH BETTER TEACHER
THAN TAKUMI COULD EVER BE.

125
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,375
- I LEARNED PRETTY MUCH
EVERYTHING FROM MY BROTHER.

126
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,208
WHEN I WOULD RIDE
ALONG WITH HIM.

127
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,125
I GUESS IT JUST STUCK IN
MY HEAD SOMEHOW.

128
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,166
- OH YEAH? WELL, I GOT A HUNCH

129
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,416
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
REALLY GOOD AT THIS

130
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,000
ONCE YOU GET YOUR
DRIVERS' LICENSE.

131
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,041
- HUH. WELL, I'M NOT SO SURE.

132
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,000
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,
I'M REALLY ALL TALK.

133
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,000
I CAN'T RACE DOWN
A MOUNTAIN PASS BY MYSELF.

134
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,916
- RIGHT, BUT THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,625
RACING IS JUST ONE
OF THE FREEDOMS YOU GET

136
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,166
FROM DRIVING A CAR.

137
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,958
THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU SHOULD
DEFINITELY GET YOUR LICENSE.

138
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,291
'CAUSE IT'LL OPEN UP
A WHOLE NEW WORLD TO YOU.

139
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,666
YOU'LL LOVE IT, TRUST ME.

140
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,083
YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO GOING
TO ONE OF THOSE DRIVING SCHOOLS.

141
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,500
YOU'RE SO GOOD AT TEACHING ME,

142
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,791
I BET YOU COULD DO IT FOR
A LIVING, YOU NEVER KNOW.

143
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,291
STEPPING ON THE GAS AND STEERING
WITH YOUR OWN TWO HANDS.

144
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,833
IT MEANS YOU GOT THE FREEDOM
TO GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO.

145
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,791
IT'S THE BEST FEELING
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

146
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,791
( grunts )

147
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,791
- WE'LL SETTLE THIS FEUD
SOON ENOUGH, AND WHEN WE DO,

148
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,750
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO BRAG
ABOUT BEING UNDEFEATED AGAIN.

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,750
- I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
AVOIDING IT THIS TIME.

150
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,000
I HAVE TO RACE HIM.

151
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,000
- ITSUKI. ARE YOU AWAKE?

152
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,583
- ( murmurs in sleep )

153
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,750
- YOU KNOW, I WAS THIS
CLOSE TO QUITTING MY JOB

154
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,416
AND MOVING BACK TO SAITAMA.

155
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,291
BUT I THINK I MIGHT
GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY.

156
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,708
QUITTING MIGHT BE
THE EASY THING TO DO

157
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,166
BUT THEN I WOULD JUST BE
RIGHT BACK WHERE I STARTED.

158
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,166
- ( snores )

159
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,541
- WASSUP, BUDDY?

160
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,083
- OH, HEY MAN.

161
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,541
- SO, HEY, IF ANYONE ASKS, JUST
TELL THEM I WAS HANGING OUT

162
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,041
WITH YOU ALL LAST NIGHT
AND INTO THIS MORNING, OKAY.

163
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,083
- CAN YOU DO THAT?
- HUH?

164
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,458
- YOU'RE JUST BACK.
YOU MEAN JUST NOW?

165
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,583
WERE YOU WITH KAZUMI
THE ENTIRE TIME?

166
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,625
- YUP.

167
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,000
- HEY, WHAT'RE YOU
BLUSHING FOR?

168
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,916
NOW DON'T GO
GETTING THE WRONG IDEA.

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,916
ALL WE DID WAS GO TO
THE PASS TOGETHER

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
AND THEN WE FELL ASLEEP
INSIDE MY CAR.

171
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,208
- OKAY, BUT DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S KIND OF A BIG STEP?

172
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,125
I MEAN, SHE IS A GIRL
IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED.

173
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,583
- I KNOW BUT SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T WANNA GO HOME

174
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,291
SO WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

175
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,791
I MEAN, ISN'T IT THE MAN'S DUTY?
STICK BY HIS GIRL AT ALL TIMES?

176
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,208
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

177
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,208
AND I'M REALLY NOT
THE BEST PERSON TO ASK, SO...

178
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,708
- I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW
HAPPY I WAS YESTERDAY.

179
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,250
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH
STUFF WE HAD TO TALK ABOUT.

180
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,875
I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY BONDED.

181
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,583
IT WAS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.

182
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,125
SO, HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR LOVE LIFE LATELY, HUH?

183
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,500
- NATSUKI'S BEEN
ABSENT FROM SCHOOL

184
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,291
A LOT THESE LAST COUPLE DAYS

185
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,125
OR SHE'S AVOIDING ME,
WHICH I DOUBT.

186
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,541
- WHAT'S THE DEAL? WHAT, HAS
SHE BEEN SICK OR SOMETHING?

187
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,000
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WHERE SHE IS?

188
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,958
- THAT'S A WEIRD THING TO SAY.
I FIGURED YOU WOULD KNOW.

189
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,500
- INITIAL D.

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,291
- ( ringing )

191
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,958
- HEY, DAD?

192
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,541
I GUESS HE MUST'VE LEFT.

193
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,666
FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

194
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,541
WHAT?

195
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,166
- Wataru: HEY, SORRY
TO CALL OUT OF THE BLUE.

196
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,041
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING
HOW I GOT YOUR NUMBER.

197
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,833
IT'S JUST I REMEMBER SEEING
THE SIGN FOR FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP

198
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:25,833
ON THE SIDE OF YOUR CAR,

199
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,416
SO I LOOKED YOU UP.

200
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,291
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
I'LL BE IN GUNMA TOMORROW,

201
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,875
TO PICK UP MY SISTER.

202
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,416
- WHY?

203
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,958
- I HEARD THAT SHE TOOK
THE DAY OFF OF WORK YESTERDAY

204
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,041
AND DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER
SHOWING BACK UP AT THE HOTEL

205
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,125
UNTIL THIS MORNING.

206
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,958
IT'S JUST SHE'S
SO IRRESPONSIBLE.

207
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,166
I SWEAR MAN, I REALLY
CAN'T STAND PEOPLE

208
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,500
WHO DON'T STAY TRUE
TO THEIR WORD.

209
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,083
I DON'T CARE IF IT IS MY SISTER.

210
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,750
- SOUNDS LIKE
ITSUKI'S IN TROUBLE.

211
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,333
- BUT ENOUGH WITH MY PROBLEMS.
LET'S TALK BUSINESS.

212
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,833
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
THAT YOU AND I HAD OUR RACE.

213
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,500
SO LEAVE TOMORROW NIGHT
OPEN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

214
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,083
MAKE SURE YOUR ENGINE
IS FULLY OPERATIONAL BY THEN,

215
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,583
OTHERWISE WE'LL JUST
BE WASTING OUR TIME.

216
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,250
I KNOW YOU'LL GET IT
WORKED OUT. I TRUST YOU.

217
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,625
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

218
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,458
- TAKUMI. HEY, WHAT'RE YOU
DOING HERE, DUDE?

219
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,458
- HEY MAN, I WAS KIND OF HOPING
I COULD ASK YOU FOR A FAVOR.

220
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,166
- YEAH.

221
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,750
- I MAY BE RACING THE EIGHT-SIX
TURBO TOMORROW NIGHT.

222
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,250
AND IF I DO I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THIS ENGINE MY DAD PUT IN

223
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,333
IS FULLY TWEAKED

224
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,916
AND READY TO BE PUSHED
TO THE LIMIT.

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,041
I NEED TO INSTALL
A NEW TACHOMETER.

226
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,375
SO I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.

227
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,416
- A TACHOMETER, HUH?

228
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,041
- YEAH. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT
THIS MECHANICS STUFF.

229
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,500
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO
START, SO I NEED YOUR HELP.

230
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,416
I'M DESPERATE. PLEASE DUDE.

231
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,041
WILL YOU PLEASE GIVE ME A HAND?

232
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,083
- ALL RIGHT.

233
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,541
I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY SPECIFICS
JUST BY LOOKING AT IT

234
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,000
BUT FROM WHAT I CAN SEE

235
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,458
THIS DEFINITELY ISN'T YOUR
NORMAL STREET RACING ENGINE.

236
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,791
- OKAY.

237
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,375
- LET'S SEE HERE.
CARBURETOR'S GOOD.

238
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,500
AND THIS HEADER'S WILD.
IT'S ALL TWISTED AROUND.

239
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,500
IT'S ONE OF THESE
NEW FIVE-VALVE ENGINES

240
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,375
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S TUNED TO THE HILT.

241
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,625
I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING
THIS ONE HAS LESS POWER

242
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,750
THAN THAT OLD ONE OF YOURS.

243
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,208
- WELL, THAT WATARU GUY
I'M SUPPOSED TO RACE TOLD ME

244
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,083
I'D GET MORE POWER
IF I WENT TO A HIGHER RPM.

245
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,291
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY

246
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,375
BUT I'M SURE HE WAS
TELLING ME THE TRUTH.

247
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,791
- HMM.

248
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,791
SO HE'S TALKING ABOUT UNLOCKING
A SEALED HIGH-REV ZONE.

249
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,125
IF THAT IS WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE, IT SURE IS EXCITING.

250
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,125
INSTALLING A NEW
TACHOMETER'S EASY.

251
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,708
I COULD PROBABLY SHOW YOU HOW
TO DO IT YOURSELF IF YOU WANTED.

252
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,958
BUT THERE IS ONE QUESTION
WE STILL NEED TO ASK.

253
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,375
- HUH?
- IT'S ABOUT YOUR DAD.

254
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,166
ARE YOU GOING TO ASK
HIS PERMISSION,

255
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,500
OR ARE YOU JUST GOING TO GO
AHEAD AND CHANGE THE WHOLE SETUP

256
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,083
BEHIND HIS BACK?

257
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,625
- THE WAY I SEE IT,
MY DAD WASN'T HOME TONIGHT.

258
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,833
AND IF WERE HOME
HE WOULD JUST TELL ME, "NO",

259
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,291
EVEN IF I GOT DOWN ON
MY KNEES AND BEGGED HIM.

260
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,083
BUT HE'S NOT HOME AND I SAY
WE GO AHEAD AND DO IT.

261
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,458
I CAN'T WAIT FOR HIM. I WANNA
GET EVERY LAST OUNCE OF POWER

262
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,291
OUT OF THIS ENGINE
BY TOMORROW NIGHT.

263
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,291
- ALL RIGHT.

264
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
HOPING YOU WOULD SAY, BROTHER.

265
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,166
I'LL CALL IN AN ORDER
FOR A PROPER TACHOMETER

266
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,375
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

267
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,708
THEN ONCE YOU'RE
OUT OF SCHOOL,

268
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,541
GET THE CAR HERE
AS FAST AS YOU CAN

269
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,750
SO WE CAN GET STARTED.

270
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,458
SOUND GOOD TO YOU?

271
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,041
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP, IKETANI.

272
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,041
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I APPRECIATE IT.

273
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,125
- WELL YOU AND YOUR EIGHT-SIX
HAVE SAVED MY ASS MORE TIMES

274
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,833
THAN I WOULD REALLY
LIKE TO ADMIT.

275
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,791
HELPING YOU FIND MORE
HORSEPOWER'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

276
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,958
- Iketani: WHAT? A WEEK?

277
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,458
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I NEED ONE TODAY.

278
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,541
- OH MAN, I AM SO SCREWED.

279
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,333
NOBODY HAS ONE OF THESE
IN STOCK.

280
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,666
DEMAND FOR HIGH-REV RPM
TACHOMETERS MUST BE LOW.

281
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,458
WHAT THE HELL
AM I GOING TO TELL TAKUMI

282
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,125
IF I'M NOT ABLE TO GET ONE?

283
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,041
- MUST BE A SPECIAL ORDER PART.

284
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,416
- HEY BOSS. DO YOU KNOW
OF ANYONE WHO COULD HELP ME OUT?

285
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,208
- LET'S SEE. MAYBE.
HOLD ON.

286
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,833
- ( phone rings )

287
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,625
- Masashi: HELLO? HEY, YUUICHI.

288
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,583
YEAH. SURE, I'VE GOT ONE.

289
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,208
- WHAT? YOU'RE SURE?

290
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,958
YOU DON'T NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK?

291
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,708
- BUNTA ORDERED
ONE FOR HIS EIGHT-SIX

292
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,416
AND I'VE BEEN SITTING
ON IT EVER SINCE.

293
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,125
IT'S GOT A RACING TACHOMETER,
WATER TEMP AND OIL PRESSURE,

294
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,541
THE WHOLE SETUP.

295
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,250
- HOLD ON A SEC. I CAN BARELY
BELIEVE WHAT I'M HEARING

296
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,166
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN WHAT
BUNTA WAS TALKING ABOUT

297
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,750
WHEN HE WAS SAID
HE WAS GOING TO SEAL IT.

298
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,541
I TELL YOU, KID, THIS IS BETTER
THAN GOING TO THE MOVIES.

299
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,541
MASASHI, I NEED YOU TO
BRING THOSE GAUGES

300
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,000
OVER HERE RIGHT AWAY.
CAN YOU DO THAT?

301
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,625
- ( panting )

302
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,333
- Itsuki: HEY, TAKUMI.

303
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,791
WHY THE HECK
IS HE IN SUCH A RUSH?

304
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,583
- NATSUKI.

305
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,666
- TAKUMI, HI,THERE.

306
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,625
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TALK. SO, LATER.

307
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,208
- NO, WAIT.

308
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,541
TAKUMI.

309
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,500
- WHAT AM I GOING DO
ABOUT THAT GIRL?

310
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,416
- Kenji: OKAY, NOW ALL YOU GOT
TO DO IS SCREW IT DOWN.

311
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,875
YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT.

312
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,666
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE FINISHED.

313
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,458
WASN'T THAT EASY?

314
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,000
- IT ACTUALLY WAS,
BUT ONLY BECAUSE

315
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,500
YOU TWO WERE HERE TO HELP.

316
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,291
IF YOU HADN'T TAKEN PITY ON ME,
I'D STILL BE STANDING HERE

317
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,791
READING THE
INSTRUCTION MANUAL.

318
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,375
- YOU KNOW INSTALLING THE NEW
TACHOMETER IS ONLY PART

319
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,833
OF FINISHING THE JOB.

320
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,000
JUST BECAUSE IT'S CALLED
A HIGH-REV ENGINE

321
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,125
DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN REV
FOREVER INTO INFINITY.

322
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,041
WITHOUT KNOWING
WHERE IT TOPS OUT,

323
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,708
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A CHANCE
AT RACING IT FULL BLAST.

324
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,500
I'D HAVE TO THINK YOUR DAD
WOULD KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

325
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,958
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE
TO TRY RACING IT

326
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,250
WITHOUT KNOWING IT'S LIMIT,

327
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,458
YOU COULD END UP
DAMAGING IT BEYOND REPAIR.

328
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,208
- I'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM.

329
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,291
- HEY, IS THAT WHO
I THINK IT IS?

330
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,250
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE READY
FOR THE BIG RACE TONIGHT.

331
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,041
UNLESS YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND
WE'LL PROCEED AS PLANNED.

332
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,041
AND 'CAUSE I'M FEELING GENEROUS,
I'LL LET YOU PICK THE COURSE.

333
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,916
ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

334
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,750
- ISN'T THAT THE SAME EIGHT-SIX
TURBO WE SAW THAT ONE TIME?

335
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,166
- IT IS.

336
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,333
AND GET THIS, THAT GUY'S
ITSUKI'S GIRLFRIEND'S BROTHER.

337
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,375
- ( gasps ) OH MAN, THIS IS NOT
GOING TO TURN OUT WELL.

338
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,791
- WELL, OKAY THEN.
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

339
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,458
I GUESS THAT
JUST ABOUT DOES IT.

340
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,625
SO I'LL BE SEEING YOU
IN A FEW HOURS. LATER.

341
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,000
- ( engine revs )

342
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,083
- TAKUMI, WHAT'S UP?

343
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,666
WHICH OF THE PASSES DID
YOU END UP PICKING?

344
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,916
- WHEREVER IT IS, WE'LL
BE THERE TO ROOT FOR YOU.

345
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,000
- WATARU.

346
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

347
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,375
HOW DARE YOU?

348
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,958
DIDN'T I WARN YOU ABOUT MAKING
OUR AUNT LOOK BAD? DIDN'T I?

349
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,416
DO YOU EVEN CARE THAT YOU HAD
MOM AND DAD WORRIED SICK?

350
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,250
I WANT YOU TO PACK UP
YOUR STUFF TONIGHT.

351
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,625
BECAUSE FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING,

352
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,041
I'M TAKING YOU BACK HOME.

353
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,666
- DAMN IT, THAT IS NOT YOUR
DECISION TO MAKE.

354
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,291
FINE, IT WAS THE
WRONG THING TO DO,

355
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,083
STAYING OUT ALL NIGHT
WITHOUT CHECKING IN.

356
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,666
IT WAS DUMB.
I GET IT.

357
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,625
BUT EVERYTHING I'VE DONE,
I'VE DONE FOR A REASON,

358
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,166
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT.

359
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,291
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE
FORCED INTO GOING HOME FOR THAT.

360
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,416
- YOU CAN EXPLAIN
YOUR SIDE ALL YOU WANT,

361
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,541
BUT IT'S MOM AND DAD YOU SHOULD
BE TELLING IT TO, NOT ME.

362
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,166
IF YOU REALLY LIKE IT
HERE SO MUCH

363
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,833
THEN GO HOME
AND TALK TO THEM.

364
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,541
LET THEM KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
AND THEN COME BACK.

365
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,500
I CAN TELL THAT YOU'VE CHANGED
IN YOUR TIME LIVING HERE.

366
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,000
AND YOU CAN BELIEVE
ME OR DON'T,

367
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,416
BUT I THINK YOU'VE DONE A WHOLE
LOT OF GROWING UP AS WELL.

368
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,708
I KNOW YOU'VE MATURED,

369
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,625
BUT OUR FOLKS HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO SEE IT,

370
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,291
WHICH IS WHY THEY
WORRY SO MUCH.

371
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,791
THEY'LL FEEL MUCH BETTER
IF THEY HEAR IT COMING FROM YOU.

372
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,791
- OKAY, FINE.
I'LL GO BACK HOME THEN.

373
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,625
- Itsuki: SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

374
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,208
- NOTHING, JUST TRYING
TO GET PREPARED

375
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,583
FOR THE BIG RACE TONIGHT.

376
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,416
- WHAT BIG RACE? YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME YOU WERE RACING.

377
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,250
WAIT, HOLD ON. IT'S NOT AGAINST
KAZUMI'S BROTHER, IS IT?

378
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,125
- YEAH IT IS. AND
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

379
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,250
I HAVE A FAVOR I'VE BEEN
WANTING TO ASK YOU.

380
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,375
I'M A LITTLE SPOOKED
GOING INTO THIS ONE.

381
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,291
SO WOULD YOU BE UP
FOR RIDING ALONG?

382
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,750
- YEAH. OF COURSE I AM, DUDE,
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

383
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,708
- YOU'RE THE BEST. I'LL PICK
YOU UP IN A LITTLE BIT.

384
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,541
- WHAT IS IT, SON?

385
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,708
- OKAY, HERE IT IS. I JUST
WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

386
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,625
THAT I'M RACING TONIGHT.

387
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,458
I PUT IN A NEW TACHOMETER.

388
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,125
NOW, ALL I NEED TO KNOW
IS WHAT THE TOP RPM IS.

389
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,000
WILL YOU TELL ME?

390
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,750
- YOU'LL WANNA REV IT UP
TO ELEVEN-THOUSAND RPM'S.

391
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,750
DON'T YOU DARE LOSE.

392
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,250
- THANKS, DAD.
I OWE YOU ONE.

393
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,250
- Itsuki: HEY, TAKUMI? WHAT
ARE WE TAKING THE HIGHWAY FOR?

394
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,875
- WATARU GAVE ME A CHOICE.

395
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,458
HE TOLD ME I COULD PICK
ANY COURSE THAT I WANTED.

396
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,875
- THAT WAS NICE OF HIM.
SO WHERE DID YOU PICK?

397
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,791
- I PICKED SHOMARU PASS.

398
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,833
- YOU DID WHAT? DON'T YOU KNOW
THAT'S WATARU'S HOME TURF?

399
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,625
- ( theme song playing )

400
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

401
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,333
- Announcer: IT'S TAKUMI'S NEW
ENGINE VERSUS WATARU'S TURBO.

402
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,875
THIS'LL BE A GOOD ONE. NEXT
ON INITIAL D: SECOND STAGE.

403
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,000
- Wataru: "EIGHT-SIX
VERSUS EIGHT-SIX".

404
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,583
- Wataru and Takumi:
A SPIRITED RACE.

405
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,000
-Narrator: DON'T MISS IT.
