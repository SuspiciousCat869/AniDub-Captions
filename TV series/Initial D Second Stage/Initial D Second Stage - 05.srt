8
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,083
- WAS THAT THE EIGHT-SIX?

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
- BRO! YOU SEE THAT?

10
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,583
-YEAH. SURE DID.

11
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,583
LOOKS LIKE KYOICHI IS
DOING A LITTLE SCHEMING

12
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,208
BEHIND OUR BACKS.

13
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,291
- SO WHAT NOW?
SHOULD WE STOP HIM?

14
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,750
THERE'S NO WAY IN
HELL THE EIGHT-SIX

15
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,000
CAN PULL OFF A WIN
AGAINST THAT GUY!

16
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,250
- LOOK, THIS IS STREET RACING.

17
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,458
AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE TO,

18
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,416
IT'S NOT UP TO US TO DECIDE
WHO RACES WHO.

19
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,750
- YEAH, BUT COME ON!

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,375
- ( tires screeching )

21
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,125
- I SAW THE RACE,
AND LET ME TELL YOU,

22
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,208
HE EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS
IN EVERY WAY.

23
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,833
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE BOY'S
ONLY EIGHTEEN. WOW.

24
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:44,166
- BIG DEAL. WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN
I WAS A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER

25
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,625
THAN HE IS.

26
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,291
- HUH. YEAH WELL, YOU MAY BE
THE ONLY ONE TO THINK SO.

27
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,750
TALKING TO YUUICHI
THE OTHER DAY,

28
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,166
HE SAID YOUR SON'S
MORE TALENTED THAN YOU.

29
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,833
HE ALSO GAVE ME THIS NUGGET.

30
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,208
THAT YOU'RE TOO DAMN
STUBBORN TO ACCEPT

31
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,416
JUST HOW TALENTED
YOUR SON REALLY IS.

32
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
- ( sneezes )

33
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,250
- ANYWAY, THE MOMENT YOUR SON
EXCEEDS HIS LIMITS,

34
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,833
THE ENGINE WILL SOON FOLLOW.

35
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,125
THAT OLD THING
CAN'T LAST FOREVER, YOU KNOW.

36
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,625
YOU THINK HE CAN KEEP WINNING
'TILL THEN?

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,041
- WHO KNOWS?

38
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,500
- WELL, NOW. LOOK WHO SHOWED.

39
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,458
- HE TOOK THE BAIT JUST AS
WE'D THOUGHT HE WOULD.

40
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,708
HEY, THERE.
THANKS FOR SHOWING UP.

41
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,125
IT'S LIKE I SAID TO YOU BEFORE,

42
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,541
YOU AND I WILL BE GOIN' UP
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

43
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,458
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO
FOR YOUR TROUBLES,

44
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,250
WITH YOU COMIN' ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE.

45
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,625
BUT I WON'T BE
TAKIN' IT EASY ON YOU.

46
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,625
I'D BE WASTIN' YOUR TIME
IF I DIDN'T GIVE YOU MY BEST.

47
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,208
- HIS ATTITUDE'S DIFFERENT
THIS TIME.

48
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,541
HE LOOKS LIKE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

49
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,791
SO LET'S DO THIS.

50
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,375
WE'LL USE THE SAME
HANDICAP WE GAVE YOU

51
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,375
WHEN YOU RACED AGAINST SEIJI.

52
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,541
YOU'LL BE STARTIN' OFF
GOIN' FIRST.

53
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,666
BUT WE DON'T
ACTUALLY GEAR UP

54
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,958
UNTIL WE REACH THAT
FIRST CORNER.

55
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,375
- SEE YA! HEY. CALL ME IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING. I'LL BE AROUND.

56
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:43,833
- ALRIGHT.

57
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,583
- SOMETHING BIG'S GONNA
HAPPEN TONIGHT.

58
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,916
WHY ELSE WOULD I BE FEELING
SO UNEASY?

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,375
- ( cell phone ringing )

60
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,916
- ONE OF THE EMPERORS
CAME HERE TO RILE UP TAKUMI?

61
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,541
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY?

62
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,375
I'M SURE THEY'RE STILL
PRETTY SORE ABOUT LOSIN'

63
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,958
TO TAKUMI IN AKINA.

64
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,416
IT'S NO SURPRISE
SINCE THEIR GOAL

65
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,083
WAS TO SWEEP EVERY TEAM IN GUNMA

66
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,125
AND WE SEEMED LIKE
AN EASY WIN AT THE TIME.

67
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,416
- SO, WHAT DID HE SAY?

68
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,875
- THAT HE'S NOT INTERESTED.

69
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,583
- OH, GOOD.

70
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,583
'CAUSE EVEN TAKUMI
ISN'T THAT DUMB.

71
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,041
HE'D BE A FOOL TO GO TO AKAGI.

72
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,250
THAT LAN-EVO
WOULD WHOOP HIS ASS.

73
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,750
- YEAH. OKAY. THANKS ANYWAY.

74
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,458
SOMETHING'S GOIN' ON.

75
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,083
- YEAH? WHAT'S WRONG?

76
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,083
- I JUST CALLED UP TAKUMI
AND HE'S NOT HOME.

77
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,916
APPARENTLY HE GOT A PHONE CALL
AND THEN TOOK OFF.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,458
NO ONE'S HEARD FROM HIM SINCE.

79
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,666
- A PHONE CALL?

80
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,250
- ONE OF MY FAVORITE
SHOWS IS ON TONIGHT

81
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,958
AND I TOTALLY FORGOT
TO SET MY DVR

82
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,125
BEFORE COMING IN TO WORK

83
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,625
SO I WAS HOPING HE
COULD RECORD IT FOR ME.

84
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,208
- DID HE TAKE THE CAR WITH HIM?

85
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,500
- UH, I THINK SO.

86
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,083
- I KNOW!
HE'S PROBABLY GOT A HOT DATE!

87
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,416
WITH THAT ONE CHICK.

88
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,833
- HOLD ON. YOU MEAN NATSUKI?

89
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,375
- YEAH. THAT'S HER!
SHE'S A CUTIE!

90
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,916
I CAN'T REALLY SAY
I BLAME THE GUY.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,416
HELL IF I HAD A PIECE LIKE HER
ON MY ARM, I SURE WOULDN'T

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,375
BE WASTIN' MY TIME
HANGIN' OUT WITH YOU TWO BOZOS.

93
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,875
- WAIT, WHAT'RE YOU SAYIN'?

94
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:32,416
DID YOU FORGET?
RACER'S DON'T NEED GIRLFRIENDS!

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,208
DUDE! BACK ME UP!

96
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,375
- RIGHT!

97
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,500
- HOW PATHETIC.

98
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,166
- ( revving )

99
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,083
- I WANNA BE CLEAR
BEFORE WE START.

100
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,000
I DON'T CONSIDER THIS A RACE.

101
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,750
THERE ARE DIFFERENT
KINDS OF CARS IN THIS WORLD.

102
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,375
SOME CARS MEANT FOR FUN AND SOME
CARS ARE MEANT FOR PURE SPEED.

103
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,250
I'M GONNA
SHOW YOU THE DIFFERENCE.

104
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,833
YOU READY TO LEARN, KID?

105
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,750
- ( engines starting )

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,541
- LET'S GET ROLLIN'.

107
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,208
- YEAH, THERE HE GOES!

108
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,958
- BEAT THAT KID'S ASS, KYOICHI!

109
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,083
- I DON'T THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND
THIS KID'S MOTIVATION.

110
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,833
WHY WOULD HE INTENTIONALLY
THROW HIMSELF INTO A RACE

111
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,166
HE HAS ZERO CHANCE OF WINNING?

112
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,250
THE IDEA OF A CAR AS
OBSOLETE AS AN EIGHT-SIX

113
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:57,375
DEFEATING KYOICHI'S PERFECTLY
TUNED EVO-THREE IS INSANITY.

114
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,666
AND IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S
ON HIS HOME TURF AGAIN.

115
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,625
IS THAT KID REALLY DUMB
ENOUGH TO THINK HE HAS

116
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,333
THAT ADVANTAGE
HERE IN AKAGI?

117
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,791
DOES HE REALLY TRUST HIS
EXPERIENCE AND INSTINCTS

118
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,166
THAT MUCH?

119
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,333
I WONDER WHAT'S GOIN'
THROUGH HIS HEAD RIGHT NOW.

120
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,125
OH HELL, I DON'T KNOW.

121
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,500
MAYBE HE REALLY BELIEVES
HE HAS A CHANCE AT WINNING.

122
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,125
MAYBE HE'S...

123
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,416
...A RACING GENIUS
IN THE MAKING!

124
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,041
- I DON'T FRIGGIN' BELIEVE THIS!

125
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,458
THEY'RE ACTUALLY
RACING EACH OTHER!

126
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,416
- YOU BETTER
BE WATCHING, RYOSUKE.

127
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,666
I WANT YOU TO SEE HOW MUCH

128
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,625
A FOUR-BY-FOUR
DOMINATES A FOUR-BY-TWO.

129
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,291
I HOPE MY INTENTIONS
AREN'T LOST ON YOU.

130
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,750
THIS RACE IS MORE OF A CHALLENGE
TO YOU THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

131
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,750
- LOOK OUT EVERYBODY! THEY'RE
GONNA BE SWINGIN' OUT WIDE!

132
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,250
- ( tires screeching )

133
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,875
- THAT DUDE
FROM AKINA'S INCREDIBLE!

134
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,291
HE GOT SO CLOSE
TO THE GUARDRAIL,

135
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,041
HE WAS CLIPPIN' THE HEDGES!

136
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,041
- THE DRIVER
OF THAT EIGHT-SIX IS INSANE!

137
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,208
NOT EVEN THE VETERAN LOCALS

138
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,375
ARE AS THAT AGGRESSIVE
IN THAT CORNER!

139
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,875
- HEY BRO, HAVE YOU NOTICED
THE SOUND THE EVO-THREE'S MAKIN'

140
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:07,916
WHEN IT BACKFIRES?

141
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,750
IT'S SOUNDIN'
A LITTLE OFF TO ME.

142
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,625
- YEAH, I NOTICED THAT TOO.

143
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,083
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

144
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,791
THE EVO-THREE HAS THE SAME
SYSTEM A WRC RALLY CAR USES.

145
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,458
- ( engine firing )

146
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,166
- IT'S A MISFIRING SYSTEM!

147
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,916
- ( engine firing )

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,583
- IT'S A PRETTY GOOD STRATEGY
FOR KYOICHI.

149
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,791
A PROFESSIONAL QUALITY
MISFIRING SYSTEM

150
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,208
IS THE BEST OPTION AVAILABLE

151
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,500
IF YOU'RE DRIVING A TURBO
ON A DOWNHILL COURSE.

152
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,916
AKAGI HAS A MUCH MORE SEVERE
SLOPE THAN BOTH AKINA AND MYOGI.

153
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,583
THE VERY FIRST PART OF THE TRACK
IS A LOW-SPEED SECTION

154
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,916
WHERE THEY GO
STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,833
IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

156
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,916
HAVING FIRM CONTROL OF THE
BRAKING AND STEERING SYSTEMS

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,916
IS THE KEY, RATHER THAN ABUSING
THE CAR'S POWER.

158
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,625
HE DEVELOPED HIS TECHNIQUE WHILE
RACING IN THE GYMKHANA CIRCUIT.

159
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,625
SO HE'S PHENOMENAL
AT THE SLOWER CORNERS.

160
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,250
NOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE
PROFESSIONAL RACING EXPERIENCE,

161
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,208
BUT HIS ABILITIES HAVE
IMPROVED EXPONENTIALLY

162
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,458
OVER THE PAST YEAR.

163
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,750
HE'S BEEN REBORN.

164
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,125
AND NOW HE'S TOUGHER THAN EVER.

165
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,625
- THIS IDEA THAT
FOUR-WHEEL-DRIVE CARS

166
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,083
CAN'T TURN EFFICIENTLY
IS OBSOLETE.

167
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,625
MY EVO-THREE CAN CORNER
WITH THE BEST!

168
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,750
- Announcer: Initial D!

169
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,125
Initial D.

170
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,375
- ( engines revving )

171
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,166
- I FEEL LIKE I'M PART
OF A HUNT.

172
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,875
ONLY I'M THE ONE BEING HUNTED.

173
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,250
- OH, DAMN DUDE,
THAT EVO-THREE IS FAST AS HELL!

174
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,791
MAN, IT'S REALLY GIVIN'
THE EIGHT-SIX A RUN

175
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,583
FOR IT'S MONEY IN THE CORNERS!

176
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,916
THAT CUZ OF A BETTER CAR
OR A BETTER DRIVER?

177
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,583
- I THINK IT'S GOTTA BE BOTH.

178
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,583
KYOICHI'S CORNERING
IS UNBELIEVABLE!

179
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:26,041
- YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING KYOICHI'S
RACING FOR QUITE A WHILE.

180
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,500
WHAT'S HIS STYLE LIKE?

181
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,791
- HE'S A VERY PRECISE DRIVER
AND NEVER MAKES MISTAKES.

182
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,083
HE LIKES TO STICK TO THE BASICS

183
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,375
AND AVOIDS MAKING
ANY FLASHY MOVES.

184
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,333
IN A RACE HE'S
INFINITELY PATIENT,

185
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,458
TESTING OUT HIS
OPPONENT'S WEAKNESSES.

186
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,916
AFTER ANALYZING THE SITUATION
FROM EVERY ANGLE,

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,208
HE GOES FOR THE MOST RATIONAL
METHOD OF WINNING.

188
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,750
- SO THERE'S NO CHANCE OF HIM
SELF-DESTRUCTING.

189
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,791
- HE'S VERY DIFFERENT
FROM HIS TEAMMATE, SEIJI.

190
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,750
- KYOICHI IS A DEVOUT BELIEVER
IN RATIONALITY.

191
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,083
THAT ALONE EXPLAINS
WHY HE IS SO INTERESTED

192
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,833
IN ONLY RACING
FOUR-WHEEL-DRIVE CARS.

193
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,458
AGAINST AN EQUALLY
SKILLED OPPONENT,

194
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,000
HE WILL GO OUT OF HIS WAY,

195
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,791
TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS CAR IS
BETTER EQUIPPED TO WIN THE RACE.

196
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,875
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

197
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,125
- I SENSE SOME BITTERNESS
IN YOUR VOICE, BRO.

198
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,333
- I'M NOT BITTER.
I JUST DON'T LIKE HIM.

199
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,291
- AND I SURE AS HELL
DON'T WANT TO LOSE TO HIM.

200
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,458
- ( engine firing )

201
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,500
- MAN, THAT BACKFIRE
IS ANNOYING! IT'S SO LOUD!

202
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,791
I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE!

203
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,291
- HIS ABILITY TO ADAPT
IS AMAZING.

204
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,833
HE'S NEVER ONCE DRIVEN
ON THIS COURSE BEFORE TODAY.

205
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,916
AND YET HE'S KEEPING UP A PACE
WORTHY OF A VETERAN.

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,541
HIS SENSES ON THE DOWNHILL
ARE SPOT ON.

207
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,375
BUT PLAY TIME
IS OFFICIALLY OVER.

208
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,291
TIME TO PUT THIS RACE TO BED.

209
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,916
- Itsuki: THANK YOU
FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

210
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,458
UH, NATSUKI?

211
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,375
- ( chuckles )

212
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,666
- HMM?

213
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,041
- IT'S TAKUMI'S GIRLFRIEND!

214
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,583
- I BROUGHT YOU THIS.

215
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,291
- ( laughs hysterically )

216
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,958
OH, THANK YOU!
I HOPE IT'S WHATI THINK IT IS!

217
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,541
- HAVE YOU SEEN TAKUMI?

218
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,583
- HIS SHIFT ENDED AT FIVE, SO HE
BUGGED OUTTA HERE A WHILE AGO.

219
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,333
WHAT, HAVE YOU NOT
SEEN HIM TODAY?

220
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,916
- MM-MM.

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,541
- OH, I WAS THINKIN' YOU GUYS
WERE GONNA HANG OUT TONIGHT.

222
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,916
WHOA! IT'S CHEESECAKE!

223
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,166
YOU'RE THE BEST, NATSUKI,
THE BEST!

224
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,791
BON APPETIT!

225
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,833
- SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

226
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,333
IF TAKUMI ISN'T OUT ON A DATE,
THEN WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

227
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,541
- HEY, YOU SAID HE TOOK
THE EIGHT-SIX WITH HIM, RIGHT?

228
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,291
- UH, YEAH.

229
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,208
- I HOPE I'M WRONG BUT HE MAY
HAVE TAKEN THE EMPEROR'S BAIT

230
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,250
AND GONE TO AKAGI.

231
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,916
- THAT'D BE BAD!

232
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,541
- ( exclaims in shock )

233
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,666
- TAKUMI WENT TO AKAGI?

234
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,750
- NOW WE'RE ENTERING
THE MID-SPEED SECTION,

235
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,708
WHICH IS MUCH FLATTER
THAN THE BEGINNING

236
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,416
WITHOUT A SLOPE TO
HELP HIM ALONG,

237
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,333
HIS SPEED'S GONNA
START DROPPING'.

238
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,000
- THE NEXT S TURN SHOULD DO
JUST FINE.

239
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,458
THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN AVOID
MY COUNTERATTACK.

240
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,791
- THEY'RE HERE!

241
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:19,250
- NO WAY! THIS IS ONE OF THE
SHORTEST SECTIONS ON THE COURSE,

242
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,625
BUT LOOK AT HIS ACCELERATION!
IT'S CRAZY!

243
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,916
SEEMS LIKE HE MAY
TRY TO TAKE HIM ON THE OUTSIDE.

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
CHALLENGING THE EIGHT-SIX
AT A CORNER?

245
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,250
THAT'S BRAVE!

246
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,875
HE'LL TAKE THE INSIDE POSITION
AT THE NEXT CORNER.

247
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:43,958
I'M SURE OF IT.

248
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:53,375
WITH THAT SICK ACCELERATION
IN THE EVO-THREE,

249
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,541
THE EIGHT-SIX IS TOAST!

250
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,541
- REALLY? THE EVO-THREE
JUST TOOK THE LEAD?

251
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,625
AT A CORNER?

252
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,708
WHOA, WE WEREN'T EXPECTING THAT.

253
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,541
ALRIGHT, KEEP US POSTED IF
ANYTHING ELSE CRAZY GOES DOWN.

254
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,208
THANKS, MAN.

255
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,541
- WHAT NOW?

256
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,708
- THIS IS CLASSIC KYOICHI.

257
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,041
HE HELD HIMSELF BACK FROM
ATTACKING DURING THE SECTION

258
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,833
WITH THE STEEPEST DECLINE
AND WAITED UNTIL THE EIGHT-SIX

259
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,125
BEGAN TO LOSE SPEED
ON THE FLATTER PORTION.

260
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,958
WITH HIS LEVEL OF EXPERTISE
AND THE EVO-THREE'S ABILITIES,

261
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,375
KYOICHI COULD HAVE TAKEN
THE LEAD MUCH EARLIER.

262
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,916
BUT HE BIDED HIS TIME AND WAITED
UNTIL THE PERFECT MOMENT

263
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,083
WHERE HIS MARGIN OF ERROR
WAS LOWEST.

264
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,500
THAT'S THE DRIVER
I KNOW SO WELL.

265
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,416
- NOW THE QUESTION IS WILL THE
EIGHT-SIX HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

266
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,833
TO TAKE THE LEAD BACK.

267
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,625
I HOPE YOU DON'T EXPECT ME
TO ANSWER RESPOND TO THAT.

268
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,375
YOU SHOULD BE MORE THAN
CAPABLE OF FIGURING OUT

269
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,208
THE ANSWER YOURSELF.

270
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,500
- ( grunts )

271
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
- IDIOT! HE SHOULD'VE
STAYED HOME

272
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,625
AND LET US HANDLE THE BIG
BOYS OURSELVES.

273
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,833
NOW HE'S ON THE VERGE OF LOSING
FOR NOTHING.

274
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,291
IT'S SO STUPID!

275
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,583
♪ FEEL THE PASSION NOW! ♪

276
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,708
- HE'S BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP
WITH ME SINCE I PASSED HIM.

277
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,500
INCREDIBLE.

278
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,833
AND SOMEHOW, HE'S BEEN ABLE
TO GAIN EVEN MORE SPEED.

279
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,666
- USUALLY EXITING A CORNER
IS KEY FOR A TURBO

280
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,416
BUT IT'S THE COMPLETE
OPPOSITE FOR AN NA,

281
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,416
WHICH IS ALL ABOUT THE ENTRANCE.

282
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,625
THAT'S MORE OR LESS THE
BASIC OVERRIDING THEORY

283
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,291
BEHIND ALL DOWNHILL RACING.

284
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,958
- BUT THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY THE CASE

285
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,458
WHEN YOU HAVE A
MISFIRING SYSTEM.

286
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,958
- YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

287
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,291
HAVING THE MISFIRING
SYSTEM IN PLACE

288
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,708
MAKES BOTH THE TURBO'S TORQUE

289
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,500
AS WELL AS THE NA'S
RESPONSIVENESS POSSIBLE.

290
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,583
COUPLED WITH KYOICHI'S
SKILLS BEHIND THE WHEEL,

291
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,541
THAT EVO-THREE BECOMES
A CORNERING MACHINE

292
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,583
OF MONSTROUS PROPORTIONS.

293
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,375
IT CAN BOTH ENTER
AND EXIT A CORNER

294
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,625
WITH PRECISION AND SPEED,

295
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,500
MAKING IT
THE ULTIMATE DOGFIGHTER.

296
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,000
- THIS RACE IS NOTHIN' MORE
THAN A SUICIDE MISSION!

297
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,583
- I THINK I'M STARTING
TO BELIEVE THIS RACE

298
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,958
WAS NEVER ABOUT SPEED IN
THE FIRST PLACE.

299
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,250
- HUH?

300
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,791
- ( tires screeching )

301
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,375
- THINK ABOUT IT.

302
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,125
KYOICHI HAS CAREFULLY STUDIED
EVERY NUANCE OF THIS COURSE

303
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,958
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, WHILE
TAKUMI HAS ZERO EXPERIENCE HERE.

304
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,458
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY QUESTION
AS TO WHO THE FAVORITE IS.

305
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,333
- I HEAR YA.

306
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,750
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY
WENT ON BETWEEN THOSE TWO

307
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,916
BUT TAKUMI SHOWED UP TO A RACE
TONIGHT WITHOUT THE TOOLS

308
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,291
NECESSARY FOR A VICTORY.

309
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,458
- I DON'T GET IT.

310
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,250
WHY DID HE HAVE HE HAD TO
ACT SO FRIGGIN' IRRATIONAL

311
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,625
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

312
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,875
- WE'LL PROBABLY NEVER KNOW
WHY HE CAME TO AKAGI.

313
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,791
THE TRUTH IS THAT SOMETIMES WE
WANT TO RACE FOR NO OTHER REASON

314
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,666
THAN TO JUST BLOW OFF STEAM.

315
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,166
HE SEEMED TO HAVE
THAT AIR ABOUT HIM TONIGHT.

316
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,583
THIS ISN'T HIS USUAL
RACING STYLE.

317
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,916
NORMALLY THE EIGHT-SIX'S EXHAUST
HAS A HIGH-PITCHED SOUND TO IT.

318
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,166
- ( exhaust screeching )

319
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,916
- TONIGHT IT'S AN ENRAGED ROAR.

320
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,250
- (singing in Japanese)

321
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,833
- Announcer: CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
TAKUMI GAVE UP THE LEAD!

322
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:16,500
CHANCE OF GAINING IT BACK,
OR EVEN MORE, ACTUALLY WINNING?

323
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,666
NEXT ON INITIAL D, SECOND STAGE.

324
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,791
- Kyoichi: GOODBYE, EIGHT-SIX.

325
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,041
- Announcer: DON'T MISS IT!
