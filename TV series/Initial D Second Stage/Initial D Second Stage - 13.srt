00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,750
♪ LET'S ROLL ♪

4
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:26,958

5
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,125
- ♪ YEAH, YEAH, CHECK IT OUT ♪

6
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,583
♪ LET'S ROLL ♪

7
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,083
- IT'S WEIRD TO SEE
A RACE LAST FOR THIS LONG.

8
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,583
THESE TWO ARE FURIOUS FIGHTERS.

9
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,083
THIS IS A BATTLE
OF ENDURANCE I SUPPOSE.

10
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,333
- IT'S PHYSICALLY
AND MENTALLY DEMANDING.

11
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,416
THEY HAVE TO MAINTAIN
SUCH EXTREME INTENSITY

12
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,791
WHILE DEALING WITH
THE CONTINUOUS LATERAL G-FORCE.

13
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,458
IT'LL DRAIN THE EVEN THE
STRONGEST DRIVER

14
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,333
YOU COULD POSSIBLY FIND.

15
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,750
THROWN INTO THE MIX, THIS IS
THE TRICKIEST COURSE OUT THERE.

16
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,500
- LESSER DRIVERS WOULD
HAVE PACKED UP

17
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,583
AND GONE HOME BY THIS POINT.

18
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,166
- WHOEVER'S GOT THE BEST
STAMINA IS THE ONE

19
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,708
WHO'S GONNA WIN IT TONIGHT.

20
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,416
- ALL WE REALLY KNOW IS THAT
THE FIRST PERSON TO LOSE FOCUS

21
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,208
IS THE PERSON
WHO LOSES THE RACE.

22
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,250
- IF KAZUMI PACKS IT UP AND
MOVES BACK TO SAITAMA,

23
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,375
I MIGHT NEVER EVEN
SEE HER AGAIN.

24
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,000
I'M SO LOST.

25
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,250
WHAT THE HECK
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

26
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,083
JUST KEEP SITTING HERE
LIKE A STATUE?

27
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,916
I SHOULD AT LEAST
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,708
NOT LIKE IT'S GONNA
CHANGE HER MIND ABOUT ANYTHING.

29
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,416
BUT I OWE HER THAT MUCH.

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,458
I SHOULD TELL HER
THAT I LOVE HER.

31
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,041
UH...

32
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,125
- YEAH?

33
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,000
- SO I, UH...

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,041
YEAH.

35
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,000
- HEY. THIRD ROUND'S COMIN' ON.

36
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,250
WHOA. BOTH OF 'EM
ARE SO DAMN INTENSE, YA KNOW.

37
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,833
THIS IS REALLY GETTIN' ME
WORKED UP.

38
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,541
I WISH I WAS DRIVIN'.

39
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,083
- THE LEVIN'S LOOKING A LOT
DIFFERENT THAN IT DID

40
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,375
ON THE FIRST ROUND
THROUGH THE PASS.

41
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,750
SEEMS SOLID.

42
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,583
- WHAT THE...
WHAT'S GOING ON?

43
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,875
HE CHANGED HIS STYLE
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

44
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,000
HE'S MOVING SO FAST NOW THAT
I CAN'T RELAX MY STYLE AT ALL.

45
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,833
- WHEN WE FIRST GOT GEARED UP,
I WAS BEING CAUTIOUS.

46
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,083
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN
THE CORNERSTONE THEORY

47
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,041
ON PASS RACING IS
NOT TO KICK IT OUT

48
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,916
AT A HUNDRED PERCENT UNTIL
YOU'VE HAD THE CHANCE

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,541
TO DETERMINE
THE ROAD CONDITIONS.

50
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,583
BUT WE'RE WAY PAST
THAT POINT BY NOW.

51
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,333
- I DON'T WANNA LOSE THIS NOW.

52
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,208
I'LL CHASE HIM ALL THE WAY
TO THE END IF I HAVE TO.

53
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,083
I'M FINALLY STARTING TO GET
THIS NEW EIGHT-SIX FIGURED OUT.

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,125
I HAVEN'T WANTED
TO WIN ANYTHING THIS BADLY

55
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,750
SINCE I FIRST STARTED RACING.

56
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,833
IS IT BECAUSE HE'S DRIVING
AN EIGHT-SIX, TOO?

57
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,083
- ( tires screeching )

58
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,958
- I DUNNO, MAYBE I JUST WANNA
WIN WITH MY NEW SET OF WHEELS.

59
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,458
NO!

60
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,958
( grunting )

61
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,791
- ( tires screeching )

62
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,916
- THAT WAS CLOSE.

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,083
I GOTTA HOLD MY FOCUS ON THIS
THING OR I COULD STAND TO LOSE

64
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,291
MORE THAN JUST A RACE.

65
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,583
THERE'S NO SURVIVING A FALL
OFF OF THESE CLIFFS.

66
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,583
I DON'T FEEL IT, BUT I WONDER
IF I'M STARTING TO GET TIRED.

67
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,625
I'M WOBBLING A LITTLE BIT
ON THE ROAD.

68
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,708
CRAP! THE TIRES!

69
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,541
NOT NOW! PLEASE! NOT NOW!

70
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,958
I CAN FEEL
MY REAR TRACTION SLIPPING.

71
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,291
THE BACK TIRES
ARE STARTING TO LOSE THEIR GRIP.

72
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,875
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

73
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,416
NO WAY I CAN ADJUST
THE TIRES OUT HERE.

74
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,708
DAMN, I'VE COME A LONG WAY
BUT THIS MAY BE IT.

75
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,458
I MIGHT JUST LOSE THIS ONE.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,791
I KNOW I'VE BEEN A LOT OF SPEED
OUT HERE THIS PAST ROUND.

77
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,125
SO WHY IS HE STAYING PUT?

78
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,625
WHY ISN'T HE
PULLING AWAY FROM ME?

79
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,166
WAIT A SECOND. YEAH! THAT'S IT.

80
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,125
IT'S THE ONLY THING IT COULD BE.

81
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,500
HE'S HAVING
THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM I AM.

82
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,791
HIS TIRES MUST BE LOSING
THEIR GRIP TOO!

83
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,083
- ( tires screeching )

84
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,375
DUDE. TAKUMI ROCKS.

85
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,250
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE FOURTH ROUND.

86
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,458
- I KNOW IT'S ABOUT ENDURANCE

87
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,083
BUT THIS IS GONNA GET STUPID
REALLY QUICK.

88
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,875
- YOUR REAR TIRES
MUST BE SLIPPING TOO.

89
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,500
THE POWER INCREASE
PUTS MORE STRESS ON THE TIRES.

90
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,958
OUR CARS ARE POWERFUL AS HELL
AND THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING

91
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,083
AT THE SAME PACE
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

92
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,875
MAKES PERFECT SENSE, WE'D BE
RUNNING INTO THE SAME PROBLEM.

93
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,666
HE'S SHOCKINGLY GOOD
AND IT ONLY GETS MORE OBVIOUS

94
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,000
WATCHING HIM FROM BACK HERE.

95
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,833
THE WORSE THE CONDITIONS GET,
THE BETTER HE SEEMS TO BECOME.

96
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,708
BUT HE'S ONLY A GUY,
JUST LIKE ME.

97
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,791
HE'S NOT SOME
INVINCIBLE MACHINE!

98
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,791
WE'RE ON EQUAL FOOTING
AND THIS IS A TEST OF ENDURANCE!

99
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,500
- ( tires screeching )

100
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:09,083
- ACTUALLY, THESE SLIPPERY TIRES
ARE MAKING IT EASIER FOR ME

101
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,666
TO SEE WHAT MY CAR
IS ULTIMATELY CAPABLE OF.

102
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,666
I HAD NO IDEA.

103
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,583
EVERYTHING JUST FEELS
SO NATURAL.

104
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,000
THE CAR'S RUNNING
JUST THE WAY I WANT IT TO.

105
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,666
I'M READY TO KNOCK THIS OUT!

106
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,666
MY NEW EIGHT-SIX IS JUST
WHAT I'VE BEEN ACHIN' FOR

107
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:37,708
AND I'M PUTTIN' HER TO WORK!

108
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:47,750
AND I'M PUTTIN' HER TO WORK!

109
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:57,750
AND I'M PUTTIN' HER TO WORK!

110
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:07,750
AND I'M PUTTIN' HER TO WORK!

111
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:17,750
AND I'M PUTTIN' HER TO WORK!

112
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:30,666
AND I'M PUTTIN' HER TO WORK!

113
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,916
BASICALLY, I NEED TO STEP
ON THE ACCELERATOR TO SWING.

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,208
IT'S JUST THE SAME AS BEFORE.

115
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,291
I CAN SEE THIS MAJOR DIFFERENCE
WHEN I'M DRIFTING AT FULL SPEED,

116
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,833
IT'S CLEAR AS DAY.

117
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,916
THANKS DAD, I FINALLY GET
HOW TO CONTROL THIS CAR!

118
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,750
- DAMN, I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT ROUND THIS IS.

119
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,083
I'VE STARTED
TO REALLY SPACE OUT HERE.

120
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:14,625
I'M GETTING TIRED, WHICH CAN
ONLY MEAN ONE THING, SO IS HE.

121
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,000
AT THIS STAGE OF THE RACE,

122
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,000
MENTALLY IT'S A WHOLE
LOT MORE EXHAUSTING

123
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,958
TO FOLLOW THAN IT IS TO LEAD.

124
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,458
JUST HAVING A LITTLE DIFFERENCE
IN SPEED ISN'T GONNA BE ENOUGH

125
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,666
TO TAKE THE LEAD.

126
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,625
CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO WIN.

127
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,958
THE ONLY WAY TO LOSE TONIGHT
IS BY FALLING BEHIND.

128
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,833
YOU CAN'T LOSE
IF YOU'RE IN FRONT,

129
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:34,000
WHICH PUTS ME
IN THE COMFORT ZONE FOR NOW.

130
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,166
THE NEXT CORNER
IS WHERE THAT MUDSLIDE IS.

131
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,791
NO WAY HE'S GONNA FIND ENOUGH
WORKABLE DRY PAVEMENT

132
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,333
TO FIND THE KINDA SPACE
HE'D NEED TO SNEAK BY ME.

133
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,583
I SHOULD BE SAFE.

134
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,416
AND I'LL KEEP THIS UP
FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE TO

135
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,458
UNTIL THAT ONE MOMENT WHERE HE
LOSES HIS FOCUS AND SCREWS UP.

136
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,416
- Announcer: Initial D!

137
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,458
Announcer: Inital D!

138
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,291
- THE HELL?

139
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,000
THERE'S LESS MUD
ON THE ROAD NOW!

140
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,958
DUDE. YOU'RE GONNA
GET US BOTH KILLED!

141
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,791
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO PASS ME HERE! STOP!

142
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,791
HE'S OUT OF HIS FREAKIN' MIND!

143
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,750
- IT'S OVER. I WON.

144
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,333
- I'M SO STUPID.

145
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,000
I DIDN'T EVEN CONSIDER THAT THE
MUD WOULD'VE BEEN PUSHED ASIDE

146
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,833
FORM THE LAST TIME
WE BLEW THROUGH HERE.

147
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:17,541
GAVE HIM JUST ENOUGH SPACE
TO SLIP BY ME.

148
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,958
STILL, HE WAS ABLE TO GAUGE
THAT NARROW SPACE

149
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,166
AS ACCURATELY AS A SURGEON.

150
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,708
THIS GUY'S WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

151
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,583
- THEY'VE SLOWED DOWN
A WHOLE LOT.

152
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,583
I GUESS THE RACE IS OVER BY NOW.

153
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,125
AW, MAN. I JUST HOPE
TAKUMI WON THIS.

154
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,625
- IT'S THE TRUENO!

155
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,625
TAKUMI DID IT. HE WON! KICK ASS!

156
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,375
- ( both laughing )

157
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,416
- Iketani: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!
HE DID IT!

158
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,041
- ( engine revving
in the distance )

159
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,625
- THAT WAS, LIKE,
THE LONGEST RACE EVER.

160
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,291
HEY BROTHER!

161
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,208
- HE MADE IT.

162
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,375
- THANKS FOR WAITING, SIS.

163
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,625
I MAY BE BACK SAFE,
BUT I'M EXHAUSTED.

164
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,458
THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST RACES
I'VE EVER HAD.

165
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,250
WHY DON'T YOU HOP ON
IN THE CAR, OKAY?

166
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,583
IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.

167
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,291
- KAZUMI!

168
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,458
- SO I GUESS THIS WOULD
BE IT THEN. GOODBYE.

169
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,250
- ( stutters )

170
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,833
I COULDN'T EVEN
TELL HER GOODBYE.

171
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,583
MAYBE CUZ I DIDN'T
WANT IT TO BE GOODBYE SO SOON.

172
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,250
- Itsuki: TAKUMI?

173
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,375
- YEAH?

174
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,875
- THE RACE TREAT YOU OKAY?

175
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,625
- YEAH, I MANAGED TO
PULL OFF A WIN.

176
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,875
- THAT'S GOOD.

177
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,291
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE BEST AT THIS RACING STUFF.

178
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,083
GLAD YOU DID WELL.
TONIGHT WAS A TOTAL WASH FOR ME.

179
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,416
I KNOW IT WASN'T YOUR
INTENTION TO GET ME

180
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,458
TO HANG OUT WITH KAZUMI

181
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,416
THE WHOLE TIME
YOU WERE OUT THERE,

182
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,541
BUT IT STILL BLEW UP IN MY FACE.

183
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,583
I JUST COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO WORK UP THE GUTS

184
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,958
TO TELL HER HOW I REALLY
FEEL ABOUT HER.

185
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,750
IT'S DISTRACTING.

186
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,458
SHE'S BEEN ON MY MIND
NON-STOP SINCE YESTERDAY.

187
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,916
IT'S LIKE FALLING IN LOVE WITH
HER OPENED UP MY EYES TO A TRUTH

188
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,500
I DON'T THINK I EVER
WANTED TO FACE.

189
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,208
THE FACT THAT FALLING IN
LOVE WITH SOMEONE

190
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,375
CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY
PAINFUL EXPERIENCE.

191
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,416
LOVE IS A DEFINITELY
SERIOUS BUSINESS.

192
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,041
IT'S NOT FOR THE FEINT OF HEART.

193
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,583
CUZ WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,

194
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,083
IT FEELS LIKE YOUR WHOLE CHEST
IS GONNA CAVE IN ON ITSELF.

195
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,000
LAUGH AT ME IF YOU WANT TO, MAN.

196
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,333
- AND WHY WOULD
I WANT TO LAUGH AT YOU?

197
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,791
- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE?

198
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,875
- YEAH.

199
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,083
- ( door opens )

200
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,791
- SO YOU'RE BACK PRETTY LATE?

201
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,583
- YEAH.

202
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,458
- ONLY ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO
BEFORE YOU GOTTA LEAVE

203
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,875
ON YOUR DELIVERIES.

204
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,250
- I KNOW. JUST WAKE ME
WHEN IT'S TIME TO LEAVE, OKAY?

205
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:39,916
- YOU GOT IT.

206
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,458
- I NEVER KNEW OUR CAR
WAS THAT GOOD.

207
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,500
I FOUND OUT TONIGHT.

208
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,583
OH, AND DAD,
THERE'S ONE OTHER THING.

209
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,333
MAYBE YOU COULD TEACH ME
ABOUT ENGINES.

210
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,625
YOU KNOW, WHENEVER
YOU HAVE THE TIME.

211
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,375
IT SHOULD HELP ME
UNDERSTAND THE CAR BETTER.

212
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,416
- WHAT TURNED ON THE LIGHT

213
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,583
INSIDE THAT THICK
SKULL OF YOURS?

214
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,583
- I JUST REALIZED WHERE
THE GAPS ARE IN MY TECHNIQUE.

215
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,458
- ( door closes )

216
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,291
- HEY TAKUMI,
ITSUKI'S ACTING WEIRD AGAIN.

217
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,875
- ALRIGHT. I'LL JUST TELL YOU

218
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,583
SINCE YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA
FIND OUT ANYWAY.

219
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,041
- AW, THAT SUCKS.

220
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,541
I FEEL REALLY BAD FOR THE GUY.

221
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,041
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
THE TWO OF THEM WOULD MAKE IT.

222
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,166
- HE'S BACK TO BEING THE LONELY
DRIVER OF AKINA AGAIN.

223
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,958
- ITSUKI?

224
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,375
- YEAH?

225
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,416
( gasps )

226
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,583
BUT...

227
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,750
KAZUMI!

228
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,583
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
YOU WERE GOING BACK TO SAITAMA.

229
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,041
I LEFT SO QUICKLY
THAT I HAD TO COME BACK

230
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,666
AND GET SOME OF THE THINGS
I FORGOT TO TAKE WITH ME.

231
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,416
- OH, YEAH.

232
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,166
- BUT THAT'S NOT ALL
I LEFT BEHIND, ITSUKI.

233
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,916
I KNOW I LEFT IN A HURRY

234
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,083
AND I WASN'T ABLE TO SAY
A PROPER GOODBYE TO YOU

235
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,666
AND THAT'S MY FAULT.

236
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,541
- LISTEN, ONE THING.

237
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,833
DO YOU HAVE ANY FREE TIME NOW,

238
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,250
I MEAN, LIKE JUST AN HOUR
OR TWO? ANYTHING!

239
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,125
- UH, YEAH, SURE. OF COURSE.

240
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,375
- ( engine starts )

241
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,125
- SO HE HAD TO
LEAVE EARLY FOR WHAT?

242
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,041
FOR PERSONAL REASONS AGAIN?

243
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,125
- SORRY TO TELL YA.

244
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,375
- BEING YOUNG AND IN LOVE.

245
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,875
RIGHT NOW THAT GIRL'S THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING

246
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,791
IN THE WORLD TO HIM.

247
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,500
- THAT, REMINDS ME.

248
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,000
TAKUMI, WASN'T YOUR GIRLFRIEND

249
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,916
STARTING A PART-TIME
JOB SOMEWHERE?

250
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,541
HOW'S SHE DOIN' WITH IT SO FAR?

251
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,250
I'M ASSUMING THE TWO OF YOU ARE
STILL SLAMMIN' ON ALL CYLINDERS.

252
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,750
- NATSUKI GOT A JOB?

253
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,833
- TOO BAD.
AUTUMN'S ALMOST OVER.

254
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:21,291
I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS TIME
I'VE SPENT HERE IN AKINA.

255
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,000
I'LL THINK OF IT EVERY TIME
THE LEAVES CHANGE COLORS.

256
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,208
I'LL NEVER FORGET THE WONDERFUL
PEOPLE I'VE MET HERE.

257
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,583
ESPECIALLY THIS ONE CUTE BOY.

258
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,375
HE'S COMPASSIONATE
AND OUTSPOKEN

259
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,375
AND PUSHED ME OUT OF
MY COMFORT ZONE.

260
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,166
HE TAUGHT ME HOW
TO LIVE AS MYSELF.

261
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,666
HE'S JUST A YEAR
YOUNGER THAN ME

262
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,333
AND REMINDS ME OF THE YOUNGER
BROTHER I NEVER HAD.

263
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,958
IT'S ONE OF HIS BEST QUALITIES.

264
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,416
I WON'T EVER FORGET HIM.

265
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,458
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING IN!

266
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,000
WELCOME TO FAST BURGER.

267
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,916
IS THIS GOING TO BE
FOR HERE OR TO GO?

268
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

269
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,791
- GOOD-BYE, KAZUMI.

270
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,833
I COULDN'T TELL YOU THIS TO
YOUR FACE. BUT I LOVE YOU.

271
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,708
- THIS IS IT, BRO.

272
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,166
YOU PUT THIS "ALL-GUNMA"
TEAM TOGETHER YET?

273
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,791
- I'VE PICKED MY CANDIDATES.

274
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,500
- NOW IT'S GOING
BE UP TO THEM

275
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,000
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT
THEY WANT TO JOIN.

276
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,291
- I CAN'T KEEP LOSING LIKE THIS!

277
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,791
I'LL GET MY REVENGE
ON THOSE DAMN EMPERORS.

278
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,583
AND ON AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX!

279
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,125
- ( singing in Japanese )
