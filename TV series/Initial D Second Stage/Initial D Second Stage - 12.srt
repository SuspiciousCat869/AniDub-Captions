ABOUT THIS ONE.

16
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:50,583
TAKUMI'S GOT TO BE RACING WITH A
NEW EIGHT-SIX AT SHOMARU PASS.

17
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,291
THAT'S WHY HE'S UP THERE.
I KNOW IT.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,208
- WHEN I SAW HIM THIS MORNING,

19
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,583
HE STILL WASN'T USED TO
THE NEW EIGHT-SIX.

20
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,875
BUT A RACE HAS A THOUSAND
DIFFERENT OTHER VARIABLES.

21
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:04,083
THE VEIL OF SECRECY AROUND
THIS NEW ENGINE IS COMING OFF.

22
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,708
AND I WANT TO BE THERE
TO SEE IT.

23
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,583
- Kenji: MAN, I JUST
CAN'T STAY FREAKING CALM.

24
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:20,250
- YEAH, ME NEITHER. BUT I STILL
HAVE A FEW HOURS OF WORK LEFT.

25
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,750
WAIT. MAYBE YOU CAN GO ON
AND CHECK IT OUT.

26
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,583
BOSS, HOW YOU DOING TONIGHT?

27
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:30,750
- ERR, I'LL JUST PRETEND I'M NOT
LOOKING AND YOU CAN GO, OKAY?

28
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,458
- WHAT? KENJI START
YOUR FREAKING CAR.

29
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,291
- IF I WERE A LITTLE
BIT YOUNGER,

30
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,833
I'D LOCK THE DOORS ON THIS PLACE

31
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,708
AND CHECK IT OUT WITH YOU BOYS.

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
- ( car honks )

33
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,833
- BE RIGHT THERE.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,333
- I ALWAYS HIT THESE RED LIGHTS
WHEN I'M IN A FREAKING HURRY.

35
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,666
- IS THAT, UH,
KENJI, LOOK.

36
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,375
ISN'T THAT TAKUMI'S GIRLFRIEND?

37
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,958
- YEAH, SURE AS HELL
LOOKS LIKE HER.

38
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,000
MAYBE SHE'S INTERVIEWING FOR
A PART TIME JOB AT FAST BURGER.

39
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,291
- ( tires screeching )

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,958
- ( gasps )

41
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,583
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

42
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,625
- ITSUKI?

43
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,666
- SERIOUSLY, WHAT'S UP?

44
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,416
- THERE'S JUST A WHOLE
LOT THAT'S GONE DOWN

45
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,916
SINCE LAST NIGHT.

46
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,333
- YOU MIGHT'VE BEEN THE ONE
WHO CHOSE THIS LOCATION,

47
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,208
BUT I'M THE ONE WHO KNOWS IT.

48
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,916
KAZUMI. I WANT YOU
TO STAY HERE WHILE I'M GONE.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
- BUT WHY?
- 'CAUSE I SAID SO.

50
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,250
YOU CAN CATCH A BUS OR TRAIN
OUT OF HERE IN THE MORNING

51
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,791
IF YOU HAVE TO.

52
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,916
THAT WAY IF ANYTHING SHOULD
HAPPEN TO EITHER OF OUR CARS,

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,625
AT LEAST YOU WON'T
BE STUCK OUT HERE

54
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,500
WITHOUT A WAY TO GET BACK HOME.

55
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,833
- TAKUMI, WHAT IS THIS?

56
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,750
- YOU'RE GOING THERE,
AREN'T YOU?

57
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,500
YOU'RE GOING OUT
TO SHOMARU PASS.

58
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,041
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T
RACE THERE.

59
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,708
I'M BEGGIN' YOU.
PICK SOMEPLACE ELSE.

60
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,041
- THAT'S ENOUGH ALREADY.

61
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,083
THIS IS NONE OF YOUR
BUSINESS ANYWAY.

62
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,583
- BUT WATARU.

63
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,375
- JUST SO YOU'RE AWARE OF WHAT
WE'RE ABOUT TO DRIVE INTO.

64
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,833
THIS PASS IS NARROW AND TRICKY
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BELIEVE.

65
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,666
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER PASS
LIKE IT ANYWHERE.

66
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,000
I'LL TAKE THE LEAD
ON THE FIRST RUN

67
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,708
SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

68
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,333
SINCE THIS IS YOUR
FIRST TIME UP HERE,

69
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,375
I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE
SOME PRECAUTIONS, OKAY?

70
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,583
AFTER THE FIRST RUN, WE'LL
ALTERNATE POSITIONS

71
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,916
AND KEEP DOING SO

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,333
UNTIL ONE OF US PULLS AWAY
OR PASSES THE OTHER GUY.

73
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,458
IT'LL BE A SUDDEN DEATH RACE.
GOT THAT?

74
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,125
AND SINCE WE'RE PROBABLY
EQUALLY SKILLED

75
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,666
SOME OTHER ELEMENT
WILL BE THE DECIDING FACTOR.

76
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,291
- YEAH? WHAT OTHER
ELEMENT WOULD THAT BE?

77
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,500
- LUCK, STAMINA, COMPATIBILITY
WITH THE CAR, WITH THE ROAD.

78
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,041
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

79
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,500
WE SHOULD ROLL OUT NOW.

80
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,375
WHEN WE GET THERE,
I'LL TURN ON MY HAZARD LIGHTS

81
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,333
TO LET YOU KNOW
AND THEN WE GET STARTED.

82
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,166
- ( engine revs )

83
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,875
- Itsuki: TAKUMI.

84
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,791
I WONDER IF TAKUMI KNEW
THAT KAZUMI WOULD BE

85
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,708
COMING UP WITH HER BROTHER.

86
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,583
- IS SHOMARU PASS REALLY
AS DANGEROUS AS YOU WERE SAYING?

87
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,875
- FOR STARTERS,
IT'S A REALLY OLD ROAD.

88
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,625
AND IT'S NOT THAT LONG
BUT YOU GO UPHILL FIRST,

89
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,791
THEN FROM THE MIDDLE POINT,

90
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,750
YOU START TO GO INTO THE
DOWNHILL SECTION.

91
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,208
- SO, THEN IT'S LIKE
A HALF UPHILL COURSE?

92
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,125
- THAT'S HARDLY
ALL OF THE PROBLEMS.

93
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,625
IT'S NARROW, IT'S GOT
HORRIBLE VISIBILITY

94
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,958
AND THAT COMBO HAS CAUSED,

95
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,958
I DON'T KNOW, HOW MANY
ACCIDENTS OVER THE YEARS.

96
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,708
THE GUARDRAILS ARE ALL RUSTED.

97
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,833
THE ROAD'S UNEVEN AND SLIPPERY.

98
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,375
EVEN WATARU'S HAD TWO ACCIDENTS
THERE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

99
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,208
HE SAID IT WAS ONE
OF THE TOUGHEST PASSES

100
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,083
THAT HE'S EVER HAD TO RACE.

101
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,333
- FOR REAL? AND THIS IS TAKUMI'S
FIRST TIME GOING UP THERE.

102
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,666
IT'S TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,291
- THERE'S HIS HAZARD'S.
THIS IS IT.

104
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,750
- HOPE YOU'RE READY.

105
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,208
- DON'T WANT YOU TO CRASH
YOUR PRECIOUS CAR JUST YET.

106
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,666
- IT'S AN UPHILL.

107
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,750
- WHAT IS THAT?

108
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,958
- I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD
BE ONE HELL OF A TRIP.

109
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,416
IT'S A GREAT ENGINE
YOU GOT THERE.

110
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,833
HELL, YOU CAN EVEN
KEEP UP WITH ME ON THIS HILL.

111
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,208
GUESS THERE'S NO NEED TO TAKE
IT EASY ON YOU, IS THERE?

112
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,333
- Natsuki: SEE YOU
GUYS TOMORROW.

113
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,625
- Man: YEAH,
GOOD NIGHT, NATSUKI.

114
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,166
- I'M SORRY ABOUT
EVERYTHING, TAKUMI.

115
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,083
I'M THE ONE TO BLAME
IN ALL OF THIS.

116
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,083
I KNOW THAT NOW.

117
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,416
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO FIX IT.

118
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,416
SO FOR THE TIME BEING,

119
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,666
I'M JUST GOING TO TRY WORKING
PART TIME LIKE YOU DO.

120
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,416
I THINK THAT'S THE BEST
I CAN COME UP WITH.

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,791
I'M GOING TO TAKE
THIS TIME IN MY LIFE

122
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,000
TO BECOME A DIFFERENT PERSON.

123
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,166
- ( tires screeching )

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,500
- I DRIVE THIS EIGHT-SIX
FOR ONE REASON.

125
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,250
BECAUSE DEFEATING ANY OPPONENT
I'M UP AGAINST WITH AN OLD CAR,

126
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,708
EVERYONE THINKS
IS SUCH A PIECE,

127
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,583
MAKES THE WIN ALL THE
MORE SATISFYING.

128
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,333
BUT THIS TIME, SOMETHING
IS DIFFERENT FOR ME.

129
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,916
I CANNOT LOSE TO ANOTHER
EIGHT-SIX NO MATTER WHAT.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,708
THIS IS MORE PRESSURE THAN
I'VE FELT IN ANY OTHER RACE.

131
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,708
THAT'S CRAZY.

132
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,041
I CAN EVEN SEE THE AURA

133
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,791
RADIATING FROM YOUR
TRUENO, TAKUMI.

134
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,916
- Kenta: YOU REALLY THINK
THIS IS A GOOD SPOT, KEISUKE?

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,166
- THE COURSE IS
SO DAMN NARROW.

136
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,708
THERE'S REALLY NO
OTHER PLACE TO WATCH.

137
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,458
THIS IS THE BEST WE GOT, MAN.

138
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,166
- HERE THEY COME.

139
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,458
- YEAH. THIS IS IT.

140
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,166
THAT SUDDEN BOOST OF
POWER IS THE BEST THING

141
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,291
THIS CAR HAS TO OFFER.

142
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,791
- ( engine revving )

143
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,333
- THERE GOES THAT OBSOLETE
"BOOM" TURBO OF HIS.

144
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,791
- HEY, I GOT A QUESTION.

145
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,625
AREN'T TAKUMI'S TRUENO
AND WATARU'S LEVIN

146
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,166
BASICALLY THE SAME CAR?

147
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,000
I MEAN, MY UNDERSTANDING IS
THAT THEY GOT DIFFERENT HEADLAMP

148
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,083
AND TAIL LAMP DESIGNS,

149
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,708
BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
WHERE IT STOPS.

150
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,083
SO WHY DO YOU THINK
THE TWO OF THEM

151
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,625
ARE RUNNING SO DIFFERENTLY
OUT THERE?

152
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,416
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE, YA KNOW.

153
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,083
I THINK MY BROTHER WOULD
DO A BETTER JOB

154
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,083
OF EXPLAINING IT TO
YOU THAN I WOULD.

155
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,666
I UNDERSTAND IT IN MY HEAD

156
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,875
BUT I JUST CAN'T PUT THAT CRAP
INTO WORDS AS GOOD AS HE CAN.

157
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,125
- IT'S LIKE YOU
WERE SAYING, KENTA,

158
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,791
THE LEVIN AND THE TRUENO
ARE LIKE TWIN SIBLINGS.

159
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:23,250
EXCEPT THEIR ENGINES TAKE
DIFFERENT TUNING METHODS.

160
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,791
THIS, OF COURSE,
CAUSES THEM TO RUN

161
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,541
LIKE TWO COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT CARS.

162
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,125
THE METHOD THAT GETS
USED IN THE CAR

163
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,500
WITHOUT THE TURBOCHARGER

164
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,500
IS CALLED MECHANICAL TUNING.
IT'S COMMON.

165
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,250
THAT'S TAKUMI'S TRUENO.

166
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,833
HIS FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL
CONTROLS THE RPM'S DIRECTLY.

167
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,750
IT'S INSTANT RESPONSE
IS IT'S STRENGTH.

168
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,750
EVEN AFTER ENTERING A CORNER
AT NEARLY TOP SPEED,

169
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,875
HE CAN STILL MAKE
ADJUSTMENTS TO HIS ATTACK.

170
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,041
A NICE ADVANTAGE.

171
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,833
- ( tires screeching )

172
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,000
THAT MEANS HE CAN ATTACK
THE CORNERS MORE AGGRESSIVELY

173
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,916
THAN THE CAR WITH
THE TURBO EVER COULD.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,958
WHEN IT COMES TO
ENTERING CORNERS,

175
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,583
CARS LIKE THIS ARE THE
BEST ON THE ROAD.

176
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,375
ON THE OTHER HAND,
THE LEVIN IS A TURBO.

177
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,625
IT MIGHT BE A HAIR SLOWER
WHEN IT COMES TO THE CORNERS,

178
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,583
BUT THE ACCELERATION IT HAS
ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS

179
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,041
COVERS THAT DIFFERENCE
IN SPADES.

180
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,833
CARS WITH TURBO
ARE BEST AT EXITING CORNERS.

181
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,958
- THEN WHAT ABOUT
THE LEVIN'S FISHTAILING?

182
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,958
COULDN'T THAT BECOME
A BIG PROBLEM?

183
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,000
- THE 'BOOM' TURBO
TENDS TO LAG A BIT,

184
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,750
SO ONCE THE BOOST
PRESSURE GOES DOWN,

185
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,625
IT TAKES SOME TIME
TO WORK IT BACK UP.

186
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,083
WHICH IS SOMETHING, THE DRIVER
SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DO.

187
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,875
THAT'S WHY HE KEEPS HIS
FOOT ON THE GAS

188
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,250
WHEN HE'S EXITING THE CORNERS

189
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,625
AND CONTROLS THE VEHICLE
USING COUNTER-STEERING ONLY.

190
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,708
THAT'S WHAT HIS FISHTAILING
TECHNIQUE IS ALL ABOUT.

191
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,833
IT'S SO HE COULD DEAL WITH
ALL THE PECULIAR DETAILS

192
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,041
HIS CAR HAS.

193
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,833
WHICH I'M SURE ARE QUITE
A FEW BY THIS POINT.

194
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,458
- THAT SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU?

195
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,250
LISTEN, PASS RACING IS NOT
JUST A TOUCH AND GO SPORT.

196
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,791
- I GOT IT. AT LEAST
I THINK I'M UNDERSTANDING.

197
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,666

INITIAL D.

206
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,625
- WHAT THE HELL
WAS UP WITH THAT?

207
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,666
- ARE YOU CERTAIN THIS IS
WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE?

208
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,666
- YEAH. I THINK.

209
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,416
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.

210
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,791
- WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

211
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,166
- ( engines revving )

212
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,666
- THAT'S THEM.

213
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,416
- NO WAY.
THAT WAS A "BOOM" TURBO.

214
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,208
- IT LOOKS OUT OF CONTROL,
THE WAY IT'S MOVING.

215
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,583
THAT'S GOT TO BE DANGEROUS.

216
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,666
THE ROAD'S SO NARROW,
HE'S BARELY STAYING ON IT.

217
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,458
LIKE HE'S SLIDING DOWN
THE EDGE OF A KNIFE.

218
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,625
- BUT MAN, WHEN HE'S ON, HE'S
FASTER THAN ANY CAR OUT THERE.

219
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,375
HE'S A DIFFERENT KIND
OF OPPONENT.

220
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,333
THE KIND THAT BREAKS EVERY
CONVENTIONAL RULE ON THE BOOKS.

221
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,875
- SECOND ROUND AND THIS TIME,

222
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,416
I'LL BE THE ONE IN THE
OBSERVER'S POSITION.

223
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,291
I GET TO SEE WHAT YOUR
UNDEFEATED GUNMA-GROWN TALENT

224
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,750
HAS TO OFFER.

225
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,500
- THIS AGAIN.
MAN, THIS CORNER SUCKS.

226
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,500
- RIGHT NOW, EVERY ELEMENT
THAT COULD LINE UP

227
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,375
AGAINST TAKUMI IS
DOING EXACTLY THAT.

228
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,666
A HORRIBLY TRICKY COURSE
THAT HE'S GOT NO EXPERIENCE ON.

229
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,416
THEN THERE'S THE LEVIN'S
IRREGULAR PACE

230
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,750
THAT JUMPS IN AND
BREAKS HIS RHYTHM.

231
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,083
BUT ABOVE
EVERYTHING ELSE,

232
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,333
HE'S GOT THAT BIG UNEASY
FEELING IN HIS GUT.

233
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,375
HE'S STILL NOT USED
TO THE NEW EIGHT-SIX.

234
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,583
HER HANDLING'S STILL
A MYSTERY TO HIM

235
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,458
AND THAT'S HIS BIGGEST HANDICAP.

236
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,750
- THESE CONDITIONS ARE CRAP.

237
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,666
MY CAR IS SHAKING
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

238
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,458
I CAN'T EVEN USE THE INNER
EDGE OF THE ROAD.

239
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,916
IT'S WORN ALL TO HELL.

240
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,291
IF THE TIRES CATCH IT,
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO SLIP.

241
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,875
AND I CAN'T USE THE
FREAKING OUTER EDGE

242
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,583
COMING OUT OF THE
CORNERS EITHER.

243
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,708
THERE AREN'T NEARLY AS MANY
USABLE AREAS ON THIS ROAD

244
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,791
AS YOU'D THINK BY LOOKING AT IT.

245
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,500
- TAKUMI, IF YOU HADN'T FIGURED
IT OUT, YOU BETTER FAST.

246
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,916
THE SUSPENSION SETTINGS
CHANGE BASED ON THE POWER

247
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,333
COMING OUT OF THE ENGINE.

248
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,708
AFTER I INSTALLED THE NEW
ONE, YOU KEPT SAYING TO ME

249
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,916
YOU COULDN'T CORNER
LIKE YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO

250
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,750
WHICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

251
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,125
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I
SET THE CAR UP FROM THE GET-GO.

252
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,750
ONLY BY GETTING YOUR CAR
REVVED UP TO THE HIGHEST RPM'S,

253
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,625
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO CORNER AT
THE HIGHER SPEED LIKE YOU WANT.

254
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,583
YOU NEED TO PICK UP
ON THAT, SON.

255
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,250
UNLOCK THAT CAR'S CAPABILITIES
AND THIS RACE IS YOURS.

256
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,125
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

257
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,500
DID I JUST IMAGINE THAT?

258
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,916
- Wataru: THE TURBO IN
THIS BABY'S SO FAST,

259
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,875
I'M HONESTLY
SWEATING A BIT.

260
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,250
THIS CAR IS NOTHING
LIKE IT WAS BEFORE.

261
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,875
I MEAN, SURE, I'LL HAVE
TO GO AT HER

262
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,875
WITH MORE DETAILED MAINTENANCE.

263
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,125
AND EVEN WHEN I'M RACING,

264
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,541
I'M GONNA HAVE TO KEEP
ONE EYE ON MY GAUGES.

265
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,000
THIS RIDE COST A LOT
OF MONEY AND SWEAT

266
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,333
BUT I DON'T REGRET A SINGLE
THING ABOUT ANY OF IT.

267
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,833
FINALLY GOT THE POWER UNDER
THIS HOOD I'VE DREAMED OF.

268
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,291
HEAR THAT, KAZUMI?

269
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,375
I KEEP GROWING 'CAUSE IT
ALL MEANS NOTHING

270
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,541
THE SECOND YOU STOP.

271
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,291
YOU KEEP UP WITH
THIS RUNNING AWAY

272
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,916
FROM THE THINGS YOU
SUCK AT ROUTINE

273
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,833
AND YOU'LL NEVER BE
GOOD AT ANYTHING.

274
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,666
YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP SEARCHING
FOR WHAT YOU ARE GOOD AT.

275
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,916
AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD
ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET.

276
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,916
- WATARU.

277
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,958
- YOU THIRSTY?

278
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,000
- OH, THANKS. THAT'S NICE.
IT'S WARM.

279
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,125
- LISTEN, ITSUKI.

280
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,250
- WHAT'S UP?

281
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,958
- I DON'T THINK THAT,
THAT AFTER TODAY,

282
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,875
I DON'T THINK
I'M GOING BACK TO GUNMA.

283
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,500
SO, UH, I JUST...

284
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,916
I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT BUT THIS
WILL PROBABLY BE GOODBYE FOR US.

285
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,333
I AM SORRY.

286
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,458
- WHAT?

287
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,208
- MY PARENTS FOUND OUT ABOUT ME
LEAVING WORK THE OTHER DAY.

288
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,916
THEY'RE ACTUALLY PRETTY
TICKED OFF AT ME.

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,625
I'M ALL KINDS OF GROUNDED.

290
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,208
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE
REASON WHY I'M LEAVING GUNMA.

291
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,250
I WAS THINKING IN THE CAR
ON THE WAY UP HERE.

292
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,416
AND THE ONE THING
I COULDN'T KEEP OUT OF MY HEAD

293
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,583
WAS THE IDEA THAT I NEED
TO CHOOSE MY OWN PATH.

294
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,041
BECAUSE IF I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CHOOSES IT,

295
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,333
THEN I'LL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO SAY
TO MYSELF IN THE END

296
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,458
THAT I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT WHATEVER I DECIDED.

297
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,458
THAT STUPID OLD JOB THAT I HAD,
AND THIS TEMPORARY ONE,

298
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,791
WELL THEY WERE NEVER MY IDEA.

299
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,125
I NEED TO GET OUT THERE
AND FIND A JOB FOR MYSELF.

300
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,416
AND I ALSO HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE I WANNA DO.

301
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,666
- SO, WHAT IS IT?

302
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,916
- I WANNA SAVE UP
ENOUGH MONEY

303
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,750
SO I CAN GET MY DRIVER'S
LICENSE JUST LIKE YOU.

304
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,625
IT'LL BE MY FIRST STEP
TOWARDS REAL INDEPENDENCE.

305
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,458
I WAS WRONG TO THINK THAT
MOVING TO SOME FARAWAY PLACE

306
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,458
WAS GOING TO SOLVE
ALL MY PROBLEMS.

307
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,958
HOLDING THE STEERING WHEEL IN
YOUR LIFE SOUNDS A LOT BETTER

308
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,333
THAN BEING A PASSENGER
AND WATCHING SOMEONE ELSE DO IT.

309
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,958
I WANT TO RUN MY OWN LIFE.

310
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,416
AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

311
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,958
WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE
JUMPING IN TO HELP.

312
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,291
- UH, KAZUMI?
I, UH, I THOUGHT...

313
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,791
- YOU THOUGHT IT WAS
BECAUSE OF YOU BUT IT'S NOT.

314
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,791
I WON'T GO BACK TO GUNMA 'CAUSE
I CAN'T GET MY LICENSE THERE.

315
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,166
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

316
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,791
- I CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH, ITSUKI.

317
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,375
YOU'RE THE BEST.

318
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

319
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,083
I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH YOU, KAZUMI.

320
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,458
- HEY, HERE COMES
THE SECOND ROUND.

321
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,750
- ( tires screeching )

322
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,541
- I THINK THE KID IS
FINALLY STARTING

323
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,208
TO GET USED TO HIS NEW ENGINE.

324
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,166
IT'S TIME FOR THIS EIGHT-SIX
TO OPEN IT'S EYES TO A NEW LIFE.

325
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,250
- I CAN CONTROL HER BETTER.
IT'S A LOT EASIER NOW.

326
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,083
I WAS JUST STRUGGLING
WITH THIS YESTERDAY

327
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,416
IS IT BECAUSE I'M GIVING
HER MORE POWER?

328
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,708
WHO CARES?

329
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,083
NOW THAT I CAN CONTROL HER,
I CAN RUN MY RACE.

330
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,000
THIS IS MY TIME.

331
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,916
I MIGHT JUST BE ABLE
TO PULL THIS OFF.

332
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,791
- I WAS JUST PLANNING ON PLAYING
THE OBSERVER THIS ROUND,

333
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,375
BUT THAT'S CLEARLY NOT
GOING TO WORK ANYMORE.

334
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,375
HE'S ADAPTING
TO THIS COURSE FAST.

335
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,875
A LOT QUICKER
THAN I WOULD'VE THOUGHT.

336
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,125
THERE'S NOT A FIRST TIMER I KNOW
OF WHO COULD'VE RACED HERE

337
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,333
AND TAKEN IT ON
THIS WELL THIS FAST.

338
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,833
IT'S IMPRESSIVE AS HELL.

339
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,708
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT RACERS
LIKE HIM ACTUALLY EXIST.

340
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,583
BUT SO WHAT? I'M STILL NOT
GOING TO LOSE ON MY OWN TURF.

341
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,125
THIS BITCH OF A RACE
IS JUST GETTING STARTED.

342
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,958
- MAKE SURE YOU REV IT UP
TO ELEVEN THOUSAND RPM'S.

343
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,666
- ( tires screeching )

344
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,500
- THERE'S NOTHING COOLER
THAN GOOD PASS RACERS.

345
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,458
AND YOU'RE NOT BAD, TAKUMI.

346
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,125
YOU GOT SOME
SHARP ASS TECHNIQUES

347
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,250
THAT WOULD CONVINCE
ANYONE OF YOUR SKILLS.

348
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,291
WHICH MEANS I CAN KICK ALL OF
THE FIRE OUT OF MY LEVIN.

349
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,875
THIS IS JUST THE
KIND OF EXCITEMENT

350
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,166
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

351
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,625
RIGHT NOW, I'M THE LUCKIEST
GUY ON THE PLANET.

352
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,958
- ( engine revs )

353
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,375
- AT THE END OF THAT LAST ROUND,
I WAS PUSHING IT FULL TILT.

354
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,333
THIS MAKES ME REMEMBER
WHY I STARTED RACING

355
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,750
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

356
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,375
YOU'VE BEEN ONE HELL
OF AN OPPONENT,

357
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,458
BUT IN THIS ROUND, KID,
I'M WIPING YOU OFF THE MAP.

358
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,458
- ( theme song playing )

359
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

360
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,541
- Announcer: EACH WITH
THEIR OWN HOPES,

361
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,708
EACH WITH THEIR OWN DESIRES.

362
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,916
NEXT ON INITIAL D
SECOND STAGE,

363
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,916
IT'S OUR LAST EPISODE OF THE
SEASON, "CHANGING SEASONS."

364
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,250
DON'T MISS IT.
