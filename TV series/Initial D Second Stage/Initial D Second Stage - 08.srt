- MAN, HE PULLED OFF THAT
COUNTERATTACK WITHOUT A HITCH.

17
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,000
AND HE DID IT LIKE IT WAS THE
MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD.

18
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:57,041
- THAT LAN-EVO CAN DO THINGS
WE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND.

19
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,416
IT'S GOT EXTRA BOOST AND
TRACTION THAT NO FR CAN IMITATE.

20
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,916
DON'T MATTER HOW FAR THAT
FR MIGHT BE TWEAKED OUT,

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,083
THE EVO'LL WIN ON EVERY LEVEL.

22
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,583
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

23
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,875
YOU JUST CAN'T DENY
THE MECHANICAL SUPERIORITY

24
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,250
OF A CAR THAT HAS
FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

25
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,625
THIS RACE JUST BECAME A
REAL TOUGH ONE FOR RYOSUKE.

26
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,375
I WONDER IF HE'S EVEN GONNA
HAVE THE CHANCE

27
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,250
TO REGAIN THE LEAD AFTER THAT.

28
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,291
- I REALLY DOUBT IT, MAN.

29
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,208
- COME ON, RYOSUKE!

30
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,666
YOU CARRY THE PRIDE AND HOPE
OF ALL GUNMA RACERS WITH YOU.

31
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,000
WIN THIS FOR US!

32
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,833
- ALL THOSE ISSUES I'VE HAD
ABOUT MOUNTAIN PASSES

33
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,083
HAVE VANISHED.

34
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,500
AFTER DOING THIS,
I DON'T BUY INTO THE IDEA

35
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,625
OF HAVING SOME KIND OF CHARISMA
OR CHARM WITH THE PASS.

36
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,958
AND NOW THAT I'VE ANALYZED
THIS SUPERSTITIOUS ILLUSION,

37
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,750
I CAN SEE IT ALL COMES
DOWN TO EXPERIENCE.

38
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,791
THAT AND REFINED TECHNIQUE.

39
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,750
NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT,

40
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,958
I'M NOT AFRAID OF
RYOSUKE ANYMORE.

41
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,000
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES
TO REFINED TECHNIQUE,

42
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,791
THAT'S ONE AREA WHERE I'VE
GOT HIM BEAT.

43
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,125
- SO, TAKUMI,
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED?

44
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,583
IN AKAGI I MEAN.

45
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,000
IT SHOULD BE OVER BY NOW.

46
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,416
WHO DO YOU THINK WON?

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,000
- I HONESTLY DON'T HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST IDEA.

48
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,416
AND HOW COULD I TELL?

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I LOST TO THAT LAN-EVO
EVEN BEFORE I SAW

50
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,708
WHAT HE WAS FULLY CAPABLE OF.

51
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,166
JUST TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IT,
PISSING ME OFF ALL OVER AGAIN.

52
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,208
- SORRY, MAN.
- ABOUT WHAT?

53
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,416
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S YOUR FAULT.

54
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,000
AND TALKING TO YOU IS
AT LEAST HELPING ME

55
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,250
TO GET IT OFF MY CHEST, Y'KNOW?

56
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,375
I WAS FEELING SO DEPRESSED
ALL DAY TODAY,

57
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,500
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH MYSELF.

58
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,458
AFTER THE ENGINE BLEW ON ME,

59
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,333
THE GUY DRIVING THE
LAN-EVO TOLD ME

60
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,375
THAT HE DIDN'T
CONSIDER IT A RACE.

61
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,041
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

62
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,541
HE SAID THAT WE'D BATTLE
FOR REAL SOME OTHER TIME,

63
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,791
WHENEVER I HAD A BETTER CAR
TO DO IT WITH.

64
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,250
- HE SAID THAT?

65
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,166
- AND IT WAS THE WAY
HE SAID IT TO ME.

66
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,083
HE ACTED LIKE HE WAS ALREADY
SURE I WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

67
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,916
LIKE A TEACHER EXPLAINING
SCHOOL WORK TO THE DUMB KID.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,750
NOT SOME GUY BRAGGING
ABOUT A VICTORY.

69
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,208
THAT PART HURT MY PRIDE
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

70
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,083
I'M PRETTY SURE THOSE WORDS
ARE GONNA STICK WITH ME

71
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,000
FOR A LONG TIME.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
- WHATTYA SAY. LET'S GET
THIS OPERATION STARTED.

73
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,500
- MMM-HMM.

74
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,875
- BY TOMORROW NIGHT,

75
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,083
THERE'S GONNA BE A NEW RUMOR
STIRRING AROUND AKINA.

76
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,208
EVERYBODY IN TOWN'S
GONNA' BE TALKIN' ABOUT

77
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,666
THE RESURRECTION
OF THE EIGHT-SIX.

78
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,250
- YOU'VE GOT A FINELY TUNED CAR
THERE, KYOICHI.

79
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,333
SURPRISINGLY FINE
CORNERING ABILITIES.

80
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,583
IT CAN ACCELERATE AT ANY RPM.

81
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,541
IT TURNS 'EASILY AND
EXITS CORNERS FASTER

82
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,416
THAN MOST OTHER
DRIVERS COULD DREAM.

83
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,458
AND THE ACCELERATION...

84
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,583
WATCHING THIS THING PERFORM
SO UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL,

85
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,958
IT'S TERRIFYING.

86
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,416
OF COURSE, IT'S NOT LIKE
I JUST NOW HAD THIS EPIPHANY.

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,875
I KNEW ALL THIS YESTERDAY.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,416
- ( tires screeching )

89
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,250
- ( crowd exclaiming )

90
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,541
- WHOA! YOU SEE THAT?

91
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,833
RYOSUKE SMACKED HIS FENDER
INTO THE GUARDRAIL!

92
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,250
- YEAH, HE HAD TO DO THAT.

93
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,000
I THINK IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
HE COULD KEEP UP

94
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,833
WITH THE EVO THREE.

95
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,291
- LOOK AT THIS TIME.
- ( gasps )

96
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,541
THAT'S NUTS!
IF THE EVO THREE KEEPS THIS UP,

97
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,250
HE'LL BLOW THE COURSE RECORD
OFF THE RAILS.

98
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,750
I 'NEVER THOUGHT I'D LIVE
TO SEE THIS.

99
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,250
- YEAH, AND RYOSUKE'S
NOT A SLOW DRIVER.

100
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,791
IT'S JUST THE EVO THREE
IS REALLY GOING

101
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,750
THAT FAST OUT THERE.

102
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,000
- YO. THIS IS CORNER THIRTY FIVE
CALLIN' TO CHECK IN. LISTEN.

103
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,208
THE EVO THREE IS
STILL IN THE LEAD.

104
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,916
- GOT IT.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,541
- HEY, KEISUKE.
DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA BE OKAY?

106
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,791
- IF THE LAN-EVO CAN
JUST KEEP UP THIS PACE

107
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,000
FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

108
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,958
I HATE TO SAY IT, YOU GUYS,
BUT YOU KNOW,

109
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,958
HE COULD WALK AWAY
WITH THE VICTORY.

110
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,750
- DON'T SWEAT IT, OKAY?
MY BROTHER'LL GET AROUND THIS.

111
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,833
HE'S STRONGER THAN YOU THINK.

112
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,000
I MEAN, THERE'S NO DOUBT
SUDO'S FAST.

113
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,250
YEAH, I DON'T THINK ANY OF US
HERE SAW THIS ONE COMIN'.

114
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,541
WATCHING THOSE TIRES IS LIKE
WATCHING LIGHTNING STRIKE,

115
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,875
I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING.

116
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,458
YOU DON'T SEE IT
'TIL IT'S TOO LATE.

117
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,583
BUT MY BROTHER CERTAINLY DID.

118
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,916
USING ALL THE DATA HE COLLECTED
AT VARIOUS CHECKPOINTS

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,791
THROUGHOUT THE RACE LAST NIGHT,

120
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,458
HE LEARNED A HELLUVA LOT
FROM WHAT SUDO DID

121
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,208
AGAINST THE EIGHT-SIX.

122
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,291
HE CALCULATED EVERY ONE
OF SUDO'S ABILITIES

123
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,541
MORE PRECISELY THAN
I EVER COULD.

124
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,958
SO I CAN TELL YOU
WHAT I TRULY BELIEVE.

125
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,208
MY BROTHER'S WALKING AWAY
WITH THE TROPHY TONIGHT.

126
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,541
- THE MISFIRING AND
THAT FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE

127
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,500
MAKE FOR A KILLER COMBO.

128
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,833
FULL ACCELERATION IN LOW
GEARS ISN'T GONNA CUT IT

129
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,291
AGAINST THIS GUY.

130
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,125
BUT I MAY GET MY CHANCE
TO OVERTAKE HIM

131
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,958
AT A HIGH-SPEED CORNER.

132
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,125
I KNEW IT!

133
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,791
- HE ISN'T COMIN' IN TO ATTACK
ME FROM ANOTHER ANGLE.

134
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,250
WHY NOT? WHAT'S HIS DEAL?

135
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,875
THIS PASSIVE DRIVING THING
IS STARTIN' TO PSYCH ME OUT.

136
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,833
HAS HE THROWN IN THE TOWEL?

137
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,000
( scoffs ) NO. THAT'S STUPID.

138
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,625
I KNOW BETTER.
HE'S GONNA ATTACK.

139
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,708
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHEN.

140
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,916
LOGICALLY, I KNOW I'M IN
THE BETTER POSITION.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,500
BUT I CAN'T SHAKE THE FEELING
THAT I'M BEING HUNTED HERE.

142
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,416
MAYBE I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
PAST MY WHOLE ISSUE

143
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,666
ABOUT RYOSUKE AND HIS CHARISMA.

144
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,333
BEATING THE HELL OUT OF HIM
WILL GET RID OF THAT.

145
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,750
I'M READY FOR YOU, PAL.

146
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,166
ALL MY TIRES HAVE STILL
GOT FULL TRACTION.

147
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,541
- THIS IS ONE INCREDIBLE BATTLE.

148
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,083
I ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE HERE.

149
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,500
AND I NEED TO MAKE
MY ATTACK PRECISE.

150
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,500
IT'S TIME TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE.

151
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,375
- Man on radio:
RYOSUKE'S RIGHT ON TOP OF HIM.

152
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,458
BUT THE EVO THREE
IS REALLY COOKING.

153
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,958
HE'S NOT SLOWIN' DOWN AT ALL.

154
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,750
LOOKS LIKE THIS IS GONNA BE
A CLOSE ONE, GUYS!

155
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,166
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

156
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,416
I REALLY DON'T THINK
RYOSUKE CAN PULL THIS OFF.

157
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,666
THEY GOT ONE MORE CORNER TO HIT

158
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,375
BEFORE THEY GET TO
THE FINISH LINE.

159
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,583
- I KNOW. GUESS RYOSUKE GETTIN'
KNOCKED OFF THE THRONE

160
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,166
IS A LOCK AT THIS POINT.

161
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,166
- ( tires screeching )
- HERE THEY ARE!

162
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,708
- CRAP! THE EVO THREE IS
STILL IN THE LEAD!

163
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,000
- THIS TURN IS MY CHANCE
TO TAKE HIM OUT.

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,166
YOUR WEAKNESS IS YOUR FEAR
OF TURNING RIGHT.

165
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,750
IT'S SOMETHING YOU NEVER
BOTHERED TO CONQUER,

166
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,291
AND FRANKLY, YOU
REALLY SUCK AT IT.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,083
- ( crowd gasping )

168
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,083
- RYOSUKE JUST TOOK HIM
ON THE OUTSIDE!

169
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,166
- AMAZING!
HE'S GOT THE EVO THREE BOXED IN!

170
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,875
- ( tires screeching )

171
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,625
- DAMMIT! HE'S GOT ME STUCK!

172
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,708
I CAN'T USE MY FOUR-WHEEL
DRIVE'S TRACTION

173
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,958
OR THE MISFIRING SYSTEM!

174
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,583
- INCREDIBLE! THE FC
IS CORNERING

175
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,250
WHILE IT'S BLOCKING
THE EVO THREE!

176
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,666
- THAT'S IT! YOU CAN DO THIS,
RYOSUKE! COME ON!

177
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,208
LET'S GO!

178
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,333
- YOU'RE ALMOST THERE, MAN!

179
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,166
- HE'S GONNA WIN THIS!

180
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,208
ALRIGHT! HE'S IN FRONT!

181
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,833
- THAT'S IT, RYOSUKE! JUST A
LITTLE FARTHER AND YOU GOT IT!

182
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,791
KEEP IT UP!

183
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:35,083
YES! HE REALLY DID IT!
UNBELIEVABLE.

184
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,916
THAT WAS A COURSE RECORD.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,333
SUCK ON THAT, EMPERORS.

186
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,083
THE RED SUNS JUST SAVED GOONMA!

187
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,125
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THEM APPLES!

188
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,750
- INITIAL D.

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,083
- INITIAL D.

190
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,583
- ( people cheering )

191
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
EVEN KYOICHI COULDN'T BEAT HIM.

192
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,750
THE HELL HAPPENED OUT THERE?

193
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,666
- THAT'S A CRAZY COURSE RECORD.

194
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,708
I MEAN, I'VE WATCHED YOUR
BROTHER RACE FOR YEARS

195
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,333
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
MOVE LIKE THAT.

196
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,583
WHY WAS HE SO MUCH FASTER HERE
THAN HE USUALLY IS AT HOME?

197
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,625
- MY BROTHER'S PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT LEAVING A BIG ENOUGH

198
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,083
MARGIN OF ERROR.

199
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,708
YOU KNOW, IT KEEPS HIMSELF
OR ANYONE ELSE FROM CRASHING

200
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,583
DURING THE TIME TRIALS
THAT WE RUN.

201
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,208
WHEN HE'S PUT INTO THE
KIND OF SITUATION

202
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,583
WHERE HE'S FORCED
TO RAISE THE BAR,

203
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,083
THEN I SUPPOSE THIS
IS THE KIND OF THING

204
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,625
THAT'S JUST GONNA HAPPEN.

205
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,916
THAT EVO THREE WAS A REALLY
TOUGH OPPONENT TO GO UP AGAINST.

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,583
SO I GUESS HE GOT REALLY
SERIOUS OUT THERE TONIGHT.

207
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,458
- NOW THAT WAS A KILLER WIN!

208
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,750
- THE WAY YOU TOOK THAT
CORNER WAS UNREAL!

209
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,000
- HEY, RYOSUKE.

210
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,666
LOOK, I GOT SOMETHING
THAT I WANNA ASK YOU.

211
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,916
WE BOTH BEEN RACIN' A LONG TIME,

212
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,541
SO WHAT THE HELL IS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US?

213
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,583
WHY CAN'T I BEAT YOU?

214
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,833
I JUST DON'T GET THIS, MAN.

215
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,041
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?

216
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,416
- IN MY OPINION,

217
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,791
YOUR TECHNIQUE IS SOLID.

218
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,000
IN FACT, IT'S ALMOST
AS GOOD AS MINE.

219
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,958
- DON'T STAND THERE AND
PATRONIZE ME! JUST TELL ME WHY!

220
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,083
- THAT'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO DO, KYOICHI.

221
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,625
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT IT
ISN'T BECAUSE OF YOUR TECHNIQUE.

222
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,083
YOUR WEAKNESS IS IN
YOUR RIGHT TURN. THAT'S IT.

223
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,625
AND IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY
HAPPEN EVERY TIME, EITHER.

224
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,458
BUT I'VE NOTICED THERE ARE
A HANDFUL OF TURNS

225
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,875
WHERE YOUR WEAKNESS RISES TO THE
SURFACE AND IT CAN BE EXPLOITED.

226
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,291
- MY RIGHT TURNS?

227
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,583
- JUST TO THE RIGHT OF THE
CENTER LINE IS A DEAD ZONE

228
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,875
WHICH IS USUALLY OCCUPIED
BY OPPOSING TRAFFIC.

229
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,625
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE USED TO.

230
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,375
YOU CAN'T ATTACK A
RIGHT-HAND CORNER

231
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,500
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT A
HEAD-ON COLLISION.

232
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:38,208
IT'S COMMON, AND NO ONE CAN GIVE
IT A HUNDRED PERCENT.

233
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,458
BUT WITH ENOUGH EXPERIENCE
AND COURSE KNOWLEDGE,

234
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,625
YOU CAN COME ABOUT AS CLOSE
TO A 100% AS ANYONE CAN HOPE.

235
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,666
IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH, KYOICHI?
DO YOU GET THE DIFFERENCE NOW?

236
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,250
THEN HOW ABOUT THIS?

237
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,250
IN MOTORSPORTS, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT OPPOSING TRAFFIC.

238
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,583
THE GYMKHANA CIRCUIT DOESN'T
HAVE TWO-WAY TRAFFIC.

239
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,458
AND ON YOUR HOME COURSE, NIKKO
IROHAZAKA, IT'S ALL ONE WAY,

240
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,875
WHICH YOU KNOW
BECAUSE IT'S THE COURSE

241
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,958
YOU'RE MOST FAMILIAR WITH.

242
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,958
YOU NEVER GET THE CHANCE
TO PRACTICE.

243
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,708
I PAY ATTENTION TO YOU
ALL OF THE TIME.

244
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,041
AND IN YOUR COUNTERATTACK,

245
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,250
YOU ALWAYS STAY OUTSIDE AT
THE RIGHT-HAND CORNERS.

246
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:15,083
I READ THAT AS AN INDICATION
YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE INSIDE.

247
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,916
IN THE RACE YOU HAD
AGAINST THE EIGHT-SIX,

248
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,375
YOU SHOWED ME TOO MUCH, KYOICHI.

249
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,458
THAT'S WHY YOU LOST.

250
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,041
- ( car door closing )

251
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,833
- ( engine starting )

252
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,833
- ( tires screeching )

253
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,208
- YOU BEAT ME, RYOSUKE.

254
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,291
THE REAL ILLUSION WAS ME
THINKING I'D CAUGHT UP WITH YOU.

255
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,125
I GUESS THIS STREET CHARISMA
IS SOMETHING YOU DO HAVE.

256
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,125
- Iketani: IT WAS TOTALLY
FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE!

257
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,416
I GOT TO SEE FIRST HAND HOW
GREAT A RACER RYOSUKE TRULY IS.

258
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,958
IT OPENED MY EYES.

259
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,958
- SO I GUESS THAT VICIOUS
STORM OF LAN-EVO'S

260
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,458
THAT THREATENED OUR FAIR GUNMA,

261
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,666
IT'S STARTING TO LOOK LIKE
IT BLEW ITSELF OUT

262
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,875
AND PEACE HAS BEEN RESTORED
TO THE VALLEY.

263
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,166
-MMM-HMM. YEAH. I REALLY SHOULD
HAVE GONE TO THAT RACE.

264
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,750
BY THE WAY, DID ITSUKI AND
TAKUMI HAPPEN TO BE OUT

265
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,333
WITH YOU GUYS LAST NIGHT?

266
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,250
NO, THEY WEREN'T WITH US AND I
DIDN'T SEE THEM UP THERE EITHER.

267
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,708
MAYBE TAKUMI DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT

268
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,666
AFTER LOSING TO KYOICHI THE
NIGHT BEFORE. I WOULDN'T.

269
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,166
- YEAH I'M SURE THAT WAS IT.
I MEAN IF WE'RE STILL IN SHOCK,

270
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,041
HE'S GOTTA BE FREAKED OUT
ABOUT IT TOO

271
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,625
- BUT HE SPECIFICALLY TOLD ME
HE WASN'T GONNA GO TO AKAGI.

272
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,458
I WONDER WHAT IT WAS THAT
GOT INTO HIS HEAD

273
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,875
AND CHANGED HIS MIND.

274
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,666
- ( bell tolling )

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,375
- I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW EXCITED I AM

276
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,583
THAT RYOSUKE WON LAST NIGHT!

277
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,583
NOW IT'S OFFICIALLY,
100 PER CENT PROVEN

278
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,875
THAT GUNMA'S GOT THE HIGHEST
STANDARDS OF RACING ANYWHERE.

279
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,208
ALRIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU
IN CLASS BROTHER!

280
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,916
- ( chuckling excitedly )

281
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,291
- HEY, TAKUMI!

282
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,291
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT JUST
HAPPENED. THERE WAS THIS KID...

283
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,875
HEY, WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

284
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,250
- I'M SORRY, NATSUKI,

285
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,041
BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

286
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,333
- WHAT?

287
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,500
- Takumi: FOR REAL? YOU'RE SURE
IT WAS MY DAD'S EIGHT-SIX?

288
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,875
NO, NO WAY, THAT'S GOTTA BE
SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.

289
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,625
HE WOULD'VE TOLD ME
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

290
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,125
- BUT IT WAS JUST
A FEW DAYS AGO.

291
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,500
ONE OF OUR TEAM
MEMBERS SAID HE SAW IT

292
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,375
OUT TOOLIN' AROUND AKINA PASS.

293
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,250
- SAID IT WAS A THREE DOOR PANDA
TRUENO JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER'S.

294
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,708
- MAYBE SO, BUT I DON'T THINK
IT WAS OURS.

295
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,583
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE
YOUR DAD'S CAR IS THESE DAYS?

296
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,541
- NO, I'VE GOT NO CLUE.

297
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,375
WE HAD IT TOWED BACK FROM AKAGI.

298
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,291
AFTER THAT, MY DAD TOOK
IT SOMEPLACE,

299
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,916
I COULDN'T REALLY
TELL YOU WHERE.

300
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,333
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT
ALL YOUR MORNING DELIVERIES?

301
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,583
- I'VE GOT THIS CHEAP OLD
PICKUP TRUCK I'VE BEEN USING.

302
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,250
IT'S PRETTY CRAPPY,
BUT AT LEAST IT RUNS...

303
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,250
- THAT EIGHT-SIX IS LIKE
AN AKINA LEGEND.

304
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,041
DON'T TELL ME IT'S BEING PICKED
APART FOR SCRAP AT SOME JUNKYARD

305
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,541
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE RIGHT NOW.

306
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,291
I MIGHT JUST CRY!

307
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,375
- NO, DUDE.
I DOUBT THAT'S WHERE IT IS.

308
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,000
MY DAD WAS TELLING
ME HE WAS GONNA TRY

309
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,583
TO PUT ANOTHER ENGINE IN IT.

310
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,958
- ARE YOU SERIOUS? WHAT KIND OF
ENGINE DID HE SAY IT WAS?

311
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,375
- NO WAY HE'S JUST GONNA CRAM
ANOTHER NORMAL FOUR AG ENGINE

312
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,875
IN THAT SUCKER.

313
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,750
THAT'S LIKE BACKTRACKING.
MAYBE HE'S PUTTING IN A TURBO.

314
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,291
- I HAVE NO INTEREST IN HIM
PUTTING IN A TURBO.

315
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,000
I REALLY COULDN'T CARE LESS.

316
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,583
- WELL, WHY NOT MAN?

317
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,375
- OF EVERYTHING INSIDE A CAR,

318
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,833
WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE ENGINE
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART?

319
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,041
WITHOUT IT, YOU GOT NOTHING,
IT'S JUST A SHELL.

320
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,166
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

321
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,791
- SO IF YOU COMPARE
A CAR TO A PERSON,

322
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,125
THEN THE ENGINE IS LIKE
A PERSON'S BRAIN.

323
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,375
- UH, TAKUMI, WHEN
PEOPLE MAKE COMPARISONS

324
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,416
THEY USUALLY COMPARE THE
ENGINE TO A HEART.

325
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,958
- WAIT, WHO DOES?

326
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,916
WELL, THEN IT'S THE HEART.
WHATEVER. THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

327
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,791
THE POINT IS I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER ENGINE.

328
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,708
I'M USED TO WHAT I'VE GOT.

329
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,250
I DON'T WANT IT TO
FEEL LIKE I'M DRIVING

330
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,416
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CAR.

331
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,541
- OKAY.
I GUESS I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

332
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,791
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY REALLY
ATTACHED TO THAT THING.

333
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,833
- I DIG HOW YOU'RE FEELIN' MAN.
MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME, TOO.

334
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,166
WE JUST CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER

335
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,750
WHAT KIND OF AN
ENGINE IT'LL HAVE,

336
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,833
WHEN YOUR DAD'S DONE WITH ALL
HIS TINKERIN' AROUND WITH IT.

337
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,291
COULD BE SWEET.

338
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,750
- ( engines accelerating )

339
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,416
- ( tires screeching )

340
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,958
- SO BUNTA, WHAT'S THE VERDICT?

341
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,583
- I FEEL IT GETTING BETTER
EACH TIME I DRIVE IT.

342
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,916
ONLY PROBLEM IS,

343
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,583
THE ENGINE'S SO GOOD THE
SUSPENSION CAN'T CATCH UP.

344
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,375
- IT'S THAT GOOD OF AN ENGINE.
PRETTY NICE.

345
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,666
- GOTTA SAY, I'M IN LOVE.

346
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,416
- STOP IT, BUNTA,
YOU'RE REALLY TEMPTING ME HERE.

347
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,125
I MAY NEED TO JUMP
IN THERE WITH YOU

348
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,583
NEXT TIME YOU TAKE
HER FOR A SPIN.

349
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,375
- WHADDYA SAY?
- ( exhales )

350
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,291
I DUNNO, SHE'S SCARY.

351
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,791
- HUH? OH, COME ON,
GIVE ME A BREAK.

352
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,791
YOU'RE PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR HERE.

353
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,333
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
HOW SCARY YOUR DRIVING CAN BE.

354
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,333
I'VE BEEN THERE.

355
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,750
- WANT ME TO PROVE IT TO YOU?
TAKE A LOOK.

356
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,250
- WHOA. WHAT HAPPENED?

357
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,833
- HOW DID YOU GET THAT?

358
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,416
- LEANING ON MY SHIN.
IT HURT LIKE HELL, BUT I HAD TO.

359
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,791
IT WAS EVERYTHING I COULD DO
TO KEEP UPRIGHT.

360
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,541
I USED TO THINK THAT THE SIDE
G-FORCE IN PASS RACING

361
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,583
WASN'T WORTHY OF A BUCKET SEAT.

362
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,375
I DO NOW.

363
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,583
THIS BRUISING'LL GO ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO MY BONES

364
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,125
IF WE DON'T PUT ONE IN BEFORE
I GO OUT AGAIN.

365
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,125
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
I'VE HAD ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

366
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,375
THIS NEW ENGINE IS
ONE TOUGH CUSTOMER.

367
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,583
BUT I WILL ADMIT, IT DOES MAKE
IT ALL THE MORE EXCITING.

368
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,958
STILL HAVEN'T DECIDED HOW
I'M GONNA SET HER UP THOUGH.

369
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,416
I MIGHT TAKE MY TIME
AND ENJOY IT SOME.

370
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,416
SHE'S A SWEET LADY,
IF A LITTLE ROUGH.

371
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,916
COURSE, I GOTTA
CONSIDER TAKUMI'S GONNA BE

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,500
DRIVING HER TOO, AND HE CAN BE
A LITTLE INEPT.

373
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,083
- HE CALLED TAKUMI INEPT?

374
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,666
HE'S JOKING, RIGHT?
TAKUMI'S A GENIUS.

375
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,250
- I CAN'T WAIT TILL WE GRADUATE.

376
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,916
ANYTHING IS BETTER
THAN HIGH SCHOOL.

377
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,291
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

378
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,750
- I DO. I CAN'T WAIT TO START
WORKING A REAL JOB.

379
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,000
UNTIL YOU GOT A JOB,
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT ANOTHER KID

380
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,875
WHO'S STILL LIVING
WITH HIS PARENTS.

381
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,083
I WANNA MAKE MY OWN MONEY,
BE SELF-SUFFICIENT.

382
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,458
WITH A GOOD JOB, I COULD FINALLY
AFFORD MY OWN CAR

383
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,125
AND DO WHATEVER I WANTED TO DO.

384
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:24,333
I CAN'T BUY ANYTHING ON MY OWN
NOW. IT'S BORDERLINE PATHETIC.

385
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,833
- I THINK MAYBE YOU NEED TO HAVE
A LITTLE MORE PATIENCE.

386
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,416
WE'RE GRADUATING NEXT SPRING.

387
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,708
AFTER THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
YOU WANT. JUST WAIT 'TIL THEN.

388
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,750
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I CAN WAIT ANYMORE.

389
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,541
THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME AT SCHOOL
THAT'S WORTH ANY OF MY TIME.

390
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,875
KINDA SEEMS TO ME LIKE
SOMETHING'S BUGGIN YOU, MAN.

391
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,291
WHAT'S UP?

392
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,875
- WAIT!

393
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,750
TAKUMI, WHY HAVE YOU BEEN
AVOIDING ME SO MUCH LATELY?

394
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,583
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG OR
WAS IT MAYBE SOMETHING I SAID?

395
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,000
I'M GOING CRAZY
THINKING ABOUT IT.

396
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,500
JUST TELL ME WHAT I DID
AND I'LL APOLOGIZE.

397
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,458
- YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

398
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,291
- THEN, WHAT'S WRONG?
- NOTHING IS WRONG.

399
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,250
- SOMETHING'S OBVIOUSLY
BOTHERING YOU.

400
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,250
WE WERE FINE UNTIL RECENTLY,
THEN YOU, LIKE, TURNED OFF.

401
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,041
SUDDENLY YOU'RE MR. DISTANT.

402
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,541
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

403
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,750
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU, TAKUMI?

404
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,333
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO WORKED UP

405
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,750
ABOUT SOME IDIOT LIKE ME.

406
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,125
I'M NOTHING SPECIAL.

407
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,750
AND NONE OF IT SHOULD REALLY
MATTER ANYWAY, RIGHT?

408
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,166
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
LIKE WE WERE EVEN

409
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,666
OFFICIALLY DATING OR ANYTHING.

410
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,125
- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND,
BUT YOU'RE NOT MAKING SENSE!

411
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,291
YOU'RE LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON!

412
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,708
- JUST STOP FOLLOWING ME.

413
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,500
OH, AND GOOD LUCK WITH
YOUR BUDDY IN THE MERCEDES.

414
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,416
NOW LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE.

415
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,083
- NO. HOW DID HE FIND OUT?

416
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,958
- ( theme song playing )

417
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

418
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,958
- Announcer: THE EIGHT-SIX IS
BACK AND THE BIG QUESTION IS,

419
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,750
HOW POWERFUL IS IT NOW?

420
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,208
NEXT ON INITIAL D, SECOND STAGE.

421
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,458
"THE NEW EIGHT-SIX."
DON'T MISS IT!
