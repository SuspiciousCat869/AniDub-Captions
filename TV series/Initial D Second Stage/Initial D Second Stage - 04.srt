00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:54,125
- I SWEAR, IT'S LIKE THIS
EVERY TIME TAKUMI RACES.

8
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,750
THERE'S TENSION IN THE AIR
AND EVERYONE'S ON EDGE.

9
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,166
SOMETIMES I GIVE UP HOPE
FOR HIM DURING THE RACE.

10
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,416
BUT HE ALWAYS PULLS OUT A WIN.

11
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,125
IKETANI AND KENJI KEEP SAYING
THAT TAKUMI DOESN'T HAVE

12
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:12,541
A CHANCE IN HELL OF BEATING
OUT A LAN-EVO.

13
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,125
I WONDER IF THEY'RE
RIGHT THIS TIME.

14
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,583
I MEAN, HE IS UNDEFEATED.

15
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,458
EVERYONE WHO'S EVER
CHALLENGED HIM HAS ENDED UP

16
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,500
BECOMING ONE OF HIS VICTIMS.

17
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,666
NOW I CAN'T PROVE THIS
BUT I HAVE A FEELING

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,416
LIKE HE'S GONNA WIN
AGAIN TONIGHT TOO!

19
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,500
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
COME OVER ME

20
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,916
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M
FEELIN' REALLY HOPEFUL.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,125
YOU GOTTA PROVE ME RIGHT
TONIGHT, MAN!

22
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,083
- I NEVER IMAGINED AN
EIGHT-SIX COULD ACTUALLY

23
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,250
PUT UP A FIGHT AGAINST ME.

24
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,750
JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW
UNPREDICTABLE

25
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,625
THE DOWNHILL CAN BE.

26
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,541
- SO FAST. THAT CAR
IS INCREDIBLE.

27
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,916
- HEY, WAIT, KEISUKE,
THERE'S STILL ONE THING

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,083
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
UNDERSTANDING HERE.

29
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,708
- WHAT'S THAT?

30
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,208
- EVEN IF HE IS CAPABLE
OF STICKIN' TO SEIJI'S BUMPER

31
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,583
LIKE SUPER GLUE,

32
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,041
IT STILL DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT THAT HE'S OUT THERE

33
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,625
DRIVIN' AN INFERIOR CAR.

34
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,041
I UNDERSTAND THAT GOIN'
DOWNHILL MINIMIZES

35
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,625
THE POWER DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE TWO,

36
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,500
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW IN
HELL THAT COULD MAKE

37
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,875
THE EIGHT-SIX ANY MORE POWERFUL.

38
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,708
HE'S MUCH SLOWER
ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS,

39
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,291
AND SINCE THEY'RE ABOUT
EQUALLY SKILLED TECHNIQUE-WISE,

40
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,458
I CAN'T SEE HOW HE COULD EVER

41
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,666
GET AHEAD OF THE LAN-EVO
THROUGH A CORNER.

42
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,375
AND IF HE CAN'T MAKE A PASS,
HE HAS NO CHANCE OF WINNING.

43
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,583
- JUST BE PATIENT.

44
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,750
THEN I WON'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN A THING.

45
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,041
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP YOUR EYES
PEELED ON THAT CORNER

46
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,083
YOUR QUESTION WILL BE ANSWERED.

47
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,500
- I DON'T KNOW.

48
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,916
I JUST DON'T SEE IT HAPPENIN'.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

49
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,958
- HE SEEMS TO SHORTEN
THE GAP RIGHT BEFORE

50
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,750
WE ENTER EACH CORNER.

51
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,166
PART OF THAT'S MY FAULT SINCE MY
FRONT TIRES ARE LOSING PRESSURE.

52
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,083
I NEED TO QUIT STRESSIN' OUT.

53
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,541
I MEAN IT'S AN EIGHT-SIX!

54
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,416
IT ACCELERATES ABOUT AS FAST
AS SAP OUT OF A TREE,

55
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,208
AND I CAN ALWAYS PULL AWAY FROM
HIM ONCE I'M THROUGH THE TURN.

56
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,750
IT PAYS TO BE
IN THE LEAD, KYOICHI.

57
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:51,375
AND UNLESS I MAKE A BONEHEADED
MISTAKE, THIS RACE IS MINE.

58
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,750
- MAN, HE'S FAST.

59
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,208
AS FAR AS ACCELERATION
AFTER A TURN IS CONCERNED,

60
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,458
HE'S THE FASTEST
I'VE EVER RACED.

61
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,583
I CAN'T STICK WITH HIM ANYMORE.
HE'S GOT TOO MUCH POWER.

62
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,166
I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS TENSE
DURING A RACE BEFORE.

63
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,291
- ( tires screeching )

64
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,416
- EVEN WHEN I'M USING THE DITCH
TURN, I'M STILL FALLIN' BEHIND.

65
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,416
IN ORDER TO OFFSET
MY POOR ACCELERATION,

66
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,875
I'M GONNA HAVE TO COME
OUT OF THE TURNS

67
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,625
AT A MUCH FASTER PACE THAN HIM.

68
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:38,208
THEN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH
UP BEFORE THE NEXT CORNER.

69
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,375
I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE TO USE
THE SAME STRATEGY I DID

70
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,250
AGAINST RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

71
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:47,750
ANOTHER DITCH TURN FOR FASTER
SPEED TO EXIT OUT OF THE CORNER.

72
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:51,083
THE TURN JUST BEFORE THE BRIDGE
IS WHERE I'LL MAKE MY MOVE.

73
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,916
I WONDER IF I'LL BE ABLE
TO CATCH THE DITCH

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,875
AT THE RIGHT ANGLE IF I GO INTO
THE TURN AT TOP SPEED.

75
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,791
I ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE
TO NAIL IT!

76
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT I FEEL DIFFERENT TONIGHT.

77
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,708
- THEY'RE COMING!

78
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,166
- I CAN HEAR THEM.

79
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,791
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE JUST
ABOUT TO ROUND THE CORNER.

80
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,791
- HONESTLY, I'M NOT ENTIRELY
SURE THE EIGHT-SIX

81
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,583
CAN ACTUALLY PASS THE EVO-FOUR

82
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,750
AND KEEP THE LEAD
UNTIL THE FINISH.

83
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,916
I KNOW IT'S SELFISH BUT I WANNA
BELIEVE THAT NO ONE CAN BEAT

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,375
THIS KID SINCE HE WAS ABLE TO
KNOCK OFF MY OWN BROTHER.

85
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,291
NOW DON'T LOSE!

86
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,875
I PROMISE, I'LL NEVER
FORGIVE YOU IF YOU DROP A RACE

87
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,875
BEFORE WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE
OUR REMATCH.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,208
- THE EIGHT-SIX IS LOSING!

89
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,416
- ( chuckles )

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,166
- NOW!

91
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,791
- I DID IT!
I GOT THIS IN THE BAG!

92
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,333
WHERE THE HELL DID HE GO?

93
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,875
NO FREAKIN' WAY!

94
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,458
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

95
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,250
HE CAUGHT UP WITH THE EVO-FOUR
COMING OUT OF THAT LAST TURN!

96
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,333
- HOW HOW DID HE DO THAT? WHOA!

97
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,833
- IT'S OVER.

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,250
- HE TOOK THE INSIDE.

99
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,166
THE KID'S DRIVIN'
A PIECE OF JUNK.

100
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,000
HOW DID HE GET
THAT MUCH ACCELERATION?

101
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,166
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!

102
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,958
SONUVABITCH! I'M LOSING CONTROL
OF MY TIRES!

103
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,958
DAMN IT, NO!

104
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,583
- NOW THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE
MOVE, DUDE.

105
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,833
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?

106
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,583
- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

107
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,250
'CAUSE THE RACE IS OVER.

108
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,083
IN FACT IT WAS ALREADY OVER
WHEN HE PULLED ALONGSIDE

109
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,250
THE EVO-FOUR OUTTA
THAT LAST TURN.

110
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,208
SEIJI HAS NO CHANCE
OF PASSING HIM NOW.

111
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,958
- OH MAN, HE SHOWED UP SEIJI
BIG TIME!

112
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,791
YOU ARE UNREAL, TAKUMI.

113
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,416
- Boy: HE REALLY DID IT!

114
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,166
- WHO'D OF THOUGHT AKINA'S
EIGHT SIX WOULD BE THE ONE

115
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,500
TO END TEAM
EMPEROR'S SWEEP!

116
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,083
- DUDE, THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

117
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,833
HE ACTUALLY BEAT A LAN-EVO!

118
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,208
- YEAH, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

119
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,583
- I WON BUT IT SURE
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT.

120
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,083
IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S ON AKINA?

121
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,208
I KNEW EXACTLY WHERE
I NEEDED TO ATTACK

122
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,000
AND WHICH CORNERS TO USE
THE DITCH TURN.

123
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,458
ON ANY OTHER PASS,
I WOULD'VE LOST.

124
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,625
- SORRY KYOICHI.

125
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,916
- DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA OF WHY

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,916
I'M SO ANGRY WITH YOU
RIGHT NOW, SEIJI?

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,750
DO YOU? I WANNA HEAR YOU
SAY IT YOURSELF.

128
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,875
SO GO AHEAD AND TELL YOUR
TEAMMATES WHY YOU JUST LOST.

129
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,416
NO REASON.

130
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,208
I JUST COULDN'T SHAKE
THE BASTARD OFF MY TAIL.

131
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,833
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW THAT EIGHT-SIX

132
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,416
WAS ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH ME.

133
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,416
I DUNNO, MAYBE IT WAS
JUST HIS TECHNIQUE.

134
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,916
ANYWAY I COULDN'T TELL YOU
EXACTLY HOW HE DID IT.

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,833
'COURSE NOT. IT'S NOT EASY
STUDYING YOUR ENEMY

136
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,500
FROM THE REARVIEW MIRROR.

137
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,750
HAD YOU STAYED CLOSE BEHIND HIM
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE

138
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,791
TO FIND HIS WEAKNESS.

139
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,583
WHY THE HELL DO YOU THINK
I TOLD YOU TO RUN

140
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,083
WITH SIMULATION THREE?

141
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,541
BUT YOU REFUSED TO LISTEN
AND BECAUSE OF YOUR STUBBORNNESS

142
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,833
YOU SUFFERED A HUMILIATING LOSS.

143
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,375
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP
ACTING LIKE A DAMN MONKEY IDIOT

144
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,833
AND START USING YOUR HEAD?

145
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,416
- LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

146
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,791
- SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO
NOW, KYOICHI?

147
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,750
- OUR PLANS OF SWEEPING GUNMA
ARE NO LONGER A POSSIBILITY.

148
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,541
BUT THE LAST THING
WE'RE GONNA DO IS RUN AWAY

149
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,166
WITH OUR TAIL BETWEEN OUR LEGS.

150
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,208
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL
GONNA HAVE TO SUCK IT UP

151
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,916
AND HEAD OUT TO AKAGI NEXT.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
- RED SUNS?

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,166
- MY PLANS HAVEN'T CHANGED.

154
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,458
I'M STILL GUNNIN'
FOR RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

155
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,541
IF WE CAN PULL OUT A VICTORY
WIN IN AKAGI, I'LL BE SATISFIED.

156
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,666
I'M ALREADY SICK OF LOSING.

157
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,416
- WHAT ABOUT THE EIGHT-SIX?
AREN'T WE GONNA TRY AND REMATCH?

158
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,708
- WE HAVE PRIDE IN OUR TEAM.

159
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,250
WE CAN'T JUST ACCEPT
A DEFEAT TO THAT TEENAGER.

160
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:17,750
- SHUT UP! I KNOW ALL ABOUT
PRIDE BUT MY DECISION STANDS.

161
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,916
LEAVE HIM TO ME, I'LL HANDLE IT.

162
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,708
I'M THE ONE WHO'S MOST UPSET
ABOUT THIS LOSS.

163
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,583
THEY HAVE NO IDEA.

164
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,708
- OH MAN, LAST NIGHT
WAS FRIGGIN' SATISFYING!

165
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,916
SERIOUSLY I THINK THAT WAS
THE MOST EXCITED I'VE EVER BEEN!

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,416
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE
GUY IN THE EVO-FOUR

167
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,458
WITH HIS LAME-ASS PONYTAIL

168
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,916
TRASH TALKED US AT THE LAKE?

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,625
HE WAS SAYIN' ALL,
"ANYONE IN AN EIGHT-SIX

170
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,750
AIN'T WORTHY OF MY TIME"

171
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,291
OR SOME CRAP LIKE THAT.

172
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,041
AH DUDE I SO WISH I COULD'VE
RUBBED IT IN HIS FACE MYSELF.

173
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,166
WHAT DO YOU THINK TAKUMI?

174
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,958
WASN'T BEATIN' THAT
JERK THE SWEETEST?

175
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,500
- IT REALLY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
FOR ME AT ALL.

176
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,833
- HUH? WELL, WHY THE HELL NOT?

177
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,291
- THESE PAST FEW WEEKS I'VE BEEN
MULLING OVER AN IDEA IN MY HEAD.

178
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,708
THEN LAST NIGHT IT BECAME
OBVIOUS TO ME.

179
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,666
I DON'T LIKE RACING IN AKINA.

180
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,166
IN FACT, I THINK I'M DONE HERE.

181
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,875
- FUNNY. YOU EVER NOTICE EVERY
TIME YOU THINK TOO HARD,

182
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,375
NOTHIN' GOOD COMES OF IT?

183
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,458
SO, TELL ME,
WHAT'S YOUR BEEF WITH AKINA?

184
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:12,000
- EVEN THOUGH I CAME IN FIRST
I DON'T THINK I WON LAST NIGHT.

185
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,291
TO ME IT FEELS LIKE A LOSS.

186
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,041
- TAKUMI, HOLD UP!
WHAT ARE YOU SO UPSET FOR?

187
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,958
- I'M NOT UPSET,
AND TALKING ABOUT IT

188
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,125
SURE ISN'T GONNA SOLVE ANYTHING.

189
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,750
I'M THROUGH
WITH RACING IN AKINA.

190
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,708
I'M GONNA BEGIN FOCUSING
ON OTHER TRACKS NOW,

191
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,500
EVEN IF IT MEANS A DEFEAT.

192
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,083
- ( bell tolling )

193
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,166
- AGAIN?

194
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,958
- Initial D!

195
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,583
- Initial D!

196
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,875
- TAKUMI! I'VE BEEN LOOKIN'
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU!

197
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,458
I GOT SOME BIG NEWS DUDE!

198
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,083
THERE'S GONNA BE AN AWESOME
RACE IN AKAGI THIS WEEKEND!

199
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,791
TEAM EMPEROR AND THE RED SUNS
ARE GONNA GO HEAD-TO-HEAD!

200
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,625
IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING!
WE CAN'T MISS IT!

201
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,625
WORD ON THE STREET IS THE GUY
WITH THE BLACK LAN-EVO

202
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,083
IS GONNA BE DRIVIN'
FOR TEAM EMPEROR.

203
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,000
AND YOUR OLD BUDDY
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI

204
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,166
WILL BE GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL

205
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,125
FOR THE RED SUNS!

206
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,583
UH, DUDE, DID YOU EVEN HEAR
A WORD I JUST SAID?

207
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,625
HEY WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON
WITH YOU MAN?

208
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,166
- NOTHING.

209
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,125
- JUST LOOK AT HIM.

210
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,250
ANY TIME HE SEEMS
ALL SPACED OUT LIKE THAT,

211
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,333
IT USUALLY MEANS HE'S THINKIN'
REALLY HARD ABOUT SOMETHIN'.

212
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,500
- I'M NOT SO SURE.

213
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,500
I THINK THAT'S GIVIN' HIM
TOO MUCH CREDIT.

214
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,166
MOST OF THE TIME WHEN HE LOOKS
SPACED OUT, HE'S JUST THAT.

215
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,291
SPACED OUT.

216
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,125
THINKIN' ABOUT NOTHIN'.

217
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,916
- I CAN SEE THAT.
SO WHAT DO YA THINK HE IS TODAY?

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,458
- UH, I HAVE NO IDEA.

219
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,125
ALL I KNOW IS HE'S BEEN
ACTING WEIRD LATELY.

220
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,875
LOOK, IT'S A BLACK EVO-THREE!

221
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,083
- HEY, IS THAT HIM?

222
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,958
- HOLY CRAP IT IS HIM!
- EMPEROR!

223
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,041
SO, UH, I HAVE A PROPOSITION
FOR YA.

224
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,791
YOU AND ME I IN
A ONE-ON-ONE RACE IN AKAGI.

225
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,791
- WHOA! HE JUST CHALLENGED HIM!

226
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,416
NO. IT'S ANYTHING
BUT A CHALLENGE

227
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,083
BUT I DON'T EXPECT YOU TWO
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

228
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,166
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER

229
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,625
BUT I SAID SOMETHING
TO YOU THAT DAY

230
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,458
WHEN WE FIRST MET
DOWN BY THE LAKE.

231
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,666
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF TALENT

232
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,000
BUT AS LONG AS YOU STICK
WITH THAT EIGHT-SIX

233
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,416
YOUR CHANCES OF ADVANCING
ARE SLIM TO NONE.

234
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,125
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU EXACTLY
WHAT I MEANT WHEN I SAID THAT.

235
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,291
IF YOU AGREE, YOU'LL
LEARN MORE ABOUT RACING

236
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,041
THEN YOU'VE EVER LEARNED IN
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

237
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,583
COME OVER TO AKAGI
EITHER TODAY OR TOMORROW.

238
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,041
IT'S UP TO YOU.

239
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,833
I'LL FIT IN A QUICK RACE
BEFORE MY BIG MATCHUP

240
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,583
WITH THE RED SUNS.

241
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,708
UNLIKE THE AKINA RACES
YOU'RE USED TO,

242
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,083
I CAN ALL BUT PROMISE THIS'LL
BE A QUICK DEFEAT FOR YOU.

243
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,250
BUT IN THAT DEFEAT YOU'LL LEARN
MORE ABOUT YOURSELF

244
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,583
THAN ANY WIN ON YOUR HOME TURF.

245
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,333
IF YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M GETTIN' AT,

246
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,791
THEN I'LL BE SEEING YOU SOON.

247
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,958
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY.

248
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,875
- WHAT A BUNCH'A BULL CRAP!
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS?

249
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,875
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A THING
HE SAYS. HEAR ME?

250
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,750
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

251
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,458
- HE WAS TRYIN' TO ACT
ALL COOL WITH YOU,

252
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,250
BUT YOU KNOW HE JUST WANTED
TO GET REVENGE

253
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,750
FOR BEATING HIS BUDDY
LAST NIGHT.

254
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,416
- THAT'S TOTALLY WHAT HE WANTS!

255
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,541
- MAYBE. BUT IT'S
NOT A BAD OFFER

256
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,416
SINCE I'VE DECIDED NOT TO
RACE IN AKINA ANYMORE.

257
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,166
- HUH?

258
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,750
- THE THING IS IF AKAGI
WEREN'T SO CROWDED

259
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,708
BECAUSE OF THE EMPEROR-RED
SUNS CHALLENGE,

260
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,791
THEN I WOULD PROBABLY
JUST TAKE HIM UP ON IT.

261
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,375
- FOR REAL?

262
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,375
- I MEAN, I'D HATE FOR HIM TO
THINK I'M CHICKENING OUT OF IT,

263
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,458
BUT I'M GONNA PASS.

264
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,333
- ( tires screeching )

265
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,541
- I SAW SOMETHING AMAZING
LAST NIGHT, BUNTA.

266
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:53,250
IT WAS YOUR SON SCHOOLIN' SOME
GUY IN A TRICKED UP EVO-FOUR.

267
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,041
IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
HOW GOOD HE IS RIGHT NOW,

268
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,458
THIS ENGINE DOESN'T HAVE
MUCH LIFE LEFT IN IT.

269
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,875
- WELL, I'M SURE
IT'LL BLOW SOONER OR LATER.

270
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,291
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO THEN?

271
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,250
YOU SAID YOU'D REPLACE IT
AS SOON AS HE LOST A RACE

272
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,500
BUT FROM WHAT I SAW LAST NIGHT,

273
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,416
THAT AIN'T HAPPENIN'
ANYTIME SOON.

274
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,416
- TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I NEVER
EXPECTED HIM TO STAY UNDEFEATED

275
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,083
FOR THIS LONG OF A STRETCH.

276
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,125
I MEAN, WHAT CAN I DO,
THE KID REFUSES TO LOSE.

277
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,166
SO THE QUESTION IS,
WHICH GOES FIRST?

278
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,000
THE ENGINE
OR HIS WINNING STREAK?

279
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,541
WHATEVER HAPPENS, JUST KNOW THAT
THE NEW ENGINE'S READY TO GO

280
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,250
WHENEVER YOU ARE.

281
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,333
- GOOD.

282
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,833
- THAT NOTE.

283
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,083
IT TOTALLY TRASHED NATSUKI.

284
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,958
SAYING SHE'S DATING SOME OLDER
GUY WHO DRIVES A MERCEDES.

285
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,000
IF THAT'S TRUE
THEN WHY'D SHE KISS ME?

286
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,458
- ( cell phone ringing )

287
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,666
- HELLO?

288
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,666
- SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO
WAY YOU COULD CHANGE YOUR MIND?

289
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,791
- SHE'S AT A RESTAURANT
OVER NEAR MAEBASHI?

290
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,791
DAMN IT. IF YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO GO, THEN I WILL.

291
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,291
DAD, MIND IF I USE THE CAR?
I NEED TO RUN AN ERRAND.

292
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,291
- SURE.

293
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,791
- ( engine starts )

294
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,708
- I CAN'T GET THIS
OUT OF MY HEAD.

295
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,583
THE HARDER I TRY TO FORGET
ABOUT IT, THE MORE I OBSESS.

296
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,916
IT'S SO IRRITATING.

297
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,500
MAYBE IT PROVES HOW STRONG
MY FEELINGS ARE FOR HER.

298
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,375
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT'S SILLY,

299
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,958
JUST THIS ONCE,
I'LL FALL FOR IT.

300
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,125
WELL, I'M HERE.

301
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,041
A MERCEDES.

302
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,583
THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING, PAPA.

303
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,958
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING SO COOL
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

304

315
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,791
- PRETTY GOOD, KYOICHI. I'M
READY TO KICK SOME ASS TONIGHT.

316
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,083
SPENT THE WHOLE DAY GOIN' OVER
A BULLETPROOF STRATEGY

317
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,666
FOR THIS COURSE.

318
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,250
I GOTTA SAY THE RED SUNS SURE
KNOW HOW TO GET ON YOUR NERVES.

319
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,958
COULDN'T GET AROUND
A SINGLE CHECKPOINT

320
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,291
WITHOUT SEEIN' ONE OF
'EM MARKIN' DOWN MY TIMES.

321
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,958
- LOOK, JUST IGNORE THEM.

322
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,125
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE EVERY
LITTLE NUANCE OF THE COURSE

323
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,666
PERFECTLY MEMORIZED,

324
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,625
THE BASIC STRATEGY
WILL BE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME

325
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,666
FOR ANY PASS YOU'RE ON.

326
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,916
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THE KID GONNA SHOW UP TONIGHT?

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,416
- WHO THE HELL KNOWS?

328
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,166
IF I WERE A BETTIN' MAN I'D SAY
THERE'S ABOUT A 40% CHANCE

329
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,083
HE'S ACTUALLY GONNA SHOW HIS
FACE HERE ON THE PASS TONIGHT.

330
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,791
IT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK
OUT A LOT BETTER FOR US

331
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,375
IF HE DID COME.

332
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,666
THE TRUTH IS I WANNA PUT THESE
ANNOYING LITTLE CHORES BEHIND US

333
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,166
BEFORE I GO UP AGAINST
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

334
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,541
- YEAH. EVEN THOUGH I HAD
A HICCUP LAST TIME,

335
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,250
WE STILL HAVE TO DOMINATE GUNMA.

336
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,333
- ONCE I DESTROY RYOSUKE,
WE'RE DONE WITH GUNMA.

337
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,958
BUT I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT
THAT I WON'T BE GETTING

338
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,916
MUCH SLEEP KNOWIN' WE LET ONE
SLIP AWAY ON MOUNT AKINA.

339
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,541
THAT'S WHY I NEED TO
COME OUT SWINGIN'

340
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,166
AND TAKE THE EIGHT-SIX DOWN NOW,

341
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,791
SO I CAN HAVE ENOUGH
TIME TO PREPARE

342
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,291
FOR THE REAL BATTLE
AGAINST RYOSUKE.

343
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,708
- ( tires screeching )

344
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,791
- TONIGHT JUST GOT
MORE INTERESTING. IT'S HIM!

345
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,583
- WONDER WHAT HE'S DOIN'
IN AKAGI.

346
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

347
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,541
- Announcer: SHOCKING EVERYONE,
TAKUMI STORMS INTO AKAGI

348
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,083
TO FACE AN EPIC BATTLE

349
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,250
AGAINST THE EVO-THREE WHILE
THE TAKAHASHI BROTHERS LOOK ON.

350
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:19,458
WHO WILL WIN? NEXT ON
INITIAL D, SECOND STAGE.

351
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,958
COUNTDOWN TO DESTRUCTION.
DON'T MISS IT.
