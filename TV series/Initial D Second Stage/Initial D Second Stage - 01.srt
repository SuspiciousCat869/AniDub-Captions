- DAMN! THERE'S NO WAY
ANY OUTSIDER'S ROLLIN' OVER ME!

18
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,083
- FISH IN A BARREL.

19
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,958
- ( exclaims )

20
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,666
- OH NO.

21
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,416
- ( exclaims ) NO WAY!
HE'S TOO FAST!

22
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,041
- THIS IS SUCH A LOAD OF CRAP!

23
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,625
- IT'S THE SAME KINDA THING
FIGHTER PILOTS USED TO DO

24
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,791
WHEN THEY SHOT DOWN
OTHER PLANES.

25
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,500
LOOKS PRETTY SHARP, HUH?

26
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:31,250
IN A MONTH YOU'RE GONNA SEE TEAM
EMPEROR RULING ALL OF GUNMA.

27
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,750
WE'RE KNOWN AS THE KINGS
OF THE MOUNTAIN PASSES.

28
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,916
- Itsuki: HEY, TAKUMI.
- YEAH.

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,750
- YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN? AS I'M
GETTIN' USED TO MY EIGHT-FIVE,

30
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,083
I JUST KEEP THINKIN' THAT IT'S
PATHETICALLY SLOW ON THE UPHILL.

31
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,000
I WANNA SQUEEZE MORE POWER
OUT OF IT.

32
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,916
- MM-HMM.

33
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,083
- MAYBE ADDING A TURBO CHARGER.

34
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,416
CAN YOU IMAGINE
ONE OF THOSE IN MY LEVIN.

35
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,750
THAT SUCKER'LL BLOW
THE SOCKS OFF

36
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,541
OF THE DRIVERS
AROUND HERE, DUDE.

37
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,416
- REALLY? A TURBO
CAN DO THAT NOW?

38
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO
ALREADY BE PUT IN

39
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,083
WHEN YOU BOUGHT THE CAR.

40
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,875
'FACTORY READY'
OR WHATEVER IT'S CALLED.

41
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,250
- WELL YEAH, BUT YOU CAN
GET THESE THINGS

42
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,791
CALLED BOLT-ON TURBO KITS.

43
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,416
YOU JUST HOOK 'EM UP TO
YOUR CAR WHENEVER YOU WANNA.

44
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,125
IF YOU WANT SOME EXTRA 'UMPH',

45
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,416
THE TURBO IS THE
EASIEST WAY TO GET IT.

46
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,458
JUST THINK, MY EIGHT-FIVE
WITH AN AWESOME TURBOCHARGER.

47
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,125
SCREECHIN' DOWN
A STRAIGHT COURSE

48
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,208
AS FAST AS ANY S-THIRTEEN
OR ONE-EIGHTY.

49
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,333
EVERY PERSON WITH EYES
WOULD BE DROOLIN' LIKE BABIES.

50
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,916
( laughs )

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,708
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT IS ENOUGH
TO GET ME FIRED UP.

52
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,833
- GET OVER, ITSUKI. SOMEONE'S
COMIN' UP BEHIND YOU REAL FAST.

53
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,583
- ( Itsuki exclaims )

54
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,125
- NO, DUDE, THE OTHER WAY!

55
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,541
- A LAN-EVO!
- A WHAT?

56
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,000
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT CAR?
IT MOVES SO STRANGELY.

57
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,833
- DID YOU SEE THAT?
IT'S INSTANT ACCELERATION, MAN!

58
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,708
THAT'S SOME KINDA CRAZY FAST!
- YEAH.

59
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,625
- THE ENGINE'S ONLY GOT 2000 CC,
BUT IT'S GOT 280 HORSEPOWER.

60
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,916
THAT'S THE POWER OF TURBO.

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,875
NOT TO MENTION
ITS KILLER FOUR WHEEL DRIVE.

62
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,875
- I SEE NOW. THAT MOVEMENT
COMES FROM THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE.

63
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,250
IT'S THE DISTRIBUTION ACROSS
THOSE FOUR TIRES

64
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,541
THAT GIVES THE
HANDLING AND POWER

65
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,000
TWO TIRES JUST CAN'T GIVE YOU.

66
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,458
- Seiji: MY EVO FOUR
IS SUCH A BEAUT

67
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,500
THAT I'D MARRY HER
IF SHE WAS A CHICK.

68
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,791
SHE'S A PREFECT EXAMPLE OF

69
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,000
WHAT THE PURSUIT OF PERFECT
DRIVING FUNCTIONALITY

70
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,541
CAN LEAD TO.

71
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,083
IT'S JUST LIKE THAT SEASONED
PRIZE-FIGHTER WHO SPENT YEARS

72
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:57,416
SCULPTING OUT THE PERFECT BODY.
THE AIR DUCTS ON THE FRONT.

73
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,458
PROTRUDING BLISTER PACKING.
THE OVERSIZED REAR WING.

74
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,083
EVERYTHING'S IN
JUST THE RIGHT SPOT.

75
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,375
THE LAN-EVO WAS DESIGNED FROM
DRAWING BOARD TO FACTORY FLOOR

76
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,083
TO WIN WORLD-CLASS TOURNAMENTS.

77
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,250
THAT'S HER
ONE AND ONLY FUNCTION.

78
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,916
- HIGH-POWERED TURBO
AND FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,583
MARRIED FOR PERFECTION.

80
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,750
NO CAR'S FULLY COMPLETE
WITHOUT THE TWO OF THEM

81
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,541
WORKING IN TANDEM.

82
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:22,250
- THE LAN-EVO'S THE FASTEST
STREET RACER, PERIOD.

83
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,541
SO, KYOUICHI, WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO FINISHIN' OFF

84
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,666
ALL OF THE OTHER FR PUNKS
GUNMA'S HOLDING?

85
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,125
- THAT LAN-EVO IS RIGHT OVER
THERE. I DON'T LIKE THIS.

86
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,875
THINK THEY'RE FROM ANOTHER TEAM?

87
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,375
- DUDE, CHILL OUT, ALRIGHT?

88
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,458
I'M GONNA GO GRAB A COFFEE
FROM THE VENDING MACHINE.

89
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,458
DO YOU WANT ONE?

90
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,291
- YEAH! IF YOU DON'T MIND.
THANKS!

91
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,666
( gasps)

92
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,666
HE'S WALKING OVER TO ME.

93
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,500
- HEY!

94
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,750
- I NEED SOME DIRECTIONS, KID.

95
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,333
- OH. SO WHERE ARE YOU GOIN'?

96
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,916
GO THAT WAY. IT'S A LOT QUICKER.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,250
- COOL. THANKS A LOT. OH, YEAH.
GOT ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU.

98
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,541
GOT ANY IDEA WHO THE FASTEST
DRIVER IS HERE IN AKINA?

99
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,750
- LOOKIN' FOR THE FASTEST?
DID YOU BY CHANCE COME HERE

100
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,458
TO CHALLENGE
THE FAMOUS EIGHT-SIX OF AKINA?

101
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,875
- HUH?

102
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,958
THINK WE'RE HERE TO CHALLENGE
SOME WEAK-ASS EIGHT-SIX?

103
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:42,166
THAT'S FUNNY. BUT YOUR FACE IS A
GOOD ENOUGH JOKE FOR NOW, KID.

104
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,541
DEFEATING A SORRY EIGHT-SIX
WOULDN'T IMPRESS ANYONE.

105
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,291
WORSE THAN THAT, MY TEAM WOULD
LAUGH ME OUT OF THE REGION

106
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,583
IF I BRAGGED ABOUT IT.

107
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,291
ANYONE DRIVIN' A JUNKER LIKE
AN EIGHT-SIX IS WAY BELOW ME.

108
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,708
I WOULDN'T RACE THAT GUY
EVEN IF HE BEGGED FOR IT.

109
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,833
- YOU KNOW YOU JERKS REALLY
SHOULDN'T GO AROUND TALKING CRAP

110
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,708
ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T
EVEN UNDERSTAND.

111
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,916
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,583
WHAT AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX CAN DO.

113
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,750
IT'S A CAR THAT HASN'T LOST
A SINGLE RACE TO ANYBODY

114
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,583
IT'S GONE UP AGAINST.

115
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,083
NOT TO AN FC, AN FD!
NOT EVEN AN R-THIRTY TWO!

116
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,208
- YEAH? THEN THOSE GUYS
MUST'VE BEEN MEMBERS

117
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,750
OF THE SHITTY DRIVER CLUB.

118
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,291
- Itsuki: YOU'RE WRONG!
THEY'RE THE BEST!

119
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,916
THE TOP DRIVERS
IN THIS WHOLE PREFECTURE!

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,750
- THE TOP DRIVERS, HUH?
THIS PLACE? REALLY?

121
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,416
WOULDN'T BRAG ABOUT THAT.
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY!

122
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,916
- HEY, ITSUKI, STOP IT!

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,958
- LAY OFF OF HIM, DUDE. WE
DIDN'T COME UP HERE TO PICK

124
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,916
A FIGHT WITH THE FIRST KID
THAT WE FOUND.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,916
SORRY, GUYS. MY BUDDY HERE'S
GOT KIND OF A BIG MOUTH.

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,333
- RIGHT.

127
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,500
- LEMME JUST SAY THIS
SO YOU DON'T MISUNDERSTAND US.

128
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,916
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO INSULT
THAT EIGHT-SIX DRIVER.

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,708
I'M SURE HIS TECHNIQUE IS GOOD.

130
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,583
BUT THE CAR THAT HE'S DRIVIN',

131
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,125
IT'S MY OPINION
THAT THE EIGHT-SIX

132
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,875
ISN'T THAT GOOD ANYMORE.

133
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,500
- Seiji: HE'S RIGHT! YOU CAN
TELL THAT TO THE DRIVER.

134
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,666
AND ONE MORE THING.

135
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,833
TELL HIM WE MIGHT LET HIM RACE
US IF HE GETS BEHIND THE WHEEL

136
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,333
OF A MORE POWERFUL CAR.

137
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,083
BUT, MAKE NO MISTAKE:
WE NEVER LOSE.

138
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,666
LAN-EVO'S
THE MOUNTAIN PASS KING.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,416
- THAT JERK! TAKUMI AREN'T YOU
EVEN A LITTLE BIT STEAMED?

140
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,333
AFTER EVERYTHING
HE SAID ABOUT YOU?

141
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,833
- YEAH SURE.
IT PISSED ME OFF A LITTLE.

142
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,250
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING
TO THOSE JACKASSES!

143
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,375
- I DON'T KNOW, GUESS WATCHING
YOU GET SO WORKED UP

144
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,125
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING
CALMED ME DOWN.

145
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,958
DON'T ASK ME TO EXPLAIN
HOW OR WHY.

146
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,708
- WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

147
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,791
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO ASK.

148
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,041
BESIDES, THERE'VE BEEN
LOTS OF GUY'S

149
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,250
WHO'VE TALKED SMACK
ABOUT ME BEFORE.

150
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,250
ARGUING WITH 'EM HASN'T EVER
DONE ME ANY GOOD ANYWAY.

151
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,208
NOBODY CAN REALLY TELL
WHO THE FASTEST ONE IS

152
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,666
UNTIL YOU'RE
OUT THERE RACING.

153
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,125
- YEAH. GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

154
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,958
BUT I JUST CAN'T STAND IT
WHEN SOMEBODY INSULTS

155
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,541
THE EIGHT-SIX LIKE THAT.

156
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,833
IT'S A TESTAMENT TO HOW MUCH
I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED THAT CAR.

157
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,166
I KNOW IT'S AN OLDER MODEL,
BUT I JUST DON'T CARE.

158
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,875
THING'S GOT NO TURBO IT'S SLOWER
THAN CHRISTMAS IN THE UPHILL.

159
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,250
BIG DEAL.

160
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,291
( sniffles ) IN THE MIND OF
ANY TRUE FAN OF YOURS,

161
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,083
THE EIGHT-SIX IS FASTER
THAN ANY OTHER CAR OUT THERE!

162
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,166
- WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP CRYING
AND TAKE THIS?

163
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,708
DRINK YOUR COFFEE, DUDE.

164
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,958
- THANKS, MAN.

165
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,916
ALRIGHT, TELL ME.
YOU CAN DO IT, CAN'T YOU?

166
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,583
YOU CAN BEAT THAT LAN-EVO
ON THE DOWNHILL

167
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,666
AND SMASH THE HELL
OUT OF THAT

168
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,833
COCKY LONG-HAIRED
DUDE'S EGO, RIGHT?

169
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,166
- I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.

170
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,458
BUT HE SAID HE WOULDN'T
RACE THE EIGHT-SIX,

171
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,041
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

172
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,541
- I'VE, GOT IT. THE TURBO!
- HUH?

173
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,375
IF WE TACK THE TURBO
ON TO THE EIGHT-SIX

174
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,791
THAT SUCKER'LL BE AMAZING!

175
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,250
- Narrator: INITIAL D!

176
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,458
INITIAL D!

177
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,875
- THIS LAN-EVO DUDE SOUNDS LIKE
ONE OBNOXIOUS PUNK.

178
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,791
- NO KIDDING. I'VE NEVER BEEN
THAT PISSED IN MY LIFE.

179
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,833
- WONDER IF THOSE'RE THE
GUYS WHO CAME UP HERE

180
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,250
TO CHALLENGE THUNDER FIRE.

181
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,208
I THINK THEY'RE FROM A TEAM
CALLED, LIKE, EMPIRE,

182
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:10,916
OR EMPEROR.

183
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,083
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

184
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,916
I HEARD THEY COME FROM NIKKO
AND ONLY DRIVE THOSE LAN-EVO'S.

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,916
THEY'RE COCKIER
THAN THE TAKAHASHI'S.

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,958
AND THEY DRIVE
FASTER THAN 'EM TOO.

187
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,750
I HEARD WHAT THEY
DID TO THUNDER FIRE

188
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,375
WAS JUST STRAIGHT
UP EMBARRASSING.

189
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,083
- THAT'S EXACTLY THE
SAME THING I HEARD.

190
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,750
- SUPPOSEDLY, THEY
WERE SAYIN' SOMETHING

191
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,333
ABOUT WANTING TO RULE GUNMA.

192
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,166
SO THEY MIGHT BE SHOWIN' UP
IN AKINA SOON ENOUGH.

193
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,458
- SERIOUSLY? I WONDER
IF THEY WERE HERE YESTERDAY

194
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,041
CHECKIN' OUT THE AREA.

195
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,250
- THE LAN-EVO'LL BE HARD AS HELL
TO BEAT.

196
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,291
EVEN IF IT'S TAKUMI
DRIVIN' HIS EIGHT-SIX.

197
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,000
- Takumi: THANK YOU
FOR YOUR BUSINESS.

198
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,291
ANYWAY, PUTTIN' THESE FELLAS
ASIDE, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN

199
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,250
OR WHO HE MIGHT BE RACIN' NEXT.

200
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,333
FROM NOW ON HIS WHOLE
GAME'S SHAPING UP TO BE

201
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,166
KIND OF A CRAP SHOOT.

202
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,791
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

203
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,166
REALLY BEEF UP HIS EIGHT-SIX

204
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,333
AS MUCH AS THAT RIDE
WILL ALLOW US TO.

205
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:02,750
- EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT, LADIES!

206
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,958
WE'LL ADD A TURBO
TO THAT EIGHT-SIX!

207
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:09,541
- GOOD IDEA. I MEAN, FOR ITSUKI
TO COME UP WITH, THAT IS.

208
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,416
OF COURSE IT MIGHT JUST
BE EASIER FOR TAKUMI

209
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,125
TO JUST SWITCH TO A FASTER CAR,

210
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,500
BUT YOU KNOW, I STILL CAN'T
IMAGINE HIM DRIVING ANYTHING

211
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,750
OTHER THAN THAT EIGHT-SIX.

212
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,416
IT'S A PART OF HIM NOW.

213
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,833
- I'M WITH YOU, MAN. I WANT HIM
BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THAT THING

214
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,041
AS LONG AS HE CAN.

215
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,833
- YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT!
I MEAN THE COOLEST PART

216
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,000
IS THAT HE DRIVES THAT OLD CAR

217
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,458
AND HE'S SO FREAKIN' FAST
WITH THE SUCKER!

218
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,000
- TAKUMI, WE WANT YOU
TO GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT.

219
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,416
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW GUYS.
IT'S NOT EVEN MINE.

220
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,875
THE CAR DOES BELONG
TO MY DAD, REMEMBER?

221
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,208
- THAT'S RIGHT. CRAP, I FORGOT.

222
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,291
- ISN'T THERE SOME WAY
WE CAN CONVINCE YOUR FATHER

223
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,875
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO
FOR THE CAR'S SAKE?

224
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,666
- I'VE GOT IT! IF WE TOLD
HIM THAT WE'D PAY

225
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,208
FOR ALL OF THE MODIFICATIONS
OURSELVES,

226
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,250
THEN HE'D HAVE NO REASON
TO OBJECT!

227
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,666
- AMEN TO THAT!

228
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,375
HE'D LOVE TO HAVE MONEY
POURED INTO HIS OLD FAITHFUL.

229
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,083
- WELL, BUD, WHAT DO YOU SAY!

230
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,541
- BUT IF THE CAR WENT FASTER,

231
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,958
THEN ITS FUEL ECONOMY WOULD
SUFFER, RIGHT?

232
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,333
- WELL, YEAH, KIND OF.

233
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,666
- THEN WE'VE GOT NO CHANCE.

234
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,083
MY DAD'S THE STINGIEST PERSON
ON THIS PLANET.

235
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,916
- DON'T SAY THAT! YOU'RE GONNA
WRECK OUR WHOLE IMAGE OF HIM!

236
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,625
- COME ON, DUDE,
YOUR DAD'S OUR IDOL.

237
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,958
YOU'RE MAKING HIM OUT TO BE
JUST ANOTHER STUPID OLD MAN.

238
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,750
- HOLD ON. YOU GUYS LOOK UP
TO MY FATHER THAT MUCH?

239
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,750
- YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T
WASTE YOUR TIME

240
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,625
TRYIN' TO CONVINCE
HIM OF ANYTHING.

241
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,583
'CAUSE THE THREE OF US
JUST NEED TO BLAZE AHEAD

242
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,625
WITH THE "AKINA EIGHT-SIX
POWER-UP PROJECT" OURSELVES.

243
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,916
- YOU'RE RIGHT, DUDE.
I'M ON BOARD.

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,958
- BEEN A HELLUVA LONG TIME,
RYOSUKE.

245
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,916
- KYOICHI SUDO. THOUGHT THAT WAS
YOU PULLING UP.

246
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,666
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

247
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,250
- EASY, PAL! WE HAVEN'T SEEN
EACH OTHER IN OVER A YEAR.

248
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,333
LET SOME WATER FLOW
UNDER THAT BRIDGE.

249
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,000
THE TWO OF US
HAVE BEEN BORED LATELY.

250
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,416
DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD CONTENDERS
IN OUR 'HOOD.

251
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,166
FIGURED WE'D COME
LOOKIN' FOR SOME DRIVERS

252
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,208
IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS.

253
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,500
AND SINCE THIS'LL BE OUR LITTLE
PLAYGROUND FOR A WHILE,

254
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,625
WE FIGURED IT'D ONLY BE POLITE
TO TOOL AROUND

255
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,708
AND INTRODUCE OURSELVES TO
WHATEVER LOCALS WE COULD FIND.

256
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,791
- THAT'S SO CONSIDERATE.
DO WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO.

257
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,125
BUT HERE IN AKAGI,

258
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,125
PLAYTIME ISN'T GONNA BE QUITE
THE FUN AND GAMES

259
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,333
THAT YOU MIGHT BE
EXPECTING, GUYS.

260
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,958
NOT AS LONG AS THE RED SUNS
ARE STILL ALIVE AND KICKING.

261
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,875
- YOU'RE JUST AS PROUD A MAN
AS I REMEMBER YOU BEING.

262
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,500
BUT DON'T FORGET ONE THING.

263
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,750
I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON
I WAS A YEAR AGO.

264
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,458
- ( tires screeching )

265
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,208
- YOU BEAT ME LAST TIME
BUT IT'S MY TURN NOW.

266
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,750
JUST LIKE YOU BROKE
MY PERFECT WINNING RECORD.

267
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,708
I'M GONNA SHATTER
YOUR WINNING STREAK

268
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,833
LIKE A MIRROR ON THE ROCKS.

269
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,083
- ( chuckles ) I'M REALLY SORRY
TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE,

270
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,750
BUT MY STREAK WAS
ALREADY BROKEN RECENTLY.

271
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,333
YOU'RE TOO LATE TO THAT GAME.

272
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,416
I LOST ON A DOWNHILL IN AKINA.
TO A LITTLE EIGHT-SIX.

273
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,041
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

274
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,125
- I WAS CONSIDERING
RETIRING AFTER THAT,

275
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,916
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
THAT I'M RUNNING AWAY FROM YOU.

276
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,625
SO I MIGHT AGREE
TO A REMATCH AFTER ALL.

277
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:29,208
FOR THE RECORD, I ADMIRE YOUR
ENTHUSIASM IN COMING UP HERE.

278
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,291
TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL SPEAK TO
THE OTHER TEAMS FOR YOU

279
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,291
AND ARRANGE FOR THE COURSE
IN AKAGI TO BE FREE

280
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,125
FOR THREE DAYS BEFORE THE RACE.

281
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,875
YOU CAN DRIVE IT
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

282
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,875
I'LL RACE YOU
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

283
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,500
- WHAT A JACKASS. ACTING LIKE
HE'S GOT THE KEY TO THE CITY

284
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,666
OR SOMETHIN'!

285
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,208
I'M GONNA CHASE HIM DOWN
AND RIDE HIS ASS!

286
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,250
- SEIJI, STOP. YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO CATCH HIM. HE'S TOO FAST.

287
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,041
- I WON'T? DIDN'T YOU SEE HIM?
HE'S A SKINNY TWIG!

288
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,625
HE'S NO KIND OF TOUGH GUY.

289
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,500
AND DRIVING THAT OUTDATED FC.

290
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,000
HE EVEN LOST TO THE
EIGHT-SIX. COME ON!

291
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,666
- THAT'S ENOUGH! DON'T
UNDERESTIMATE RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI!

292
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,125
HE BEAT ME FAIR AND
SQUARE IN HIS FC LAST YEAR,

293
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,541
SO I DON'T WANNA HEAR
ANYMORE OUTTA YOU.

294
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,625
- THE WHITE COMET OF AKAGI.

295
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,458
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO COULD BEAT HIM.

296
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:26,125
- BUT RYOSUKE LOST?
AND TO AN EIGHT-SIX FROM AKINA?

297
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,500
- IT'S A CAR THAT HASN'T LOST
A SINGLE RACE TO ANYONE

298
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,166
IT'S GONE UP AGAINST.

299
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,250
NOT TO AN FC, AN FD!
NOT EVEN AN R-THIRTY TWO!

300
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,708
I GET IT.

301
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,666
THAT KID WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE SAME EIGHT-SIX.

302
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,458
I WONDER WHAT THE DRIVER'S LIKE.

303
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,291
- ( clock tolling )

304
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,625
- GUESS WHO?

305
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,250
- CUT IT OUT, NATSUKI.

306
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,625
- ( laughs ) I'M GLAD
YOU KNEW IT WAS ME.

307
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,583
'CAUSE I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
HOW BADLY I WOULD'VE FREAKED OUT

308
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,416
IF I'D HEARD YOU SAY
ANOTHER GIRL'S NAME.

309
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,333
YEAH, RIGHT.

310
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:23,125
- TAKUMI, LET'S GET
OUTTA HERE. ( exclaims )

311
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,791
MAYBE I'M GOING HOME ALONE
'CAUSE I AM THE LONELY DRIVER.

312
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,166
YEAH. I SHOULD GO HOME.

313
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,791
WORK ON THE "EIGHT-SIX
POWER-UP PROJECT."

314
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,041
THAT THING WON'T WORK
ITSELF OUT. SO, UH.

315
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,041
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

316
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,125
WE HAVE TO GO TO WORK TODAY.

317
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,125
- I FORGOT.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO.

318
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,916
- OKAY.

319
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,625
- SEE YOU LATER, GUYS!

320
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,791
- both: BYE.

321
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,208
- SO, TELL ME.

322
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,791
HOW FAR HAVE YOU TWO
TAKEN THE MAGIC?

323
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,125
- HOW FAR HAVE WE WHAT?

324
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,291
- COME ON, YOU KNOW

325
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,458
HOW FAR HAVE YOU GONE! HAD
TO BE FURTHER THAN KISSIN'!

326
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,625
AM I RIGHT? EH?

327
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,583
- ( tires screeching )

328
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,375
- THIS'LL BE A ONE-RACE MATCH.

329
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,250
WE'LL DECIDE THE THING
BY A HILL CLIMB.

330
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,750
- SOUNDS GOOD.

331
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,125
- THEN LET'S GO. YOU READY
TO KICK THIS THING OFF SEIJI?

332
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,375
- YEAH, LET'S DO THIS.

333
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,666

THIS UP, TAKESHI.

334
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,750
SHOW THEIR PUNK ASSES THE POWER
OF THE GUNMA DRIVERS.

335
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,041
JUST FOR TONIGHT,
I'M GONNA BE PULLIN' FOR YOU.

336
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,083
- OUR GOAL'S BIGGER
THAN THIS RACE.

337
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,500
SO DON'T WASTE TIME SCREWIN'
AROUND WITH THIS GUY, SEIJI.

338
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,041
HIT IT AND QUIT IT.
