CERTAINLY NOT TO ANY PUNKS

17
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,791
THAT BLAST INTO MY TURF
WITH THEIR BAD ATTITUDES.

18
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,458
- TIME TO KNOCK THIS GUY OUT.

19
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,375
- WHAT THE HELL?

20
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,875
- CRAZY DUDE! HE BLEW PAST
TAKESHI LIKE IT WAS NOTHIN'!

21
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,625
- BADASS. THAT GUY'S A BEAST.

22
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,416
- THE EVO FOUR PASSED
TAKESHI'S R-THIRTY TWO

23
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,083
AND IT'S PULLIN' AWAY FAST.

24
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,708
- WHAT? HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

25
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,791
- WONDER WHAT DESPERATE THOUGHTS
IN THE SMALL BRAIN OF THAT GUY.

26
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,500
SURE, HE'S IN A LAN-EVO

27
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,416
BUT HE JUMPED IN FRONT OF
A SKILLED MYOGI RACER.

28
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,958
THAT'S THE WORST POSITION
YOU CAN BE IN.

29
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,291
IS IT REAL CONFIDENCE?

30
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,291
OR IS THE GUY JUST AS
DUMB AS I THINK HE IS?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,791
- HE BETTER NOT THINK
THIS IS OVER YET!

32
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,625
- Keisuke: HEY, BRO,
YOU IN THERE?

33
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,166
- I'M HERE. COME ON IN.

34
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:21,500
- THE LAN-EVO TEAM. THEY'RE
RACING TONIGHT ON MOUNT MYOGI.

35
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,958
I JUST HEARD IT FROM A FRIEND.

36
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,958
- AGAINST TAKESHI
OF THE NIGHT KIDS, RIGHT?

37
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,541
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE SO.
WHO'S YOUR BEST GUESS?

38
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,666
ANYBODY RIDING TO THE TOP?

39
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,000
BECAUSE FOR ME, THIS HAS
GOTTA BE THE FIRST TIME

40
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,125
I'M HOPIN' TAKESHI
ACTUALLY WINS.

41
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,333
AND THAT LAN-EVO'S
BIGASS SPOILER IS ENOUGH

42
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,583
TO MAKE ME WANNA THROW UP
IN MY OWN MOUTH.

43
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,375
- TAKESHI'S POWER
LIES IN HIS BOLDNESS,

44
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,083
HIS OFFENSIVE
DRIVING STRATEGY.

45
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,333
THE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU DISLIKE
HIM SO MUCH IN THE FIRST PLACE.

46
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,666
WHEN HE'S ON,
THE BOY'S QUITE FAST.

47
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,500
BUT UNDER PRESSURE, HE TENDS
TO CRACK LIKE DRYING MUD.

48
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,708
I JUST HOPE HE WAS ABLE
TO RECOVER FROM THE LOSS

49
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,375
HE SUFFERED WHEN HE
WENT UP AGAINST YOU.

50
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,458
'CAUSE IF HE WASN'T,
IT COULD BE A REALLY BAD NIGHT.

51
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,250
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

52
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,125
BUT WE STILL GOT A LONG WAY
TO GO BEFORE THE FINISH LINE.

53
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,500
IF I DON'T STOP THESE GUYS,
WHO THE HELL WILL?

54
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,083
( screams )

55
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,958
DAMN IT!

56
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,416
- NOW YOU HAND OVER YOUR TEAM
STICKER. THAT'S THE DEAL.

57
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,708
- IN NO TIME MY ENTIRE SPOILER'S
GONNA BE PLASTERED

58
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,291
WITH THE SLASHED UP STICKERS

59
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,875
FROM EVERY TEAM IN THIS REGION
THAT I CHEWED UP AND SPIT OUT.

60
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,083
- DON'T START PLANNING
YOUR PARADE YET, YOU PRICK.

61
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,416
THERE ARE MORE RACERS IN GUNMA
THAN YOU 'KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH.

62
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,708
- THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE CRY
OF A GUY WHO'S ALREADY A LOSER.

63
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,750
- HA! LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
- YEAH.

64
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,333
ONE MORE THING.

65
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,833
FROM NOW ON
WHENEVER YOU SEE A CAR

66
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,458
WITH A TEAM EMPEROR
STICKER ON IT,

67
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,958
I WANT YOU TO PULL OVER
TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

68
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,291
- TAKESHI, I HAVE A HARD TIME
WRAPPIN' MY HEAD AROUND THE FACT

69
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,000
THAT HE WAS FASTER THAN YOU
IN AN UPHILL BATTLE.

70
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,416
- Kenji: SO, THAT LAN-EVO TEAM
DEFEATED THE NIGHT KIDS.

71
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,958
- Itsuki: NO!
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME!

72
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,250
- THAT'S ALL ANYONE I'VE RUN
INTO HAS BEEN TALKIN' ABOUT

73
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,708
ALL MORNING LONG.

74
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,208
TAKESHI CRASHED HIS R-THIRTY
TWO INTO THE WALL

75
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,750
AND JACKED IT UP PRETTY BADLY.

76
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,791
- WHOA. THAT SUCKS.

77
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,166
I GUESS THINGS HAVE BEEN
PRETTY ROUGH FOR THE NIGHT KIDS.

78
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,250
I GOTTA ADMIT I FEEL
KINDA SORRY FOR THEM.

79
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,833
- REMEMBER, I HEARD
THE LAN-EVO TEAM

80
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,416
IS PLANNIN' TO CONQUER GUNMA?

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,583
WELL, THEY WANNA DO IT
WITHIN THE MONTH.

82
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,291
THAT MEANS AKINA'S GONNA BE
ON THEIR LIST REAL SOON.

83
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,916
- Itsuki: WHAT DO WE DO
WHEN THAT HAPPENS?

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,083
- WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE MUCH OF
A CHOICE BUT TO FACE 'EM DOWN.

85
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,875
WE'RE AKINA'S TEAM,
SO IF THEY TRY AND CHALLENGE US,

86
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,250
I DON'T HAVE ANY INTENTION
OF RUNNING AWAY NOW.

87
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,750
I'VE ALREADY SWITCHED OUT THE
TIRES ON MY S-THIRTEEN

88
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,750
TO ONES THAT GOT BETTER GRIP.

89
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,541
AND I TOLD ALL OF
THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS

90
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,375
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE GOIN' DOWN.

91
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,708
- TAKUMI, COME HERE.

92
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,333
THEY MIGHT CHALLENGE
YOU SPECIFICALLY

93
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,666
TO A DOWNHILL BATTLE,

94
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,125
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT IT
IF YOU DON'T WANT.

95
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,000
YOUR UNDEFEATED STREAK IS A BIG
SOURCE OF PRIDE AMONG ALL OF US.

96
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,791
I'D REALLY HATE TO RUIN IT
AGAINST THEIR LAN-EVO.

97
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,875
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT

98
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,250
THAT YOU'RE NOT
OFFICIALLY A TRUE MEMBER

99
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,375
OF THE SPEED STARS
YET, YOU KNOW.

100
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,916
AND I WANT YOU TO KEEP YOUR
WINNING STREAK ROLLIN', TOO.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THIS LAN-EVO BUSINESS
IS NO JOKE.

102
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,041
I MEAN, YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE
GOIN' UP AGAINST A CAR

103
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,833
FROM THE WORLD RALLY
CHAMPIONSHIP.

104
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,291
ITS BODY IS LIGHT AS HELL

105
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,916
AND EQUIPPED WITH TURBO
AND FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,250
IT'S GOT NO REAL WEAKNESSES.

107
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,083
FREAKIN' CAR SHOULDN'T
BE ALLOWED ON ANY PASS

108
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,041
IN MY OPINION.

109
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,541
- LISTEN GUYS,
I'D HATE TO, UH...

110
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,291
- I'D HATE TO AVOID A RACE.

111
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,666
I WANNA RACE THEM
AS MUCH AS YOU.

112
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,750
I'M READY.

113
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,083
- OH, TAKUMI. YOU SOUND LIKE A
REAL RACER NOW! YOU'RE THE MAN!

114
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,916
YOU'RE MY TRUE FRIEND.
I LOVE YOU, MAN! I DO.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,083
I KNOW YOU'LL WIN.
THERE'S NOT A DOUBT IN MY MIND.

116
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,875
YOU'RE GONNA MOP UP THE FLOOR
WITH THOSE GUYS!

117
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,833
- THINK THIS IS
THE SMARTEST THING?

118
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,750
- RIGHT NOW I'D PUT OUR CHANCES
OF WINNING AT ABOUT,

119
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,458
RIGHT AT ZERO PERCENT, GUYS.

120
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:02,625
- UPGRADING THE EIGHT-SIX, HUH?
THAT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

121
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,416
SO WHAT'RE YOU GETTIN' AT?

122
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,000
- COME ON. IT HAD TO
HAVE CROSSED YOUR MIND

123
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,666
AT SOME POINT, BUNTA.

124
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,125
TAKUMI'S EVOLVING INTO A MUCH
BETTER RACER THAN HE USED TO BE.

125
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,250
JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S TIME
TO UPGRADE.

126
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,625
YOU KNOW, TRY TO BRING
THE EIGHT-SIX'S CAPABILITIES

127
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,083
UP TO THE SAME LEVEL
AS THE KID'S.

128
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,416
HEY, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO.

129
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I CERTAINLY KNOW
BETTER THAN THAT.

130
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,250
JUST CURIOUS AS TO
WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE.

131
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,666
- I GUESS, UH, THIS ENGINE IS
GETTING A LITTLE RUN DOWN,

132
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,000
ISN'T IT?

133
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,166
MAYBE IT IS ABOUT TIME TO
FINALLY GIVE THE OLD GAL

134
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,250
AN OVERHAUL.

135
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,458
- YEAH.
- ACTUALLY,

136
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,750
I KIND OF ALREADY GOT ONE.

137
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,583
- ( gasps ) YOU SCREWIN' AROUND
WITH ME, MAN?

138
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:47,416
- NO. BUT I JUST HAPPENED UPON
THE MOST INCREDIBLE LITTLE THING

139
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,041
FROM THE MOST UNLIKELY SOURCE.

140
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,625
- WHAT'S INCREDIBLE?

141
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,708
- ALRIGHT. I'LL SHOW YOU.
JUST GET IN THE CAR.

142
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,291
YOU WON'T BELIEVE YOUR EYES.

143
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:15,125
- ( gasps ) UNREAL!
WHOA, IT'S LIKE HAVING GOLD!

144
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,541
- TOLD YA YOU'D BE IMPRESSED,
DIDN'T I?

145
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,750
- NO, IT GOES WAY BEYOND THAT.
THIS BLOWS ME AWAY.

146
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,416
HOW'D YOU MANAGE TO GET A HOLD
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

147
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
I JUST HOW'D YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT THIS FOR THE EIGHT-SIX.

148
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,500
THAT'S AMAZING!

149
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:32,666
- YEAH, ME EITHER. HAVEN'T FELT
THIS EXCITED IN A WHILE.

150
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,125
ALMOST SEEMS TOO GOOD TO
WASTE ON A KID LIKE TAKUMI,

151
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,291
DOESN'T IT?

152
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,666
- WELL. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
PUT IT IN THERE?

153
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,208
- WE'LL SEE.

154
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,125
A BETTER ENGINE ISN'T
AUTOMATICALLY GONNA MAKE

155
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,500
THE CAR A BETTER MACHINE.

156
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,500
I'LL NEED TO ADJUST A WHOLE
LOT OF OTHER STUFF

157
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,000
AND FINE-TUNE THE
FOOTWORK FIRST.

158
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,416
- AND WITH THE PROPER BALANCE,

159
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,125
I THINK THIS ONE WILL BE
THE MONSTER TO BEAT.

160
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,291
- Bunta: I'LL TEST HER MYSELF

161
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,541
AND WORK OUT THE
BEST CONFIGURATION.

162
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,791
ONCE I'M FINISHED WITH THAT,
MASASHI, I'LL NEED YOUR HELP.

163
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,083
- SURE, WHATEVER YOU NEED.

164
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,166
I'VE LEARNED NOT TO ASK
QUESTIONS BY THIS POINT.

165
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,750
YOU'RE TOO STUBBORN TO LISTEN
TO MY SUGGESTIONS, ANYWAY.

166
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,541
- JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS,
HUH, GUYS?

167
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,875
- BUT, UH, THERE IS ONE MORE
THING TAKUMI HASN'T BEEN ABLE

168
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,000
TO ACCOMPLISH IN THAT CAR.

169
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,416
- YEAH? YOU GONNA TELL US
WHAT THAT IS?

170
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,666
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

171
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,375
- WOULD You STOP BEING
SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS

172
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,958
AND JUST TELL US?

173
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,375
- FINE. BUT YOU HAVE
TO SWEAR TO ME

174
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,833
THAT YOU WON'T TELL
TAKUMI ANYTHING

175
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,291
ABOUT WHAT I'M GONNA
SAY TO YOU.

176
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,416
- I PROMISE WE WON'T
SAY A THING TO HIM.

177
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,125
- THEN I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU.

178
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,166
THAT SINGLE THING IS

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,458
HE HASN'T LOST A RACE.

180
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

181
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,208
HE'S TRIED SO HARD TO
REMAIN UNDEFEATED!

182
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,375
HE'S THE TOP GUY IN
THIS WHOLE REGION!

183
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,916
- AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I DON'T LIKE.

184
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,375
LONG AS HE KEEPS SUCCEEDING,

185
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,583
HE'LL NEVER HAVE THE KIND OF
APPRECIATION FOR WINNING

186
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,916
THAT HE'D NEED FOR THIS UPGRADE.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,416
TAKUMI HAS TO PUSH THE CAR'S
CAPABILITIES TO ITS VERY LIMITS.

188
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,833
THEN HE'LL REALIZE THAT IT'S
STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH

189
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,583
TO SIMPLY WIN.

190
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,375
BECAUSE THE LESSON OF
HUMILITY CAN ONLY BE LEARNED

191
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,041
FROM FAILING.

192
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,541
SO UNTIL HE LOSES,

193
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,458
I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE
UPGRADE THE EIGHT-SIX.

194
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,125
- Narrator: INITIAL D!

195
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,666
- Kyoichi: AT THIS RATE,

196
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,916
THE SIDE OF THAT SPOILER'S
GONNA BE WALLPAPERED IN NO TIME.

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,250
- YEAH, THE WHOLE THING'S
KINDA FUN FOR ME

198
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,958
THE MORE I THINK
OF IT AS A GAME.

199
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,000
BUT I REALLY WISH I WAS
RACING DRIVERS

200
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,583
WITH A LITTLE MORE EXPERIENCE.

201
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,916
ANYWAY, WHERE'S OUR NEXT TARGET?
HAVE YOU DECIDED YET?

202
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,625
- YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE TOMORROW
NIGHT. WE'RE HEADING INTO AKINA.

203
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,208
- ( gasps ) WE'RE GONNA DO
THE EIGHT-SIX?

204
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,416
HOW FREAKIN' BORING.

205
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,791
- I WOULDN'T MIND RACIN' HIM
MYSELF IF YOU DON'T WANNA.

206
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,750
- KYOICHI'S RACIN' THE DUDE?

207
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,625
WHY WOULD HE PUT HIS
REPUTATION ON THE LINE?

208
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,291
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

209
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,583
- OUR ULTIMATE TARGET,
OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE,

210
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:29,166
IS RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI OF
THE AKAGI RED SUNS.

211
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,000
- BUT BEFORE HIM WE GOTTA
TAKE DOWN AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX.

212
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,916
LOOK, I CHECKED OUT
THE COURSE YESTERDAY.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,583
THE SLOPES ARE WAY MORE SEVERE
THAN WE'RE USED TO.

214
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,750
MY EVO THREE IS LIGHTER
AND BETTER SUITED TO IT.

215
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,375
- DUDE, WHATEVER.
LET ME DO THIS.

216
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,500
YOU KNOW I'M GOOD FOR IT.

217
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,791
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE
I RACE, OR WHO IT IS,

218
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,833
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE.

219
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,291
THERE'S ONLY ONE CAR ON THE ROAD
THAT MY CAR CAN'T BEAT

220
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,333
AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHICH ONE
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT, KYOICHI.

221
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,333
IT'S YOUR EVO THREE.
IT'S A BETTER VEHICLE THAN MINE,

222
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,583
AND YOU'RE A BETTER DRIVER.

223
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,916
WE DON'T NEED OUR NUMBER ONE

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,041
TO GO UP AGAINST SOME
WEAK-ASS EIGHT-SIX.

225
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,250
YOU GOT NOTHIN' TO PROVE.
I'LL DO IT. OKAY?

226
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,125
- ( clock tolling )

227
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,583
- WHO'S LEAVING ME NOTES?

228
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,916
DID YOU KNOW THAT NATSUKI MOGI

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,125
IS TAKING MONEY TO DATE AN OLDER
MAN WHO DRIVES A MERCEDES?

230
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,333
- Itsuki: TAKUMI!

231
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,583
SO, ARE YOU READY TO GO YET?
- YEAH, SURE.

232
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,166
- WHATCHA GOT
IN YOUR HAND THERE?

233
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,041
- IT'S, UH, NOTHING.

234
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,375
- I ALMOST FORGOT.

235
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,583
THIS CAR MAG THAT I BOUGHT THE
OTHER DAY HAD A FEATURED ARTICLE

236
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,708
ON THE EVO FOUR
THAT YOU MIGHT WANNA READ.

237
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,375
COULD HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HER
A BIT BETTER.

238
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,375
AND YOU NEED ALL THE HELP
YOU CAN GET.

239
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:07,000
I MEAN, YOU MIGHT BE GOING UP
AGAINST ONE, RIGHT?

240
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,041
- THANKS, MAN, BUT NO THANKS.

241
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,000
- WHY NOT? IF THE
ARTICLE ISN'T HELPFUL,

242
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,041
IT SURE AS HECK ISN'T GONNA
HURT YOU, DUDE.

243
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,166
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

244
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,500
I PROBABLY 'WOULDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO

245
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,833
WITH ANY OF THE INFORMATION

246
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,666
THE ARTICLE HAS ANYWAY.
IT MIGHT JUST CONFUSE ME.

247
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,041
- HUH?

248
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,041
- LOOK, I ONLY GOT ONE THING
ON MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

249
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,375
HOW CAN I DRIVE THE EIGHT-SIX
FASTER? THAT'S IT.

250
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,041
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHICH CAR I'M UP AGAINST.

251
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:32,916
- HAVEN'T YOU PUT ANY THOUGHT

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,291
INTO FINDING A MORE
POWERFUL ENGINE

253
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,166
AND STICKING THAT SUCKER
UNDER THE HOOD OF YOUR CAR?

254
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,000
THAT'D DO IT FOR SURE.

255
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,750
- I NEVER CONSIDERED IT.
- ( Itsuki exclaims )

256
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,666
SERIOUSLY? I'M DYING FOR MORE
POWER FROM MY EIGHT-FIVE.

257
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,500
IT'S LIKE ALL I THINK ABOUT!

258
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,958
- A MORE POWERFUL ENGINE.

259
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,083
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START.

260
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,208
- ( brakes screeching )

261
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,750
- TAKUMI!

262
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:30,333
- HEY, IKETANI. YOU LOOK KINDA
WORRIED. WHAT'S GOING ON?

263
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,791
- YOU DIDN'T HEAR?
THEY'RE COMING TO AKINA.

264
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,458
TONIGHT.

265
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,708
- boy: HERE COMES
THE LAN-EVO CREW.

266
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,833
THIS IS GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE
BATTLES FOR THE RECORD BOOKS.

267
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,375
- THE LAN-EVO'S ARE
FILIN' IN, GUYS!

268
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,750
THIS NIGHT'S
GONNA BE CRAZY!

269
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,041
- THAT WHITE EVO FOUR IN
FRONT MUST BE THE ONE

270
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,750
THAT BEAT TAKESHI IN MYOGI.

271
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,416
AND BEAT HIM PRETTY BAD, TOO.

272
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,458
ALL I'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM IS THAT
HE'S RIDICULOUSLY FAST.

273
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,833
- DUDE! I KNEW IT!

274
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,333
THOSE'RE THE SAME GUYS
I MET OUT AT AKINA LAKE!

275
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,208
- SO YOU'RE THE SPEED STARS.

276
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,500
I'M KYOICHI SUDO, THE LEADER
OF TEAM EMPEROR.

277
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,916
I'M SURE YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS,
BUT WE ONLY HAVE ONE DEMAND.

278
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,833
WE JUST WANNA RACE YOUR
EIGHT-SIX ON THE DOWNHILL.

279
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,291
THAT'S IT.

280
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,958
WE'LL ACCEPT
WHATEVER STIPULATIONS

281
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,708
YOU WANNA PLACE ON THIS THING.

282
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,916
ANY NUMBER OF RACES,
ANY KIND, AND ANY CONDITIONS.

283
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,958
BUT IF YOU FAIL TO WIN
EVEN ONE RACE, JUST ONE,

284
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,958
THEN YOU PEEL OFF YOUR TEAM
STICKER AND HAND IT OVER.

285
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,208
GOT THAT?

286
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,583
- OUR STICKER?

287
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,750
- WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO
WITH A STICKER? WEIRD...

288
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,083
- YEAH. BUT WHO CARES?
THEY WON'T WIN.

289
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,750
- WE ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE.

290
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,583
- THEN WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
STOP FLAPPIN' OUR JAWS

291
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,250
AND JUMP RIGHT INTO THIS RACE?

292
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,416
IT'S NOT LIKE EVERY HOUR
IN THE WORLD WAITS ON US.

293
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,791
THE FIRST RACE WILL BE
THE MAIN DOWNHILL. GOT IT?

294
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,583
SO, GET YOUR EIGHT-SIX READY.

295
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,416
- WHO IS IT YOU GOT RACIN'
FROM YOUR TEAM?

296
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,250
- THAT'D BE ME. AND I'LL BE
DRIVIN' MY EVO FOUR.

297
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,416
- OKAY, MAN, THEY SAID THAT
THEY WERE READY TO GO

298
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,166
FOR MORE THAN ONE RACE WITH US.

299
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,708
SO WHEN TAKUMI'S DONE,
WHICH ONE OF US IS UP NEXT?

300
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:53,291
- IF TAKUMI LOSES,
THEN I'LL RACE NEXT.

301
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,291
BUT IF HE CAN BEAT TAKUMI
THEN I SURE AS HELL

302
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,916
WON'T BE ABLE TO DO ANY
DAMAGE OUT THERE.

303
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,250
BUT THERE'S JUST NO WAY
WE'LL BE ABLE TO ACCEPT DEFEAT

304
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

305
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,541
- THEN AFTER YOU GET YOUR ASS
KICKED, IT'S MY TURN.

306
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,583
- MM-HMM.

307
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,250
- I THINK WE'VE BEEN LEANING ON
TAKUMI A LITTLE TOO MUCH LATELY.

308
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,458
WE NEED TO SHOW HIM THAT
WE'RE CAPABLE OF DOIN' THIS

309
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,500
AS MUCH AS HE IS.

310
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,666
- YEAH!

311
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,458
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.
YOU'RE THE LEAD-OFF MAN.

312
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,500
GO GET HIM!

313
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,958
- ( crowd chattering excitedly )

314
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,916
- HERE COMES THE EIGHT-SIX
FROM THE FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP,

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,041
YOU GUYS!

316
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,875
IT'S THE EIGHT-SIX
VERSUS THE EVO FOUR!

317
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,958
GOOD LUCK, MAN!
YOU'RE GUNMA'S DOWNHILL HERO!

318
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,583
- LISTEN, SEIJI, BE CAREFUL.

319
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,000
I WANT YOU TO APPROACH THIS RACE
WITH "SIMULATION THREE".

320
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,125
- COME ON, MAN,
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

321
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,625
"SIMULATION THREE" AGAINST
AN EIGHT-SIX? THAT'S OVERKILL.

322
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,375
- NO, MAN, I'M SERIOUS. DO IT.

323
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:09,000
I CAN TELL.
I FELT THIS KID'S ENERGY.

324
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,958
THIS EIGHT-SIX IS THE REAL DEAL.
HE'S NOT FAKIN' IT.

325
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,875
HE'S GOT SOMETHIN' THAT
ALLOWED HIM TO BEAT RYOSUKE.

326
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,500
UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT THE
HELL THAT SOMETHIN' IS,

327
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,083
WE CAN'T LET OUR GUARD DOWN.

328
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,875
- I'LL GO AHEAD
AND START THE COUNTDOWN.

329
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,833
- Kyoichi: HOLD UP.
NO NEED FOR THAT.

330
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,583
THIS IS JUST A REGULAR RACE.
NO KIND OF TIME TRIAL HERE.

331
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,666
WE LET THE CAR WITH
LESS ENGINE POWER START

332
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,833
WHENEVER HE FEELS LIKE

333
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,583
AND THE OTHER CAR
CAN START AFTER THAT.

334
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,041
SURE, IT MIGHT NOT BE
WHAT YOU'RE USED TO,

335
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,750
BUT IT'S A FAIR WAY TO ROLL OFF.

336
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,791
THAT LEAVES US STARTIN' LATE,
BUT WE DON'T MIND.

337
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,875
THAT'S THE HANDICAP
WE'RE USED TO

338
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,750
FOR HAVING THE
HORSEPOWER WE GOT.

339
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,541
IT MIGHT NOT BE
COMMON AROUND HERE,

340
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,208
BUT WE CALL IT THE
'HANDICAP METHOD'.

341
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,458
HOW 'BOUT IT?
THAT WORK FOR YOU?

342
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,583
- WORKS FOR ME
IF YOU'RE COOL WITH IT TAKUMI.

343
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,208
- Seiji: I REMEMBER HIM NOW.

344
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,958
THAT'S THE KID WE
SAW AT AKINA LAKE.

345
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,416
NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT A PUNK
LIKE HIM COULD BE THE DRIVER

346
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,125
OF THE EIGHT-SIX
EVERYONE'S TALKIN' UP.

347
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,708
KYOICHI'S DEVELOPED
THREE STRATEGIES

348
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,958
TO WIN ON AN OPPONENTS COURSE.

349
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,500
"SIMULATION THREE" IS ONLY USED
ON THE TOUGHEST DRIVERS.

350
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,625
SO WHY THE HELL DOES HE
HAVE ME BUSTING IT OUT

351
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,375
AGAINST THIS EIGHT-SIX?

352
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,958
WHAT A WASTE.

353
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,958
- TAKUMI BLASTED OUTTA THERE!

354
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,875
- YES! GO FOR IT, MAN!

355
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,416
- I'M NOT JUST GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW KILLER THE EVO FOUR IS,

356
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,833
YOU'RE GONNA SEE
HOW GREAT I AM.

357
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,458
- ( theme song playing )

358
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

359
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,500
- Announcer: THE RACE
HAS BEGUN!

360
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,916
WILL SEIJI UNDERSTAND THE REASON

361
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,875
HE'S USING SIMULATION THREE
AGAINST THE EIGHT-SIX?

362
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,000
NEXT ON INITIAL D
SECOND STAGE.

363
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,416
- Kyoichi: "PREMONITION
OF DEFEAT!"

364
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,000
- Announcer: DON'T MISS IT!
