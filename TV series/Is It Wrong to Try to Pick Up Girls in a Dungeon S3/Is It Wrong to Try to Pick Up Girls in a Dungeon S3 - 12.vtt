00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:21.476
(ASTERIUS snort)

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.095
[OTTARL] Just up ahead...

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:33.568
[OTTARL] ...lies
the one you seek.

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:36.272
(ASTERIUS grunt)

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:42.552
[ASTERIUS, internal] Ever since
then, I have had a dream...

00:00:44.088 --> 00:00:48.731
[ASTERIUS, internal] A dream
of doing battle with but a
single person...

00:00:51.503 --> 00:00:54.643
(Opening song, "over and over")

00:02:26.492 --> 00:02:28.564
[FELS] You want
the Xenos to die?!

00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:31.637
[FELS] What on earth is the
meaning of this, Lord Hermes?!

00:02:31.737 --> 00:02:36.179
[HERMES] Consider it a trade...
Or perhaps... a simple request.

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:41.456
[HERMES] As it stands, it won't
be long before the Loki Familia
tracks you down....
(GLOS sigh)

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:45.497
However... there is another
entrance in.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:49.973
And if you agree to hear out
my idea... I'll tell you where.

00:02:50.073 --> 00:02:51.577
[HERMES] And in exchange...

00:02:51.677 --> 00:02:53.948
[HESTIA] Fels, we're in trouble!
(FELS notice)

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:58.223
[HESTIA] The notebook fell
into a puddle, but the ink
didn't smear.

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.227
[HESTIA] It's a fake!
(HERMES smirk)

00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:03.801
[HESTIA] Uranus... No,
that jerk Hermes must've...

00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:06.039
[HESTIA] Hey! Are you
listening to me?!
(FELS frustrated)

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.542
[HESTIA] Fels-!

00:03:09.412 --> 00:03:12.418
[FELS] What is it that
you want, Lord Hermes?

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:15.691
(HERMES chuckle)

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.568
Daedalus's notebook was
a fake the whole time!

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:23.239
[LILI] No way! It was a fake!?

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.945
Why would someone do
that... Any clue?!

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:27.314
(HESTIA hesitant)

00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:29.485
[HESTIA] I'm not sure...
I don't really know why,

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:31.355
but I have a bad
feeling about this.

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:33.259
Are the Xenos in danger?

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.328
[LILI] (gasp) You think?

00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:35.565
[HESTIA] Oh man.

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.401
This has Hermes
written all over it.

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:39.438
He's up to something...

00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:41.577
(GLOS roaring)

00:03:41.677 --> 00:03:42.211

(ALL gasp)

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.526
[HESTIA] It can't be...

00:03:50.427 --> 00:03:51.964
(GLOS roaring)

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:53.433
[GUILE] What the...?!

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.842
[MORD] Where is it?!?
That thing sounds nearby!

00:03:57.942 --> 00:04:00.347
[SCOTT] Hey, uh,

[BYSTANDER A] Look!

00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:02.117
(MORD huh?)
[BYSTANDER B] Whoa!

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:03.119
[BYSTANDER C] They're
coming this way!

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.388
[BYSTANDER A] Oh crap!

00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:08.564
[MORD] What the hell...?

00:04:13.106 --> 00:04:14.208
(BYSTANDER B scream)

00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:15.377
(TOWNSPEOPLE

00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:16.847
[BYSTANDER C] Run!

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.988
[REHMER] Stay put...
Don't leave.

00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:21.890
[EINA] Yessir!

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.293

(ADVENTURERS pain)

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.735
[GUILD EMPLOYEE] Adventurers,

(OUKA struggle)

00:04:32.144 --> 00:04:34.115
[OUKA] Chigusa!
Get them to safety!

00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:36.352
[CHIGUSA] Ah-...Alright!

00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:37.354
[CHIGUSA] Hurry, come with me!

00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:38.757
(CHILDREN scared)

00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:41.530
[HARUHIME] It's Master Glos!

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.901
(XENOS fighting)
[HESTIA] What could they be
doing...?

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.005
[BELL] It can't be!

00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:48.343
[BELL] But why though?!

00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:49.111

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.750
[HESTIA] W-wait a minute, Bell!

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.121
[HESTIA] (irritated)
What is happening?!

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:58.731
[HESTIA] There's no logical
reason to force the Xenos
into a situation like this.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:02.772
What is your goal
here... Hermes...?

00:05:04.743 --> 00:05:08.584
[HERMES] Just Think of it as
a performance... if you will.

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:11.389
The plaza is our theater...

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:13.928
and the civilians are
our audience.

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:17.769
[HERMES] Creatures and
adventurers alike have their
respective roles to play.

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:19.539
(BELL grunting)
(land) (run/jump)

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.846
[HERMES] The stage is set,
awaiting the debut of our brave,

00:05:22.946 --> 00:05:26.653
beloved hero who rushes
headlong into battle.

00:05:26.753 --> 00:05:28.323
(BELL running)

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:30.661
[GLOS] Ah...

00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:32.632
Which means that
our job is to die

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:35.303
on behalf of the

00:05:35.403 --> 00:05:36.507
(FELS gasp)

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:38.409
[GLOS] In order to
restore his honor,

00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:42.451
he must execute us in front
of the general public.

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:44.088
(laugh) Well that
would certainly

00:05:44.188 --> 00:05:46.158
speed things up wouldn't it?

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:47.795
[HERMES] But yes.

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:50.835
[HERMES] I wouldn't go so far as
to say all of you need to die...

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:55.110
Maybe three or four of your
choosing should be more than
sufficient enough.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.279
(LIDO distraught)

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.084

[LIDO] W-wait...!

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:03.661
[GLOS] We do not have much

00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:05.998
of a choice in the matter.

00:06:06.098 --> 00:06:09.873

Would you please tell

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.126
[GLOS] ...Glos.

00:06:53.226 --> 00:06:54.696
[HERMES] Thank you, Glos.

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:56.566
Monster though you may be....

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:59.038
I'd like to address
you properly.

00:06:59.138 --> 00:07:00.206
[GLOS] What is this?

00:07:00.307 --> 00:07:01.810
This special item will

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.716
respond to a certain
person whom he holds dear.

00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:07.588
[HERMES] Be sure
to attack her first.

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:10.728
[GLOS] Understood.

00:07:10.828 --> 00:07:13.834
[GLOS, internal] So this is
how I return the favor, huh?

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:15.771
[GLOS, internal]
Falter not, boy.

00:07:15.871 --> 00:07:18.744
[GLOS, internal] Or else...

[WELF] Ya' see this!?
What the hell?!

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.929
Are we sure that it's the Xenos?

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:30.868
(panting) Why would
they suddenly rampage?

00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:34.074
[HESTIA] No doubt Hermes
must've put 'em up to it.

00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:35.711
[HESTIA] Let's hurry!

00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:39.786

[HERMES] Sorry, Uranus....
About this mess.

happen if we tried to reverse
thousands of years' worth of

00:07:54.415 --> 00:07:59.726
[HERMES] Nobody wants a hero

It's time to get back to
your roots, Bell... Got it?!

[LILI] You realize we risked our

Do you really want all of our

[TIONE] What the hell is

you interfere?!

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.043

on this fight.

[ALLEN] So you oughtta keep
your noses out of it.

00:14:29.872 --> 00:14:31.543
[FINN] A fine job, Ottarl.

00:14:31.643 --> 00:14:35.383
It seems that your Familia has
successfully interfered...

00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:38.322
you prevented others

[HERMES] What's going on down
there? You seeing this?! What
the hell?!

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.778
[ASFI] The Xenos slipped away
from us during the chaos.

00:15:05.878 --> 00:15:11.556
I think... They're likely
headed towards Knossos with
the help of Lady Hestia.

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:15.329
(frustrated) That damn monster
threw a wrench in my plans...

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:36.873
[HERMES] Nobody's ever been this
excited about one of my plans!

00:15:36.973 --> 00:15:38.242
[HERMES] Even I couldn't have
come up

00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:40.981
with something that'd
top this fight!

00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:46.391
[HERMES] You knew,
didn't you, Zeus?

00:15:46.492 --> 00:15:51.669
That a boy who defied the
will of the gods would
shine brightest of all...!

your grand stage.

00:21:09.872 --> 00:21:12.043
(GLOS grunt)
[LIDO] He's already on his way

00:21:12.143 --> 00:21:13.880
back down to the deeper floors.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.752
[LIDO] He's going on another one
of his training missions.

00:21:16.853 --> 00:21:20.292
[LIDO] Needs to get even
stronger, he said.

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:28.510
[ADVENTURER H] Rumor has it
that the Loki Familia
rounded up all the monsters
and finished 'em off.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.412
[ADVENTURER A] Incredible...

00:21:30.514 --> 00:21:32.718
[ADVENTURER A] Well, I suppose
that means we can relax now.

00:21:32.818 --> 00:21:33.953
(EINA smile)

00:21:35.055 --> 00:21:38.128
[WELF] "The Little Rookie's
Miraculous Survival."

00:21:38.228 --> 00:21:41.769
Are you kidding me?
What a bunch'a crap.

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:46.546
[MIKOTO] Isn't this a good
thing? We managed to clear
the air at least.

00:21:46.646 --> 00:21:49.117
[LILI] And everything's
gone back to normal.

00:21:49.217 --> 00:21:50.620
[MIKOTO] I wouldn't
go that far...

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.156
(LILI notice)
(question)

00:21:52.256 --> 00:21:53.693
(HARUHIME somber)

00:21:55.296 --> 00:21:57.500
[HESTIA] Are you
alright... Haruhime?

00:21:57.601 --> 00:22:03.513
Oh? I am... We'll meet again...
We made a promise after all.

00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:07.588
(HESTIA happy) (sigh)

00:22:07.688 --> 00:22:09.390
[WELF] That just leaves Bell...

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.631
[LILI] So uh, Lady Hestia...
is Master Bell...?

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:16.071
[HESTIA] Mmhm... He's
out there again today.

00:22:16.171 --> 00:22:17.073
(bell ringing)

00:22:17.173 --> 00:22:18.676
(HESTIA notice)

00:22:21.381 --> 00:22:22.718
[HERMES] Howdy!

00:22:23.285 --> 00:22:25.189
(angry)

00:22:25.289 --> 00:22:26.324
[HESTIA] Get lost, creep!

00:22:26.424 --> 00:22:27.961
(HERMES pain)

00:22:48.903 --> 00:22:50.039
(BELL notice)

00:22:52.109 --> 00:22:53.613
[BELL] Miss Ais...

00:22:56.184 --> 00:22:58.790
[BELL] What're you...
doing here?

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.096
[AIS] I'm not sure...

00:23:02.196 --> 00:23:06.438
[AIS] Something told
me... that I might run
into you here though.

00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:09.043
[BELL] Oh yeah? You mean it?

00:23:09.778 --> 00:23:10.847
[AIS] Yes.

00:23:13.385 --> 00:23:14.287
[BELL] Miss Ais.

00:23:14.387 --> 00:23:15.790
[AIS] Hmm?

00:23:16.926 --> 00:23:19.732
[BELL] Would you be
willing to train me again?

00:23:21.535 --> 00:23:23.606
[AIS] Even after all that?

00:23:24.374 --> 00:23:25.777
[BELL] Yes.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.987
[AIS] You're relentless,
aren't you?

00:23:32.557 --> 00:23:33.960
[BELL] I need you...

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.970
[BELL] to help me...
I want to get stronger.
