We're outmatched, Dix...

It's way too strong!

00:02:20.548 --> 00:02:21.583
Yeah?

00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:22.752

I'm going to the Dungeon

[DIX] Ah, anyways,
she's a lost cause.

00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:07.816
[DIX] But don't let her loose,
she'll burn down the whole

I don't like takin' orders
from anyone either...

that's the type

(street chatter)

00:08:17.628 --> 00:08:22.805
[BELL, internal] Xenos like
Wiene and Lido are different
from regular monsters.

[BELL, internal] Monsters kill
people. That's a fact.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.186
[BELL, internal]
But is that enough to
justify killing them...?

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:34.495
[BELL, internal] Or to earn
a living...? Or to be like our

[URANUS] Is something
wrong, Fels?

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:49.893
[FELS] No. Despite
ongoing surveillance,

00:08:49.993 --> 00:08:55.671
there is no indication that the
group of hunters from the Ikelos
Familia have exited Babel.

00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:58.644
[FELS] At present... they either
remain in the Dungeon...

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:01.850
or our worst fear has
come to fruition:...

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.891
There is another entrance to the
Dungeon aside from the tower.

00:09:07.461 --> 00:09:10.735
What is the status...
of the Xenos?

00:09:10.835 --> 00:09:12.672
[FELS] As planned,
they are in the process

00:09:12.772 --> 00:09:14.909
of relocating to another
hidden village.

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:17.715
I have yet to receive
word of their arriv--...

00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:20.386
[URANUS] What's happened now?

00:09:20.487 --> 00:09:23.761
[FELS] The signal from Lido's
crystal has disappeared...

00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:30.908
[LIDO] What's the
big idea, Glos?!

00:09:31.008 --> 00:09:33.079
[LIDO] Why'd you
smash the crystal?!

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:36.887
[LIDO] How are we supposed to
get in touch with Fels?!

00:09:36.987 --> 00:09:40.026
[GLOS] Seriously? Listening
to Fels is pointless!

00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:42.632
[GLOS] You know exactly
what must be done!

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:44.636
[LIDO] Take it easy...

00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:46.673
I saw everything...

00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:49.211
[GLOS] I could hear
the bloodshed...

00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:50.748
Those humans' evil deeds...

00:09:50.848 --> 00:09:53.386
[GLOS] The deaths of
our beloved friends...!

00:09:53.486 --> 00:09:57.929
[GLOS] We do not need Fels' help
any longer! No one can stand in
our way!

00:09:58.029 --> 00:10:00.233
[GLOS] We shall end this
with our own hands!

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:04.576
[GLOS] Revenge! We shall
have our revenge for
Lanier and the others...

00:10:04.676 --> 00:10:06.847
[GLOS] We shall rescue
our comrades!
(LIDO shock)

00:10:06.947 --> 00:10:10.386
[GLOS] And those savages are
going to pay the price!

00:10:10.487 --> 00:10:11.690
[LIDO] W-wait...!

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.959
[GLOS] I'll destroy them,

00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:14.863
along with anyone who
dares to interfere!

00:10:14.963 --> 00:10:17.033
[GLOS] I'll slaughter every
last one of them!

00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:20.240
[LIDO] And let all of our hard
work go to waste?! Is that what
you want?!

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.012
[LIDO] To forsake our fallen
comrades' dreams?!

00:10:23.112 --> 00:10:27.020
[LIDO] Not all adventurers...
Not all surface-dwellers are
evil!

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.592
[LIDO] Some of 'em are
like Bell and his friends.

00:10:29.692 --> 00:10:33.332
[GLOS] How long are you going to
turn a blind eye?!
[LIDO] So- (taken aback)

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:37.575
[GLOS] That little brat is no
different. He will abandon us
eventually.

00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:41.448
[GLOS] Mankind and monsters
cannot coexist!

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.620
[GLOS] Come back
to reality, Lido!

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.923
(LIDO gasp)

00:10:45.023 --> 00:10:47.862
[GLOS] We are going
to rescue our comrades!

00:10:47.962 --> 00:10:50.333
[GLOS] We shall honor
Lanier's dying wish!

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:52.037
[XENOS] Yeah!

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:02.123
[REI] We can't stop them.
Lido... It's too late.
(LIDO distressed)

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:06.833
[LIDO] I'm sorry, Fels...
Bellcchi...

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:08.837
[LIDO] Rei, Rhett...
(REI solemn)

00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:12.979
[LIDO] Stick with me.
We're goin' after Glos' crew.

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:13.847
[REI] Right.

00:11:13.947 --> 00:11:15.216
[RHETT] Anything you say, sir!

00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:17.487
[LIDO] Alulu, go meet
up with our comrade.

00:11:17.588 --> 00:11:20.728
He should be arriving at the
rendezvous point any minute now.

00:11:20.828 --> 00:11:21.663
(ALULU understood - "kyu!")

00:11:21.763 --> 00:11:23.734
(LIDO somber) (resolute)

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:25.403
[LIDO] Let's go!

00:11:25.504 --> 00:11:29.077
(ADVENTURERS chatting)

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:32.952
(HERMES ELF notice)
(HERMES CATMAN affirmative)

00:11:33.052 --> 00:11:34.789
[HERMES CATMAN] Falgar...
See that down there?

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:36.893
[HERMES CATMAN] Ikelos's grunts!

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:39.899
[MALE ADVENTURER A] Bors!

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.137
[MALE ADVENTURER A]
The monsters are acting strange.

00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:44.274
[MALE ADVENTURER A] You hear
that don'tcha?

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:45.711
(BORS grunt)

00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:47.180
[BORS] What is that...?!

00:11:51.488 --> 00:11:56.566
(street chatter)

00:11:56.666 --> 00:12:02.277
[BELL] U-um so uh... I'm sorry
for uh... Taking your time...

00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:03.814
[AIS] No no it's fine.

00:12:03.914 --> 00:12:06.953
(BELL conflicted) (sigh)

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:10.093
[BELL] So um tell me Miss Ais...

00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:11.830
Let's say...

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.032
there's a monster that had

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.401
its very own reason to live...

00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:17.608
[BELL] And it had feelings
exactly like ours...

00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:19.378
What would you do?

00:12:19.478 --> 00:12:20.714
(AIS ponder)

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.160
Doesn't matter... What if that
monster were to hurt somebody...

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.496
(AIS shakes head)

00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:37.347
[AIS] If that monster were
to make someone cry...

00:12:37.447 --> 00:12:40.453
[AIS] I would kill it without
any hesitation.

00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:50.941
(BELL shaky breath)

00:12:51.375 --> 00:12:52.243
[BELL] I...

00:12:52.344 --> 00:12:55.183
(bells ringing)

00:12:55.283 --> 00:12:56.920
(BOTH surprised)

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.759
[EINA, intercom] Emergency
alert! Emergency alert!

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:02.097
[EINA] All Familias operating
within city limits,

00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:05.370
please follow the official
instructions with which
you are provided.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.342
[EINA] The Guild will be
issuing a mission shortly!

00:13:14.722 --> 00:13:18.362
[EINA] Armed monsters have
destroyed Rivira, located
on the 18th Floor.

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:24.207
[EINA] We are asking adventurers
for their immediate cooperation
in eradicating the monsters
responsi-

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:26.579
[EINA] Huh? But-

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.451
[EINA] Yes, sir! The Guild
retracts its previous statement.

00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:33.794
All citizens, including
adventurers, are prohibited
from entering the Dungeon.

00:13:33.894 --> 00:13:36.966
(STREET hushed
talking /confusion)
[EINA] Familias, please stand by
at your respective homes.

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:39.706
[AIS] A party of monsters...?
[EINA] I repeat: All citizens,
including adventurers,

00:13:39.806 --> 00:13:42.143
[EINA] are prohibited from
entering the Dungeon.
[BELL] What happened...?

00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:45.918
[BELL] Mr. Lido... and Wiene...

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.391
D'you hear? The
hell's going on?!

00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:52.030
[WELF] They said the Xenos
attacked the town?!

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.537
[LILI] We don't know...
There's not enough information.

00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:57.440
In the unlikely
event it's true...

00:13:57.541 --> 00:14:01.683
what would happen to the Xenos?
And what would happen to poor
Lady Wiene?

00:14:01.783 --> 00:14:06.125
Hmm.. Dangerous monsters
who've already wrought
havoc on Rivira...

00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:09.498
It's gonna be impossible for
Orario to just let them be.

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:14.074
[LILI] They'll be forced to take
some sort of decisive action...

00:14:15.443 --> 00:14:16.412
[ROYMAN] Lord Uranus!

00:14:16.513 --> 00:14:18.784
[ROYMAN] Why would you
give such an order?!

00:14:18.884 --> 00:14:20.621
[URANUS] Calm yourself, Royman.

00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:22.157
[ROYMAN] But...
this is pressing!

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:24.327
We can't let the monsters
continue their onslaught...

00:14:24.428 --> 00:14:26.766
Our righteous Guild shall
lose its authority!

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:31.141
If those creatures were
truly intent on invading
the surface...

00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:34.347
they would have already
broken down Babel's doors.

00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:39.692
[URANUS] More importantly,
my Divine Prayer has yet
to be disrupted.

00:14:39.792 --> 00:14:41.529
[ROYMAN] O-of course...

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:43.065
[URANUS] Involving more Familias

00:14:43.165 --> 00:14:46.573
would cause unnecessary
chaos and confusion.

00:14:46.673 --> 00:14:50.781
[URANUS] The Ganesha Familia
will lead the subjugation
forces.

00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:52.852
[ROYMAN] (point taken)
I understand then.

00:14:52.952 --> 00:14:55.657
[URANUS] Further instructions
will follow shortly.

00:14:55.758 --> 00:14:56.826
[URANUS] Now, go.

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:59.397
[ROYMAN] Yessir! (scurry off)

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:00.901
(URANUS pondering)

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:02.738
[FELS] This is a problem.

00:15:02.838 --> 00:15:04.474
[URANUS] Very true.

00:15:04.575 --> 00:15:07.948
[FELS] Ideally, we should have
had a full grasp on the
situation

00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:11.288
and devised a plan before
sounding the alarm.

00:15:11.388 --> 00:15:15.864
Yes. Now, Fels...
Ready your familiar.

00:15:15.964 --> 00:15:17.568
[FELS] Certainly, but....

00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:19.906
[URANUS] The participants
of this mission shall

00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:22.812
be selected from our
most trusted allies.

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:25.249
[URANUS] You are
to accompany them.

00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:29.826
In addition... I would like
you to involve Bell Cranel.

00:15:29.926 --> 00:15:31.094
(FELS surprised)

00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:34.234
[FELS] Uranus... Are you sure?

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:36.271
[URANUS] This is the boy's
moment of truth.

00:15:36.371 --> 00:15:42.250
A final test for the only
adventurer to ever join
hands with the Xenos.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.156
[URANUS] Is he merely a child
swept up in the moment?

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:48.763
Is he a puppet being
manipulated by the gods?

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:52.538
[URANUS] Or perhaps,
it's something else.

00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:57.548
(street angry chatter)

00:15:57.648 --> 00:15:59.519
(BELL rushing) (sliding by)

00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:00.754
[BELL] Miss Eina!

00:16:00.854 --> 00:16:02.190
[EINA] Oh! Hi there, Bell!

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.593
[BELL] Please tell me!

00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:05.864
What do we know about the
monsters who attacked?!

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:09.070
[EINA] According to the
adventurers who managed to
escape...

00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:11.509
they were equipped with
weapons and armor.

00:16:11.609 --> 00:16:14.849
[EINA] It sounds as though
there were several different
species involved,

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:16.786
lead by a ferocious gargoyle.

00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:17.755
(BELL gasp)

00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:19.157
[EINA] From what I know...

00:16:19.257 --> 00:16:21.228
the Guild will be sending out
the Ganesha Familia

00:16:21.328 --> 00:16:23.032
as the lead subjugation unit.

00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:26.171
[EINA] We may be issuing further
orders to more Familias.

00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:28.977
So I encourage you
to stand by at home.

00:16:29.077 --> 00:16:31.448
[MISHA] Hold on a second, Eina!

00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:32.350
[EINA] Hmm?

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:34.956
What?! Master Uranus...

00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:37.460
wants to speak with Bell?!

00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:39.331
(BELL confused)

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:41.034
[BETE] That's complete bullshit!

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:42.638
Just standby?!

00:16:42.738 --> 00:16:45.176
[BETE] Why the hell would
anybody leave this up to
Ganesha?!

00:16:45.276 --> 00:16:47.948
Plus issuing an abrupt
change to the mission...

00:16:48.048 --> 00:16:50.253
[RIVERIA] It's truly
a bizarre situation.

00:16:50.353 --> 00:16:51.923
[FINN] Well, at any rate guys...

00:16:52.023 --> 00:16:54.729
I'm sure this won't be
the last we hear of it...

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:56.498
Know what I mean.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:57.835
It's just a hunch.

00:16:57.935 --> 00:16:59.104
[LOKI] Look...

00:16:59.204 --> 00:17:00.841
I'm not exactly thrilled about

00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:02.477
being kept outta
the loop, y'know.

00:17:02.578 --> 00:17:04.615
[LOKI] ...but I gotta
agree with Finn, here.

00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:09.457
It made far too many waves...
It's not stopping any time
soon...

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:15.537
How amusing that even Uranus
has something to hide...

00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:19.311
..and he wants to keep us
as far away as possible.

00:17:23.553 --> 00:17:26.058
(IKELOS laughing)

00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:29.497
Screwed up big time Dix...
didn'tcha?

00:17:30.534 --> 00:17:31.769
(IKELOS chuckle)

00:17:31.869 --> 00:17:36.178
[IKELOS] Oh, what a glorious
turn of events! (amused)

00:17:36.278 --> 00:17:39.417
[HESTIA] No way! Bell
hasn't come back? yet!

00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:42.223
[LILI] He hasn't. He's
still down in the Dungeon.

00:17:42.323 --> 00:17:44.494
[HESTIA] But it's been
placed on lock-down!

00:17:44.595 --> 00:17:48.035
[HESTIA] They forced a mandatory
evacuation on us in the tower.

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:51.008
Oh Bell... Where are you?

00:17:51.108 --> 00:17:51.876
(MIKOTO panting)

00:17:51.976 --> 00:17:53.245
(HESTIA notice)

00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:55.817
[MIKOTO] Lady Hestia! A message
from the Guild.

00:17:55.918 --> 00:17:56.819
(HESTIA concerned)

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.291
(LILI anticipation)

00:17:59.391 --> 00:18:02.363
[HARUHIME] "In case of
emergency, we shall call in..."

00:18:02.463 --> 00:18:04.067
[HARUHIME] "...reserve units?"

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:06.138
[LILI] "Maintain
the status quo."

00:18:06.238 --> 00:18:09.845
[LILI] So basically, we're
supposed to stay put?

00:18:09.946 --> 00:18:14.087
"They're recruiting Bell
for the subjugation unit
on the 18th Floor"?!

00:18:14.187 --> 00:18:15.423
[ALL] They're what?!

00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:19.364
What on earth are you
thinking... Uranus...?

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:24.709
[FELS] We don't have much
time. Pay close attention, Bell
Cranel.

00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:29.919
[FELS] Our assumptions are
based on testimonies from the
adventurers who have evacuated.

00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:35.931
[FELS] However, it seems the
Xenos did not exit the 18th
Floor following their assault on
Rivira.

00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:37.735
(BELL surprised)

00:18:37.835 --> 00:18:40.540
[FELS] I firmly believe that
the reason for their outburst,

00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:43.747
whatever it may be, currently
resides on said floor.

00:18:43.847 --> 00:18:47.453
[FELS] Nevertheless,
I must verify this claim
with my own eyes.

00:18:47.554 --> 00:18:50.259
[BELL] But... how will you
manage to get down there?

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:56.606
[FELS] We have arranged to
dispatch you to the Dungeon.
You shall infiltrate and move
alongside the subjugation unit.

00:18:56.706 --> 00:18:57.675
(BELL gasp)

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:02.885
[FELS] Are you willing to
help us... Bell Cranel?

00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:04.922
Of course I'll help out!

00:19:05.022 --> 00:19:07.327
I insist on it!

00:19:07.427 --> 00:19:11.468
[BELL] I have to go...
I have to find Wiene...!

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.909
(HERMES sigh)

00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:17.113
Dragging poor Bell into this...

00:19:17.213 --> 00:19:19.885
[HERMES] You've really
done it now, Uranus.

00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:21.455
[ASFI] I'm surprised.

00:19:21.556 --> 00:19:24.094
You're usually eager to put him
through one of your "tests."

00:19:24.194 --> 00:19:26.498
I was sure you wouldn't
pass up the chance.

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:28.803
[HERMES] Well, there's always
an exception to the rule...

00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:32.878
One wrong move and it's
curtains for the kid.

00:19:32.978 --> 00:19:34.381
How's Falgar's party doing?

00:19:34.481 --> 00:19:37.821
[ASFI] They managed to
survive, albeit narrowly.

00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:39.190
(HERMES sigh)

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.028
[HERMES] Head down
to the 18th Floor,

00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:43.365
but travel separately
from Ganesha's team.

00:19:43.465 --> 00:19:46.171
[HERMES] Get all the information
you can and report back.

00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:49.010
[ASFI] Okay what about you?

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.083
[HERMES] I need to take
care of something.

00:19:52.183 --> 00:19:56.391
[HERMES] I'm concerned
for Bell's safety...
Take Aisha along.

00:19:56.491 --> 00:19:58.930
[RYU] Mr. Cranel is joining
the subjugation unit?

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.705
[AISHA] Yup. Apparently the
rampaging monsters never left
the 18th Floor

00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:06.344
after laying waste to Rivira.
They're holed up there now.

00:20:06.445 --> 00:20:08.950
Why are you telling
me about all this?

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.088
[AISHA] I'm too nosy
for my own good.

00:20:11.188 --> 00:20:15.296
[AISHA] I only say this 'cause
you seem to have a soft spot for
Bell Cranel...

00:20:15.396 --> 00:20:18.570
That boy is about to wander
down a dangerous path.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.041
[RYU] And how exactly do
you know so much? (react)

00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:25.617
[AISHA] Because I converted
to the Hermes Familia...
after Ishtar bit the dust.

00:20:25.717 --> 00:20:28.188
[RYU] Of all the gods
out there why him?

00:20:28.288 --> 00:20:30.761
[AISHA] (chuckle)
I have my reasons.

00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:33.767
[AISHA] Let's call it a mutually
beneficial agreement.

00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:37.941
I'm assuming... you must be
headed to the 18th Floor?

00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:39.110
(AISHA amused)

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.881
[RYU] I see...
(AISHA question)

00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:43.485
[RYU] In other words,
it's safe to conclude...

00:20:43.586 --> 00:20:45.456
it's no ordinary mission.

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:47.728
[AISHA] Good guess.
According to my source,

00:20:47.828 --> 00:20:50.366
the Ikelos Familia
is involved somehow.

00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:52.470
Can you be certain about that?

00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:54.174
That would be the rumor....

00:20:54.274 --> 00:20:57.915
They're said to be in league
with an illicit group called
"Evilus."

00:20:58.482 --> 00:20:59.852
[RYU] Evilus...?

00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:03.258
[RYU] Understood.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.730
I shall be accompanying you.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.717
(DIX smirk)

00:21:17.386 --> 00:21:18.656
[GRAN] Dix!

00:21:18.756 --> 00:21:21.596
The entire city's up in
arms and going crazy...

00:21:21.696 --> 00:21:24.802
Something about armed
monsters in Rivira!

00:21:24.902 --> 00:21:26.639
You said armed monsters?

00:21:26.739 --> 00:21:29.010
It's almost too good to be true!

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:34.220
So our prey has decided to make
it easy on us an' bring the
fight right to our doorstep.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.661
Meanwhile our god is
nowhere to be found...

00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:40.634
[DIX] Well then...

00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:44.274
[DIX] ...how to proceed?

00:21:46.378 --> 00:21:47.581
[SHAKTI] Now listen.

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.919
[SHAKTI] Our job is to tame
these monsters.

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:53.125
[SHAKTI] Do not kill them.
They are to be captured alive.

00:21:53.225 --> 00:21:54.762
[ILTA] You sure
about this, Sister?

00:21:54.862 --> 00:21:57.868
We abide by the will of
our master, Ganesha...

00:21:57.968 --> 00:22:01.208
We trust in his judgement and
follow his command.

00:22:01.308 --> 00:22:03.145
[SHAKTI] Isn't that right, Ilta?

00:22:03.245 --> 00:22:05.349
(ILTA agree)

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:06.519
[SHAKTI] Now let's get moving!

00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:10.326
(GANESHA FAMILIA power yell)

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:20.614
(Ending Song, "Evergreen")

00:23:45.583 --> 00:23:48.422
[HESTIA] Next time: "Knossos."
