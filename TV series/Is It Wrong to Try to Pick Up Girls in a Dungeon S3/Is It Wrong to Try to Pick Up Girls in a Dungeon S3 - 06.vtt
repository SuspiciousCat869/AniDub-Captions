00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:41.328
(BELL observe)

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.252
[BELL] What tha...

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:00.901
[FELS] This is not a
natural formation...

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:04.007
[FELS] Clearly, it is
a man-made structure.

00:10:10.186 --> 00:10:13.092
[FELS] Hmm? Is that...
...orichalcum?!

00:10:13.192 --> 00:10:18.169
[FELS] A refined metal with a
durability surpassing that of
adamantite...

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:24.749
[FELS] Which means that it's
virtually impossible to destroy,
even with the use of magic.
However...

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.997
[FELS] Unbelievable...

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:35.336
[FELS] Something like
this, in the Dungeon...?

00:10:40.614 --> 00:10:43.085
(BELL question) (notice)

00:10:44.823 --> 00:10:46.960
[FELS] "Daedalus"...

00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:52.270
[WELF] Dammit...! We
gotta help somehow.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.043
[MIKOTO] They're going to great
lengths to maintain the Guild's
orders,

00:10:55.143 --> 00:10:57.582
I'd say any attempt to sneak
in would be futile.

00:10:57.682 --> 00:11:00.521
I hate waiting around,
it's just stupid.

00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:03.861
This is my life when you guys
are out.. Welcome to my world.

00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:05.496
[WELF] Hmm? Huh? Oh, uh...
(nervous laugh)

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:07.935
[HARUHIME] Master Bell....

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:10.173
[WELF] Listen... Assuming that
the hunters were

00:11:10.273 --> 00:11:13.446
the cause of this whole
fiasco, why not just track
down their hideout?

00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:15.818
[WELF] If they're sellin' the
Xenos on the black market,

00:11:15.918 --> 00:11:18.289
they oughtta have a base
somewhere in Orario, right?

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:21.128
[MIKOTO] Probably, Welf...
That's a good assumption.

00:11:21.228 --> 00:11:25.571
[HARUHIME] But how would we go
about searching for something
like that?

00:11:25.671 --> 00:11:27.742
(ALL disheartened)

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:29.812
(HESTIA sigh)

00:11:29.913 --> 00:11:31.048
Perfectly content selling off

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:34.021
monsters to the
highest bidder...

00:11:34.121 --> 00:11:36.125
[HESTIA] These people aren't
afraid of the Dungeon,

00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:37.494
let alone the gods.

00:11:37.595 --> 00:11:40.734
[HESTIA] I don't think it'll
be so easy to find them...

00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:44.408
[LILI] (gasp) Right! They sell
monsters for profit...!

00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:45.711
(ALL question)

00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:53.459
[ZANIS] I never would have
dreamed of seeing someone like
you here... Arde.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.498
[LILI] There's something that
I would like to ask you.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.770
[LILI] It regards
"talking monsters".

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.246
[ZANIS] We know you possess
a peculiar sort of
transformation magic..

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:05.083
You mentioned it once...

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.521
Something of a plan to
lure the monsters out.

00:12:07.622 --> 00:12:11.262
Then capture them, and sell
them on the black market.

00:12:11.362 --> 00:12:14.401
At the time, I dismissed
it as total nonsense.

00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:18.175
I thought that no one would
pay any money for monsters...

00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:21.850
However... things
have changed...

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.252
[ZANIS] I get it...

00:12:23.352 --> 00:12:24.956
(ZANIS chuckle)

00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:26.793
[ZANIS] You met one, didn't you?

00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:29.131
One of the talking
monsters, that is.

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:32.972
[LILI] Which means, if you were
conspiring with those hunters...

00:12:33.072 --> 00:12:37.515
...then you must at least
have some idea of where
their base is.

00:12:37.615 --> 00:12:39.217
Perhaps you're correct...

00:12:39.318 --> 00:12:44.328
And perhaps you'll find
something interesting on
Daedalus Street...

00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:47.200
[BELL] So this place... connects
to Daedalus Street...?

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.941
[FELS] Yes. They were able to
transport imprisoned Xenos

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:55.651
to the surface and smuggle
them outside Orario, all
while avoiding detection...

00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:59.091
[FELS] If it is connected to the
surface, everything would make
sense.

00:12:59.191 --> 00:13:02.130
[FELS] Besides,
there's that sign...

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.036
[FELS] These tunnels
are obviously the
work of Daedalus...

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:07.541
[FELS] ...a master craftsman who
created several structures that

00:13:07.642 --> 00:13:13.553
would lay the groundwork for
Orario, including Babel and
Daedalus Street.

00:13:13.654 --> 00:13:16.593
(BELL surprised)
[FELS] We have long suspected
the possibility of another way

00:13:16.693 --> 00:13:21.235
to access the Dungeon outside
of the usual tower entrance...

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:24.976
[FELS] But our investigation
had yet to yield results.

00:13:25.076 --> 00:13:27.915
[FELS] We've finally
found it, Uranus...

00:13:30.754 --> 00:13:31.690
[HERMES] Ikelos.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.625
[IKELOS] Huh?

00:13:32.725 --> 00:13:34.027
(IKELOS laughing)

00:13:34.127 --> 00:13:37.133
Guess ya' finally
caught up with me.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.872
I guess you win this
round, Hermes.

00:13:39.972 --> 00:13:42.712
[IKELOS] I've no control over
the present situation...

00:13:42.812 --> 00:13:47.855
but as a reward for finding me,
I shall answer any questions
that you may have.

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:51.261
So... what would you
like to know?

00:13:51.362 --> 00:13:53.867
[GLOS] The scent of our
brethren grows stronger!

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:54.969
[GLOS] Onward!

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:56.539
So about this door, Lido...

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:58.342
I can't help but
think it's a trap!

00:13:58.442 --> 00:13:59.679
[LIDO] I know...

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:01.850
[LIDO] But there's
no other choice!

00:14:03.653 --> 00:14:05.056
(LIDO shock)

00:14:05.991 --> 00:14:08.129
[LIDO] What in the hell?

00:14:12.838 --> 00:14:13.740
[FIA] Get us out!

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.876
(BOTH shock)

00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:16.378
[GLOS] Dismantle the cages!

00:14:16.478 --> 00:14:18.215
Retrieve our brethren!

00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:25.129
[LIDO] Are you alright, Fia?!

00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:26.231
(XENOS breaking
cages open/rushing)

00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:27.902
[LIDO] What happened to Wiene?!

00:14:28.002 --> 00:14:29.706
[FIA] I have no idea.

00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:31.108
[FIA] I guess while
I was passed out,

00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:33.613
they must have taken her away.

00:14:33.714 --> 00:14:35.617
[DIX] What a touching reunion!

00:14:35.718 --> 00:14:39.424
[DIX] Congratulations on getting
this far, creatures...

00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:41.563
Welcome to our humble home.

00:14:41.663 --> 00:14:42.998
[GLOS] You must be the hunter

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:45.303
who's been selling our
brethren into slavery!

00:14:45.403 --> 00:14:47.140
Yup. I'm your guy.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.783
And I beat some manners into 'em
too so that they don't offend
our gracious customers.

00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:53.720
[GLOS] You son of a bitch!

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.492
[DIX] Well honestly
I did have some help.

00:14:57.595 --> 00:15:00.199
[DIX] So I was wondering...
(BOTH notice)

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:04.675
[DIX] Just How well can you
fight... while protectin' your
precious cargo?
(BOTH notice)

00:15:04.776 --> 00:15:05.911
(BOTH annoyed)

00:15:06.011 --> 00:15:06.880
[BELL] Mr. Lido! (running)

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.815
(BOTH notice)

00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:09.184
[LIDO] B-Bellcchi?!

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:10.954
[GLOS] You're the little
puke from before!

00:15:11.054 --> 00:15:12.792
[GLOS] What the hell
are you doing here?!

00:15:12.892 --> 00:15:15.096
[DIX] Oh? Gran, you dumbass!

00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:18.603
I don't remember tellin' you to
let the damn rabbit-boy in here!

00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:20.707
Uh-wait, it's not my fault!

00:15:20.808 --> 00:15:22.978
I know I closed the
door behind me!

00:15:23.078 --> 00:15:24.515
[FELS] Look Bell!

00:15:26.553 --> 00:15:27.287
(BELL gasp)

00:15:27.387 --> 00:15:28.355
Another key!

00:15:28.456 --> 00:15:30.493
(chuckle) Ahhh...

00:15:30.594 --> 00:15:32.565
so that's how it is, huh?

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:36.071
Which incompetent idiot
did you swipe that from?

00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:39.010
Maybe I shouldn't hand 'em
out like candy...

00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:42.050
[FELS] "Hazer"... Dix Perdix.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.555
[FELS] Are you the culprit
behind this incident?

00:15:44.655 --> 00:15:47.393
[DIX] Well, you're
a fine one to talk, mage.

00:15:47.494 --> 00:15:49.632
[DIX] Now you've got me
curious...

00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:53.507
Just what sort of relationship
do you and the Little Rookie
have with these creatures?

00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:58.215
[FELS] This man-made labyrinth
was built by none other than
Daedalus, was it not?!

00:15:58.315 --> 00:16:01.188
[FELS] How did someone
like you lay hold of it?!

00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:02.725
(DIX laugh)

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:04.161
[DIX] There's nothin' to tell.

00:16:04.261 --> 00:16:05.764
[DIX] This old baby's been
pawned off

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:07.768
from one generation to the next.

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:09.639
And as a descendant
of the bloodline,

00:16:09.739 --> 00:16:12.745
it's really nobody's business
how I choose to use it.

00:16:12.845 --> 00:16:15.249
[BELL] Descendant...? You...?

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.721
[DIX] What, is it
so hard to believe?

00:16:18.723 --> 00:16:22.497
[DIX] Fine then. I'll show you.

00:16:22.598 --> 00:16:25.971
[DIX] Definitive proof that
Daedalus... is my ancestor!

00:16:26.071 --> 00:16:27.575
(BELL surprised)
(FELS surprised)

00:16:27.675 --> 00:16:30.279
[DIX] Everyone who has that
shithead's blood flowin' through

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:34.120
their veins ends up bein' born
with eyes like this.

00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:36.391
[DIX] It's the burden we bear!

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.864
[HERMES] A man-made labyrinth...

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:43.874
And a vow that haunts Daedalus's
blood relatives to this very
day...

00:16:43.974 --> 00:16:45.677
So what I'm gettin' is...

00:16:45.777 --> 00:16:48.349
Daedalus only wanted his own
lineage carrying on his work....

00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:52.925
[HERMES] ...so he built a door
that only opens when is
recognizes their distinctive
eyes?

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:58.937
[IKELOS] Yep and Dix and his
pals gouged the eyeballs outta
some corpses and turned 'em into
"keys."

00:16:59.037 --> 00:17:00.406
[HERMES] Makes sense...

00:17:00.507 --> 00:17:03.412
[HERMES] Thanks to you,
I'm starting to understand...

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:05.751
Now we know what
we're dealing with.

00:17:07.353 --> 00:17:10.761
[HERMES] A thousand years ago,
after the gods made their
descent,

00:17:10.861 --> 00:17:14.569
they bestowed their first
blessings upon the Lower World.

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:19.645
[HERMES] Uranus introduced
Farna, and amongst his few
followers...

00:17:19.745 --> 00:17:22.383
[HERMES] ...was Daedalus.

00:17:22.483 --> 00:17:24.956
[HERMES] In accordance with
Uranus' divine will,

00:17:25.056 --> 00:17:27.761
he dedicated himself to
Orario's construction,

00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:31.769
[HERMES] and upon completing
Babel, he reveled in the gods'
praise.

00:17:31.869 --> 00:17:35.777
[HERMES] He's a genius... and
his skills went unmatched...

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:39.685
[DIX] But when said genius laid
his eyes upon the breathtaking
"work of art"

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:42.023
that stretched just beneath
the world's surface...

00:17:42.123 --> 00:17:44.494
...the crackpot lost
his freakin' mind!

00:17:44.595 --> 00:17:48.937
[HERMES] An underground
labyrinth: The Dungeon.

00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:52.443
In his eyes, it transcends
human comprehension.

00:17:52.544 --> 00:17:56.184
[HERMES] Hence, the perfect
"work of art."

00:17:58.623 --> 00:18:02.831
[DIX] It completely shattered
his dreams! It destroyed him!

00:18:02.932 --> 00:18:04.367
He became obsessed!

00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:06.338
[FELS] Once admired
for his skills,

00:18:06.438 --> 00:18:09.044
Daedalus' speech and
behavior grew erratic.

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:10.346
[FELS] They called him crazy...

00:18:10.446 --> 00:18:12.718
[FELS] Eventually he
vanished into thin air.

00:18:12.818 --> 00:18:14.054
So do you mean to tell me...?

00:18:14.154 --> 00:18:16.592
[DIX] Bingo! He left to create a
"work of art"

00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:19.431
with his own hands that would
outshine the Dungeon itself!

00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:22.738
[DIX] A man-made labyrinth
known as "Knossos"!

00:18:23.607 --> 00:18:25.176
What does that mean?

00:18:26.144 --> 00:18:27.648
[FELS] Daedalus' legacy...

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:30.554
[FELS] Am I to assume that this
place is it?

00:18:30.654 --> 00:18:33.860
[DIX] Well... it's not
quite finished yet.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.433
[HERMES] Humans are bound by
the inevitability of death.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:43.245
[HERMES] I'm guessing that even
a genius like Daedalus couldn't
compete with the mortal effects
of aging.

00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:46.753
[IKELOS] The old coot
still didn't quit.

00:18:46.853 --> 00:18:51.629
He dumped responsibility for
Knossos on his descendants,
along with the blueprints.

00:18:51.729 --> 00:18:56.138
[IKELOS] He even laid it out for
'em all nice and neat in his
little notebook.

00:18:56.238 --> 00:18:58.475
[HERMES] (surprised)
Hold on, Ikelos...

00:18:58.576 --> 00:19:00.947
[HERMES] If what you just
said is true, then...!

00:19:01.048 --> 00:19:02.350
[DIX] For a millennium...

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.722
the Daedalus bloodline
has been hammerin' away

00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:06.526
at these tunnels nonstop!

00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:07.828
(BOTH shocked)

00:19:07.928 --> 00:19:09.565
[DIX] And yet, despite a
thousand years' worth of effort,

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:12.303
the middle floors are the
deepest we've managed to get.

00:19:12.403 --> 00:19:13.606
(IKELOS cackling)

00:19:13.707 --> 00:19:15.544
[IKELOS] Oh and let
us not forget...

00:19:15.644 --> 00:19:18.850
Daedalus's project
ain't exactly cheap.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.789
It's costing us
time... and money.

00:19:21.889 --> 00:19:25.731
[HERMES] That would explain why
your Familia allied themselves
with Evilus.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:30.139
All of it was for the sake
of completing Knossos...

00:19:30.874 --> 00:19:32.544
[FELS] So capturing the Xenos

00:19:32.644 --> 00:19:35.517
and selling them as merchandise
was merely a means of procuring
funds?

00:19:35.617 --> 00:19:38.288
[DIX] Uh-huh... Well,
at first, anyway...

00:19:38.389 --> 00:19:40.159
[GLOS] Enough talk!

00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:42.397
The fact that you
disgraced my comrades

00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:45.771
and murdered Lanier in cold
blood has not changed!

00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:47.541
[GLOS] Accept your punishment!

00:19:50.346 --> 00:19:52.951
(BELL block) (annoyed)

00:19:53.052 --> 00:19:54.254
[FELS] Rhett!

00:19:54.354 --> 00:19:56.425
(RHETT affirmative) (takes off)

00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:59.230
(XENOS attack)

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.969
[DIX] I guess I have no
reason to hold back...

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.673
[DIX] Time for the big guns.

00:20:03.773 --> 00:20:04.508
(FELS notice)

00:20:04.608 --> 00:20:06.278
[FELS] Quickly, get behind me!

00:20:06.378 --> 00:20:09.384
[DIX] "Lose thyself amidst
an unending illusion"...

00:20:09.484 --> 00:20:11.589
[DIX] "Phobetor Daedalus"!

00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:16.131
(GLOS shock)

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:17.366
(LIDO shock)

00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:22.043
(XENOS pain)

00:20:22.143 --> 00:20:23.145
(GOBLIN XENOS B pain) (hit)

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:25.182
(GREEN PIG XENOS swing) (roar)

00:20:25.282 --> 00:20:27.286
(XENOS continued
fighting and pain)

00:20:27.386 --> 00:20:28.188
(TROLL A roaring)

00:20:28.288 --> 00:20:29.357
[BELL] Huh!?

00:20:29.457 --> 00:20:31.194
What's the matter
with all of them?!

00:20:31.294 --> 00:20:32.396
[FELS] A curse...

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:33.700
[FELS] It is a type of hex that,

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.171
unlike ordinary magic,
cannot be warded off.

00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:41.214
[FELS] What he cast appears to
stupefy its victims, causing
confusion and violent behavior.

00:20:41.314 --> 00:20:42.818
(XENOS pain and fighting)
[BELL] That's not good!

00:20:42.918 --> 00:20:45.857
[FELS] My robe repels status
effects and curses like this.

00:20:45.957 --> 00:20:49.397
[DIX] It looks like a couple
of 'em were able to dodge it...

00:20:49.497 --> 00:20:50.667
(DIX sarcastic sigh)

00:20:50.767 --> 00:20:51.903
[DIX] Oh well.

00:20:52.003 --> 00:20:53.238
[DIX] Let the feasting begin!

00:20:53.338 --> 00:20:54.875
(TROLL A roaring)

00:20:54.975 --> 00:20:56.178
(BELL block)

00:20:56.278 --> 00:20:58.215
(TROLL A effect)
(swing) (charge)

00:20:58.315 --> 00:21:01.321
(BELL pain)
(steadies self) (brace)

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:04.728
(LIDO attack) (blasted back)

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.471
[FELS] Forgive me, Lido...

00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:13.780
[FELS] Bell Cranel, stop Hazer!

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.483
(BELL notice)

00:21:15.584 --> 00:21:16.986
[FELS] A curse like this is

00:21:17.086 --> 00:21:18.489
broken by defeating the caster!

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.727
[FELS] The Xenos will
regain their senses!

00:21:20.827 --> 00:21:23.232
(BELL determined)
[DIX] You sure about this,
little fella

00:21:23.332 --> 00:21:25.269
[DIX] I am a level five, y'know.

00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:27.508
(BELL tense)
[FELS] Curses are powerful,

00:21:27.608 --> 00:21:30.012
but they take a toll on
those who wield them.

00:21:30.112 --> 00:21:33.252
[FELS] He ought to be feeling
the side effects at this very
moment!

00:21:33.352 --> 00:21:34.989
[DIX] Ah... Well, shit...

00:21:35.089 --> 00:21:36.592
[DIX] Guess we better
get started.

00:21:36.692 --> 00:21:38.696
[BELL, internal] A lvl. 5...

00:21:39.497 --> 00:21:41.134
[BELL] But if I can stop him,

00:21:41.234 --> 00:21:43.573
the Xenos will go
back to normal...!

00:21:44.942 --> 00:21:48.550
[BELL] Wait for me, Wiene!
I'm coming...

00:21:49.852 --> 00:21:51.454
(BELL determined)

00:21:53.058 --> 00:21:54.027
(BELL jump)

00:21:54.127 --> 00:21:56.566
(DIX cocky)
(BELL attack)

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:20.614
(Ending Song, "Evergreen")

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.890
[HESTIA] Next time:
"Dix Perdix."
