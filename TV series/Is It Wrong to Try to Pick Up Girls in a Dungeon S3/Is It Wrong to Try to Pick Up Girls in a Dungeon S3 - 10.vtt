WEBVTT

00:00:00.668 --> 00:00:10.722
(excessive scribbling)

00:00:10.822 --> 00:00:12.692
[EINA] ...He hasn't come...

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.201
[EINA] At all... Not once!

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.740
[MISHA] Uh... Hey... Uh, Eina?

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.242
[EINA] Why?!

00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:23.313
[EINA] Why in the world
hasn't he shown up yet?!

00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:27.354
(MISHA shock)
[EINA] I mean, sure. I
shouldn't have slapped
him. That's my fault!

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:29.458
[EINA] But c'mon! Even if he
can't explain,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.464
how am I supposed to feel about
the fact that he hasn't dropped
by once?!

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.237
Not even for a stupid
measly second!

00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:37.208
[MISHA] M-Miss Eina...?

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:38.945
[EINA] It's weird.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:41.349
It's weird, right,
like weirdly weird?

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.921
[EINA] I mean what kind of girl
does Bell take me for, anyway?!

00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:46.794
[EINA] And it...!
(MISHA horrified)

00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:50.467
[EINA] And it was the first time
that I've ever cried in front of
a guy...

00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:53.541
[EINA] Alright enough
of this nonsense!
(MISHA sympathy, afraid)

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:54.977
[EINA] Sir, I'm
headed out on patrol!

00:00:55.077 --> 00:00:56.513
[REHMER] Huh?! H-hold on, Tulle!

00:00:56.614 --> 00:00:58.951
[REHMER] Who's going to finish
this mountain of paperwork?!

00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:01.389
[MISHA] Listen to him,
Eina! Calm down!

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.867
If an institution falls to its
knees when one employee goes
missing, something is wrong with
the system!

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.171
(BOTH terrified)

00:01:09.272 --> 00:01:12.478
(push) I'll just have to go
find him myself! (storm off)

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.017
(EINA huffing)

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:16.386
[HERMES] Oh?

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:18.323
Hey there, Eina!

00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:19.927
Where are you off to
in such a hur-

00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:20.795
[EINA] What?!

00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:21.964
(HERMES afraid)

00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:24.135
[EINA] Oh, Lord Hermes!

00:01:25.838 --> 00:01:28.945
[HERMES] I get it now...
You're off to see Bell, right?

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:32.619
(EINA drinking)
[HERMES] Sorry to break it to
ya... He's not home today.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.221
[EINA] What?!

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:35.792
I can tell you where
to find him.

00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:38.898
But in return... would you
mind doing me small favor?

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.467
(EINA confused)

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:50.253
(ADVENTURER A notice)

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:52.191
Check it out... It's
the Little Rookie.

00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:55.531
[ADVENTURER B] We'd better make
sure he doesn't beat us to the
punch this time.

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:57.602
[ADVENTURER C] Let's
keep an eye on him.

00:01:57.702 --> 00:02:02.912
[BELL, internal] Stay calm.
Everything's fine. Don't be
afraid.

00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:06.920
[BELL, internal] I'm going
to get everyone to Knossos
safely...

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:08.490
[BELL, internal]
...no matter what!

00:02:14.503 --> 00:02:17.575
(Opening song, "over and over")

00:03:56.607 --> 00:03:58.944
All doors to Knossos have
been secured, right?

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:03.086
[ELFY] Yes! Everyone is
currently in their positions!

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:04.355
[FINN] Good.

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:06.325
[FINN] Now then...
It's time to figure out

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:08.062
which door the
monsters will choose.

00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:11.335
[ANAKITTY] Bell Cranel has
been spotted in the southeast
quadrant!

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:14.041
[FINN] I see...
Not surprising...

00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:15.611
If he's to be a diversion...

00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:19.251
the monsters ought to appear in
a completely different area.

00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:23.794
But still... it's possible
they're planning to subvert
our expectations.

00:04:23.894 --> 00:04:26.567
[AIS] Finn... I'll keep
an eye on the boy.

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:29.038
[FINN] Hmm... I'm not so sure.

00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:32.545
[FINN] Your attachment to
him presents a conflict of
interest Ais.

00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:34.583
I won't let him out of my sight.

00:04:34.683 --> 00:04:39.024
If he attempts anything
suspicious... I'll handle it.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:40.795
Should the monsters turn up...

00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:41.830
I'll stop them.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.966
(FINN pensive)

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:44.268
Very well.

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:46.038
Follow Bell Cranel then.

00:04:51.382 --> 00:04:52.284
[HESTIA] Bell!

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:54.355
(BELL notice) (run)

00:04:57.127 --> 00:04:58.463
[BELL] Yes! I'm here.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:00.668
[HESTIA] The Guild ordered
a mandatory evacuation of

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:02.839
all civilians around
Daedalus Street.

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.312
[HESTIA] Apparently, they've
moved everyone to the main road
running east.

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:08.116
[HESTIA] The operation is a go
as planned.

00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:09.318
[BELL] Understood.

00:05:09.418 --> 00:05:12.424
Okay, now Master
Welf... let's see...

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:15.063
You will want to make a
turn at the third corner.

00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:16.299
[WELF] Gotcha!

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.303
[MIKOTO] Okay. Thanks a lot.

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:23.914
Master Fels' magic items are
truly remarkable, aren't they?

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:26.419
[HARUHIME] Amazing how we can
track their locations...

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.922
while we stay in touch.

00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:29.191
[HESTIA] Uh-huh...

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:30.695
Plus, Uranus was gracious enough

00:05:30.795 --> 00:05:34.034
to lend us Daedalus'
handy-dandy notebook.

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:38.577
With this thing, we oughtta
be able to lead 'em anywhere!
(giggle)

00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:43.253
(STREET very faint chatter)

00:05:43.353 --> 00:05:45.156
[BELL, internal]
My job is to distract.

00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:47.294
[BELL, internal] I'll draw the
attention of as many adventurers

00:05:47.394 --> 00:05:49.866
and Loki Familia members
as possible.

00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:56.980
(BELL gasp)

00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:01.857
[BELL, internal] Miss Ais...?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.837
[BELL, internal] They
sent her alone...?

00:06:08.938 --> 00:06:11.677
[BELL, internal] This
wasn't part of the plan!

00:06:11.777 --> 00:06:13.781
I'd better let Goddess
Hestia know...!

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:14.783
[NAAZA] Boo!

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:15.818
(BELL startled)

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:16.920
[NAAZA] Howdy.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.022
[BELL] Miss Naaza!

00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.325
What are you doing here?!

00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:20.628
[NAAZA] Hmm...

00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:23.466
[NAAZA] I'm here to help you
guys... I guess.

00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:24.703
[BELL] Huh?

00:06:25.403 --> 00:06:26.640
[AIS, internal] A woman?

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.011
I may not know
the whole story...

00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:32.184
...but I would suspect that
you went chasing after
another girl again...

00:06:32.284 --> 00:06:35.123
and then got yourself wrapped
up in a bunch of trouble.

00:06:35.223 --> 00:06:36.627
[BELL] No it's not like that!

00:06:36.727 --> 00:06:39.431
[NAAZA] Besides, Master Miach
requested me to be here.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:42.972
[NAAZA] He said to help Bell
with whatever he needs and don't
ask questions.

00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:44.408
(BELL huh?)

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.680
[NAAZA] Heh, there's no
need to be shy, Bell...

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.918
I'm a tool at your disposal.

00:06:49.018 --> 00:06:51.690
[BELL] Um... Thanks...

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.293
[BELL] Thank you so much!

00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:56.098
(BELL sniffling)

00:06:56.198 --> 00:06:57.902
[NAAZA] Such a crybaby.

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.576
[AIS, internal] Is she
caressing him...?

00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:06.218
[NAAZA] Got it. I'll hang
on to this for you.

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.091
[BELL] Thanks...
I appreciate it.

00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:12.832
(BELL notice)

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:16.005
[BELL, internal] I have to
figure out a way to get rid
of Miss Ais...

00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:16.840
(AIS notice)

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.976
(BELL huh?)

00:07:18.076 --> 00:07:19.144
[AISHA] Bell Cranel!

00:07:19.244 --> 00:07:20.113
(BELL pain)

00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:21.182
[BELL] Miss Aisha!

00:07:21.282 --> 00:07:23.654
Wait and... Miss Ry-?

00:07:23.754 --> 00:07:26.893
[RYU] Andromeda filled us
in on the situation.

00:07:26.994 --> 00:07:29.231
[RYU] We've come to assist
you with your mission.

00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:32.237
[AISHA] If there's anything we
can do to help, just say the
word.

00:07:32.337 --> 00:07:35.076
Do you really mean
it?! Well, uh...

00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:42.057
[AIS, internal] More women...
Two of them this time...

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:45.631
[AISHA] Jeez, kid... That's
a mighty big task, y'know.

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:49.839
[RYU] Consider it done. If that
is what you wish, we'll do it.

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:52.177
[BELL] Thank you from the bottom
of m-! (stammering)

00:07:52.277 --> 00:07:54.048
[AISHA] But a word of warning:

00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:57.955
[AISHA] When this is all over,
I intend to receive my
compensation in full.

00:07:58.056 --> 00:07:59.358
(BELL gulp)

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:00.393
(BELL struggling)

00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:01.763
[RYU] Unhand Mr. Cranel!

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:04.703
If you do not comply,
I'll strike you down first.

00:08:04.803 --> 00:08:06.138
[AISHA] Go ahead and try!

00:08:06.238 --> 00:08:08.944
I've been robbed of my
reward far too many times.

00:08:09.044 --> 00:08:10.981
(BELL smothered)
[AISHA] I can't take it much
longer. (giggles)

00:08:11.082 --> 00:08:12.250
(BELL swung around)

00:08:13.654 --> 00:08:15.825
[AIS, internal] Is she...
smothering him?

00:08:15.925 --> 00:08:17.494
(RYU grunt)

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:22.939
[BELL, internal] Oh thank
goodness they got outta here.
(turn)

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.509
[BELL, internal] She's
still staring!

00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:25.443
[EINA] Bell!

00:08:25.544 --> 00:08:27.180
(BELL startled)

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.184
[BELL] M-Miss Eina?!

00:08:29.284 --> 00:08:31.923
[BELL] Wh...whatcha
doing here...?

00:08:32.024 --> 00:08:34.361
I waited days for you
to show up you know.

00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:35.664
So I was forced to come to you!

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.535
(wince) I'm sorry!

00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:39.572
Well, y'see...
it's embarrassing!

00:08:39.672 --> 00:08:40.841
I was ashamed to look at you!

00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:43.212
You could have sent me
a note or something,

00:08:43.312 --> 00:08:44.783
it's the least you
could have done!

00:08:44.883 --> 00:08:46.152
(BELL being shook)
[EINA] Am I just a girl that

00:08:46.252 --> 00:08:47.789
you only care about
whenever it's convenient?!

00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:49.726
[BELL] Wha--?! Please
don't say that!

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:51.630
That's a very misleading
implication!

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.934
[EINA] At any rate...
you aren't going home until

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:57.340
I get satisfactory answers...
to all of my questions!
(BELL lifted)

00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:00.748
[BELL] Wa-... Wait! Miss Eina,
please...! (struggling)
(EINA struggling)

00:09:00.848 --> 00:09:05.591
[AIS] Yet another woman. Why
are there so many women?
[BELL] Please hear me
out, Miss Eina!

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.964
[AIS, internal] Is Bell...
a playboy?

00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:13.774
[BELL] I swear it's nothing like
that at all... (struggling)

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:16.680
You think he's okay? He's
been yelling quite a while...

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.382
(HESTIA nervous laugh)

00:09:18.483 --> 00:09:21.355
Sounds like he's dealing
with an unexpected snag in
the plan, huh?

00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:24.863
Don't think there's much we
can do about it from here...

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:28.169
[HESTIA] Welf, Mikoto!

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:30.140
The Xenos should be up ahead...

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.712
They're laying low inside
of that drainage canal.

00:09:32.812 --> 00:09:35.985
[WELF] Roger that...
Lady Hestia.

00:09:38.222 --> 00:09:40.995
[LIDO] Our dreams of
seeing the sky came true...

00:09:41.095 --> 00:09:44.234
and yet we're forced to slink
around underground again.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:48.109
[LIDO] We might be destined for
a life in the shadows, after
all...

00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:52.652
(WIENE somber) (notice)

00:09:53.754 --> 00:09:55.156
[WELF] Sorry for the wait.

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:56.893
[REI] Mr. Welf, Miss Mikoto.

00:09:56.993 --> 00:09:59.364
[MIKOTO] What a relief...
You're all safe and sound.

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:02.572
[WIENE] Is Bell doing okay...?

00:10:02.672 --> 00:10:05.076
For now, you must have
faith in the brat, Wiene.

00:10:05.176 --> 00:10:08.617
[GLOS] You do want to "return
the favor," don't you?

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:10.253
(WIENE nod)

00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:12.157
[FELS] It's your turn, Lido.

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:13.359
[LIDO] I'm on it.

00:10:20.774 --> 00:10:24.816
(LIDO howling)

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:38.075
(XENOS howling back)

00:10:38.577 --> 00:10:40.146
(LILI notice)

00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:42.919
(BOTH struggling) (notice)

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:45.223
[BELL, internal] Mr. Lido...!

00:10:45.323 --> 00:10:46.392
(BELL gasp)

00:10:52.672 --> 00:10:54.007
(LIDO land)

00:10:54.107 --> 00:10:58.584
[REI] Fia... and Rhett...
Helga... and also Alulu...

00:10:58.684 --> 00:11:01.388
[REI] I don't hear Asterius'
voice among them.

00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:04.461
[GLOS] I highly doubt that it's
a matter of being loud enough.

00:11:04.562 --> 00:11:07.300
[GLOS] He's either keeping his
mouth shut on purpose, or...

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.275
[FELS] We must forge ahead...
Believe in your comrades.

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:15.250
(XENOS howling)

00:11:19.993 --> 00:11:27.708
(ASTERIUS heavy breathing)
(growling)

00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:38.362
[FREYA] Ottarl... Have a second?
[OTTARL] Ma'am.

00:11:38.462 --> 00:11:43.941
I need arrangements made...
However... they may prove to
be an utter waste of our time.

00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:46.680
[FREYA] Even I cannot predict
how this'll play out.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.990
[OTTARL] Regardless of
circumstance... I shall
abide by your divine will.

00:11:52.758 --> 00:11:54.294
[ADVENTURER D] Where are they?!

00:11:54.394 --> 00:11:57.868
[ADVENTURER D] Damn monsters!
Where's that noise coming from?!

00:11:57.969 --> 00:12:02.110
(TOWNSPEOPLE looking
for monsters)

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:06.018
(scared) Dammit! This sucks!
I'm freaking out.

00:12:06.118 --> 00:12:07.855
Why do I always have to
do the dirty work...?!

00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:11.796
(LILI stressed) (deep breath)

00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:13.967
"Thy scars belong to me;

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.272
my scars belong to me..."

00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:19.579
[ADVENTURER F] (surprised)
Hey! Look behind you!

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:20.915
[ADVENTURER G] It's an al-miraj!

00:12:21.015 --> 00:12:22.250
(LILI question) (hop away)

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.754
[ADVENTURER F] Eat this!

00:12:23.854 --> 00:12:29.999
(LILI terrified kyu) (scared)

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:31.770

00:12:34.575 --> 00:12:37.147
[LILI] "The clock tolls
midnight"!

00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.627
[ADVENTURER D] Hey!
Which way did it go?!

00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:46.098
[LILI] Th-that way...

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.706
Master Fels... you're
just the worst...!

00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:51.241
(TOWNSPEOPLE in pursuit
of monsters)

00:12:51.342 --> 00:12:53.112
[ADVENTURER D] It's over there!
[ADVENTURER E] After it!

00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:55.751
[ADVENTURER F] Don't
let it get away!

00:12:55.851 --> 00:12:57.788
[ADVENTURER G] Drive
it into a corner!

00:12:57.888 --> 00:13:01.596
[BELL, internal] Lili's on
the move... I have to go!

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:03.165
Miss Eina, please!

00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:05.236
(EINA startled)
(confused) (shock)

00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:08.877
[BELL] Sorry! When this is
over, you can yell at me
as much as you want!

00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:10.179
(BELL running)
(EINA confused)

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:11.315
[EINA] Wait, Bell!

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:12.518
(EINA notice)

00:13:14.856 --> 00:13:17.460
[HERMES] I'd like you to
deliver this to Bell.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.001
[EINA] Oh I forgot to
give it to him...

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:26.145
[EINA] Oh...huh? ..The heck?
I-it won't come off!

00:13:27.414 --> 00:13:29.619
[ADVENTURER H] The Little
Rookie's makin' a run for it!

00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:31.088
[ADVENTURER I] After him!

00:13:31.188 --> 00:13:35.029
[BELL, internal] Miss Ais...
She's still following me!

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:36.833
[BELL, internal] If I
don't do something quick,

00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:38.904
our whole plan goes up in smoke!

00:13:39.004 --> 00:13:41.075
[BELL, internal] I've
gotta get outta sight.

00:13:42.645 --> 00:13:47.555
(BOTH heavy breathing)

00:13:47.655 --> 00:13:48.690
[ADVENTURER H] He's gone!

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.961
[ADVENTURER J]
The hell did he go?!

00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:52.397
[ADVENTURER A]
Hey, look! He's way over there!

00:13:52.497 --> 00:13:54.134
[ADVENTURER A] He went inside
that building!

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:56.038
[ADVENTURER I] You're wrong!
He circled behind us now!

00:13:56.138 --> 00:13:59.612
(panic) What the?! A swarm
of monsters...! (worried)

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:01.081
(ADVENTURERS confusion,
arguing, panic)

00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:04.722
[NAAZA] Wow... It really does
cause hallucinations.

00:14:04.822 --> 00:14:06.191
[NAAZA] Incredible...

00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:08.597
Where did that boy manage
to get his hands on this...?

00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:09.799
[ADVENTURER J] Where is he?!

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:10.801
[ADVENTURER A] Dammit...

00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:11.770
[ADVENTURER I] Over there!

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.542
[AIS] Did he... disappear?

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:21.255
[BELL] Thanks for the
help, Miss Naaza.

00:14:22.725 --> 00:14:24.896
[AIS] (disagree) I sense him.

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:27.333
[AIS] This way.

00:14:29.104 --> 00:14:33.345
[RYU] Sword Princess.
I challenge you to a duel.

00:14:33.446 --> 00:14:35.751
[AIS] Now? Right here?

00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:38.022
[RYU] I, myself, am an outcast.

00:14:38.122 --> 00:14:41.095
Were it not for these
extenuating circumstances,

00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:43.567
I could not hope to
cross swords with you.

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:46.438
[RYU] I urge you to cooperate.

00:14:50.581 --> 00:14:53.987
[HARUHIME] Is she going to be
alright? The elven woman, I
mean...

00:14:54.087 --> 00:14:59.866
[HESTIA] Wallen-whatser-hoozit
might be ridiculously strong...
but the elf can hold her own.

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:03.974
[HESTIA] Plus with the extra
power from your Level Boost...
She's good.

00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:05.143
[BELL] Goddess!

00:15:05.243 --> 00:15:06.713
[BELL] Thanks to Miss Ryu...

00:15:06.813 --> 00:15:08.784
I was able to get
away from Miss Ais.

00:15:08.884 --> 00:15:10.621
[HESTIA] Nicely done, Bell!

00:15:10.721 --> 00:15:12.157
Try to hold their attention.

00:15:12.257 --> 00:15:15.363
Go confuse the heck outta the
Loki Familia and the others!

00:15:15.463 --> 00:15:16.900
[BELL] Roger!

00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:20.774
[HESTIA] Easier
said than done...

00:15:20.874 --> 00:15:25.684
[HESTIA] The Loki Familia is a
force to be reckoned with. They
still haven't broken formation.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.824
[ANAKITTY] An al-miraj has
surfaced in the southern sector!

00:15:28.924 --> 00:15:32.397
[ANAKITTY] And there're
eyewitness reports of
monsters southeast!

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:34.535
[ELFY] Bell Cranel
is out there, too!

00:15:34.635 --> 00:15:38.877
It would appear that Miss Ais
has been delayed by an unknown
assailant!

00:15:38.977 --> 00:15:42.852
Pay no mind to Bell Cranel...
Ais will catch up.

00:15:42.952 --> 00:15:45.123
Maintain present formation.

00:15:45.223 --> 00:15:47.460
Any word on the
black minotaur?

00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:49.297
I'm afraid
nothing yet.

00:15:49.397 --> 00:15:51.769
Continue to monitor
the situation.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.809
[FINN, internal] Presumably,
the monsters have flocked
together...

00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:57.280
[FINN, internal] For such a
large number to avoid detection,

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.351
they either
possess magic items...

00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:02.725
or someone familiar with
the area is guiding them.

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:04.962
[FINN] Perhaps even both...

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:10.674
[RAUL] Looks like the party's
gettin' started down south...

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:14.314
[RAUL] It's too bad that the
captain ordered us not to leave
our posts.

00:16:14.414 --> 00:16:16.084
[FINN] Raul!
(RAUL surprised)

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:17.888
[RAUL] Captain?!
What are you doing here?

00:16:17.988 --> 00:16:19.391
[RAUL] Shouldn't you be at the-?

00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:22.598
Around the headquarters...
a horde of monsters appeared!

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:25.737
[FINN] Make your way
to the area immediately!
(RAUL confusion)

00:16:25.838 --> 00:16:27.273
[RAUL] The central sector?!

00:16:27.373 --> 00:16:29.010
[FINN] Which reminds me...

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.148
What's the status of the
fortified Knossos entrances?

00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:32.718
[RAUL] Uh, lemme think...

00:16:32.818 --> 00:16:35.591
[RAUL] Miss Riveria, Mr. Gareth,
and both their teams...

00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:38.195
are guarding the four doors
we discovered in the northwest,

00:16:38.295 --> 00:16:41.268
northeast, southwest, and
southeast quadrants!

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:45.644
[FINN] Good. Everyone pack up
your equipment and head towards
the central sector...

00:16:45.744 --> 00:16:47.447
I'll head southeast.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.284
[RAUL] Y-yes, sir!

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:55.229
[FINN] "The clock
tolls midnight"!

00:16:58.235 --> 00:17:01.441
[LILI] As gullible as
Master Bell! Lady Hestia!

00:17:01.543 --> 00:17:07.788
[LILI] As predicted, they're
at four entrances...
Northwest, northeast,
southwest, and southeast.

00:17:07.888 --> 00:17:09.859
[HESTIA] Ey Attagirl,
Miss Supporter!

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.663
[HARUHIME] Fantastic, Lady Lili!

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:14.702
[HESTIA] Our enemies have a
tight grip on four out of the
six doors...

00:17:14.802 --> 00:17:18.743
[HESTIA] The unguarded door
closest to the Xenos' current
location is...

00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:21.415
[HESTIA] ...out west!

00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:24.087
Hey, Fels! The western
entrance is clear!

00:17:24.187 --> 00:17:26.458
[FELS] Understood,
Goddess Hestia.

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:31.001
[WELF] When we step outside...
the Loki Familia's our threat.

00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:34.040
[MIKOTO] Thanks to Master
Bell... the surface is in
chaos....

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.413
Slip past them... and
advance to the west door.

00:17:37.514 --> 00:17:40.453
[LIDO] Alright... Is everyone
ready?

00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:43.827
(WIENE somber)

00:17:43.927 --> 00:17:45.196
[LIDO] Move out!

00:17:50.741 --> 00:17:54.147
[ELFY] A group of monsters are
storming the surface in the
western sector!

00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:57.186
[FINN] What the?
What's Raul's team doing!?

00:17:57.287 --> 00:17:58.455
[RAUL] Huh? Captain?

00:17:58.556 --> 00:18:00.126
[ANAKITTY] Raul?!
Why are you here?

00:18:00.226 --> 00:18:02.363
[RAUL] Wait... the captain
just ordered us here

00:18:02.463 --> 00:18:03.700
a few moments ago, right?

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.104
[ANAKITTY] No, he never
asked you to do that.

00:18:06.204 --> 00:18:08.409
[RAUL] But he delivered his
orders in person...

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.279
[FINN, internal] They've
outsmarted us...

00:18:10.379 --> 00:18:12.116
[FINN, internal] A type of
magic? A magic item?

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:15.991
[FINN] What's their projected
route? Which direction are they
moving?

00:18:16.091 --> 00:18:17.761
(ELFY look)

00:18:17.861 --> 00:18:22.003
[ELFY] To the east, almost like
they're making a beeline for
something.

00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:24.374
[FINN] Eastbound?

00:18:24.474 --> 00:18:27.080
We uncovered a total of four
doors that lead underground.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:32.725
[FINN] They surfaced in the
west, which means that they
ought to be moving northeast or
southeast.

00:18:32.825 --> 00:18:36.532
[FINN , internal] Is there
another door that we don't know
about...?

00:18:40.574 --> 00:18:42.711
[LIDO] Bellcchi and
Lilicchi did great!

00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:44.849
[LIDO] There's nobody around!

00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:47.220
[FELS] Stay on your toes!

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.790
[FELS] Here they come!

00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:53.432
(ADVENTURERS panting)

00:18:56.973 --> 00:18:58.475
(ADVENTURERS pain/struggle)

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:05.590
[ARCHER A] Now! Take aim!
(ARCHERS focus) (pain)

00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:10.867
[MIKOTO] You crafted these
to avoid harming the city...
didn't you Welf?

00:19:10.967 --> 00:19:12.270
[WELF] Damn straight!

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.274
[HARUHIME] If you follow the
path a little longer,

00:19:14.374 --> 00:19:15.844
you'll reach a large plaza.

00:19:15.944 --> 00:19:17.480
[HARUHIME] Keep
on straight ahead!

00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:19.184
[MIKOTO] Roger, Lady Haruhime!

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:22.925
[HESTIA] Heck yeah! Nice work...
Kick some Loki ass!

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:26.666
[LOKI FAMILIA MEMBER A] Now!

00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:30.774
[WELF] Not on your life!

00:19:30.874 --> 00:19:32.176
[WELF] Hien!

00:19:33.312 --> 00:19:34.447
(LOKI FAMILIA MEMBERS shouting)

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.018
[LIDO] Thanks a
million, Welfcchi!

00:19:36.118 --> 00:19:38.857
[FELS] Perfect! This is our
chance to make a break for it!

00:19:38.957 --> 00:19:40.159
(LIDO notice)

00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:42.698
(GARETH yelling)

00:19:43.198 --> 00:19:45.604
(ALL scream)

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.524
(GARETH notice)

00:19:55.624 --> 00:19:57.060
[GARETH] A bit excessive...

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.435
I foresee yet another lecture
from Riveria in my future...

00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:03.940
(GARETH question)

00:20:05.577 --> 00:20:06.779
[GARETH] Magic sword, eh?

00:20:06.879 --> 00:20:10.319
[WELF] Lemme handle him...
Go on without me!

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:11.388
[FELS] Thank you.

00:20:11.488 --> 00:20:13.526
[FELS] Everyone! Time to move!

00:20:13.626 --> 00:20:17.200
(GARETH grunt)

00:20:18.168 --> 00:20:20.473
(WELF brace, fling)

00:20:20.574 --> 00:20:25.249
(GARETH grunt)
(wind up)

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:28.823
[GARETH] Aha...
There're two of ya'.

00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:33.733
[GARETH] Come what may,
I shall pursue those monsters...

00:20:34.902 --> 00:20:36.004
[GARETH] Stay outta my way!

00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:38.008
(WELF brace)

00:20:38.108 --> 00:20:40.814
[MIKOTO] Okay! Let's
test this blade!

00:20:40.914 --> 00:20:41.849
[MIKOTO] Fubu!

00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.218
(GARETH grunt)

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.095
[HESTIA] Alright! The Xenos are
on the move!

00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:51.502
[HESTIA] Keep it up guys! Come
on! Hold out!

00:20:51.602 --> 00:20:55.677
(gasp) You see that?! No way...

00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:57.313
(HESTIA gasp)

00:20:57.413 --> 00:20:58.282
[HESTIA] Wiene?!

00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:04.427
(WIENE nervous breathing)

00:21:04.528 --> 00:21:06.331
[WIENE] Hey guys? You there?

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:10.941
(WIENE nervous breathing)

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:15.116
[HESTIA] Turn around, Wiene!
You're going the wrong way!

00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:17.588
[HESTIA] Wh-...what
do we do...?!

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.059
[HARUHIME] I shall retrieve her.

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:20.994
[HESTIA] Huh?!

00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:24.535
(HARUHIME land)

00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:26.639
[HESTIA] Wait-! Haruhime, no!

00:21:29.578 --> 00:21:31.949
[HESTIA] This is bad...
Really bad!

00:21:32.049 --> 00:21:32.985
(HESTIA notice)

00:21:33.987 --> 00:21:35.055
[HESTIA] Bell!

00:21:35.156 --> 00:21:36.926
[HESTIA] We lost Wiene!
(BELL gasp)

00:21:37.026 --> 00:21:39.497
[HESTIA] And Haruhime took off
before I could stop her!

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:41.301
[HESTIA] We gotta help!

00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:42.905
[BELL] Wiene's all alone...

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.589
(WIENE grunting)

00:21:54.093 --> 00:21:55.362
[WIENE] You guys...?

00:21:55.462 --> 00:21:56.632
[TIONA] Whoa...

00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:58.503
(WIENE gasp)

00:21:58.603 --> 00:22:00.807
[TIONA] Didn't expect
one way out here.

00:22:00.907 --> 00:22:03.312
(WIENE terror)

00:22:03.412 --> 00:22:08.021
[TIONA] Welp! Bumpin' into a
monster ain't the worst thing
ever.

00:22:09.558 --> 00:22:11.194
[TIONA] This won't take long!

00:22:11.294 --> 00:22:13.600
(WIENE terrified)

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:20.614
