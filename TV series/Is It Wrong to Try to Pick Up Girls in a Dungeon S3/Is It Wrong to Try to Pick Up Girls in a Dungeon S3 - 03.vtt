WEBVTT

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:05.612
[MISHA] Aw, and I just finished
my night shift...!

00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:08.885
[GUILD COWORKER A] It's an
emergency! There's no time to
complain!

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:10.589
[GUILD SUPERIOR A] You two!
(BOTH startled)

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.826
Finish your reports then
run the service counter!

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:14.930
[GUILD SUPERIOR A]
We're short-staffed!
(BOTH whiney)

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.734
(angry mob)
[CITIZEN A] What's is going on?!

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:18.104
[CITIZEN B] We deserve
an explanation!
[EINA] My apologies!

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:19.773
[EINA] The Guild is currently
in the process

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:21.444
of investigating... yesterday's

00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:22.946
monster-related
incident, you see!

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:26.154
That thing attacked a child!
No one's safe anymore!

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:29.994
We are working hard to assess
the situation as quickly as
possible!

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:32.232
[REHMER] Enough Eina.
Pack it in.
(EINA notice)

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.935
[EINA] But sir... you sure?

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:36.140
[REHMER] The Guildmaster
wants a word.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.276
(EINA question)

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:40.415
[EINA] You wanted to see me?

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:41.984
(ROYMAN serious)

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:43.221
(EINA gasp)

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.561
Please deliver these
instructions

00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:49.166
to Bell Cranel of
the Hestia Familia.

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.669
[EINA] To Mr. Cranel...?

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.206
[ROYMAN] Do not ask questions.

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:54.610
This matter is of
a confidential nature.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.645
(EINA notice)

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:56.814
The Guild has issued

00:00:56.914 --> 00:00:58.218
a distinct mission...

00:00:58.318 --> 00:01:00.121
to the Hestia Familia.

00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:01.022
(EINA serious)

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:04.430
(Opening Song, "over and over")

00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:37.149
[BELL] A mission, you said...?

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.920
[EINA] Mmhm. As you
may already know...

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.192
missions are quite
different from quests...

00:02:42.292 --> 00:02:44.863
They're a type of
mandatory assignment.

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.834
[EINA] You are unable to refuse.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:50.408
(BELL notice) (think)

00:02:50.508 --> 00:02:52.512
(EINA nod)

00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:55.418
[EINA] Normally, missions are
assigned to the much larger
Familias...

00:02:55.518 --> 00:03:00.161
I can't imagine why the Hestia
Familia would be chosen for such
a thing...

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:05.839
(BELL gasp, anger)

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.713
[BELL, internal] "Proceed to
the 20th Floor of the Dungeon
with the dragon girl..."

00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:15.057
[BELL, internal] What?! But
how...? How does the Guild
know about Wiene...?!

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.927
[EINA] Bell?

00:03:17.028 --> 00:03:17.829
(BELL surprised)

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.301
[EINA] Are you okay?

00:03:20.402 --> 00:03:22.205
(BELL stammering)

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:23.841
Don't worry about
it... I'm fine.

00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:25.779
(EINA worried)

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.486
[EINA] It's okay Bell...
What's wrong?

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:30.555
(BELL surprised)

00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:31.791
Tell me what it is.

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:34.396
I want to help you out...
Just say it.

00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:35.231
(EINA surprised)

00:03:35.332 --> 00:03:36.634
(BELL sigh)

00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:38.304
[BELL] I gotta go...

00:03:38.404 --> 00:03:39.907
(EINA notice)

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:44.316
(door closing)

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.460
[WELF] I guess we got caught
during yesterday's fiasco...

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.167
[LILI] You're wrong... If
that were true, then this
is way too soon.

00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:56.474
[LILI] The Guild knows
everything, even Lady
Wiene's species.

00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:59.380
[LILI] I can only assume that
they found out a while back...

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.154
[LILI] The thing is, I have
no idea what they're trying
to accomplish.

00:04:03.254 --> 00:04:05.592
[LILI] We aren't being
sanctioned yet for one thing...

00:04:05.692 --> 00:04:08.898
And well they aren't
demanding that Lady
Wiene surrender either.

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:13.006
[LILI] Instead, they're
sending us to the 20th
Floor of the Dungeon...

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:16.380
I wonder... Why would they
ask us to bring Lady Wiene?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.488
I don't know. I mean what could
be the point of all this...?

00:04:20.588 --> 00:04:22.592
You think we can we pull it off?

00:04:22.692 --> 00:04:24.663
Gettin' to that
Floor isn't easy.

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:26.300
[MIKOTO] Sure isn't.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.738
Plus none of us have ever
been there before.

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:32.846
[WELF] Sounds like it's all or
nothing... our safety be damned.

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:35.652
If we raise our levels using
Lady Haruhime's sorcery,

00:04:35.752 --> 00:04:38.725
we ought to satisfy the floor's
accessibility requirements.

00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:44.136
[LILI] But make no mistake.
It will be a dangerous journey,
to say the very least.

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:46.207
[MIKOTO] So then what
should we do?

00:04:46.307 --> 00:04:49.813
[LILI] It was never our choice.
We aren't allowed to refuse.

00:04:49.913 --> 00:04:51.350
[BELL] I'm sorry...

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.623
Everything is
all my fault...

00:04:54.723 --> 00:04:56.627
[HARUHIME] Master Bell...

00:04:58.831 --> 00:04:59.666
(BELL notice)

00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:01.137
You saved Lady Wiene...

00:05:01.237 --> 00:05:03.241
Please don't be so upset
with yourself...

00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:06.012
(BELL surprised)
[HARUHIME] Everyone
came to my rescue,

00:05:06.113 --> 00:05:08.451
and now I know true happiness.

00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:11.724
[HARUHIME] I'm certain that Lady
Wiene feels the same.

00:05:11.824 --> 00:05:12.826
[HARUHIME] So please...!

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:15.231
(BELL gasp)

00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:17.034
(LILI grabbing)
(HARUHIME yelp)
(BELL surprised)

00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:18.003
(LILI hmph)
(HARUHIME gasp)

00:05:18.104 --> 00:05:19.473
[WELF] What she's tryin'

00:05:19.573 --> 00:05:20.575
to say is, don't apologize.

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:21.677
(ALL notice)

00:05:21.777 --> 00:05:22.846
We are a Familia...

00:05:22.946 --> 00:05:24.183
We support each other.

00:05:24.283 --> 00:05:26.987
That's right, we are
all in this together!

00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:29.626
[WELF] Yeah, see. That's it.

00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:30.795
(LILI annoyed)

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:32.365
I suppose that's true.

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:34.736
It is my job as Master
Bell's supporter...

00:05:34.837 --> 00:05:36.907
to be of assistance to him.

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:38.678

00:05:38.778 --> 00:05:40.181

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:06.901
(WIENE hm?)

00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:07.836
(WIENE notice)

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:09.473
(BELL happy)

00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:12.712
[WIENE] Bell?

00:06:12.813 --> 00:06:15.050
[BELL] I have some news, Wiene.

00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:19.493
[WIENE] The Dungeon...?

00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:22.699
[BELL] Mmhmm... I'd like
for you to join us.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.436
(WIENE nervous)

00:06:25.972 --> 00:06:26.941
[BELL] That a "no"?

00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:27.976
(WIENE upset)

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:29.179
(BELL sigh)

00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:32.786
[WIENE] I'll go.

00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:33.988
Wiene...

00:06:34.088 --> 00:06:36.025
[WIENE] I'm scared... but um...

00:06:37.395 --> 00:06:40.668
If I'm with everyone...
it won't be bad.

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.010
(BELL surprised) (happy)

00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:51.257
[WIENE] Thanks for always
looking out for me.

00:06:51.357 --> 00:06:56.467
I love you... Bell... so much.

00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:08.324
(DIX happy)

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.194
[DIX] It's time!

00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:12.699
[DIX] Follow the Hestia Familia!

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.473
[HERMES] They're on the move...

00:07:16.574 --> 00:07:19.213
and using Bell and his
friends as bait, no less.

00:07:19.313 --> 00:07:21.584
[HERMES] Uranus, you bastard...

00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:26.493
[HERMES] The rest
is up to you, Asfi.

00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:35.545
[WIENE] Bell...

00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:36.914
Everything's okay.

00:07:37.014 --> 00:07:39.152
[BELL] Bye, Goddess! I'll see
you soon!

00:07:39.253 --> 00:07:42.692
[HESTIA] Kay! Be sure to
come back in one piece.

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:48.137
(HESTIA smile) (serious)

00:07:48.237 --> 00:07:50.408
Well, here goes.

[HESTIA] Are you the one who
summoned me here?

00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:04.336
[FELS] It is a pleasure to meet
you, Goddess Hestia.

00:08:04.436 --> 00:08:07.275

apologies for the inconvenience.

have set out... Please make
your way to 4th Street in
District 7."

00:08:12.886 --> 00:08:17.829
[HESTIA] Hiding a message in the
Language of the Gods. That was a
clever little trick.

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:21.904
Are you for certain
that you are mortal?

00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:23.808
[HESTIA] That aura is odd.

00:08:23.908 --> 00:08:25.043
[FELS] My goodness...

00:08:25.144 --> 00:08:26.513
[FELS] Disguises prove
meaningless

00:08:26.614 --> 00:08:29.720
in the presence of

00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:32.192

[LILI] Quickly,

00:08:45.218 --> 00:08:47.021
[WELF] Step it up!

[BELL] Fire Bolt! Ah!

00:08:56.507 --> 00:09:01.950
[LILI] The 19th Floor is just
through there... The real
challenge begins ahead.

00:09:02.051 --> 00:09:03.454
Let's recap once more.

00:09:03.554 --> 00:09:05.892
[LILI] Our magic swords...
What d'we have?

00:09:05.992 --> 00:09:07.228
[WELF] Three in total.

00:09:07.329 --> 00:09:08.631
They're for emergencies.

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.203
[LILI] And you're going
to cast your Level-Boost

00:09:11.303 --> 00:09:13.974
on Master Welf... once
we hit the 19th floor.

00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:15.178
[HARUHIME] Right.

00:09:15.278 --> 00:09:17.014
[LILI] Then Lady Mikoto's up.

00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:18.784
Yes I know what to do.

00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:20.221
I will go scout out the level..

00:09:20.321 --> 00:09:21.857
And search for nearby monsters.

00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:23.594

[HESTIA] Who'da thought all
this was down here...?

[FELS] Those who know of this
passageway's existence

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.183
are few and far between,
let alone those who have
made use of it.

00:09:51.283 --> 00:09:53.254
[FELS] I can count
the number on one hand.

00:09:53.354 --> 00:09:55.291
I can only guess that
this must have been built

00:09:55.391 --> 00:09:58.330

[FELS] My work here is complete.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.334
[URANUS] Been a long
time... Hestia.

00:10:50.435 --> 00:10:54.309
I had a feeling it
was you... Uranus...

00:10:59.219 --> 00:11:02.057
[HESTIA] The mission we received
was your doing, wasn't it?

00:11:02.158 --> 00:11:03.461
[URANUS] Correct.

00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:05.598
Bell and the others aren't
in harm's way, are they?

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:08.370
[URANUS] Their destination
lies in the Dungeon.

00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:09.906
[URANUS] Which comes with harm.

00:11:10.006 --> 00:11:11.343

(LIZARDMAN A die)

00:11:17.122 --> 00:11:18.190
[WIENE] Be careful! (react)

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.326
[BELL] Just stay behind me!

(WIENE afraid)

00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:23.734
[WELF] Fall back, Bell!
(BOTH surprised)

(LIZARDMAN B slashed)
(MIKOTO slash) (notice)

00:11:29.212 --> 00:11:30.248
[MIKOTO] There's another wave!

00:11:30.348 --> 00:11:31.150
(BOTH gasp)

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.452

(BELL gasp) (bracing)
(WIENE turn) (bracing)

00:11:34.356 --> 00:11:35.925
[LILI] I'm using a magic sword!

00:11:36.025 --> 00:11:37.896
(LILI attack)

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.319
[WELF] So this is
the 20th Floor...

00:11:49.419 --> 00:11:51.690
I'm sorry... I wasted a sword.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.627
[WELF] Nah, that
was a good call.

00:11:53.727 --> 00:11:56.300
[WELF] A second later and
we would've been goners.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.804
[WIENE] Are you okay, Welf...
and Lili?

00:11:58.904 --> 00:12:01.343
[WELF] Yup... Doing good.
(LILI happy)

00:12:01.443 --> 00:12:03.681
[WIENE] That is good!
I'm so glad!

00:12:03.781 --> 00:12:06.186
[HARUHIME] They're fine...
because they're so strong.

00:12:06.286 --> 00:12:09.159
(WIENE agree)

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:10.695
Master Bell... As I feared,

00:12:10.795 --> 00:12:13.667
they are specifically
targeting Lady Wiene.

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:14.536
Yeah.

00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:15.805
I shall defend
her to the best

00:12:15.905 --> 00:12:17.675
of my ability...
...but we can't handle

00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:19.546
another large-scale ambush.

00:12:19.646 --> 00:12:22.017
[BELL] Don't worry.
Rest assured...

00:12:22.118 --> 00:12:24.322
I'll protect her with my life.

00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:27.562
[HESTIA] Am I to assume that
you called me here

00:12:27.662 --> 00:12:31.035
because of Wiene... you know,
the dragon girl?

00:12:31.136 --> 00:12:32.906
[HESTIA] What exactly is she?

00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:35.611
[HESTIA] What's going on
in the Dungeon right now?

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:38.584
[HESTIA] What are you hiding?

00:12:38.684 --> 00:12:41.423
[HESTIA] And what's
your endgame?

00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:48.270
[URANUS] Let us
discuss it... Hestia.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.608
[MIKOTO] Lady Lili...
Are you sure this is it?

00:12:50.708 --> 00:12:55.050
Yes, I'm positive of it...
We should be in the correct
place...

00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:57.322
There's nothing... here.

Dammit...

00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:01.430
[WELF] What does the

00:13:14.088 --> 00:13:15.858
I hear something..

00:13:21.002 --> 00:13:21.870
...a song.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.107

[MIKOTO] But where's it coming
from...?

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:38.737
[LILI] (reax) A song echoing
through the Dungeon...

00:13:45.351 --> 00:13:47.822
[WIENE] Where are

This place isn't on the

[HARUHIME] Master Bell?

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.947
[BELL] Mikoto... Any

00:14:34.048 --> 00:14:37.555

to when these creatures first
sprang forth into existence.

[URANUS] Nevertheless, we
observed their behavior and

we have provided them with

[HESTIA] What? The Guild

(HESTIA realize)
[URANUS] Precisely.

00:18:41.343 --> 00:18:45.718
[URANUS] For the same reason
you and your children took in
the dragon girl.

00:18:45.818 --> 00:18:47.722
[URANUS] The primary objective
of their mission....

00:18:47.822 --> 00:18:51.997
was to escort her back to
her comrades in the heart
of the Dungeon.

That means... Bell and

Yes. If they survive
the journey,

00:18:57.441 --> 00:19:01.283
they should be arriving

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.216
[MIKOTO] There're
dozens of them...

00:19:18.317 --> 00:19:20.187
[BELL] (shock) Huh?

00:19:20.287 --> 00:19:22.124
[LIDO] The name's Lido.
(BELL confused)

00:19:22.224 --> 00:19:24.963
[LIDO] As you can see,
I'm a Lizardman.

00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:27.435
[LIDO] How goes it, Bell Cranel?

00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:29.138
[BELL] Uh... uh....

00:19:29.238 --> 00:19:31.276
[LIDO] Mind if I
call you "Bellcchi"?

00:19:31.376 --> 00:19:32.545
[BELL] Huh?!

00:19:32.645 --> 00:19:34.716
[BELL] Oh... sure... it's fine.

00:19:34.816 --> 00:19:35.951
[LIDO] Bellcchi!

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.521
[BELL] (shock) Um, uh, yeah?

00:19:37.622 --> 00:19:38.790
[LIDO] Put 'er there.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:39.692
(BELL gulp)

00:19:39.792 --> 00:19:41.463
(nervous)

00:19:41.563 --> 00:19:43.467
(BELL scared)

00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:46.806
(BELL scared)

00:19:48.844 --> 00:19:50.079
(BELL nervous)

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.885
[LILI] Master Bell...!
(disagree)

00:19:52.985 --> 00:19:55.290
(BELL nervous) (notice)

00:19:55.391 --> 00:19:57.060
(WIENE worried)

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.367
(BELL gulp)

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:03.373
(nervous laugh)

00:20:03.473 --> 00:20:07.080
(BELL nervous)

00:20:07.181 --> 00:20:09.986
It's... it's nice
to meet you!

00:20:11.856 --> 00:20:12.792
(LILI disappointed)

00:20:12.892 --> 00:20:13.894
(WELF chuckle)

00:20:13.994 --> 00:20:16.031
[LIDO] Yup, nice to meet you!

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.770
(BELL notice) (awkward)

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:24.716
(XENOS cheering,
laughing/celebrating)

00:20:24.816 --> 00:20:26.186
[RHETT] Heya! Nice to meet you!

00:20:26.286 --> 00:20:27.955
[RHETT] Can I please
shake your hand too?

00:20:28.055 --> 00:20:29.759
[MONSTER A] Yes, me, too!
(MONSTER B excited growling)

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:32.398
[BELL] Hey... Slow
down everyone...

00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:33.667
(ALULU kyuuuuuu!)

00:20:33.767 --> 00:20:34.702
(BELL gasp)
(XENOS surprised)

00:20:34.802 --> 00:20:36.071
(BELL struggling)

00:20:36.172 --> 00:20:37.842
[FIA] This little one
isn't able to speak yet...

00:20:37.942 --> 00:20:40.280
but she's taken a shine to you,
Mr. Surface-dweller.

00:20:40.381 --> 00:20:42.685
(ALULU loving)
[BELL] It's a girl!? Huh!?

00:20:42.785 --> 00:20:45.691
(ALULU kyuu kyuu!)
(XENOS laughing)

00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:47.161
(ALL notice)

00:20:47.261 --> 00:20:49.632
I would like to know your name
if that's okay with you.

00:20:49.732 --> 00:20:50.701
(WIENE question)

00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:52.304
(ALL question)

00:20:53.072 --> 00:20:54.909
(WIENE nervous)

00:20:55.577 --> 00:20:57.248
It's Wiene...

00:20:57.848 --> 00:20:59.652
"Wiene", huh?

00:20:59.752 --> 00:21:01.623
That's a lovely name indeed.

00:21:01.723 --> 00:21:02.825
(WIENE gasp)

00:21:02.925 --> 00:21:04.094
I'm pleased to meet you...

00:21:04.195 --> 00:21:05.230
our newest companion.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.201
Newest...
Companion...?

00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:09.605
[REI] Yes. Around here,
you will be safe,

00:21:09.706 --> 00:21:14.716
we shall ever harm you....
We welcome you... with arms
wide open.

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:16.486
(REI happy)

00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:18.857
(XENOS happy/warm)

00:21:18.957 --> 00:21:22.131
(WIENE awe) (giggle)

00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:24.569
(BELL happy)

00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:25.971
[BELL] Can you tell me...

00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:29.979
[BELL] What exactly are you
guys? And Wiene?

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:33.453
The ground-dwellers...
regard us as heretics.

00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:43.907
[LIDO] But y'see my friend,
we are known as "Xenos"!

00:21:45.411 --> 00:21:46.312
[HESTIA] "Xenos"...

00:21:46.413 --> 00:21:48.650
[URANUS] Correct.
That's the name

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.120
we have bestowed upon them...

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.025
The monster species that were
born with intelligence.

00:21:53.126 --> 00:22:01.309
Hestia... You and your children
have inspired hope, in not only
those creatures but also in us.

00:22:01.409 --> 00:22:02.311
We did?

00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:04.949
For a bridge leading
down the path...

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:08.022
of coexistence between
man and monster.

00:22:08.123 --> 00:22:10.059
(HESTIA shock)

00:22:15.137 --> 00:22:21.249
(Ending Song, "Evergreen")

00:23:46.452 --> 00:23:49.057
[HESTIA] Next time: "Yearning."
