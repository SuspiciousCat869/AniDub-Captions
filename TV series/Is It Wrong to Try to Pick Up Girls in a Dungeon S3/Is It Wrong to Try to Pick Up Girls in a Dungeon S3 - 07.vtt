[DIX] Listen up,

Everyone in my family has
spent the last thousand years

forces us to!

[DIX] It's like the crazy
bastard doesn't know when to
shut up!

[DIX] He constantly screams to
finish the damn labyrinth!

00:03:41.844 --> 00:03:46.520
[DIX] The ache in my eyes... And
the throbbing inside of my head,
it knows no rest.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.624
[DIX] The Knossos blueprints
are in that book...

00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:52.498
and we obsess over them until
our bodies melt into quivering
sludge!

it's been cursed?

(GREEN PIG XENOS charge)
(die)

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.963
[DIX] I used to

slayin' every monster, but
nothing quenched my thirst.

00:04:29.573 --> 00:04:33.279
Until one day... I ran into 'em.

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.785
It was a group of
talkin' monsters...

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:37.354
(IKELOS giggling)

00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:41.262
It was like someone flipped a
switch... Dix was different.

00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:42.331
[HERMES] So he changed then?

00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:44.168
[IKELOS] Sure did. It happened

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:47.474
while he was torturing the
monsters "to encourage their
compliance"...

00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:50.213
[IKELOS] Eventually, his eyes
started to light up more and
more

00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:52.384
at the sound of each
one of their cries...

00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:55.190
[DIX] They're different
from ordinary monsters.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.265
[DIX] They can cry! They have
the ability to beg for their
lives.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:03.607
[DIX] Pretty ironic for
creatures born from the same
Dungeon that drove Daedalus
insane...

00:05:03.707 --> 00:05:06.747
[DIX] I mean come on,
isn't that hilarious?!

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.820
[DIX] That's when
I figured it out.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.257
[DIX] Humiliating and
tormenting these beasts

00:05:12.357 --> 00:05:16.365
driving 'em to the brink
of despair, treating 'em
like garbage they are.

00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:18.571
[DIX] It's the one thing
that satisfies me!

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:21.977
[DIX] The one thing that can
assuage this wretched blood!

00:05:22.077 --> 00:05:26.219
[IKELOS] Like that, the means
of achieving his goal became
the goal itself.

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.956
Oh you really should've seen it!

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:32.999
The face of a man who had seen
the light at the end of the
tunnel...

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:35.605
The euphoria of it all!

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:38.811
Conquering my blood, achieving
what was once unachievable!

00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:43.821
[DIX] No drink or drug
could ever compare.
It's the ultimate pleasure!

00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:47.762
[DIX] At last, I'd become
true to my desires!

00:05:47.862 --> 00:05:49.231

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:09.539

of a curse scorching the

[IKELOS] Do ya' get it now?

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.924
Dix doesn't give a rat's ass
about Knossos anymore.

00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:24.603
[IKELOS] He cares about one
thing: And... I refer to it
as a "dream of beasts."

00:17:57.588 --> 00:17:58.890
[LIDO] Didn't I
tell you there're

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.493
some trustworthy
humans out there?

00:18:00.594 --> 00:18:04.401
[GLOS] Too soon! I remain
unconvinced of their integrity.

00:18:04.502 --> 00:18:05.236
(REI giggle)

00:18:05.336 --> 00:18:07.541
[REI] Someone's clearly lying.

00:18:07.641 --> 00:18:09.477
[FELS] "Dia Panacea."

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:21.603
(BELL gasp)

00:18:21.703 --> 00:18:22.871
[BELL] What was that...?

00:18:22.972 --> 00:18:24.875
[FELS] A spell similar
to an elixir.

00:18:24.976 --> 00:18:27.013
Healing magic, so to speak.

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:29.417
[BELL] Thank you very
much... Mr. Fels!

00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:33.258
[FELS] Always so
quick, that one.

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:36.098
(GRAN labored breathing)

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.735
[GRAN] Please, help me...

00:18:37.835 --> 00:18:41.341
You around, Dix? Where the
hell did you run off to...?

00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:44.649
[GRAN] Damn those freaks of
nature...!

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.554
[GRAN] I'll make sure they
pay for this...!

00:18:47.655 --> 00:18:49.190
(street chatter)

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.499
[WELF] I figured payin' a visit
to Daedalus Street might give us
a clue...

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.704
[WELF] But there're way too
many places to look.

00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:58.610
[LILI] You're right.
I didn't expect this.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:03.285
[MIKOTO] At this rate, scouting
out the enemy's base isn't a
realistic option.

00:19:05.957 --> 00:19:07.093
(street fear)

00:19:07.193 --> 00:19:09.331
(ALL notice) (running)

00:19:09.431 --> 00:19:11.869
(street panic/run)
[LADY CITIZEN A] Somebody help!

00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:12.971
[WELF] Huh?
[MIKOTO] Whoa!

00:19:13.072 --> 00:19:13.973
[LILI] What the heck?!

00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:14.775
(HESTIA gasp)

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.685
(WIENE growling) (roar)

00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:21.054
[MIKOTO] It's a monster!

00:19:21.154 --> 00:19:22.423
[HARUHIME] No Mikoto.

00:19:22.524 --> 00:19:24.294
[HARUHIME] Look closer.

00:19:24.394 --> 00:19:25.764
[HESTIA] No way...

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.636
[HARUHIME] Lady Wiene... no!

00:19:28.737 --> 00:19:29.605
(ALL gasp)

00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:32.845
(WIENE roaring) (leap)

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:33.646
(MIKOTO &amp; WELF dodge)

00:19:33.747 --> 00:19:34.247
(HARUHIME gasp)

00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:35.449
(WIENE growling)

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.186
Lady Wiene...
Please no... (shoved)

00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:39.057
(BELL push)
(struggle)

00:19:39.157 --> 00:19:40.459
(WIENE growling)
[HARUHIME] Master Bell!

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.096
[HESTIA] (gasp) It's Bell!

00:19:42.196 --> 00:19:43.232
[LILI] Master Bell!

00:19:43.332 --> 00:19:45.069
Go find some cover,
Miss Haruhime!

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:46.739
[HARUHIME] (gasp) Right!

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.142
(WIENE growling)

00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:50.046
(BELL effort)

00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:51.682
[BELL, internal]
This is really bad...

00:19:51.783 --> 00:19:53.118
So first things first...

00:19:53.218 --> 00:19:55.791
I'd better rein her in...
Quickly.

00:19:57.326 --> 00:20:02.236
(WIENE growling)
(pain)

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:03.072
[BELL] Huh!?

00:20:03.172 --> 00:20:06.011
(WIENE pain)

00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:07.781
(street cheering)

00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:09.117
(WIENE pain) (pain)

00:20:09.217 --> 00:20:09.985
[BELL] Wiene!

00:20:10.086 --> 00:20:11.254
(BELL notice)

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.100
Residents appear
to be unharmed.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.672
Hang on... That's
Mr. Argonaut!

00:20:19.772 --> 00:20:22.911
Why's it always that
rabbit dipshit?!

00:20:24.314 --> 00:20:27.120
[BELL, internal] Miss Ais...
The Loki Familia...

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.388
But why...?!

00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:30.727
[TIONE] Captain...
What about the monster?

00:20:30.827 --> 00:20:33.800
[FINN] It's missing it's
forehead stone... We must
dispose of it.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.737
[WELF] The Loki Familia...?

00:20:35.837 --> 00:20:38.475
[HESTIA] Come on...
They're here already!?

00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:41.081
[LILI] Perhaps they predicted
that this would happen?

00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:42.785
[BELL] What...?

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:54.240
[DIX] You are just...
A hypocrite!

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.013
(WIENE howling)

00:20:57.113 --> 00:21:00.152
[DIX] You're a dirty,
treacherous rat!

00:21:00.252 --> 00:21:01.823
(BELL panicked breath)

00:21:01.923 --> 00:21:03.392
[BELL] I...

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:10.272
(BELL panicked gasping)

00:21:10.372 --> 00:21:11.776
[BELL] I...

00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:17.955
[BELL] I... I just...

00:21:20.392 --> 00:21:27.140
(BELL panting)

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.812
[BELL] I'm... a...!

(WIENE pain) (struggling)

00:21:34.053 --> 00:21:35.122
[BETE] The hell?

00:21:35.222 --> 00:21:42.704
(WIENE struggling)

00:21:42.805 --> 00:21:45.342

(BELL heavy breathing)

00:21:50.052 --> 00:21:51.254
[TIONE] What is he doing?

00:21:51.354 --> 00:21:52.758
[TIONA] I have no idea.

00:21:52.858 --> 00:21:55.129
(BELL terrified)

00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:56.666
[WELF] Wait... Is he...?!

00:21:56.766 --> 00:21:58.468
(WIENE struggling)
[HESTIA] Be careful, Bell...

00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:59.905
(IKELOS big laugh)

00:22:00.005 --> 00:22:01.274
Can't make this shit up!

00:22:01.374 --> 00:22:02.476
And here I thought all

00:22:02.578 --> 00:22:05.382
the stupid ones died
out centuries ago!

00:22:05.482 --> 00:22:07.521
[HERMES] Bell...

00:22:07.621 --> 00:22:10.794
[HERMES] You truly are
a fool, aren't you?

00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:13.900
(BELL heavy breathing)

00:22:14.568 --> 00:22:20.680
