[AIS] It's with you,
isn't it? The vouivre.

00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:53.901
[AIS] Show your face.

00:08:59.746 --> 00:09:04.488
[AIS] "Why would he ask such
an absurd question?"
I couldn't figure it out.

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:08.997
Let's just say... there's a
monster that had its very own
reason to live...

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:14.108
[BELL] And it had feelings
exactly like ours...
What would you do?

00:09:14.642 --> 00:09:15.978
(WIENE scared)

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.519
It all makes sense to me, now.

00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:20.621
[BELL] Miss Ais, please listen.

00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:23.092
[AIS] My answer hasn't
changed...

00:09:23.192 --> 00:09:28.537
If that same monster were to
make someone cry... I would kill
it without hesitation.

00:09:28.637 --> 00:09:29.806
(BELL frustration)

00:09:30.574 --> 00:09:31.910
[BELL] Why though?

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.079
[BELL] Why?

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:34.816
[BELL] Tell me!

00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:37.722
[BELL] Listen to me!
The Xenos aren't-

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:39.024
[AIS] Don't bother.

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:40.059
[BELL] Miss Ais!

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.630
[AIS] When that vouivre
rampages again,

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.134
will you be able to
defend its actions?

00:09:44.234 --> 00:09:45.671
(WIENE worried)

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:47.675
[AIS] Because I
certainly couldn't.

00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:50.648
(BELL conflicted) (yelling)

00:09:51.182 --> 00:09:52.150
(AIS gasp)

00:09:52.785 --> 00:09:53.720
[BELL] Dammit!

00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:57.093
(WIENE worried)
(BELL grunt)

00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:03.841
(AIS notice)

00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:08.449
[AIS] You've gotten
a lot stronger.
(BELL heavy breathing)

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.453
I can't go easy on you anymore.

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:13.159
(fighting)

00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:21.342
(BELL pain) (pain) (fall back)

00:10:21.442 --> 00:10:22.979
[WIENE] Bell, no!

00:10:23.614 --> 00:10:24.516
(BELL struggling)

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:27.120
[BELL] Fire Bolt! Aahh!

00:10:29.057 --> 00:10:30.661
(BELL yelling)

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:42.250
(AIS frustrated)

00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:51.503
[HARUHIME] Miss Aisha...!

00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:53.774
[HARUHIME] Miss Aisha
are you okay!

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:56.145
(AISHA come to/pain)

00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:58.851
[AISHA] It's gonna take more
than that to kill me.
(HARUHIME gasp)

00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:00.186
[HARUHIME] I know...

00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:01.388
[HARUHIME] But still...

00:11:02.658 --> 00:11:04.796
(HARUHIME crying)
[AISHA] Blubbering
won't change anything.

00:11:04.896 --> 00:11:07.200
You have more
important things to do?

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.604
(HARUHIME gasp)

00:11:08.704 --> 00:11:09.606
[HARUHIME] Yes...

00:11:09.706 --> 00:11:11.375
[AISHA] Then get a move on.

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:12.912
As soon as I catch my breath,

00:11:13.012 --> 00:11:14.549
I should be right
back in action.

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:18.022
You hang in there...
Miss Aisha.

00:11:24.702 --> 00:11:29.579
[AISHA] Can't catch a break
these days, can I? Get it
together.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:32.985
(WIENE heavy breathing)

00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:34.656
[BELL] Are you doing alright,
Wiene?

00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:38.496
[WIENE] Uh-huh...
I'm doing okay.

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:39.866
[BELL, internal] It's no use.

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:41.636
[BELL, internal] Any
attempt to outrun Miss Ais

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:43.774
would be a total
waste of time...

00:11:46.646 --> 00:11:48.216
[BELL] Wait, isn't this...?

00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:51.656
(WIENE question)

00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:54.328
[BELL] That's right...
I know this place.

00:11:55.296 --> 00:11:57.334
[BELL] Goddess. If
I'm not mistaken,

00:11:57.434 --> 00:11:59.438
there's a hidden passage
somewhere around here.

00:11:59.539 --> 00:12:00.874
[HESTIA] Huh?

00:12:00.975 --> 00:12:03.045
[HESTIA] There is, but
compared to Fels' location...

00:12:03.145 --> 00:12:04.749
it's a pretty big detour...

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.252
[BELL] Can you guide me there?

00:12:08.757 --> 00:12:11.428
[WIENE] Um, Bell...?

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:15.470
[BELL] Take this stone...
and just walk straight down
the path, okay.

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:16.940
(WIENE notice)

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.512
[WIENE] What about you?

00:12:19.612 --> 00:12:21.115
I'm going to be staying here.

00:12:21.215 --> 00:12:22.785
How come?!

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:24.889
Miss Ais and I are going
to have a little talk.

00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:27.260
[BELL] She ought to
be here any minute.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.097
(WIENE question)

00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:32.404
[BELL] Don't worry...
I'll be right behind you.

00:12:32.505 --> 00:12:36.278
[BELL] Follow Goddess Hestia's
directions, and you'll be fine.

00:12:36.378 --> 00:12:37.648
[WIENE] But Bell...

00:12:37.748 --> 00:12:39.384
[BELL] It's okay... go.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.065
(WIENE takes off)

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.973
[BELL, internal] Nothing's
changed since the last time.

00:12:51.175 --> 00:12:53.880
[BELL, internal] I'm just
as weak as I was back then...

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:03.499
[AIS] Step aside.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.069
[BELL] Not a chance!

00:13:06.372 --> 00:13:07.908
(AIS sigh)

00:13:09.712 --> 00:13:11.081
(BELL brace)

00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:18.029
(BELL charge) (block)

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:24.609
[HESTIA] What's the matter,
Wiene? Take the next right.

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:26.646
[WIENE] Goddess, I hate this...

00:13:26.746 --> 00:13:29.952
I don't want this to be goodbye.

00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:32.324
[WIENE] Bell says that he's
going to catch up later,

00:13:32.424 --> 00:13:34.027
but it's a lie.

00:13:34.127 --> 00:13:36.298
[WIENE] He's fighting
her to save me.

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:40.373
[WIENE] That makes me happy,
but it feels wrong.

00:13:41.342 --> 00:13:43.947
[WIENE] I don't want
Bell to be in pain.

00:13:44.716 --> 00:13:46.553
[WIENE] I don't want him to cry!

00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:48.724
And besides..

00:13:48.824 --> 00:13:52.698
I still need to
repay him somehow!

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:54.736
[HESTIA] I was in
your shoes once.

00:13:54.836 --> 00:13:56.071
(WIENE surprised)

00:13:57.508 --> 00:13:58.810
(BELL grunt)

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.983
[HESTIA] The thing is, Bell can
be totally unfair.

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:05.991
He overworks himself... And
he's always a big show-off....

00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:08.897
[HESTIA] ...especially when it
comes to a damsel in distress.

00:14:08.997 --> 00:14:13.005
[HESTIA] And well, he can't
turn his back on family.

00:14:13.105 --> 00:14:15.176
[WIENE] Family...?

00:14:15.276 --> 00:14:17.414
[HESTIA] That's right.
And you, Wiene,

00:14:17.515 --> 00:14:22.323
are a part of his precious
family. He wouldn't have
it any other way.

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:28.269
[WIENE] Goddess, I want
to be by Bell's side.

00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:30.607
[WIENE] I can't let
it end this way.

00:14:32.043 --> 00:14:33.780
[HESTIA] Are you
sure about this?

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.755
[HESTIA] If things go south,
it might mean saying goodbye
to Bell forever.

00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:40.994
[HESTIA] Are you
prepared to die?

00:14:41.095 --> 00:14:45.036
Yes... I wanna be the one
to save Bell this time!

00:14:45.904 --> 00:14:46.940
(HESTIA happy)

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.543
[HESTIA] Alright then.

00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:51.850
(WIENE running)

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.022
[HESTIA] Oh Wiene...
Look at how you've grown...

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:04.542
(BELL brace) (dodge) (slash)

00:15:04.642 --> 00:15:06.178
(BELL conflicted)

00:15:07.313 --> 00:15:08.449
(AIS shock)

00:15:09.217 --> 00:15:13.994
(BELL pain) (impact) (pain)

00:15:14.796 --> 00:15:17.701
(BELL cough) (heavy breathing)

00:15:17.802 --> 00:15:20.473
[AIS] Why insist
on protecting her?

00:15:20.574 --> 00:15:24.615
[AIS] That girl isn't a human...
She's just a monster.

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:28.088
[BELL] She can speak. And laugh.

00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:32.798
[BELL] And she has thoughts
and feelings just like we do!

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.535
[AIS] It's not even similar.

00:15:34.635 --> 00:15:38.810
The monsters slaughter our
people... They're capable
of massacering-

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.346
[BELL] How are we any
different?!

00:15:40.446 --> 00:15:43.219
[BELL] Humans are capable
of the same damn thing.

00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:47.293
No matter if it's by the
edge of your sword or by
the tip of my knife!

00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:55.243
[AIS] That's enough.

00:15:55.343 --> 00:15:59.819
[AIS] My blade... It's
sharp and it hurts a lot.

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:00.854
[AIS] So...

00:16:00.954 --> 00:16:02.525
(BELL somber)

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:06.633
[WIENE] NO!

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:07.935
(AIS gasp)

00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:09.705
Quit picking on Bell!

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:11.175
Wiene?!

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:12.711
[WIENE] I'm begging you...

00:16:12.812 --> 00:16:15.082
Please don't hurt him! Please...

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.988
[AIS] Just stop it...
Please stop talking.

00:16:18.088 --> 00:16:19.357
(WIENE shock)

00:16:20.493 --> 00:16:23.633
[AIS] How can a
creature like you exist?

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.436
What is it that you want?

00:16:25.537 --> 00:16:29.110
[WIENE] What I want is...
to stay with Bell!

00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:32.050
[AIS] I can never condone that.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.022
[AIS] Your claws
mangle our flesh.

00:16:35.122 --> 00:16:37.795
[AIS] Your wings strike
fear into our hearts.

00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:41.569
[AIS] The gem in your forehead
causes countless deaths.

00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:46.178
[AIS] I will not simply stand by
and allow you to wreak havoc on
the surface...

00:16:46.278 --> 00:16:49.017
like those other monsters did.

00:16:49.117 --> 00:16:51.523
[AIS] I cannot turn a blind eye!

00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:53.693
(WIENE pain)

00:16:53.793 --> 00:16:54.529
(AIS shock)

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:56.866
[BELL] (gasp) Wiene!

00:16:56.966 --> 00:16:59.137
(WIENE wince) (screaming)

00:17:31.034 --> 00:17:32.270
(BELL catch)

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.575
(WIENE labored breathing)
[BELL] No, Wiene!

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:43.593
[WIENE] If I lose control of
myself again... I promise...

00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:47.200
I promise... to
disappear for good...!

00:17:47.902 --> 00:17:49.672
[WIENE] I was all alone...

00:17:49.772 --> 00:17:52.076
in a cold, dark place...

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:55.249
[WIENE] And I...
before I was myself...

00:17:55.349 --> 00:17:59.190
I was scared the
whole time... (crying)

00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:01.729
[WIENE] I was so lonely...

00:18:01.829 --> 00:18:05.336
[WIENE] No one dared
to hold me in their arms...

00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:10.781
[WIENE] But then... Bell came
along... and rescued me!

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.152
He was the only one that cared.

00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:16.793
[WIENE] Bell saved me when
I was lost! (whimper)

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:24.542
[AIS] ...I can't bring
myself to slay this vouivre.

00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:26.512
[AIS] Honestly...

00:18:26.613 --> 00:18:29.150
I find myself questioning
everything...

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.956
I'm no longer certain
you're wrong.

00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:33.660
(BELL tense)

00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:37.701
(confused)

00:18:38.937 --> 00:18:40.272
[AIS] Go.

00:18:42.243 --> 00:18:43.913
[BELL] Miss Ais... Thank you.

00:18:44.014 --> 00:18:45.684
(HESTIA relief)

00:19:00.413 --> 00:19:03.920
[HESTIA] Bell, I managed to
get in contact with Haruhime.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.458
[BELL] Really, so what
did you find out?

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:09.565
[HESTIA] She found Miss
Supporter and made sure
that she's safe.

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:11.969
[HESTIA] And there's
even more good news.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.242
[HESTIA] Haruhime located the
Xenos who got separated from the
group.

00:19:15.343 --> 00:19:17.614
[HESTIA] Sounds like they
have a key to Knossos.

00:19:17.715 --> 00:19:19.919
[BELL] Wait are you serious?!
But how though?

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:24.260
[HESTIA] They said that one
of their comrades, a black
minotaur, gave it to them.

00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:28.670
If I had to guess, it's the
same one Wallenwhatser-whatever
fought earlier.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.707
[BELL] D'you say
a black minotaur...

00:19:30.807 --> 00:19:33.847
[HESTIA] Anyhow, they're on
their way to pick you guys up.
(BELL surprised)

00:19:33.947 --> 00:19:36.786
[HESTIA] Would'ja do me a favor
and escort 'em to the door?

00:19:36.886 --> 00:19:38.288
[BELL] Roger that, Goddess.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.236
[MIKOTO] Yes, Lady Hestia.

00:19:45.336 --> 00:19:47.373
[MIKOTO] Master Fels and
the Xenos know...

00:19:47.473 --> 00:19:49.678
They're relieved to hear
that Lady Wiene's safe.

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:53.553
[WELF] And I got 'em into
the secret passageway
without any problems.

00:19:53.653 --> 00:19:56.592
[WELF] They oughtta be at the
western door any minute now.

00:19:58.195 --> 00:19:59.698
(FINN humph)

00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:05.644
[BELL] I don't know, Are you
absolutely positive that there's
a door through here?

00:20:05.744 --> 00:20:10.520
[FIA] For sure... Our comrade,
the one who gave us this key,
said so.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.927
[FIA] It's the door he used to
reach the surface in the past.

00:20:14.027 --> 00:20:15.496
[BELL] That'll be perfect.

00:20:15.597 --> 00:20:18.268
[HARUHIME] Well I suppose
that this is goodbye then.

00:20:18.368 --> 00:20:20.574
[FIA] Thank you so much
for all of your help.

00:20:20.674 --> 00:20:23.011
[FIA] I'll always remember
your kindness.

00:20:23.112 --> 00:20:27.286
[RHETT] If you find yourselves
in trouble... we won't hesitate
to lend a hand.

00:20:27.386 --> 00:20:28.923
[BELL] Thanks, Rhett.
[WIENE] Hey, Bell uh?

00:20:29.023 --> 00:20:32.063
[BELL] Hmm?
[WIENE] The last time
we had to say goodbye,

00:20:32.163 --> 00:20:33.465
I cried a whole bunch.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:36.839
But that just makes you
guys upset too, right?

00:20:37.508 --> 00:20:38.977
So I won't cry anymore.

00:20:39.077 --> 00:20:42.818
(BELL happy)
[WIENE] We'll see each
other again, won't we?

00:20:42.918 --> 00:20:44.421
[BELL] Mmhm... You betcha.

00:20:44.522 --> 00:20:46.191
[WIENE] Spend time
together, too?

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:48.830
[BELL] Oh yeah, for sure...
And that's a promise.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.504
[BELL] One day, I'll build us a
place where we can all coexist.

00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:55.977
[HARUHIME] Might I
suggest a pinky swear?

00:20:56.077 --> 00:20:57.346
[WIENE] A "pinky swear"...?

00:20:57.447 --> 00:20:58.883
[HARUHIME] That's right.

00:20:58.983 --> 00:21:02.791
Back home it's a customary
ritual that symbolizes a vow.

00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:06.966
Now take each of your pinkies...
and hook them together.

00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:09.705
(BELL happy)

00:21:10.272 --> 00:21:11.676
(WIENE laugh)

00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:18.723
(HESTIA scream) (spazzing)

00:21:18.823 --> 00:21:22.230
[HESTIA] No-not the
thousand-year-old diary...!

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.867
[HESTIA] Huh?

00:21:29.277 --> 00:21:30.881
[HESTIA] Wait a minute...

00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:32.450
[HESTIA] Is this thing a...?!

00:21:32.551 --> 00:21:38.696
(Ending Song, "Evergreen")

00:23:03.933 --> 00:23:05.336
(LIDO gasping)

00:23:05.436 --> 00:23:08.141
[LIDO] I don't understand...

00:23:08.242 --> 00:23:09.444
[FELS] Is this a dead end...?

00:23:09.545 --> 00:23:11.549
[FELS] Inconceivable...

00:23:11.649 --> 00:23:13.485
[FELS] There should
be a door here.

00:23:13.586 --> 00:23:16.726
[FELS] It was documented in
Daedalus' notebook!

00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:20.667
[HERMES] Oopsie, my bad!
That was actually a fake.

00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:22.036
(ALL gasp)

00:23:23.472 --> 00:23:28.583
[HERMES] Hello there, my dearest
Xenos... You can call me Hermes.

00:23:29.518 --> 00:23:31.087
[HERMES] I'm but a humble god.

00:23:31.187 --> 00:23:34.060
[FELS] Lord Hermes, what
is the meaning of this?

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.903
[HERMES] Why, I have a
teensy-tiny favor to ask of you.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.780
[HERMES] Drop dead...
you abominations.

00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:48.790
[HESTIA] Next time: "Argonaut."
