[LIDO] Grab a drink!

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:53.928
[LIDO] Pass 'em around!

00:01:54.028 --> 00:01:55.497
[LIDO] Let's celebrate
in honor of

00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:59.071
our newest companion and our
first surface-dwelling guests!

00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:00.207

00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:24.923
So then... that's when
Bell swooped in to save me!

00:02:25.023 --> 00:02:25.925
Is that so?

00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:27.061
Would you say...

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:28.864
that he's odd? I mean uh...

00:02:28.964 --> 00:02:30.400
he's a gentleman, right?

00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:32.137
What's that supposed to mean...?

00:02:32.237 --> 00:02:33.273
[LIDO] Bellcchi!

00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:34.976
And why am I "Bellcchi"...?

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:36.647
[LIDO] Don't be shy.
Eat all you like!

00:02:36.747 --> 00:02:38.751
We picked these not
far from here.

00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:41.155
[LIDO] I hear they're
a rarity on the surface!

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:44.696

[LIDO] I know, right!

00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:52.478
(LIDO happy)

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.283
[BELL] Listen... I'm sorry for
punching you so hard earlier.

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:58.691
[LIDO] No biggie! Gave
you quite a wallop, myself.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.266
So, uh... Did you get those
weapons from an adventurer?

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:08.343
[LIDO] Yup. Treasures that
once belonged to an unsuspecting
person who attacked me.

00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:13.821
[LIDO] Similar to the way your
kind collects claws and tusks
after defeating monsters, right?

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.325
[BELL] Well, I... suppose so.

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:18.998
[LIDO] Manmade weapons
are a thing of beauty!

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:22.839
[LIDO] Much sharper than the
plants that grow 'round these
parts. Sturdier, too.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.446
[LIDO] I mean, nothing of

00:03:38.871 --> 00:03:42.311
[GLOS] Lido, put an end
to this foolish charade.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.583
(LIDO question) (irritated)

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.454
[GLOS] As you know, these are
people that we're dealing with.

00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:49.391
[GLOS] They don't
deserve our trust.

00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:51.095
[LIDO] Are you still
on that, Glos?!

00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:54.736
[LIDO] Bellcchi and his friends
protected Wiene the whole time.

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:56.640
Fels said so, remember?

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.478
[LIDO] In fact, the only reason
we had to rough 'em up like that

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.817
was 'cause you
weren't convinced.

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:03.286
(GLOS hmph)

00:04:03.754 --> 00:04:04.790
(LIDO sigh)

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.092
[LIDO] Sorry 'bout him.

00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:08.062
Some of the guys are
struggling to adjust.

00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:10.601
We were all kinda nervous
when we heard that

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:13.239
surface-dwellers would
be visiting us.

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:14.743
[BELL] Oh it's fine...

00:04:14.843 --> 00:04:17.014
Still, it should be
obvious to 'em by now

00:04:17.114 --> 00:04:19.753
that you guys are different
from other adventurers.

00:04:19.853 --> 00:04:20.822
(GLOS sigh)

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:22.491
(BELL notice)

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:24.830
Question! I was
wondering something...

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.267
The Guild knows that
you're down here, huh?

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:30.942
[LIDO] Uh-huh! They've been
pullin' some strings to keep
the truth about us hidden...

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:34.783
and sendin' food and
weapons every now and
then for a while...

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:35.885
(WELF &amp; LILI shock)

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:37.087
[LIDO] Well, it's not so much

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:39.458
the Guild as a god named Uranus.

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.832
Most people who work for
the Guild don't know
anything about us.

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:47.274
[LILI] So then... our mission
to travel to the 20th Floor
was arranged by whom?

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:51.717
[LIDO] Proposed by Master
Uranus and his crew. We
agreed to lend a hand.

00:04:51.817 --> 00:04:52.886
(WELF sigh)

00:04:52.986 --> 00:04:55.223
[LIDO] "To discern the
potential" of the people

00:04:55.323 --> 00:04:57.427
who would protect one of
our brethren, he said.

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.868
[WELF] Basically, the
head of the Guild was
testing all of us...

00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:05.578
[LIDO] But y'know, after
hearin' about you guys...
I had high hopes.

00:05:05.678 --> 00:05:09.118
[LIDO] Thought to myself, "The
winds of change are upon us..."

00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:10.353
(BELL serious)

00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:13.326
"Coexistence between
man and monster"...?

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:17.100
[HESTIA] Do you understand
the seriousness of what you're
saying, Uranus?!

00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.971
[URANUS] Of course.

00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:21.442
[HESTIA] Mankind and monsters
can't live in harmony.

00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:24.215
It's been this way since the
days of yore. Despite that...

00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:28.189
[URANUS] The Xenos are not apt
to attack on primal instinct.

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.193
They desire to have a dialogue.

00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:33.399
(HESTIA question)
[URANUS] They plead their case
not with claws and fangs,

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.573
but through their
words and logic.

00:05:36.673 --> 00:05:38.611
[URANUS] They wish
to walk the surface.

00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:41.817
[URANUS] They want to know our
children... to know humanity.

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:48.096
[URANUS] These Xenos face
violence from other monsters.
Shunned and ostracized.

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:51.102
[URANUS] They belong nowhere,
not even in the Dungeon.

00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:55.511
[URANUS] It is easy to dismiss
their plight because they are
monsters.

00:05:55.611 --> 00:06:02.491
[URANUS] However, these
creatures possess hopes
and dreams, along with
a way to express them.

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:05.163
[URANUS] Just as our
own children do.

00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:11.409
[URANUS] To deny their suffering
and exterminate them... would be
unforgivable.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.012
(HESTIA sigh)

00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:16.085
[HESTIA] You really plan on
making peace with monsters?

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:21.964
[URANUS] Indeed. But...
if we wish to unite them
with our children...

00:06:22.064 --> 00:06:26.038
we must first determine
the reason for their existence.

00:06:26.138 --> 00:06:29.813
[HESTIA] In other words,
prove to mankind that their
lives have meaning.

00:06:29.913 --> 00:06:33.186
And you think that Bell and
the others can bridge the gap?

00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:35.223
[URANUS] That is the hope.

00:06:35.323 --> 00:06:36.693
(HESTIA distressed)

00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:38.530
[HESTIA] I know how you feel...

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.768
but... if anyone found out...

00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:44.241
my Familia would lose their
standing in this city for good.

00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:46.479
[HESTIA] Just like the Xenos...

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.684
[URANUS] Of this, I am aware.

00:06:48.784 --> 00:06:52.692
[URANUS] The decision was
mine and mine alone.

00:06:52.792 --> 00:06:55.297
[HERMES] Gotcha... So
they caught on, huh?

00:06:55.397 --> 00:06:57.467
[ASFI] Yes, my apologies.

00:06:57.568 --> 00:06:59.438
[ASFI] Our presence was noticed.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.475
That guy's got a keen eye,

00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:03.379
doesn't he? Ikelos's child...

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.220
[ASFI] Dix Perdix,
also known as "Hazer."

00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:12.264
[ASFI] Captain of the Familia...
He reached level 4 nearly ten
years ago.

00:07:12.364 --> 00:07:13.634
[HERMES] What of the others?

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:15.370
They split up and fled...

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.773
We lost them on the way.

00:07:16.873 --> 00:07:19.111
[ASFI] They could be back
on the surface by now...

00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:21.917
[HERMES] I'd expect that they'll
make a move sometime soon.

00:07:22.017 --> 00:07:24.589
[HERMES] Keep a close eye
on those middle floors.

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.860
[GRAN] (frustrated)
Bunch of bastards!

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.033
[GRAN] We should have stayed on
the Lil' Rookie's tail a lot
longer, Dix.

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:32.572
Then we would've located
their stupid nest!

00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:34.041
[DIX] It is what it is.

00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:37.749
Keeping the Hermes Familia
off our ass is top priority.

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:42.625
Damn that worthless god,
screwin' us over. Big time.

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:44.596
[MAN A] This could
be pretty bad...

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:47.200
[MAN A] If they caught wind of
our smuggling operation...

00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:50.808
you can bet that the Guild will
get involved sooner or later.

00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:52.745
[GRAN] What's our
next move, Dix?

00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:54.616
[DIX] They didn't pick
a fight with us

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:57.287
so I assume that means
we have more firepower.

00:07:57.387 --> 00:08:01.530
Y'know what... This is fun; how
am I s'pposed to stop now?

00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:04.536
[DIX] The hunt is on...

00:08:06.606 --> 00:08:08.176
[FELS] My, what a surprise.

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:11.215
[FELS] It would seem things have
taken an unexpected turn.

00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:12.919
[LIDO] Fels, you came!

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:13.954
(BELL notice)

00:08:14.054 --> 00:08:15.056
[BELL] Huh.. Fels?

00:08:17.662 --> 00:08:22.270
[HESTIA] Aside from Hermes, are
my Familia and I the only ones
who know...

00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:24.041
...about Wiene and the Xenos?

00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:28.483
[URANUS] No. There is
one other. Ganesha.

00:08:28.584 --> 00:08:29.719
[HESTIA] Ganesha?!

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:32.024
[GANESHA] I am... GANESHA!

00:08:32.124 --> 00:08:35.196
[GANESHA] ...echo... echo...
echo... echo... echo...!

00:08:35.296 --> 00:08:38.136
[HESTIA] (shock) Does that mean
the Monsterphilia was...?!

00:08:38.236 --> 00:08:43.781
[URANUS] Precisely. In order
to curtail the public's
animosity towards monsters,

00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:47.020
I enlisted Ganesha
to host the event.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.928
[URANUS] To gain his
cooperation, I explained
the situation.

00:08:51.028 --> 00:08:55.905
[HESTIA] Aa, you're kidding me?
That has to be the most bonkers
thing I've heard all day.

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:58.510
[URANUS] Despite his appearance,
he is not one to gossip.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.721
[HESTIA] (question) Still, I'm
surprised the whole "unification
of mankind and monsters" thing

00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:07.127
has been in the works
for so long...

00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:09.198
[FELS] First, allow me to
introduce myself.

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:13.807
[FELS] My name is Fels. I serve
primarily as a point of contact

00:09:13.907 --> 00:09:16.713
between Uranus and the
creatures known as Xenos.

00:09:16.813 --> 00:09:22.357
[FELS] I was tasked
with monitoring your
behavior, including
that of the dragon girl.

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:23.326
(BELL gasp)

00:09:23.426 --> 00:09:24.596
[BELL] So it was you...!

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:27.000
[LIDO] Fels has eyes almost
everywhere.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.006
[LIDO] Cause of these things,
we can get in touch whenever we
want.

00:09:30.106 --> 00:09:34.582
[LILI] Hey Master Fels... Does
that make you a monster as well?

00:09:34.682 --> 00:09:37.622
[LIDO] Nope! Fels is human.

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:40.126
[FELS] Formerly human,
to be precise.

00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:41.830
[BELL] Huh?

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.901
[FELS] Allow me to show you...

00:09:44.536 --> 00:09:45.671
(BOTH scared)

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:47.441
[WELF] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:09:47.542 --> 00:09:49.378
[BELL] A spartoi monster?!

00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:52.752
[FELS] As I said...
I am formerly human.

00:09:52.852 --> 00:09:54.856
[BELL] But what does
that mean exactly?

00:09:54.956 --> 00:09:58.296
[LIDO] Fels is the Sage! A
magician of unimaginable power!

00:09:58.396 --> 00:10:01.736
[LILI] Creator of the
Philosopher's Stone from
the Kingdom of Magic?!

00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:05.578
[LILI] The only person to
uncover the secret to
freaking eternal life?!

00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:06.947
[LILI] That Sage?!

00:10:07.047 --> 00:10:08.182
[LIDO] Y-yeah...

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:10.621
That's probably... the one...?

00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:12.023
(LILI awe)

00:10:12.124 --> 00:10:13.827
[FELS] I am the remnants
of an individual

00:10:13.927 --> 00:10:17.067
once known as "The Sage."

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:18.704
[FELS] In my pursuit of
knowledge,

00:10:18.804 --> 00:10:21.208
I became obsessed with the
thought of eternal life.

00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:28.790
[FELS] Despite crafting a
formula for immortality and
regeneration, I was reduced
to a living ghost.

00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:32.164
[FELS] Nowadays, I
go by "Fels the Fool."

00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:35.203
[FELS] Under Uranus'
supervision,

00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:38.811
I observe each generation
as it evolves.

00:10:44.488 --> 00:10:49.398
[FELS] 15 years have passed
since my first encounter with
Lido and his comrades.

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:55.410
[FELS] We decided to call them
"Xenos," and they formed a
community under that name.

00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:58.584
[FELS] An organization that
allows creatures born of the
Dungeon

00:10:58.684 --> 00:11:02.324
to function as a group and
provide protection to their
"brethren."

00:11:02.424 --> 00:11:05.631
[REI] Ever since then...
we've been living together
and traveling as a group...

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:09.037
to avoid being detected by
the aggressive monsters of
the Dungeon...

00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:11.242
...remaining on the lookout
for new companions.

00:11:11.342 --> 00:11:13.446
[LILI] If you live together...

00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:16.385
...then does that mean monsters
don't spawn in this area?

00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:19.926
[LIDO] (realize) How very
observant of you, Lilicchi!

00:11:20.026 --> 00:11:21.830
[LILI] Don't call me that.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.838
Adventurers haven't discovered
this room so it's considered
uncharted territory.

00:11:25.938 --> 00:11:28.810
Plus, it's a safe point
where monsters won't spawn.

00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:31.248
[LIDO] We call this place...
our "hidden village."

00:11:31.348 --> 00:11:34.923
[FELS] Dozens of these rooms are
scattered across the Dungeon.

00:11:35.023 --> 00:11:36.458
[BELL] That's really
interesting.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.029
(FELS affirmative)

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:42.370
[FELS] Approximately 40 Xenos
are before you.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.345
[FELS] Of those... Lido, Rei,
and Glos are the oldest members.

00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:47.848
(GLOS hmph)

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:50.086
[WELF] So... does that
make you the leader?

00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:54.161
[LIDO] Yup. And you're looking
at the strongest Xenos, right
here!

00:11:54.261 --> 00:11:56.298
[LIDO] Well, that's
what I'd like to say...

00:11:56.398 --> 00:12:00.106
Sadly, I got my ass handed to me
by one of our newest recruits
the other day...

00:12:00.206 --> 00:12:01.676
[WELF] Seriously?

00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:03.279
[LIDO] Y-...yeah...

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:06.252
He's trekkin' through the deep
floors by himself as we speak...

00:12:06.352 --> 00:12:10.961
[LIDO] Even says he ain't comin'
back until he's totally
shredded! (distressed)

00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:13.299
(WELF nervous laugh)
[LILI] But Master Fels...

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:17.508
[LILI] I can't help but wonder
why you agreed to help the Xenos
in the first place?

00:12:17.608 --> 00:12:21.348
[LILI] Given their place in
society, there's no logical
explanation.

00:12:21.448 --> 00:12:26.458
[LILI] It may be dangerous...
but they seem capable of
surviving here.

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:28.062
Why are they relying on you?

00:12:28.162 --> 00:12:31.168
What exactly are
the Xenos after?

00:12:34.976 --> 00:12:36.412
[REI] A life on the surface.

00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:38.149
(WELF surprise)

00:12:38.784 --> 00:12:41.088
That is our only desire.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.694
(LIDO somber)

00:12:43.794 --> 00:12:45.196
[LIDO] I have this dream...

00:12:45.296 --> 00:12:47.535
[LIDO] There are these enormous
cliffs in the distance

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.471
and a red light
sinking beneath them.

00:12:49.572 --> 00:12:52.077
[LIDO] An alien sky that
drenches the world in red,

00:12:52.177 --> 00:12:54.616
bright enough to bring
tears to my eyes...

00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:56.686
[BELL] That sounds
like a sunset.

00:12:56.786 --> 00:12:58.924
[WELF] Have you ever
been on the surface?

00:12:59.024 --> 00:13:02.063
[LIDO] No... Never.

00:13:02.163 --> 00:13:04.334
[LIDO] But somehow I feel...

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:09.579
...maybe in a past life, I lived
somewhere... somewhere I could
see the sky.

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:11.382
[LILI] "A past life"...?

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:12.952
(LIDO sigh)

00:13:13.052 --> 00:13:14.221
[LIDO] Bellcchi...

00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:15.891
[LIDO] Wiene picked up
the human language

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:17.394
pretty quickly, right?

00:13:17.494 --> 00:13:18.797
[BELL] Huh? yeah.

00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:21.001
[LIDO] Some of our
kind are capable

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:23.573
of learning your speech
patterns, while others are not.

00:13:23.674 --> 00:13:28.684
[LIDO] For some reason, those of
us who can speak pick up the
language almost instantly.

00:13:28.784 --> 00:13:33.326
[LIDO] In a way, it kinda seems
like we're remembering something
from a long time ago...

00:13:33.426 --> 00:13:34.962
(BELL gasp)

00:13:35.063 --> 00:13:36.700
[WIENE] My body gets colder...

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.375
[WIENE] I feel empty inside,
like there's a hole in my
chest...

00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:44.882
[WIENE] And those people, they
look so beautiful...

00:13:44.982 --> 00:13:46.986
(BELL shock)
[FELS] An intense longing...

00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:50.293
[FELS] Each Xenos possesses
their own thoughts and feelings.

00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:57.307
[FELS] However, the one thing
they share is a strong sense of
yearning towards mankind and the
surface.

00:13:57.407 --> 00:14:00.514
[LIDO] I'm itching to see that
sunset... Bet it's amazing.

00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:04.321
[REI] I would like to glide
around in a world filled with
bright light.

00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:07.628
[REI] My wings have made
it difficult to hold my
loved ones closely...

00:14:07.728 --> 00:14:12.137
I've always wished to know
the feeling of being embraced.

00:14:12.237 --> 00:14:14.542
[LIDO] We're well aware of the
fact that we're outcasts.

00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:19.151
[LIDO] We're hated by man and
monster alike, stuck somewhere
in between...

00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:25.798
[LIDO] Y'know, I can't help but
think that Mother built these
rooms and tucked 'em away for us
as a sort of safe haven.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.802
[WELF] Your "Mother"...?

00:14:27.902 --> 00:14:30.306
[REI] The Dungeon from
which we were born.

00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:32.511
[REI] Our own kind
show us aggression...

00:14:32.611 --> 00:14:34.181
and they threaten our lives.

00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:35.984
[REI] Yet at the same time...

00:14:36.085 --> 00:14:37.922
it is according to
the Mother Dungeon's will

00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:40.259
that we are permitted to exist.

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:42.230
[REI] It's the life
we've come to know.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.573
[LIDO] So y'see, that's why we
were so stoked to meet you folks
today!

00:14:46.673 --> 00:14:50.313
[LIDO] And it's not 'cause
we expect you to help us or
anything like that...

00:14:50.413 --> 00:14:54.689
[LIDO] Just knowing that there
are surface-dwellers who're
willing to accept us for who we
are...

00:14:54.789 --> 00:14:56.325
(LIDO happy)

00:14:56.425 --> 00:14:58.830
[LIDO] I'm so glad we
met you and your friends!

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.099
(LIDO happy)

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.870
[HESTIA] Uranus... If I may,

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.840
can I please ask
one last question?

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.276
[URANUS] Of course.

00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:07.280
[HESTIA] Is there something
going on in the Dungeon?

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.654
Do you have any idea why these
Xenos are spawning?

00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:16.533
[URANUS] What do you think
happens to monsters after
they die?

00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:18.002
[HESTIA] Excuse me...?!

00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:21.141
[URANUS] The souls of our
children return to Heaven...

00:15:21.241 --> 00:15:24.147
then are granted life
anew in the Lower World.

00:15:24.247 --> 00:15:27.888
[URANUS] Given this precedent,
where would a monster's soul go?

00:15:27.988 --> 00:15:29.357
[HESTIA] No idea.

00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:32.598
[URANUS] Monsters' souls return
to the Mother Dungeon.

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:38.242
There, they are given new
form and are reborn deep
within its walls.

00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:40.647
[HESTIA] The monsters
get reincarnated?!

00:15:40.747 --> 00:15:45.724
[URANUS] It is merely
conjecture... but I am
convinced it holds merit.

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:49.932
[URANUS] After being reborn
countless times over the
course of millennia...

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:55.109
[URANUS] ...the weight of the
desires and regrets has begun
to transform their souls.

00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:56.478
[HESTIA] But how?!

00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:59.484
Perhaps it is the monsters'
sense of longing...

00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:05.163
or perhaps... it is according
to the Dungeon's design.

00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:07.333
[REI] I'd like to thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:08.770
[REI] I'm so glad that we met.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.507
[BELL] Yeah... Same goes for me.

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:12.578
[LIDO] Bellcchi... do
you know what this is?

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:15.751
[BELL] Yeah It's a monster's
magic stone, isn't it?

00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:17.721
(LIDO down the hatch) (munch)

00:16:17.822 --> 00:16:22.565
[LIDO] The other monsters attack
us. They see us the same way
they see all of you.

00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:25.604
[LIDO] So like you, we gotta
kill 'em in order to survive.

00:16:25.704 --> 00:16:28.075
(LIDO swallow) (satisfied)

00:16:28.175 --> 00:16:33.085
[LIDO] Munchin' their magic
stones gives us a boost by
enhancing our natural strength.

00:16:33.185 --> 00:16:34.287
What I'm gettin' at is,

00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:36.124
don't shy away from
killin' monsters.

00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:38.763
[LIDO] Don't let your concern
for us cloud your judgement.

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:42.738
[LIDO] If you hesitate,
it could cost you your life.

00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:44.642
(ALL serious)

00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:46.111
(LIDO happy)

00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:47.982
Stay alive, y'hear?

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.353
[LIDO] I wanna see ya' again.

00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:53.259
(BELL happy)

00:16:58.737 --> 00:16:59.972
(WIENE happy)

00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:02.978
[WIENE] Hey, Bell! Wasn't that
fun? (giggling)

00:17:03.078 --> 00:17:04.515
[WIENE] Let's head
back home now!

00:17:04.615 --> 00:17:06.351
[LIDO] You're comin'
with us, Wiene.
(WIENE surprised)

00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:08.489
[WIENE] Stop! Put
me down! (squirming)
(LIDO being beaten)

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.928
[LIDO] No can do! You belong
with your own kind!

00:17:11.028 --> 00:17:14.401
[WIENE] (struggling) I don't
wanna! I'd rather be with Bell!
(BELL sad)

00:17:14.502 --> 00:17:17.808
[LIDO] If you stay with Bellcchi
and his friends, you're gonna
make 'em cry!
[WIENE] Let go of me! (struggle)

00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:19.645
(WIENE shock)

00:17:19.745 --> 00:17:22.150
[REI] Y'know how scary stuff
happened to you above?

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.058
If we aren't careful... The same
things could happen to Bell and
his friends...

00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:27.561
(WIENE notice)

00:17:27.661 --> 00:17:30.567
[LIDO] The surface isn't a safe
place for us right now.

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:33.239
[LIDO] But in the Dungeon, no
one will ever hurt you here.

00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:39.785
[LIDO] This is where we going to
live. Together. From now on.
(WIENE tiny whimper)

00:17:39.885 --> 00:17:42.457
[WIENE] But Bell... I....

00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:44.127
(LIDO happy)

00:17:44.227 --> 00:17:46.365
[LIDO] Catch ya later, Bellcchi.

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:48.904
(WIENE crying)

00:17:49.004 --> 00:17:52.143
[WIENE] Bell! Bell!

00:17:52.243 --> 00:17:53.780
[WIENE] Bell!

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:55.984
[BELL] It's not goodbye!

00:17:56.084 --> 00:17:58.455
[BELL] I'll be back to see you!

00:17:59.057 --> 00:18:01.361
[WIENE] Bell!

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.820
(HESTIA notice)

00:18:18.462 --> 00:18:19.632
[BELL] We're back safe...

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:22.571
[HESTIA] Welcome back, Bell...
Hey, guys...

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.911
[BELL] Goddess...

00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:29.184
[BELL] What is the
Dungeon anyway?

00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:31.756
The Dungeon's the Dungeon,
silly...

00:18:36.566 --> 00:18:39.437
[FIA] It's about time
to head out... Wiene.

00:18:39.538 --> 00:18:40.707
[WIENE] Kay...

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:43.880
[LANIER] Pick up
the pace, Wiene.
(BOTH notice)

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.655
[LANIER] You'll make us late
for our rendezvous with the
advance party.

00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:49.625
[WIENE] I'm sorry...

00:18:49.725 --> 00:18:54.000
(FAU playful growling)
(WIENE smooshed)

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.771
[WIENE] Thank you a bunch...
Fau.

00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:57.106
(FAU affirmative)

00:18:57.206 --> 00:18:58.375
[LANIER] Quit dawdling!

00:18:58.475 --> 00:18:59.645
(ALL startled)
[LANIER] Anything can happen

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:01.582
so until we arrive at
the new village...

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:04.220
we must remain focused
on the task at hand.

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:05.624
[FIA] Right!
(FAU affirmative)

00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:08.362
(WIENE deep breath)

00:19:09.699 --> 00:19:13.339
[WIENE] How come we have
to move? Did someone find
the village?

00:19:13.439 --> 00:19:19.184
[LANIER] Relocating's a
preventative measure that
reduces the chance of an ambush.

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.355
[FIA] Plus, if we stay in
one spot for too long,

00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:23.893
the food supply runs
out after a while.

00:19:23.993 --> 00:19:25.429
[WIENE] Oh...

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:29.538
[WIENE] Mikoto's cooking....
was tasty...

00:19:29.638 --> 00:19:31.475
[FIA] I wouldn't worry
if I were you.

00:19:31.576 --> 00:19:33.580
[FIA] I'm positive
that you'll see Mr. Bell

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.717
and the other surface-dwellers
again soon.

00:19:35.817 --> 00:19:38.055
[WIENE] Yeah...
[LANIER] You have
to let them go.

00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:40.326
[LANIER] Forget about those
wretched humans!

00:19:40.426 --> 00:19:43.633
[LANIER] Wiene, they'll cause
you nothing but trouble.

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:45.637
(WIENE sad)

00:19:45.737 --> 00:19:46.906
[WIENE] Lanier...,

00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:48.643
why do you hate
people like Bell?

00:19:48.743 --> 00:19:51.582
[WIENE] Their Familia and even
their goddess was nice to me!

00:19:51.682 --> 00:19:54.387
[LANIER] Their kindness was no
more than a passing fancy!

00:19:54.487 --> 00:19:55.957
[LANIER] You're far too naive!

00:19:56.058 --> 00:19:58.997
[LANIER] You know nothing of
mankind's cruelty and deceit!

00:19:59.097 --> 00:19:59.999
(mystical noise)

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:01.602
(WIENE gasp)

00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:02.604
[FIA] Wiene...?

00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:03.673
(FAU inquisitive)

00:20:03.773 --> 00:20:05.209
[WIENE] I can hear...

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:07.046
someone crying...

00:20:07.146 --> 00:20:09.250
[WIENE] They're
saying "Save me!"

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.554
[LANIER] One of our brethren?

00:20:10.654 --> 00:20:11.421
[WIENE] Yes...

00:20:11.522 --> 00:20:13.526
[WIENE] She's in so much pain...

00:20:13.626 --> 00:20:15.931
[WIENE] If we don't help her
soon...!

00:20:16.031 --> 00:20:17.433
(FIA surprised)

00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:19.304
[FIA] What should we do,
Lanier?!

00:20:19.404 --> 00:20:21.642
[LANIER] Sounds like
there's no time to waste.

00:20:21.743 --> 00:20:23.245
[LANIER] Let's move!

00:20:27.153 --> 00:20:30.159
(SIREN A screaming/pain)

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:32.698
[WIENE] It's close... so close.

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:34.735
[LANIER] She's right. I can hear
it, too.

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:38.676
[LANIER] Glos, do you read me?
We're on our way to recover a
new comrade.

00:20:38.777 --> 00:20:40.781
[LANIER] Stand by at
the rendezvous point.

00:20:40.881 --> 00:20:43.452
[GLOS] Wait, Lanier! It's
too dangerous to go alone.

00:20:43.553 --> 00:20:44.755
[GLOS] I'll send backup!

00:20:44.855 --> 00:20:46.626
(SIREN A screaming / pain)
(WIENE distressed)

00:20:46.726 --> 00:20:49.932
[LANIER] The torment in her
voice... We can't afford to
wait!

00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:51.101
[GLOS] Stand down, Lanier!

00:20:51.201 --> 00:20:52.871
[GLOS] It could be a trap.

00:20:54.207 --> 00:20:55.544
(WIENE shock)

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:07.366
(SIREN A pain)

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:09.972
[SIREN A] Run... run away...

00:21:10.072 --> 00:21:10.841
(WIENE shock)

00:21:10.941 --> 00:21:12.009
(LANIER shock)

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.947
[DIX] Well, would you look
at that...

00:21:14.047 --> 00:21:16.519
Monsters can cry.

00:21:17.186 --> 00:21:19.625
(jump)

00:21:19.725 --> 00:21:21.361
(DIX amused)

00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:22.463
[LANIER] Adventurers!

00:21:22.564 --> 00:21:24.502
[FIA] An ambush!
(WIENE gasp)

00:21:24.602 --> 00:21:27.306
[DIX] All according to
my ingenious plan.

00:21:27.406 --> 00:21:30.012
I heard that Vouivres
have some good ears...

00:21:30.112 --> 00:21:33.953
and it looks like a squawkin'
siren was the perfect lure.

00:21:36.592 --> 00:21:38.428
[LANIER] You bastards...!

00:21:44.742 --> 00:21:45.677
(GRAN slash)

00:21:48.883 --> 00:21:50.052
(AUDE pain, die)

00:21:51.354 --> 00:21:52.290
[LANIER] Aude!

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.960
Gran, you moron...

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.266
We could've made ourselves a
nice chunk of change from that
thing?

00:21:57.366 --> 00:21:59.437
[GRAN] I got carried
away... My bad.

00:21:59.538 --> 00:22:06.017
[DIX] There's fewer of them than
I thought... Disappointing.

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:08.322
I guess there's no need to
break out the big guns.

00:22:08.422 --> 00:22:10.459
(LANIER angry)

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.931
[DIX] Alright... Let's dance.

00:22:14.535 --> 00:22:20.647
(Ending Song, "Evergreen")

00:23:45.784 --> 00:23:48.923
[HESTIA] Next time:
"Ikelos Familia."
