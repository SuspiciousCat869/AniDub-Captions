WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.412
[HESTIA] Since the dawn of time,
long before the gods' descended
to the Lower World...

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:11.322
[HESTIA] humanity is at war,
waged against a pure evil known
as "monsters."

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:13.995
(WIENE panting)
[PARTY MEMBER A] It's over
there! That way!

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:16.734
(WIENE gasp) (fear)

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:18.169
[GRAN] Don't let it get away!

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.446
(WIENE heavy breathing)

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:27.789
(WIENE trip) (pain)

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:28.791
(BIRD MONSTER roaring)

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.697
(WIENE terror)

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:41.015
[HESTIA] Scorned by civilized
society, even the gods are
powerless to save them.

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:42.284
(WIENE heavy breathing)

00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:48.096
(BELL land) (gasp)

00:00:51.102 --> 00:00:53.941
(WIENE scared)

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.878
A vouivre...

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.724
[HESTIA] For people and
monsters, living together in
harmony was never an option.

00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:09.773
(BELL shock)

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:18.490
(WIENE scared) (cry)

00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:20.662
[BELL, internal]
A monster that can cry...?

00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:21.597
(BIRD MONSTER screeching)

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:22.699
(WIENE &amp; BELL startled)

00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:31.149
(BELL shock) (determined)
(grunt)

00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:33.854
(BELL attack)

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:35.658
(BIRD MONSTER death)

00:01:37.862 --> 00:01:39.198
(BELL conflicted)

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:40.802
[PARTY MEMBER A] Where the
hell's that little rat?!

00:01:40.902 --> 00:01:42.338
(BELL notice)

00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:45.444
[GRAN] It couldn't have gone
far, we need to find it!

00:01:47.047 --> 00:01:50.487
[GRAN] Heya, kid! Have
you maybe seen a vouivre
pass through here?

00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:53.628
[BELL] P-please... Can
you spare a potion, sir!?

00:01:53.728 --> 00:01:56.332
[BELL] My friend got burned
really bad!

00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:59.372
(GRAN thinking) (tsk)

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:01.342
[GRAN] Thanks for nothin'.

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:14.468
(BELL relief) (nervous)

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.874
(BELL surprised)

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:20.247
(WIENE whimper)

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:23.253
(BELL hesitant)

00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:25.858
(ponder)

00:02:26.994 --> 00:02:28.597
(BELL reassuring)

00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:30.501
(WIENE shock)

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.177
[MIKOTO] Master Bell!

00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:38.483
[BELL] Hey you guys...

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:40.387
[WELF] Where'd you run off to?

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:42.659
[WELF] We were worried something
happened after you disappeared.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.228
Glad you're okay.

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:48.236
You know wandering off by
yourself on the 19th Floor
is very dangerous!

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:52.177
[HARUHIME] So, um... Master
Bell... Who is this?

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:55.417
Let's head back... we can
talk on the 18th floor.

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:57.689
(ALL confused)
[HARUHIME] Oh?

00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:00.728
[LILI] Out with it, Master Bell.

00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:03.099
[LILI] Who is this person and
where did she come from?!

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:08.811
Don't tell me you rescued a
mysterious girl and made yet
another mess for us to clean up!

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:13.521
(WIENE trip) (gasp)

00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:14.856
(ALL shock)

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:16.259
(WELF jump back)

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.766
[WELF] The hell is that, Bell?!

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.735
(MIKOTO determined)

00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:22.104
Wait, you guys! She's not-

00:03:22.204 --> 00:03:23.941
[LILI] Get away
from it, Master Bell!

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.578
[LILI] What are you
even thinking?!

00:03:25.678 --> 00:03:27.782
[LILI] You gonna keep it just
'cause it's got a pretty face?!

00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:29.820
[LILI] If I didn't know any
better, I'd say you're treading

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.391
awfully close to "monster
fetish" territory!

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:34.161
(gasp) No! That's not--

00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:36.199
Master Bell,
monsters are monsters!

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.535
[LILI] They are our enemy!

00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:38.303
(BELL shock)

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:39.873
Bell, get out of the way!

00:03:39.973 --> 00:03:40.942
[MIKOTO] Master Bell...!

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.512
[LILI] Well?

00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:43.246
(BELL gasp)

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:44.181
(WIENE trying to talk)

00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:45.985
[BELL] Huh? (notice)

00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:48.223
[WIENE] B... Beh

00:03:48.323 --> 00:03:49.458
(shock)

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.795
[WIENE] Bell...?

00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:52.064
[BELL] Uh, yeah...

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:55.036
That's right... That's
me, that's my name.

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:59.345
Um-ah... Uh Bell...
Nuh-name is Bell?

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:02.752
Tell me you heard
that... It just spoke.

00:04:02.852 --> 00:04:04.121
Y'gotta be kiddin'...

00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:05.792
[LILI shock)

00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:09.498
[HARUHIME] Master Bell... What
exactly happened to the two of
you?

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.737
[BELL] I spotted her on the
19th Floor...

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:16.045
being chased by adventurers and
attacked by other monsters...

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:18.450
She was shaking and crying.

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:21.557
[BELL] I want to help this girl.

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:23.661
Not a chance, Master Bell!

00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:27.234
If we were caught harboring a
monster... Our Familia would be
done for!

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:30.340
Look guys... I
can't leave her.

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:35.952
(LILI sigh)

00:04:37.054 --> 00:04:38.824
[LILI] Fine, do
whatever you want.

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:40.628
(WELF hesitant)

00:04:42.464 --> 00:04:44.101
[BELL] I'm sorry everyone...

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:45.237
[BELL] Thank you.

00:04:45.337 --> 00:04:46.607
What's our next
course of action?

00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:49.145
Do we dare take her
back to the surface?

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:53.453
That's right. In the Dungeon,
she's at risk of being attacked.

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:56.760
[BELL] Let's take her home...
and talk to Goddess Hestia.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.729
[WIENE] Take... home?

00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:00.968
[BELL] Uh-huh.
Let's go to our house.

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:05.978
[FELS] There's trouble
brewing, Uranus.

00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:10.487
[FELS] A monster possessing
intelligence has made contact
with an adventurer.

00:05:10.588 --> 00:05:12.525
[FELS] They shall
exit Babel shortly.

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:15.832
[URANUS] And who might
this adventurer be?

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:17.134
[FELS] Bell Cranel.

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:21.743
The Little Rookie, eh? That's
one of Hermes' favorites.

00:05:21.844 --> 00:05:24.916
[FELS] What say you? For good
or ill, the Hestia Familia

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:28.389
is currently the center
of the city's attention.

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:32.464
I must discern... whether
or not Hestia's children...

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:36.673
are up to the task of becoming
their beacon of hope.

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:39.211
[HESTIA] What did you just say?!

00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:43.253
[HESTIA] O-of course I've never
heard of a talking monster
before!

00:05:43.353 --> 00:05:44.455
(WIENE fear)

00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:46.158
[BELL] I-I figured as much...

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.866
[HESTIA] Ugh! To tell you
the truth, it is kinda hard
to believe.

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:53.507
But uh... the poor thing
does seem scared though.

00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:54.876
[BELL] Does that mean...

00:05:54.976 --> 00:05:58.383
[HESTIA] Yeah... I say we keep
her here for now.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.220
(BELL relief)

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.659
[HESTIA] Okay, so...
You got a name?

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.996
[WIENE] My name... is Bell.

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:08.169
Oh, uh, that's my name
actually... What's yours?

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:09.338
(WIENE surprised)

00:06:09.438 --> 00:06:11.710
What is name... my name.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.847
Guess she doesn't
have one.

00:06:13.948 --> 00:06:16.419
Her species is referred
to as "vouivre"...

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.489
She doesn't seem to
have a name of her own.

00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:20.895
C'mon... Ya' gotta
name her, man.

00:06:20.995 --> 00:06:23.299
[BELL] Huh?!
[HESTIA] Welf is right, Bell!

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:24.869
[HESTIA] You're the one who
brought her home,

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.042
take responsibility for your
actions and be a good father!

00:06:28.142 --> 00:06:29.011
(BELL hesitant)

00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:30.180
(WIENE notice)

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.850
(BELL awkward)

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.927
Uh... then, uh...let's see...
How about "Wilusine" then?

00:06:37.027 --> 00:06:41.904
Master Bell... isn't that a
name from a spirit fairy tale?

00:06:42.004 --> 00:06:44.676
Yeah! It is! You like it?!

00:06:44.776 --> 00:06:46.379
Well... it's better than what

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.449
I thought you'd come up with.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.053
Nah, it's way too long...

00:06:50.153 --> 00:06:52.291
Also kinda pretentious.

00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:53.894
Very much so.

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.065
[HESTIA] In that case...!

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:59.071
How's about we just
shorten it to "Wiene"?

00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:01.409
"Wiene"... you say?

00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:03.881
(BELL notice)

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:06.252
Wie...ne...?

00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:09.091
Wiene... is name.

00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:11.495
Wiene name! I am... Wiene!

00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:12.865
(HESTIA satisfied)
(HARUHIME gasp)

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.736
[HESTIA] Still, the
fact of the matter is,

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:16.472
this small girl is a monster....

00:07:16.573 --> 00:07:18.644
So we need to gather
some information.

00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:20.715
[HESTIA] We should split
up and look for clues.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.921
[HESTIA] One. We need
to find out if there's
others just like her.

00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:26.693
And two, if there's something
weird going on in the Dungeon.

00:07:26.793 --> 00:07:28.631
[HESTIA] For now let's
keep this between us.

00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:31.135
[HESTIA] Outside of Hephaistos,
Miach, and Take,

00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:35.410
we don't want any of the other
gods or children sticking their
noses into our business.

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:37.047
[HESTIA] Anything you
can get your hands on.

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:39.218
[HESTIA] Search for leads
and report back to me.

00:07:39.318 --> 00:07:43.259
[MIKOTO] And that's about the
gist of it. Do uh, you have any
theories?

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:44.529
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI thinking)

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.533
While it's rather
difficult to believe...

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:47.969
anything is possible.

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:49.839
There are things
in the Lower World

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:52.210
even we gods cannot anticipate.

00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:54.048
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI thinking)

00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:59.124
Mikoto... What are your
thoughts on all this? The
talking monster I mean?

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:00.561
[MIKOTO] I'm not sure...

00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:02.865
[MIKOTO] She doesn't strike
me as being hostile...

00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:06.439
in fact, she looks just
like an ordinary girl.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.409
[MIKOTO] ...but I can't
shake this feeling.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.413
[MIKOTO] I mean...
she's a monster...

00:08:10.514 --> 00:08:12.819
And quite frankly
that bothers me.

00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:16.593
[ADVENTURER A] You hear the
rumors? About the monster

00:08:16.693 --> 00:08:18.496
who swiped a bunch of
dungeon supplies?

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:20.266
[ADVENTURER B] Y'mean the one
totin' a sword around?

00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:23.172
I heard it showed its ugly face
on the middle floors, too.

00:08:23.272 --> 00:08:26.445
[ADVENTURER A] Yeah, and it
roughed up those poor Rivira
bastards real good.

00:08:26.546 --> 00:08:27.815
[ADVENTURER B]
I heard that, too.

00:08:27.915 --> 00:08:29.919
[ADVENTURER A] Oh, look,
that's the one.

00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:36.867
[WELF] No friggin' way... Damn.

00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:47.220
[WIENE] What is the
big bright thing?

00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:52.464
It's called the Sun.
It gives us our light.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:53.901
I like it...

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.170
it's warm...

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.274
(HARUHIME sigh)

00:08:57.374 --> 00:09:00.280
I think I like it up here!

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.152
This thing too stuffy... so...

00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:04.421
I take it off! (struggling)

00:09:04.522 --> 00:09:05.190
(BOTH shock)

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.225
No-please!

00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:07.595
You mustn't, Lady Wiene!

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:08.897
(WIENE fall back)

00:09:08.997 --> 00:09:10.534
You have to wear it, Wiene!

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:11.937
[BELL] Okay?

00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:13.974
(WIENE irritated)

00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:24.896
(tavern chatter)

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.214
[LILI] An Arve
spring water please.

00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:43.567
[LILI] I'm wondering...
do you have any information...
on talking monsters?

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.303
[BARKEEPER] I can't say I do.

00:09:45.403 --> 00:09:48.242
[LILI] Can you point me in the
direction of someone who may?

00:09:48.342 --> 00:09:51.583
[LULUNE] I know a thing or two
that you might find interesting.

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:54.823
[LULUNE] I wouldn't expect too
much though.

00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:56.459
[LILI] Mud Hound.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.628
[LULUNE] Oh whoa...

00:09:57.728 --> 00:09:59.666
someone actually knows
my nickname?!

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.903
[LULUNE] S'cuse me. I'll take
one mead, please!

00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:03.540
[LILI] Go on...
[LULUNE] Hmm?

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.976
[LILI] Tell me what you know.

00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:08.449
Y'see, I lost a pretty penny
in a bet the other day.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.422
[LULUNE] Payin' off my tab might
be kinda tough, y'catch me?

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:12.457
(LILI annoyed)

00:10:12.558 --> 00:10:14.027
(LULUNE satisfied)

00:10:15.263 --> 00:10:17.033
(drinking)

00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:18.336
(refreshing)

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:21.208
[LULUNE] Word on the street,
there are disembodied voices

00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:25.183
echoing off the Dungeon walls
despite no adventurers in the
area.

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:28.256
[LULUNE] There are stories of
multiple voices talking at once,

00:10:28.356 --> 00:10:31.563
and some say they've heard
singing on the lower floors.

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.199
[LULUNE] Aside from that...

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.803
You're not the only person

00:10:34.903 --> 00:10:37.775
to come lookin' for a little
dirt on these talking monsters.

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:44.722
[LULUNE] Nobody takes the
rumors seriously, but it
seemed like these guys
weren't messin' around.

00:10:44.823 --> 00:10:46.927
[LILI] Who exactly were they?

00:10:47.027 --> 00:10:49.632
Ah... Honestly, that's
what I'd like to know...

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:52.304
...and well I'm under
orders to find out.

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:55.911
[LULUNE] I don't think
I've seen you before...
Who are you working for?

00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:59.686
Most elves I know don't
like gettin' their hands dirty.

00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:01.623
[LULUNE sniffing)

00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:02.490
(LILI annoyed)

00:11:02.592 --> 00:11:04.061
Oh, leaving so soon?

00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:07.735
[LULUNE] I was hoping for
a bit more of a chit-chat.

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:13.279
[LILI, internal]
I'm being followed.

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:15.618
[LILI, internal] She's a
high-level adventurer...

00:11:15.718 --> 00:11:17.822
[LILI, internal] I can't
afford to be picky.

00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.628
[HARUHIME] Lady Wiene!

00:11:20.728 --> 00:11:22.364
Are you interested
in a little meal?

00:11:22.464 --> 00:11:25.538
You haven't eaten anything
since yesterday, have you?

00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:27.007
[WIENE] A meal...?

00:11:27.107 --> 00:11:29.712
It's, uh... just another
way to say "food."

00:11:29.812 --> 00:11:31.015
(WIENE curious)

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:34.221
I'll join you guys as
well... So let's eat.

00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:35.323
[WIENE] Kay!

00:11:36.593 --> 00:11:37.728
(WIENE thinking)

00:11:37.828 --> 00:11:39.331
Just give it a try.

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:41.435
(WIENE look)

00:11:42.404 --> 00:11:45.143
(bite, eating)

00:11:45.243 --> 00:11:46.278
(surprised)

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.550
(WIENE astonished)

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.586
That tasty?

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:52.625
Ta... sty...

00:11:52.725 --> 00:11:54.328
I'm really happy
to hear that!

00:11:54.428 --> 00:11:57.835
The rice balls were made by
Lady Mikoto... Help yourself!

00:11:57.935 --> 00:12:00.306
(WIENE notice)
[HARUHIME] We also brought
some fresh fruit.

00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:02.010
(WIENE thinking)

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.285
(bite, eating)

00:12:06.385 --> 00:12:07.555
(HARUHIME hmm?)

00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:08.422
(WIENE laughing)
(HARUHIME fall)

00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:09.458
(BELL shock)

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:11.195
(WIENE humming) (bite)

00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:12.632
(HARUHIME sad)

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.905
(WIENE happy)

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:22.885
(WIENE notice)

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.256
(WIENE sigh)

00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:27.193
(WIENE grab &amp; miss)

00:12:27.294 --> 00:12:28.396
(BOTH happy)

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:29.666
[WIENE] Hey, Bell...

00:12:29.766 --> 00:12:30.668
(BELL question)

00:12:30.768 --> 00:12:31.670
The fruits...

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.507
they all smell really good!

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:37.147
Yeah, you're right...
They were sweet and
juicy weren't they?

00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:39.852
[WIENE] And rice balls, tay-sty!

00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:41.790
Do you think so too?

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.294
Mmhm... They were
really delicious.

00:12:44.394 --> 00:12:47.033
(laughing)

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:48.235
(happy)

00:12:49.071 --> 00:12:54.381
[WIENE] Bell! Bell! (giggling)

00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:55.584
(BELL pain)

00:12:55.684 --> 00:12:57.053
(WIENE gasp)

00:12:58.155 --> 00:12:59.892
[HARUHIME] Master Bell?!
(BELL pain)

00:12:59.993 --> 00:13:01.896
[HARUHIME] I'll get
the first-aid kit!

00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:07.541
(gasp) O...Oh no...
Bell is... in pain?

00:13:07.642 --> 00:13:08.910
(WIENE gasp)

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:12.551
[WIENE] Please, no... I...

00:13:13.285 --> 00:13:14.488
I'm sorry!

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:16.693
I'm sorry, Bell!

00:13:16.793 --> 00:13:19.431
(WIENE upset)

00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:28.817
(WIENE startled) (struggling)

00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:29.786
[BELL] Don't worry.

00:13:29.886 --> 00:13:31.589
(WIENE gasp)

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.225
[BELL] I'll be just fine.

00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:40.106
(WIENE shock) (crying)

00:13:40.206 --> 00:13:41.810
(BELL nod)

00:13:42.645 --> 00:13:43.580
[WIENE] Bell!

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.651
[BELL] Huh? (laugh)

00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:47.220
(WIENE laughing)

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.892
[BELL] (laughing) Now, now...
[WIENE] Bell! Bell! (laughing)

00:13:49.992 --> 00:13:50.928
(HARUHIME notice)

00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:52.030
(WIENE laugh)

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.802
(BELL happy) (notice)

00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:02.384
(BELL confusion)

00:14:04.087 --> 00:14:05.758
[HESTIA] I'm home.

00:14:05.858 --> 00:14:07.895
[HESTIA exhausted)

00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:09.331
[HESTIA] How'd it go, you guys?

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.137
[WELF] No luck here...
Couldn't find any real leads.

00:14:12.237 --> 00:14:16.345
[MIKOTO] And well Lord
Takemikazuchi didn't
have any ideas either.

00:14:16.445 --> 00:14:19.017
[LILI] Yeah same here.
It's a long story...

00:14:19.117 --> 00:14:22.591
(HESTIA sigh) (notice)

00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:24.094
[HESTIA] Bell?

00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:26.699
[HARUHIME] Go on, Lady Wiene.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.438
(WIENE surprise) (nervous)

00:14:29.539 --> 00:14:32.243
[WIENE] Weh..welcome to home.

00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:33.980
(WIENE afraid)

00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:35.617
[WELF] Well it looks
like you two bonded.

00:14:35.718 --> 00:14:39.091
[HESTIA] Wow, Haruhime... You'd
really make a great mom, huh!

00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:40.393
[HARUHIME embarrassed)

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:44.702
(WIENE munch) (happy)

00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:46.038
[WIENE] Tasty...

00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:47.340
[WIENE] I like it Mikoto!

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.246
Uh... Oh... Thank
you very much!

00:14:50.346 --> 00:14:52.317
You are really
good at cooking...

00:14:52.417 --> 00:14:55.156
Haruhime told me that you
are the best in the kitchen!

00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:59.498
No! I'm not! I still have a
lot of room for improvement.

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:00.834
But still...

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:03.406
Getting such genuine praise
warms my heart...!

00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:04.575
[LILI] Lady Mikoto!

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:06.746
Have you already forgotten
that she's a monster?!

00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:07.948
Don't let your guard down!

00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:09.819
Don't be so uptight...
Miss Supporter.

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:13.159
At times like these,
it's important to keep
positive, isn't it?

00:15:13.259 --> 00:15:15.731
[LILI] You're being way too
casual about this!

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.635
Aw, come on. Just relax!

00:15:17.735 --> 00:15:20.473
[HESTIA] Here you go, Wiene.
Have some of mine, too.

00:15:20.574 --> 00:15:21.743
(WIENE ahhh) (eating)

00:15:21.843 --> 00:15:23.446
(LILI annoyed chewing)

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:24.549
[WIENE] (laughing) Tasty!

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:26.118
[HESTIA] (giggling)
I figured you'd like it!

00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:28.590
Awe... You guys
are just too much.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:29.424
[HARUHIME] Here.

00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:31.228
(drinking)

00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:33.867
Well, she's gotten a lot
more talkative, hasn't she?

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:36.472
Yeah. Since our
picnic earlier today.

00:15:36.573 --> 00:15:39.779
Thing is... Squeaks
ain't the problem here.

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:42.050
You sure this is a good idea?

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.620
(BELL sigh)
(WIENE ahh) (eating)

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.160
[BELL] So... do you
not trust her either?
(HESTIA laugh)

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.464
[WELF] I just don't want 'em
to get their hopes up, y'know?

00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:52.070
[HESTIA] C'mon, Miss
Supporter. Get over here!

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.773
[LILI] I'll pass, thanks though!

00:15:53.874 --> 00:15:54.976
[HARUHIME] No need to be shy.

00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:56.713
[LILI] I'm fine!
(BELL nervous laugh)

00:15:56.813 --> 00:15:57.948
I bet this probably feels

00:15:58.048 --> 00:16:00.052
like a huge weight
is off your shoulders.

00:16:00.153 --> 00:16:02.858
Are you sad that she's not
glued to your side anymore?

00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.194
(MIKOTO bashful/happy)
[HARUHIME] Say, "Ah."

00:16:04.294 --> 00:16:07.935
[BELL] No, not at all. (happy)
(LILI annoyed)

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:26.371
[WIENE] How come Bell
isn't in bath with us?

00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:27.842
(HARUHIME awkward)
(MIKOTO awkward)

00:16:27.942 --> 00:16:29.244
[HARUHIME] Well, um...

00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:31.448
[LILI] Master Bell is
a boy, do the math!

00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:35.624
[HESTIA] Well, men and women
have a strange relationship...
It's tricky.

00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:37.595
(WIENE thinking)

00:16:39.497 --> 00:16:41.603
(WIENE wince) (shakes like a
dog)

00:16:41.703 --> 00:16:42.705
(ALL yelling)

00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:45.644
[MIKOTO content sigh)

00:16:45.744 --> 00:16:47.180
[MIKOTO] I'm in heaven!

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.886
So whaddya think of the
bath? It's nice, right?

00:16:49.986 --> 00:16:51.455
It... feels good!

00:16:51.556 --> 00:16:52.958
(LILI blowing bubbles)

00:16:53.058 --> 00:16:55.664
Is something the
matter... Lady Lili?

00:16:55.764 --> 00:17:00.574
(inhale) This dumb Familia
has way too many people with
gigantic freakin' boobs.

00:17:00.674 --> 00:17:01.943
(ALL question)

00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:03.914
(LILI angry)

00:17:04.014 --> 00:17:06.218
(ALL happy sigh)

00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:08.188
(WIENE annoyed sigh)

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:10.026
I much rather spend
time with Bell!

00:17:10.126 --> 00:17:12.230
(HARUHIME, HESTIA, MIKOTO shock)
(LILI annoyed)
[MIKOTO] Wiene wait!

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:13.800
[HESTIA] H-hold on a sec, Wiene!

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.207
[HARUHIME] Stop,
Lady Wiene! Come back!

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:22.317
[BELL] Huh?! Wiene?!
W..wait-! (scream)

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.054
(ALL tense)

00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:31.468
[WELF] Tada... All done.

00:17:33.105 --> 00:17:34.374
(WIENE excited)

00:17:34.474 --> 00:17:36.211
[WIENE] So nice! Thanks, Welf!

00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:39.619
[WELF] Sure! (chuckles)

00:17:39.719 --> 00:17:41.990
(WIENE giggling)

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.793
(BELL poked) (amused)

00:17:43.893 --> 00:17:45.864
[WIENE] So uh... does that hurt?

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.835
[BELL] Nope! I'm all right!

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:49.906
(WIENE joy)
(BELL surprise)

00:17:50.006 --> 00:17:52.477
[WIENE] (giggling)
That's good! Bell! Bell!
(BELL face being played with)

00:17:52.578 --> 00:17:54.815
[LILI] (sigh) What are you
acting so giddy for?

00:17:54.916 --> 00:17:57.621
Claws grow back, y'know and
if they aren't filed down,

00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:59.892
she could end up causing
some real damage!

00:17:59.992 --> 00:18:01.128
(BELL] Well yeah, but...

00:18:01.228 --> 00:18:02.998
(LILI shock)

00:18:03.098 --> 00:18:04.936
[WIENE] Lili, do you hate Bell?

00:18:05.036 --> 00:18:07.040
Where did that
come from...?!

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.275
[WIENE] Do you?

00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:11.181
Well, I... I wouldn't
quite say that....

00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:14.054
(LILI awkward)
(WIENE thinking)

00:18:14.154 --> 00:18:17.360
[HARUHIME] I.. for one...
I do love Master Bell!

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.429
(LILI shocked)
(WIENE question)

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.667
Ditto... he's a cool ass dude.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.405
(WELF pushed) (annoyed)
[HESTIA] Obviously I do, too!

00:18:23.506 --> 00:18:24.508
As do I!

00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:28.683
(LILI stammering)

00:18:28.783 --> 00:18:31.455
[LILI] Okay fine! Lili
feels the same way!

00:18:31.556 --> 00:18:34.027
[LILI] I love Master
Bell very much!

00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:35.864
[BELL] Same here...

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:37.066
Me too...

00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:38.903
I love all of you guys, as well.

00:18:39.004 --> 00:18:40.039
(WIENE joy)

00:18:40.139 --> 00:18:42.410
You all... You love Bell...

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:45.550
You all... loves each other?

00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:46.886
(LILI embarrassed)

00:18:46.986 --> 00:18:50.694
[WIENE] (giggle)
Bell is very warm!

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:53.165
(BELL happy)

00:18:55.469 --> 00:19:01.348
[HARUHIME] Perhaps it's a
misplaced sense of pity... but I
find myself in the same boat...

00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:04.989
Much like him...
I can't abandon Lady Wiene.

00:19:05.089 --> 00:19:06.793
[MIKOTO] To be honest...
(HARUHIME notice)

00:19:06.893 --> 00:19:08.997
I'm unsure of my own feelings.

00:19:09.097 --> 00:19:11.335
However... when I
see her smiling...

00:19:11.435 --> 00:19:14.709
it appears to be no different
than the smiles of our own.

00:19:15.844 --> 00:19:17.146
[MIKOTO] If it's possible...

00:19:17.246 --> 00:19:20.754
...and if we can foster
a close relationship...

00:19:20.854 --> 00:19:22.323
[LILI] I'm almost positive...

00:19:22.423 --> 00:19:25.096
that the gods are withholding
something about the Dungeon...

00:19:25.196 --> 00:19:28.369
but I don't understand
why they choose to
hide it from all of us.

00:19:28.469 --> 00:19:29.805
[WELF] Who really knows.

00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:33.145
And yet they didn't foresee
our current predicament...

00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:34.749
No matter how I look at it,

00:19:34.849 --> 00:19:37.955
we've managed to insert
ourselves into an volatile
situation.

00:19:38.055 --> 00:19:42.130
You agreed to bringin'
her back here... So why
worry about it now?

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.171
[LILI] I haven't agreed
to anything. I just quit
fighting it...

00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:49.310
...with Master Bell being
a huge softie and all...

00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:51.783
[LILI] We mustn't let our
emotions control us.

00:19:51.883 --> 00:19:55.189
[LILI] If we aren't careful
around that girl... it'll
come back to bite us.

00:19:55.289 --> 00:19:56.692
(WELF sigh)

00:19:56.793 --> 00:19:59.565
[LILI] We can't go on
like this forever.

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:02.771
[LILI] After all,
she's a monster...

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.443
[BELL] Hey, uh, Goddess?

00:20:05.544 --> 00:20:08.015
Don't you think sleeping in your
own bed would be a lot less...

00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:09.484
cramped for everyone?

00:20:09.585 --> 00:20:10.954
[HESTIA] Come on
what's the harm?

00:20:11.054 --> 00:20:13.358
[HESTIA] I mean we're a big
happy family, aren't we?

00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:15.831
[WIENE] It's really,
nice and warm in bed.

00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:17.400
(BELL laughs)

00:20:19.905 --> 00:20:24.447
[BELL] Where did you come from,
Wiene? Were there others like
you?

00:20:24.982 --> 00:20:26.451
I don't know...

00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:30.359
When I woke up... I was
by myself somewhere dark.

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:33.332
I have these dreams...
about people...

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:36.606
[WIENE] ...but in the dreams...
I attack them...

00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:37.541
(BELL worried)

00:20:38.242 --> 00:20:40.379
[WIENE] Claw at them...

00:20:40.479 --> 00:20:44.454
bite at them...
rip them to pieces...

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:46.893
[WIENE] Everything
around me turns red.

00:20:46.993 --> 00:20:54.809
[WIENE] In my dreams, I
always angry... but then...
it gets colder...

00:20:54.909 --> 00:21:02.223
[WIENE] A bunch of people remind
me of you... They're protecting
someone from me...

00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:06.699
[WIENE] My body gets colder...
and colder...

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:11.776
[WIENE] I feel empty inside,
like there's a hole in my
chest...

00:21:11.876 --> 00:21:15.416
[WIENE] And those people,
they look so beautiful...

00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:17.921
[WIENE] After that,
it is always the same.

00:21:18.021 --> 00:21:22.029
[WIENE] I turn a bright red,
and then everything goes dark.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.900
[WIENE] I scream for help...

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.570
but no one comes to save me...

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.645
[WIENE] It is a scary...
lonely dream...

00:21:32.049 --> 00:21:35.590
[HERMES] And you traced these
monsters from the smugglers to
the buyer, is that correct?

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:40.667
[LAURIER] Yes... We found them
bound by chains in a cellar.
They were on an Elurian estate.

00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:45.911
[HERMES] Lulune. You mentioned
something about a child who was
looking for leads on talking
monsters.

00:21:46.011 --> 00:21:49.017
[LULUNE] Yeah. An tiny elf girl
I haven't seen around before.

00:21:49.117 --> 00:21:53.025
I followed her, but she
ditched me... With a
god-awful stink bomb...

00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:55.262
[LULUNE] (frustrated)
I lost her.

00:21:55.362 --> 00:21:57.835
[HERMES] Our client's demands
are not negotiable.

00:21:57.935 --> 00:22:01.241
We need to get as much
information as possible.

00:22:01.341 --> 00:22:03.278
[HERMES] Gods Dammit...

00:22:03.378 --> 00:22:06.986
This is a doozy... thanks
a lot... Uranus...

00:22:08.355 --> 00:22:11.328
[HERMES] So...
The Ikelos Familia, eh...

00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:17.373
(Ending Song, "over and over")

00:23:46.284 --> 00:23:48.823
[HESTIA] Next time: "Monster."
