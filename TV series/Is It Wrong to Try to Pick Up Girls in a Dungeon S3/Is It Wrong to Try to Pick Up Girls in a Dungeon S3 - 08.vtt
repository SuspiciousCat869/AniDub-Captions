(DIX groaning)

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:07.381
[DIX] That hurts...

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:11.222
(DIX grunting)

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:16.366
[DIX] Those damned monsters...
and that stupid ass punk.

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.405
[DIX] I'll slaughter
every last one of 'em!

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:32.732
(ASTERIUS growling)

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:36.139
[DIX] (grunting) Ah...

00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:40.782
[DIX] You want some of me...

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:41.917
[DIX] Wha-

00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:43.654
(ASTERIUS intimidating
breathing)

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:46.226
(ASTERIUS growl)

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:48.330
[DIX] Well, what
have we here, huh?

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.806
[DIX] Damn you... Damn You!!

00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:58.751

(WIENE straining)

00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:58.891
I dunno what he's doin',
and I don't give a rats' ass.

00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:00.427
C'mon, let's wrap this up.

00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:02.197
[BELL] Fire Bolt!
(BETE shock)

00:03:05.337 --> 00:03:07.408
[BETE] Huh?!

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.648
(WIENE labored breathing)

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.426
[HERMES, internal] The moment of
truth. If he screws this up...

00:03:16.527 --> 00:03:19.866
[HERMES, internal] Bell Cranel
becomes public enemy number one.

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:24.509
(WIENE straining)

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.481

(BELL scared) (determined)

00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:32.324
[BELL] This vouivre
right here is mine!

00:03:32.424 --> 00:03:34.495
[BELL] So keep your hands off!

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:37.902
(WELF worried)

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:39.506
(LILI concerned)

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.810
[HESTIA] Careful Bell...

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.952
(WIENE strain) (pain)

00:03:46.052 --> 00:03:47.221

(heavy breathing) (collisions)

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:57.274
[TIONA] So, uh... How are
we s'pposed to take that?

00:03:57.374 --> 00:03:58.944
[AIS] It is an unspoken rule...

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:02.217
Hijacking another adventurer's
target is frowned upon.

00:04:02.317 --> 00:04:06.058
[TIONA] Oh! Vouivres are
pretty rare... I getcha!

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.461
"Rules," my ass!

00:04:07.562 --> 00:04:09.966
That shit don't fly
outside the Dungeon!

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:13.874
[FINN] There's no reason
for us to cater to the
whims of a child.

00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:14.943
[FINN] Tail them!

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:18.717
(GLOS roaring)

00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:22.224
[TIONE] Armed monsters!

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:23.861
[RIVERIA] So we were
right to assume

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:27.167
that it's indeed in connection
to the incident in Rivira.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.305
[FINN] Ais, I'd like
you to hang back.

00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:32.010
[AIS] Huh? Is there
something wrong?

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:34.115
My thumb's acting up... M'kay?

00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:35.818
(AIS questioning)

00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:37.454
[FINN] Something feels off.

00:04:37.555 --> 00:04:39.893
Capture as many
alive as possible!

00:04:39.993 --> 00:04:41.028
[BETE] Alive?!

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.197
[BETE] Dammit...

00:04:42.297 --> 00:04:44.903
What's with all the

00:04:48.476 --> 00:04:49.713
(GLOS pain) (raging)

00:04:49.813 --> 00:04:51.650
[BETE] (kick) You
want some more?
(GLOS charge)

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.923
[BETE] Shouldn't you be down in
the shadows? This is our turf!

00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:56.425

00:04:56.927 --> 00:04:58.229

(TIONE grunting)

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:02.505
[LIDO, internal] So strong...

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:03.874
[LIDO, internal] Compared
to normal adventurers,

00:05:03.974 --> 00:05:05.243
they're leagues above!

00:05:05.343 --> 00:05:07.715
[LIDO, internal] But...
I won't let 'em beat me!

00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:09.753
(TIONE jump)

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:10.621
(LIDO swing)

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.032

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:20.340
(punched) (pain)

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.710
[TIONA] Well...

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.148
Didn't know goblins could
fight like a level 4...

00:05:24.248 --> 00:05:25.685

(ALULU weak) (dazed)

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:40.515
[FELS] The situation is
beginning to look grim...

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.419
[FELS] Forgive me, Uranus...

00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:45.423
[FELS] I have no choice!

00:05:49.164 --> 00:05:50.066
(ALL shock)

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:51.703
[TIONE] What's going on?!

00:05:53.406 --> 00:05:55.210
[TIONE] Another friend of
theirs?!

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.880
[BETE] Who the hell knows!

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.387
[FELS] A golem made
purely of adamantite...

00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:02.892
[FELS] My secret weapon
in case of an emergency!

00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:04.428
[TIONA] Get out the way!

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.132
[TIONA] I've been waitin' all
day for this!

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:07.234

[BETE] (shock) Hey!

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:10.708
[TIONA] Here goes...! (impact)

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.997
[TIONA] Check it out!
You like that?!

00:06:22.097 --> 00:06:23.233
[TIONE] Tiona, you idiot!

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:24.401
[TIONE] Weren't you listening?!

00:06:24.502 --> 00:06:25.905
The captain said
to take them alive!

00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:26.840
[TIONA] Whoops.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.409
(FELS laughing)

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.913
[FELS] We're doomed, Uranus...

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:32.919
[FELS] The Loki Familia are
more fearsome than monsters!

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:34.455
(FELS notice)

00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:39.633
(GARETH notice)

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:40.735
[IKELOS] Fair is fair...

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.772
I did draw the short straw...

00:06:42.872 --> 00:06:45.745
[GARETH] Are you the
one behind this mess?

00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:49.986
[GARETH] A god rubbing elbows
with monsters sounds fishy...

00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:52.090
[GARETH] No matter. I'm
taking you into custody.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.165
[IKELOS] Huh? (grabbed)
Yeah, sure, whatever,
just go easy on the goods!

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:58.604
(IKELOS screaming)

00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:01.042
[FELS] I am in your debt,
Lord Hermes.

00:07:01.142 --> 00:07:07.789
[HERMES] Come now... Your
expertise is an invaluable
asset honestly... dear Mage.

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:10.962
[FELS] It's "Fels" now. "Fels
the Fool."

00:07:11.062 --> 00:07:14.803
[HERMES] Well then, Fels...
Bell is all alone right now.

00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:17.742
[HERMES] Do me a favor
and help him out.

00:07:17.842 --> 00:07:20.013
[FELS] But what about the Xenos?

00:07:20.113 --> 00:07:21.550
(HERMES happy)

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:27.929
(LILI struggling)

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:29.131
[LILI] No, you can't!

00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:30.701
[WELF] C'mon! Let go, Lil Bit!

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:32.471
[WELF] The Xenos won't
survive if we don't

00:07:32.572 --> 00:07:33.907
[LILI] We can't do it!

00:07:34.008 --> 00:07:36.379
The damage done by Master
Bell is still unclear!

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:38.584
If we try to defend
those monsters...

00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:40.487
...the Hestia Familia is over!

00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:42.057

(WELF grunt)

00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:17.762
[WELF] A "Howl" skill?

00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:20.133
[HESTIA] Haruhime...

(ASTERIUS growling)

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:39.338
[AIS] Incredible...
A black minotaur...

00:08:39.438 --> 00:08:41.142
[LIDO] Asterius...

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:47.955
(ASTERIUS growl)

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:50.160
[TIONA] That's enough!

[TIONE] Think you're good, huh?!
Don't get cocky, you big bull
bastard!

00:09:05.991 --> 00:09:08.864

[AIS] His sword...

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:27.334
[AIS] It's magic!

(ASTERIUS growling)

00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:26.653
[FINN] Never mind about
capturing them.

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:28.356
[FINN] Get down there, Ais.

00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:29.859
[AIS] Understood.

00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:38.042

[MIKOTO] The War

It's Ais... Wallenstein...

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:33.319
Do you recognize that
minotaur, Ottarl?

00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:36.025
[OTTARL] Isn't that-

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:38.362
[OTTARL] No. It can't be...
