(CREATURES panic/pain/misery)

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:06.479
(LAMIA MORMOS scream)

00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:09.682
[DIX] You let the vouivre get
away?!

00:00:09.782 --> 00:00:11.285
[GRAN] Unfortunately, yes.

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.924
We lost sight of the damn thing
somewhere on the 19th Floor...

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:17.798
[IKELOS FAMILA LADY A] It's
probably being torn apart by
other monsters right now.

00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:20.303
[DIX] Ugh... A precious
opportunity gone to waste!

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:25.246
[DIX] That thing was worth some
serious scratch. We could have
sold it to those rich Elurian
freaks.

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.718
[DIX] Their nest is somewhere in

00:00:27.818 --> 00:00:28.954
the Colossal Tree Labyrinth...

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:30.289
but we still can't figure out

00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.728
where that damn thing's
located! Can we?!

00:00:32.828 --> 00:00:36.101
(LAMIA MORMOS death yell)

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.373
A vouivre, huh...?

00:00:38.473 --> 00:00:42.815
It's such a rare find... I'm not
inclined to give up so easily.

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:44.719
[DIX] Luckily,
we've got insurance.

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:48.259
[DIX] Get me a list of every
adventurer in Rivira at the
time.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.495
[GRAN] Roger that.

00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:52.501
[DIX] So, Master Ikelos...

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:55.941
[DIX] Would you mind lendin' us
a hand over here?

00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:57.077
(IKELOS cackle)

00:00:57.177 --> 00:00:58.747
What an arrogant
way of asking

00:00:58.847 --> 00:01:03.089
your god for a favor...
cocky little scamp.

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.563
[DIX] The gods can spot us
mortals lying from a mile away.

00:01:06.663 --> 00:01:11.105
If that vouivre is still alive
and some jackass is out there
protecting it...

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:13.610
I'm gonna need you
to sniff 'em out.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.581
What a pain in the ass...

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.386
[IKELOS] (grunt) Have you
forgotten that I'm a god?

00:01:18.487 --> 00:01:21.760
[DIX] Anything for you to keep
the boredom at bay, am I right?

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.897
[IKELOS] Such is life,
I suppose.

00:01:23.997 --> 00:01:27.872
Put on another good
show for me... Dix.

00:01:27.972 --> 00:01:29.442
(DIX heh)

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:36.389
(Opening Song, "over and over")

00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.344
[BELL] We're going to
the dungeon... aren't we?

00:03:10.444 --> 00:03:13.817
[HESTIA] That's right.
I had a chat with Hephaistos,
Take, and Miach...

00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:17.858
[HESTIA] We agreed there's only
so much we can learn about Wiene
up here on the surface.

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:23.503
[HESTIA] Normally the Guild
would be a good place to
start... but we have to keep a
low profile.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:24.772
Makes sense to me.

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.141
If word gets out...

00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:28.613
it would jeopardize the
future of our Familia.

00:03:28.713 --> 00:03:31.553
[LILI] And who knows what
would happen to her...
(WIENE giggling)

00:03:31.653 --> 00:03:32.955
[HESTIA] Exactly.

00:03:33.055 --> 00:03:34.659
So let's make this
trip to the Dungeon

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.563
as discreet as possible, okay?

00:03:36.663 --> 00:03:40.002
Scope out the place you found
her... And surrounding areas...

00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:42.106
Check it all out...
and report back.

00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:43.543
Sounds like a plan.

00:03:43.643 --> 00:03:46.248
[WIENE] Bell...
Are you going away?

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.789
Don't you worry... I'll
get back as soon as I can.

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.058
[WELF] Let's do it.

00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:53.162
But let's get back here
as soon as we can.

00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:57.838
And if these two are going to
stay behind... it'll be just the
three of us on 19.

00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:00.844
[LILI] A trip like that could
take upwards of a day...

00:04:00.944 --> 00:04:02.180
Okay...

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.317
Then remember, the
last thing we wanna do

00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:06.188
is ask the wrong
person for help.

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:07.558
(BELL concerned)

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:09.629
(WIENE worried)

00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:12.868
[RYU] You want to
travel to Rivira?

00:04:12.968 --> 00:04:14.338
[BELL] Uh... That's right!

00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:16.308
If you aren't...
busy, that is...

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.382
I was hoping that you might
lend us a hand, maybe?

00:04:19.482 --> 00:04:21.986
[SYR] Any particular
reason you're going?

00:04:22.086 --> 00:04:23.490
Well, uh... kinda!

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.560
There's this thing that we
have to take care of today,

00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.431
sort of like a quest
or something...

00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:28.767
Can ya' help?

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:30.236
(RYU suspicious)

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:32.574
[RYU] My deepest
apologies, Mr. Cranel.

00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:34.912
[RYU] I must attend to
my responsibilities here
at the pub-

00:04:35.012 --> 00:04:35.948

00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:37.484

[BELL] Miss Aisha!

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.989
[BELL] What are you
doing here...?

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:41.492
[AISHA] I was in the
neighborhood,

00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:44.665
so I figured I'd pay
Haruhime a lil' visit.

00:04:44.765 --> 00:04:47.236
[AISHA] That's when I saw
a few familiar faces.

00:04:47.338 --> 00:04:50.042
[AISHA] What's a guy like you
doin' in a place like this?

00:04:50.142 --> 00:04:53.082
[BELL] U-um, to tell
you the truth...

00:04:53.182 --> 00:04:54.284
[SYR] Oh wow...

00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:56.456
[SYR] She's like
an Amazon, right?

00:04:56.556 --> 00:04:57.491
(RYU annoyed)

00:04:57.591 --> 00:04:59.227
(AISHA hmmm?)

00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:01.466
[AISHA] You're in need
of a bodyguard, eh?

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:04.137
Okay... I think I can
help you out with that.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:05.440
Seriously?!

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.811
Uh-huh... It's just a quick trip

00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:09.482
to Rivira and back, isn't it?

00:05:09.582 --> 00:05:12.855
[AISHA] I've always
wanted to party up with
you in the Dungeon.

00:05:13.723 --> 00:05:14.625
[AISHA] However...

00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:15.961
(BELL notice) (scared)

00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:18.433

come cheap, y'know.

(SYR gasp)

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:20.202
I missed my chance

00:05:20.302 --> 00:05:21.806
to devour you the last time...

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:24.345
(BELL nervous)
[AISHA] Let's work out
an agreement, shall we?

00:05:24.445 --> 00:05:27.216
(AISHA licks lips)
(BELL fear)

00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:32.093
[RYU] Unhand him...
Do you hear me?

00:05:32.193 --> 00:05:34.365
[RYU] Such vulgar behavior
will not be tolerated.

00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:38.907
Huh? Excuse me?! Are
you insinuating the
boy is your prey?!

00:05:39.007 --> 00:05:40.811
Do not get the wrong idea.

00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:43.883
[RYU] Mr. Cranel and... his
intended have a commitment.

00:05:43.983 --> 00:05:46.456
[SYR] Huh?! (happy)
[AISHA] Oh yeah?
What a coincidence!

00:05:46.556 --> 00:05:51.866
I, too, have entrusted this boy
with my dearest protégée's
lifelong health and happiness.

00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:54.538
(BELL terrified)
[RYU] I'd rather you didn't
spout such nonsense.

00:05:54.638 --> 00:05:57.009
(SYR giggling)
[RYU] It will only
confuse Mr. Cranel.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.314
Oh, I get it. I get it.

00:05:59.415 --> 00:06:01.652
You're worried that I'm going
to get the first taste,

00:06:01.753 --> 00:06:04.324
so you're trying to butter him
up with all the cutesy crap.

00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:06.128
How very like an elf...

00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:10.136
[RYU] I cannot leave him in the
care of a woman with such poor
character.

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:11.773
[RYU] Stand down.

00:06:13.343 --> 00:06:14.879
[RYU] Syr.
(SYR giggling, notice)

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.582
[RYU] I'm taking a half day.

00:06:16.682 --> 00:06:19.187
I apologize, please
inform Mama Mia.

00:06:19.287 --> 00:06:20.757
[SYR] Huh?! Ryu?!

00:06:20.857 --> 00:06:22.260
This woman is trouble.

00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:24.465
To protect Mr. Cranel's
chastity...

00:06:24.565 --> 00:06:26.669
I shall accompany them
on their journey.

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:29.274
I'll be back in time to
help with the dinner rush.

00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:30.911
[SYR] O-okay...

00:06:31.813 --> 00:06:33.349
Well... I suppose it all

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.752
worked out in the end...

00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:36.889
Bein' a famous adventurer
sure seems rough...

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:39.895
I can't imagine dealing with
the extra attention...

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:41.365
Yeah, right..?

00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:43.903

[AISHA] It's all thanks to
someone kickin' my ass.

[AISHA] After my visit to the
Rakia camp,

00:06:55.994 --> 00:06:59.234
I holed up in the Dungeon

[RYU] Is something
the matter, Mr. Cranel?

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.220
[RYU] You don't seem

[AISHA] Talk about a major

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:52.240
[RYU] Let's make haste.

00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:54.077
[RYU] Allegedly,

(awkward laugh)

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.457
[AISHA] Fess up. If the
two of 'em really had

00:08:17.558 --> 00:08:19.762
gone to exchange dropped
items like you said,

00:08:19.862 --> 00:08:21.699
wouldn't they have
been back here by now?

00:08:21.799 --> 00:08:24.070
[RYU] I'm surprised that
they left you behind.

(LILI thinking)

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.409
It's possible...

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:27.578
that they need their
own "guy time"

00:08:27.678 --> 00:08:28.780
just like us girls do, right?!

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.383
So you're really
not gonna let us in

00:08:30.483 --> 00:08:31.919
on the little secret then, huh?

00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:33.423
I don't have the faintest idea

00:08:33.523 --> 00:08:36.395
what you're talking about.
Sorry, Lady Aisha!

00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.366
You annoying little shrimp.

00:08:38.466 --> 00:08:40.002
(RYU sigh)

00:08:43.576 --> 00:08:48.318
[BELL] Do you think... we
should've said something
to Miss Ryu and Miss Aisha
before leaving?

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:52.728
[WELF] It'd be way too risky..
If they tagged along they'd have
questions.

00:08:52.828 --> 00:08:55.500
You can just leave
'em to Squeaks.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.971
Hey... I know it's
all pretty new...

00:08:58.071 --> 00:09:01.846
but doesn't the terrain on
this floor seems like it's
different to you?

00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:04.618
[BELL] It's called the
"Colossal Tree Labyrinth."

00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:07.056
[BELL] They taught me
about it at the Guild.

00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:08.459
[WELF] Huh...

00:09:11.632 --> 00:09:13.469
[WELF] This the spot?

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.444
Mmhm... This is the place
where I met Wiene.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.684
[WELF] I don't see anything
outta the ordinary...

00:09:20.784 --> 00:09:22.888
[BELL] It's never
that easy, is it?

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:29.969
(WELF notice)

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:32.073
(BOTH startled)

00:09:36.415 --> 00:09:37.551
(BELL nod)

00:09:44.898 --> 00:09:47.103
[REI] You two reek
of my brethren...

00:09:47.203 --> 00:09:48.373
(BOTH question)

00:09:48.473 --> 00:09:51.077
[WELF] Huh!? What
did you just say?

00:09:51.177 --> 00:09:52.914
[REI] Are you their abductors?

00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:55.052
[REI] No you can't be.

00:09:55.152 --> 00:09:57.223
[REI] I detect no blood...

00:09:57.323 --> 00:09:59.662
Then are you, by any chance...

00:09:59.762 --> 00:10:02.567
...the individuals of
whom Fels spoke?

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:04.471
[BELL] Fels you say?

00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:07.310
[REI] Let me ask you...
Do you two believe...

00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:09.581
that we are capable
of coexisting?

00:10:09.682 --> 00:10:11.519
[BELL] What do you mean
"Coexisting"...?

00:10:11.619 --> 00:10:13.856
[WELF] What're you
yammerin' on about?!

00:10:13.957 --> 00:10:16.996
Your fellow brethren murder us
in cold blood...

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:20.737
while my brethren... also
slaughter your people.

00:10:20.837 --> 00:10:24.979
[REI] Is this our true destiny?
Can we not see eye to eye?

00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:26.549
(BOTH gasp)

00:10:27.049 --> 00:10:28.251
As for me...

00:10:28.353 --> 00:10:29.955
I'd wish to bask in the Sun.

00:10:30.055 --> 00:10:32.861
I'd like to soar high
above a vast world...

00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:35.934
filled with a warm light...
rather than this cold abyss.

00:10:36.034 --> 00:10:38.840
[REI] There's... something
different about you...
(BELL shocked)

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.213
[REI] I have high
hopes... for us.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.754
(BOTH gasp)

00:10:52.033 --> 00:10:52.734
[BELL] Feathers?

00:10:52.834 --> 00:10:54.203
Okay, you saw
that too...

00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:56.307
right Bell...?

00:10:56.409 --> 00:10:59.247
[BELL] She's...
just like Wiene...

00:11:05.627 --> 00:11:07.531
(BELL shock)

00:11:18.686 --> 00:11:21.359
[DIX] Oh? Is that
Little Rookie, eh?

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:23.128
[GRAN] It is...
no doubt about it.

00:11:23.228 --> 00:11:26.635
I'm positive... he was here
when the vouivre got away.

00:11:26.736 --> 00:11:28.439
(DIX intrigued)

00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:30.109
[DIX] Smells fishy... (chuckles)

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:34.785
[DIX] Perhaps it's time
for Master Ikelos to
turn up the heat...

00:11:40.797 --> 00:11:42.934
[BELL] I can't thank
you enough, everyone.

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:46.207
[AISHA] I must say, you've
certainly piqued my curiosity...

00:11:46.307 --> 00:11:49.415
[AISHA] But! Some questions
are better left unanswered.

00:11:49.515 --> 00:11:50.884
[RYU] Mr. Cranel...
(AISHA notice)

00:11:50.984 --> 00:11:52.554
[RYU] If you find
yourself in trouble,

00:11:52.654 --> 00:11:54.057
don't hesitate to ask for help.

00:11:54.157 --> 00:11:56.929
[RYU] I'll do everything
in my power to assist.

00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:00.135
I'll collect payment
some other time.

00:12:00.235 --> 00:12:02.874
Send my regards to Haruhime.

00:12:03.709 --> 00:12:04.812
(LILI sigh)

00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:06.749
So! Would you two
mind telling me

00:12:06.849 --> 00:12:08.218
what the heck happened?

00:12:08.318 --> 00:12:09.488
I mean c'mon guys...

00:12:09.588 --> 00:12:11.425
You two have been
acting awfully strange

00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:13.563
ever since you got back
from the 19th Floor.

00:12:13.663 --> 00:12:15.467
Uh... W-well...

00:12:15.567 --> 00:12:16.936
Yeah, about that...

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:20.710
Honestly, I still haven't
wrapped my head around it.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.914
You mind if we meet up
with Lady Hestia first?

00:12:23.014 --> 00:12:26.489
Uh... yeah, sure... If that's
what you prefer, it's fine.

00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:32.634
Sorry... Lili.... It's just that
I... need to be alone for a bit.

00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:40.115
[REI] Do you two believe... that
we are capable of coexisting?

00:12:40.215 --> 00:12:43.890
[BELL, internal] Who or
what was that person...?

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.829
[IKELOS] Yo, Little Rookie!
(BELL notice)

00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:51.171
[IKELOS] Lucky me! Fancy
meeting you here, kiddo...

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.976
Is there... something
I can help you with?

00:12:54.076 --> 00:12:55.078
(IKELOS laugh)

00:12:55.179 --> 00:12:57.451
Hey, there's no need
to be so nervous.

00:12:57.551 --> 00:13:02.861
Kinda hard though, eh? Us
gods can be quite the shady
characters, can't we?

00:13:03.396 --> 00:13:04.898
My name is Ikelos.

00:13:04.998 --> 00:13:07.938
[IKELOS] Unfortunately, the
impudent runts in my Familia

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.443
are dumping their
dirty work on me.

00:13:10.543 --> 00:13:12.914
[BELL] Uh... oh yeah?

00:13:13.014 --> 00:13:14.283
(IKELOS sigh)
(BELL tense)

00:13:14.384 --> 00:13:17.390
Tell me what you know
about a talking vouivre.

00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:18.559
(BELL gasp)

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:19.895
I hear that thing has got

00:13:19.995 --> 00:13:22.767
an absolutely
stunning little face!

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.375
[IKELOS] It appeared on
the 19th Floor.

00:13:26.475 --> 00:13:28.078
I'd love to sneak a peek...

00:13:28.178 --> 00:13:31.619
[IKELOS] I'm conducting an
investigation of sorts.

00:13:31.719 --> 00:13:33.823
Say... Little Rookie, buddy...

00:13:33.923 --> 00:13:35.727
Would..., you know anything
about that? ...Hmm?

00:13:35.827 --> 00:13:37.329
[HERMES] Is that you, Bell?

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:38.799
(BELL notice)

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.835
[BELL] Master Hermes...

00:13:39.935 --> 00:13:41.672
Go on Bell... Run along.

00:13:41.772 --> 00:13:45.880
[HERMES] I know being harassed
by a strange god isn't fun.
(BELL notice)

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.053
And Ikelos and I need to have
ourselves a chit-chat.

00:13:49.153 --> 00:13:50.690
Yeah?

00:13:53.696 --> 00:13:58.104
[HERMES] What's this I hear of
the Ikelos Familia's involvement
in the black market?

00:13:58.205 --> 00:13:59.441
Whaa?

00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:01.277
Am I a suspect or something?

00:14:01.378 --> 00:14:04.585
[HERMES] I don't enjoy
accusing an old buddy
of mine from Heaven.

00:14:04.685 --> 00:14:10.630
[HERMES] They say you have
ties to an organization... the
illicit group known as Evilus.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.434
[IKELOS] Lies and slander!

00:14:12.534 --> 00:14:14.471
[IKELOS] Evil just
isn't my style.

00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:15.907
[HERMES] That's not all...

00:14:16.007 --> 00:14:18.412
There's someone smuggling
unique monsters.

00:14:18.512 --> 00:14:22.219
Taking them outside Orario's
walls, as if to wreak havoc.

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:25.960
(IKELOS cackling)

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.434
Is that what you think
I'm after!? That's rich!

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:31.438
Really, Hermes?
That's my scheme!?

00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:35.713
To overrun the Lower World
with a bunch of nightmarish
creatures?!

00:14:35.813 --> 00:14:36.849
[IKELOS] Too funny.

00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:38.018
Sorry to disappoint...

00:14:38.118 --> 00:14:39.922
but it's got nothing
to do with me.

00:14:40.022 --> 00:14:42.494
Those kids of mine are
the ones running wild.

00:14:42.594 --> 00:14:47.871
They don't show me any
respect these days... Just
a buncha cocky riff-raff.

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.210
They even treat me like
I'm some errand boy!

00:14:51.311 --> 00:14:57.924
[IKELOS] Then again... Their
stupid antics never get old...
They crack me up...

00:14:58.024 --> 00:15:01.732
Keeping our Familias in check
is a part of our job as gods.

00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:06.775
Well they can put up with
all sorts of crap, but they
can't resist a good time.

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:08.813
Sounds familiar doesn't it?

00:15:08.913 --> 00:15:10.950
[IKELOS] So, as long as they
keep me entertained...

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.589
I don't really see the
point in stopping 'em.

00:15:13.689 --> 00:15:18.366
[IKELOS] They wouldn't knock
it off even if you killed me
and sent me back to Heaven.

00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:22.039
[IKELOS] They'll lay low... And
just worm their way into other
Familias...

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:25.647
Then they'll just pick up
right where they left off.

00:15:25.747 --> 00:15:26.615
(HERMES sigh)

00:15:26.715 --> 00:15:28.218
[HERMES] A fair point.

00:15:28.318 --> 00:15:29.388
(IKELOS stand)

00:15:29.488 --> 00:15:30.623
[IKELOS] Round up your friends

00:15:30.723 --> 00:15:32.226
you've got lurking in the
shadows...

00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:35.733
and feel free to do all
the digging you please.

00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:38.406
[IKELOS] Go ahead! I
don't give a rat's ass.

00:15:38.506 --> 00:15:41.779
[IKELOS] It'll be much more
interesting that way...

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:43.549
[HERMES] So distasteful.

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:46.388
These gods starving for
entertainment...

00:15:51.565 --> 00:15:53.001
[WIENE] I see you, Haruhime!

00:15:53.101 --> 00:15:56.542
[HARUHIME] My goodness!
Good job finding me, Wiene!

00:15:56.642 --> 00:15:58.846
[WIENE] Now it's
your turn to be "it"!

00:15:58.946 --> 00:16:01.585
[HARUHIME] Okay... I'll
start counting then.

00:16:01.685 --> 00:16:08.198
[HARUHIME] Are you ready? One...
Two... Three... four...
(WIENE laughing, gasp)

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:12.941
(WIENE awe)

00:16:13.576 --> 00:16:16.280
(look) (notice)

00:16:20.288 --> 00:16:20.957
(WIENE sniffing)

00:16:21.057 --> 00:16:22.627
[WIENE] Smells like Bell.

00:16:22.727 --> 00:16:24.096
(WIENE excited)

00:16:29.006 --> 00:16:31.879
(WIENE come up for air) (notice)

00:16:33.849 --> 00:16:35.252
(WIENE smelling)

00:16:35.353 --> 00:16:38.592
[WIENE] I wonder if
he's coming home soon...?

00:16:39.961 --> 00:16:41.365
[HESTIA] Is it true, Welf?!
(WIENE notice)

00:16:41.465 --> 00:16:43.168
[HESTIA] Are you
absolutely positive...

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:45.305
that it was a talking
monster like Wiene...?

00:16:45.406 --> 00:16:50.516
[WELF] Yeah. On floor 19...
in the exact spot where Bell
had found her.

00:16:50.616 --> 00:16:53.923
So you're saying there
are other creatures
out there... like her?

00:16:54.023 --> 00:16:55.626
[WELF] According
to the monster...

00:16:55.727 --> 00:16:59.300
it smelled the scent of its
"brethren" on us or whatever.

00:17:00.636 --> 00:17:02.206
(HESTIA pondering)

00:17:02.306 --> 00:17:03.376
[LILI] Well I...

00:17:03.476 --> 00:17:06.180
think we ought to part
our ways with Lady Wiene.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.049
(WIENE gasp)

00:17:07.149 --> 00:17:08.853
But Lili! What do you mean?!

00:17:08.953 --> 00:17:10.055
Hear me out...

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:11.625
We're hovering on the edge of

00:17:11.725 --> 00:17:13.662
a very dangerous
situation...

00:17:13.763 --> 00:17:15.967
This is getting far too risky.

00:17:16.067 --> 00:17:18.406
[MIKOTO] I know... but what
happens to Lady Wiene?!

00:17:18.506 --> 00:17:21.177
[LILI] We can release
her outside of Orario.

00:17:21.277 --> 00:17:27.757
She is a vouivre... She
should be much stronger
than any monsters living
on the surface right now.

00:17:27.857 --> 00:17:29.260
Lili please!

00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:30.363
Fine...

00:17:30.463 --> 00:17:32.734
let's suppose we continue
to protect her...

00:17:32.834 --> 00:17:34.771
What are we going to do?

00:17:34.871 --> 00:17:37.109
We can't keep her hidden
forever, y'know.

00:17:37.209 --> 00:17:40.850
Do we try to pass her off as
a monster that's been tamed?

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.454
No one would ever believe us.

00:17:42.554 --> 00:17:44.791
[LILI] That girl is
a ticking time bomb.

00:17:44.891 --> 00:17:50.336
[LILI] Things are fine now, but
at some point, she's going to
put our Familia in danger.

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:53.876
[LILI] Someone as sentimental as
Master Bell can't handle this.

00:17:53.976 --> 00:17:59.153
[LILI] No matter how much he
hates or resents us for it,
we must do something.

00:17:59.253 --> 00:18:04.698
Sadly us and Lady Wiene...
can't stay together forever.

00:18:04.798 --> 00:18:07.670
After all... she's a monster.

00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:09.374
(WELF sigh)

00:18:10.108 --> 00:18:11.645
(HESTIA serious)

00:18:11.745 --> 00:18:12.714
(door slamming)

00:18:12.814 --> 00:18:13.616
(MIKOTO gasp)

00:18:13.716 --> 00:18:15.318
(ALL notice)

00:18:16.087 --> 00:18:17.590
[MIKOTO] Don't tell me...

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.226
(LILI shock)

00:18:20.997 --> 00:18:23.168
[WIENE, internal] Why...? Why?!

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:26.307
[WIENE, internal] Why can I not
be with Bell and the others?!

00:18:27.343 --> 00:18:30.817
[WIENE, internal] Bell...
where are you?!

00:18:30.917 --> 00:18:33.589
[WIENE, internal] Bell... Bell!

00:18:34.758 --> 00:18:36.027
[BELL] Wiene disappeared?!

00:18:36.127 --> 00:18:37.730
[HESTIA] It's my fault.

00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:40.268
[HESTIA] I didn't know
she was listening in on
our conversation...

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:44.210
Everyone has split up...
They're on their way to
find her right now.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.113
[BELL] I'm heading out, too!

00:18:46.214 --> 00:18:48.318
(HESTIA concerned) (sigh)

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:51.324
Please be safe out
there... Wiene...

00:18:55.766 --> 00:19:00.008
(street chatter)

00:19:02.246 --> 00:19:03.816
(DRUNKS laughter/good time)
(WIENE gasp)

00:19:03.916 --> 00:19:06.355
[WIENE, internal] Bell...
Where are you...?

00:19:06.455 --> 00:19:07.724
(snapping)

00:19:07.824 --> 00:19:08.959
(WIENE gasp)

00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:17.944
(WIENE gasp)

00:19:18.044 --> 00:19:20.115
(GIRL notice, gasp)

00:19:20.716 --> 00:19:22.119
(GIRL brace)

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.302
(CROWD murmuring and
gasping/questioning)

00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:34.243
(GIRL scared) (notice) (scream)

00:19:37.984 --> 00:19:40.556
[WIENE] Are you... are you okay?
(panting)

00:19:40.656 --> 00:19:42.660
(GIRL shock) (scared)

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.198
(CROWD fear and
panic and disgust)
[TOWNSMAN A] I-it's a demon!

00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:50.643
[ADVENTURER A] A harpy!
No... is that a siren?!

00:19:50.743 --> 00:19:53.047
[ADVENTURER B] How did a monster
get all the way out here?!

00:19:53.147 --> 00:19:54.985
[TOWNSMAN B] Don't touch it!
[TOWNSMAN C] Stay back!

00:19:55.085 --> 00:19:56.153
[TOWNSWOMAN A] What a
vile little thing!

00:19:56.254 --> 00:19:57.189
[TOWNSWOMAN B] Why's it in
town?!

00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:59.961
(WIENE gasp) (gasp)

00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:01.665
[TOWNSWOMAN C] Go to
Hell... monster!

00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:03.435
(WIENE notice) (wince)

00:20:08.177 --> 00:20:10.449
(WIENE shock) (pain)

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.252
(CROWD angry mob yelling)
[CITIZEN A] Freak!

00:20:12.353 --> 00:20:13.756
[CITIZEN B] Go! Leave our city!

00:20:13.856 --> 00:20:16.662
[CITIZEN C] Go back to the
Dungeon where you belong!

00:20:16.762 --> 00:20:17.931
(WIENE pain)

00:20:18.031 --> 00:20:18.966
[WIENE] That hurts...

00:20:19.066 --> 00:20:20.168
[TOWNSMAN D] It's disgusting!

00:20:20.268 --> 00:20:22.205
[TOWNSMAN E] Beat it!
Get outta here!

00:20:23.074 --> 00:20:24.978
[WIENE] Save me...

00:20:25.078 --> 00:20:27.115
[WIENE] Save me, Bell...!

00:20:27.215 --> 00:20:27.884
(BELL grunt)

00:20:27.984 --> 00:20:29.688
Move aside!

00:20:29.788 --> 00:20:30.957
[BELL] Get out of the way!

00:20:31.057 --> 00:20:33.696
(BELL struggling)

00:20:33.796 --> 00:20:35.098
[BELL] (gasp) Welf?!

00:20:35.198 --> 00:20:36.602
[WELF] What are you gonna do?!

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:39.808
There'll be
consequences... if
you help her out.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.745
[BELL] But I...

00:20:41.845 --> 00:20:42.780
[BELL] I can't just leave her!

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.849
[WELF] No... Wait!

00:20:43.949 --> 00:20:45.386
(BELL panting)

00:20:45.486 --> 00:20:46.955
[BELL] Wiene!

00:20:47.055 --> 00:20:49.326
[LILI] Head to
the hidden cellar.

00:20:49.861 --> 00:20:50.796
(BELL gasp)

00:20:58.044 --> 00:20:59.179
[CITIZEN D] It went that way!

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.050
[CITIZEN E] The hell is that elf
doing?!

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.121
[CITIZEN F] Quickly,
someone call the Guild!

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.991
[MIKOTO] Master Bell!
(BELL notice)

00:21:05.091 --> 00:21:08.399
[WELF] I assume...
that elf was Lil' Bit.

00:21:08.499 --> 00:21:09.801
[BELL] It was... Let's go.

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:13.375
[HARUHIME] Um...where are
we going Master Bell?

00:21:13.475 --> 00:21:15.111
[BELL] The hidden cellar...

00:21:15.211 --> 00:21:16.748
[BELL] Our first home.

00:21:19.754 --> 00:21:23.662
(WIENE soft crying)

00:21:23.762 --> 00:21:25.399
(BELL notice)
[WIENE] Is it true, Bell?

00:21:25.499 --> 00:21:30.443
[WIENE] Am I... Am I not
allowed... to be with you?

00:21:32.112 --> 00:21:34.617
(BELL gasp) (hesitant)

00:21:34.718 --> 00:21:38.492

(BELL upset)

00:21:49.714 --> 00:21:51.351
[ADVENTURER C] Hey you!
Find 'em yet?!

00:21:51.451 --> 00:21:53.389
[ADVENTURER D]
Nothin' over here!

00:21:54.591 --> 00:21:56.762
[FELS] We were overzealous...

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:01.872
[FELS] In them, I had
a faint ray of hope...

00:22:03.207 --> 00:22:05.211
[FELS] Alas, it is too early.

00:22:05.311 --> 00:22:07.483
[FELS] What say you, Uranus?

00:22:15.331 --> 00:22:21.445
(Ending Song, "Evergreen")

00:23:46.915 --> 00:23:49.253
