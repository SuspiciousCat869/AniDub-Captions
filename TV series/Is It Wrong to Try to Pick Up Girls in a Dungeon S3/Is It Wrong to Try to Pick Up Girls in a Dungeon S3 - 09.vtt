00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:10.053
(CITIZEN D tch!)

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:11.623
[CITIZEN E] Can you believe he
showed his face here?

00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:12.992
[CITIZEN F] Can you
believe this guy?

00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:15.030
[CITIZEN G] I can't believe
this is happening.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.073
(IKELOS sigh)

00:00:20.173 --> 00:00:23.012
[HERMES] The chaos and confusion
seems to be quieting down now

00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:25.685
that Ikelos has been
exiled from Orario.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:29.425
[HERMES] They've pinned it on
the Ikelos Familia and their
smuggling ring...

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:33.233
including the appearances of
monsters on the surface.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.107
I'd say that he played his
role as a scapegoat rather
successfully.

00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:40.882
[URANUS] However... There's yet
to be any sort of conclusion.

00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:47.427
[URANUS] The Xenos are unable to
return to the Dungeon. They're
concealing themselves within the
city as we speak.

00:00:47.527 --> 00:00:52.906
[URANUS] Swarms of adventurers
are scouring every back-street
and alleyway of Daedalus Street.

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.078
Not least among them
is the Loki Familia.

00:00:56.178 --> 00:01:02.190
[URANUS] It is merely a matter
of time before they are all
discovered.

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:05.196
Furthermore... with Ikelos
now out of the picture...

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:09.505
The whole city's taking out
their frustrations on Bell.

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:11.777
The tide has shifted
against him.

00:01:11.877 --> 00:01:14.683
[HERMES] Indeed... Even
kind-hearted children...

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:18.089
can become quite cruel when
faced with adversity.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.495
[MORD] And just who does
he think he is?! Screw
you, Little Rookie!

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:25.537
[MORD] That stupid rabbit made a
fool outta himself all for the
sake of bragging rights...!

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:26.840
(ADVENTURER A chuckling)

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.911
Oh, how the mighty record
holder has fallen!

00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:30.513
It's gotta be the fame.

00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:31.883
It serves him right!

00:01:31.984 --> 00:01:33.988
People used to bend over
backwards for him.

00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:35.423
Those days are long gone.

00:01:35.523 --> 00:01:36.292
(ADVENTURER A laughing)

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:37.461
(BOTH PAIN)

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:39.198
What the hell, Mord?!

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.569
(ADVENTURER B grunting)
[MORD] Quit yer yappin'! Just
drink!

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.541
(MORD drinking)

00:01:44.643 --> 00:01:48.116
(sigh) (growling)

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.299
(Opening Song, "over and over")

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.819
[HESTIA] Mikoto, Haruhime.
Welcome home.

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.723
[HESTIA] How was
your trip into town?

00:03:31.823 --> 00:03:34.696
[HARUHIME] Fairly uneventful...
However...

00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:39.438
[HARUHIME] The way that
everybody looked at us
was um... unpleasant.

00:03:39.538 --> 00:03:42.745
[MIKOTO] As we feared...
Master Bell's actions have had
an impact.

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:46.218
And of course public
opinion is growing more
and more hostile.

00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:47.855
[MIKOTO] The tension
was palpable.

00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:49.759
[HESTIA] Ooh...

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.028
[HESTIA] Figures...

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.832
(MIKOTO notice)

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.803
Is Master Welf still occupied?

00:03:54.903 --> 00:03:57.407
[HESTIA] Yup... Hunkered
down in his forge.

00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:06.025
[BELL, internal] I made up
my mind to save her.

00:04:07.527 --> 00:04:09.565
[BELL, internal] I don't
regret anything.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.605
[BELL, internal] And I don't
care what anyone says about me.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.642
[BELL, internal] But...

00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:16.011
(BELL somber)

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.949
(door knock)
(BELL notice)

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.485
[BELL] Come in!

00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:20.888
Hey, Bell...

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:21.756
Someone's here.

00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:23.559
A visitor...?

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.365
[HERMES] You're in surprisingly
good spirits for someone

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:29.739
who's become the most hated
man in Orario. Kudos.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.075
[HESTIA] Hermes!

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:32.578
The facts speak for themselves.

00:04:32.678 --> 00:04:36.152
You've picked up on the
general sentiment, I'm sure.

00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:38.322
Did you come here
just to tease us?!

00:04:38.422 --> 00:04:40.193
[HESTIA] If that's all you
wanted, then beat it.

00:04:40.293 --> 00:04:42.932
The Xenos... are
waiting for your help.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.936
(BOTH gasp)

00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:46.238
[HESTIA] What do you mean?

00:04:46.338 --> 00:04:48.677
[HERMES] There's no need
keep up the charade.

00:04:48.777 --> 00:04:52.484
[HERMES] Uranus brought me up to
speed on their existence a while
ago.

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:55.523
[HERMES] Up 'til now, I've been
working behind the scenes.

00:04:55.624 --> 00:04:56.960
(BOTH hesitation)

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.396
[BELL] Do you know
where they might be?

00:04:58.496 --> 00:05:01.001
[HERMES] Asfi's out with a small
team looking...

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:03.005
but we've yet to find anything.

00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:06.479
[HERMES] I suspect that they
split up and took shelter in
different locations.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.322
[HERMES] Regardless, there's a
good chance that they haven't
left the sewers beneath Daedalus
Street.

00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:15.263
[HESTIA] The place is probably
crawling with Loki's children by
now...

00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:18.704
[HERMES] Yep. Lady Freya's
got Babel under close
surveillance...

00:05:18.804 --> 00:05:22.678
and the Ganesha Familia's got
the entrance to the Dungeon
locked down tight.

00:05:22.778 --> 00:05:29.124
If monsters were to hide in the
city... Daedalus Street seems
like the most logical choice.

00:05:29.224 --> 00:05:31.161
Ais' party is
patrolling that area.

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:33.466
[BELL] Wait, Miss Ais?

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:34.334
(BELL somber)

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:36.973
Hermes... It's a long shot...

00:05:37.073 --> 00:05:39.579
but what if we explain
the situation to Loki?

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:42.217
(BELL gasp)
[HESTIA] I wouldn't
call it a truce...

00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:44.421
[HESTIA] But if we could
just convince her to look
the other way

00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:46.726
while the Xenos return
to the Dungeon...

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:48.496
[HERMES] Unlikely.
(BOTH surprised)

00:05:48.597 --> 00:05:50.868
[HERMES] Even if Loki were
privy to the details...

00:05:50.968 --> 00:05:54.408
her children would never
condone an act of sympathy
towards monsters.

00:05:54.508 --> 00:06:00.086
[HERMES] Don't forget Finn
Deimne... He's desperate to
reclaim his people's former
glory.

00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:02.925
And He wouldn't do anything
to jeopardize that goal.

00:06:03.025 --> 00:06:04.461
(BELL discouraged)

00:06:04.561 --> 00:06:07.300
Possessing intelligence
alone doesn't matter...

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.941
To Loki's children, a
monster is just a monster.

00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:14.114
And exterminating
them is all they know.

00:06:18.824 --> 00:06:25.336
(TOWNSPEOPLE grunts and
groans/rebuilding town)

00:06:25.436 --> 00:06:26.505
(angry)

00:06:26.606 --> 00:06:29.278
[HESTIA] You sure are
strange sometimes, Bell.

00:06:29.378 --> 00:06:32.718
I have no idea why you're
so eager to visit Daedalus
Street...

00:06:32.818 --> 00:06:34.154
[BELL] I'm sorry...

00:06:34.254 --> 00:06:35.991
But when I heard what
Master Hermes said,

00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:38.730
I couldn't sit around
at home any longer.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.233
[CITIZEN A] (notice) Hey, kid!

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.568
Aren't you the Little Rookie?!

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.537
(BELL notice)

00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:44.408
How dare you show
your face here?!

00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:46.378
Y'give adventurers
a bad name!

00:06:46.478 --> 00:06:48.316
Don't try to pretend
this isn't your fault!

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:50.286
You gonna say
something or what!?

00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:53.059
(TOWNSPEOPLE various insults
and griping)

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:54.328
You've really got some
nerve, kid... Honestly!

00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:56.031
Alright! That's enough
out of all of you!

00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:57.100
(CITIZENS shock)

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.469
Bell's questionable behavior

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.075
you witnessed was a result
of my financial debts.

00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:05.049
[HESTIA] In fact, you might call
it the aftermath of his undying
love for me!

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:08.857
[HESTIA] If you're gonna
blame someone, you oughtta
be blaming me!

00:07:08.957 --> 00:07:09.892
[HESTIA] Let's go, Bell.

00:07:09.993 --> 00:07:11.428
[BELL] Oh! Alright...

00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:14.669
I'm so sorry, Goddess...
Because of me, we're all...

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:16.038
[HESTIA] Don't sweat it!

00:07:16.138 --> 00:07:17.173
You haven't needed a whole lot

00:07:17.274 --> 00:07:19.177
of hands-on Hestia
guidance recently.

00:07:19.278 --> 00:07:21.181
So it makes me kind of happy...

00:07:21.282 --> 00:07:24.121
I get to do my job as

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:27.093

[BELL] Still, all this attention

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:31.936
might make it difficult
to search for Wiene...

00:07:32.037 --> 00:07:35.678
[HESTIA] Good point. We wouldn't
wanna do anything reckless.

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:38.617
[BELL] Huh?

00:07:41.188 --> 00:07:45.196
[HESTIA] (hesitation)
Hmm? Hmmm?!

[LOKI] Heya, kiddo! So...

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:17.895
I heard about your

[BELL] Uh-huh!
[LOKI] I dunno what your plan
was...

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:23.707

getcha kicked to the curb.

00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:26.713
(BELL gasping)
[LOKI] So tell me lil'

[HESTIA] Wha-?!

[HESTIA] What the hell are you

[LOKI] Oh come on...

00:08:35.263 --> 00:08:36.800
Where's the harm? Not like
I get to jab him often!

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.204
[HESTIA] (struggling) Yeah,
well, nobody asked you!

00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:41.743

[HESTIA] Cut it out already?!

00:08:41.843 --> 00:08:44.514
[HESTIA] Run away while

[LOKI] Hold on a sec,

00:08:44.615 --> 00:08:46.820
[HESTIA] None of that concerns

00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:13.774
[BELL] Miss Syr...

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:14.942
Thank goodness!

00:09:15.042 --> 00:09:16.412
I haven't seen you
around lately...

00:09:16.512 --> 00:09:18.817
I was starting to get worried!

00:09:18.917 --> 00:09:20.353
[BELL] I'm sorry...

00:09:20.453 --> 00:09:21.589
(SYR concerned)

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:24.294
I know! Care to join
me for a short walk?

00:09:24.394 --> 00:09:26.298
(surprise) Well...

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:30.974
Everybody in the city is pretty
upset with me at the moment...
You sure you want to?

00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:32.978
Yes! Of course.

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:34.816
(BELL amazed)

00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:38.389
[SYR] So then Mama Mia takes a
bite of my homemade lunch and

00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:41.428
you know what she said? "Quit
wasting all our veggies!"

00:09:41.528 --> 00:09:43.667
[SYR] Can you believe that?

00:09:43.767 --> 00:09:46.573
So, you aren't ... going
to ask me about anything?

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:49.712
Well... Do you have something
you'd like to share?

00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:52.550
[SYR] What's bothering you?

00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:56.926
(BELL surprised) (hesitate)

00:09:58.362 --> 00:10:02.070
Bottling up your emotions
isn't very healthy, you know.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.506
You have friends, Mr. Bell.

00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:06.579
And also a Familia
who supports you.

00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:10.988
It scares me...

00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:12.323
(SYR shock)

00:10:12.423 --> 00:10:13.325
[BELL] I'm afraid that

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:14.528
they're going to leave me...

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:17.400
I never bothered to
ask how they felt.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.804
I acted all on my own...

00:10:18.904 --> 00:10:22.443
and dragged my friends along.
Put them in danger.

00:10:23.212 --> 00:10:26.084
And... And I didn't...!

00:10:26.185 --> 00:10:27.120
[SYR] That's my cue.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.255
(BELL choked up)
(confused)

00:10:28.355 --> 00:10:29.457
[BELL] Wait?! What?

00:10:29.558 --> 00:10:31.663
Don't worry... Just relax.

00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:34.735
Don't be afraid...
or discouraged.

00:10:34.836 --> 00:10:37.875
You may have lost a few
things along the way...

00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:42.116
[SYR] ...but what matters
most... will always be by
your side, Mr. Bell.

00:10:42.217 --> 00:10:43.587
(BELL surprised)

00:10:44.287 --> 00:10:45.958
Personally...

00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:50.566
I care about the boy who
never gives up far too
much to leave him.

00:10:54.274 --> 00:10:57.715
(forge hammering)

00:10:57.815 --> 00:11:00.453
[LILI] At least take
a break for dinner!

00:11:00.553 --> 00:11:01.823
Also keep it down

00:11:01.923 --> 00:11:04.595
so we don't disturb the
neighbors, either okay.

00:11:05.563 --> 00:11:09.605
(LILI sigh) (annoyed) (kick)

00:11:11.141 --> 00:11:12.578
(LILI notice)

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:20.560
[HERMES] The Loki Familia's
full-scale manhunt
across Daedalus Street is now
underway, Uranus

00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:23.532
With few options left, we
have little time to waste...

00:11:23.633 --> 00:11:27.540
The Xenos could be moving...
any moment now.

00:11:27.641 --> 00:11:29.277
Then we know where
they've turned.

00:11:29.377 --> 00:11:30.513
To get help.

00:11:30.614 --> 00:11:32.785
That's correct...
Bell and his Familia.

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:34.221
[URANUS] However...

00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:36.258
Knossos leads to the Dungeon,

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:39.599
and the Loki Familia
is restricting access.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.468
Even with reinforcements...

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:44.441
a frontal assault would ensure
their destruction.

00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:47.715
[HERMES] Perhaps... but
all is not yet lost.

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:53.359
The blueprints for Knossos...
Daedalus' notebook.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:55.429
(URANUS surprised) (realize)

00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:57.267
Ikelos passed it along to me...

00:11:57.367 --> 00:12:02.010
After checking out its
contents... I can vouch
its accuracy.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.412
[HERMES] Uranus, allow me

00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:05.817
to put this whole
fiasco to rest.

00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:09.391
[HERMES] I would expect proper
compensation, of course...

00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:11.863
[HERMES] Well? Might be handy!

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:13.800
(URANUS thinking)

00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:20.914
[AISHA] Intelligent monsters
called "Xenos" and a labyrinth
called "Knossos"?

00:12:21.014 --> 00:12:23.052
[ASFI] We don't have
enough manpower...

00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:26.793
so I would appreciate your
cooperation... to smooth
things over.

00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:30.132
[ASFI] Ryu, if we can count on
you to lend us a hand,

00:12:30.232 --> 00:12:34.842
we promise to provide you
with information on the
last few remnants of Evilus.

00:12:34.942 --> 00:12:36.244
(RYU react)

00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:37.648
[AISHA] I dunno...

00:12:37.748 --> 00:12:39.619
[AISHA] Yeah, they might talk
and think like us...

00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:44.895
but I have a hard time getting
behind the idea of helpin' out
a bunch of monsters.

00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:47.100
[AISHA] I mean, they're not
exactly the most sympathetic

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.204
creatures in the
world, are they?

00:12:49.304 --> 00:12:53.012
Our has client requested...
that the Xenos be rescued.

00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:57.888
Since you've joined the Hermes
Familia... it's important
you learn to follow orders.

00:12:57.988 --> 00:13:00.426
Well, I'm not exactly
a pushover y'know.

00:13:00.526 --> 00:13:04.735
If somethin' doesn't sit right
with me, I won't hesitate to
make a huge stink about it.

00:13:04.835 --> 00:13:07.240
(sigh) Well just so you know...

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:12.450
Bell Cranel has chosen to show
compassion... towards these
"creatures," as you called them.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.787
Excuse me?!

00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:15.891
[HEPHAISTOS] To be
completely honest...

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:19.497
I'm of two minds about whether
or not we should help the Xenos.

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:21.068
[HEPHAISTOS] I mean,
let's face it...

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:24.541
[HEPHAISTOS] Their presence
on the surface is disastrous.

00:13:24.642 --> 00:13:27.948
They're even wreaking havoc
on the city as we speak.

00:13:28.048 --> 00:13:29.685
Be that as it may...

00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:32.891
Takemikazuchi and I find
ourselves on the fence as well.

00:13:32.992 --> 00:13:38.469
I have yet to disclose... the
true nature of the Xenos to
my own children...

00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:40.206
I'm genuinely baffled...

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:42.410
Is it worth the
effort to save them?

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.282
(TAKEMIKAZUCHI frustrated)

00:13:45.383 --> 00:13:49.391
Look I can't speak to the
advantages... or disadvantages.

00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:52.296
However... this
can't go on forever.

00:13:52.397 --> 00:13:53.733
(MIACH agree)

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.839
In which case, we ought
to make our final decision.

00:13:58.308 --> 00:14:00.881
[HESTIA] Are you able to
decipher it, Miss Supporter?!

00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:04.989
[LILI] Uh-huh... As I suspected,
it's a letter from Master Fels.

00:14:05.089 --> 00:14:08.062
[LILI] He wrote this using a
complex code... (reaction)...

00:14:08.162 --> 00:14:12.705
perhaps to prevent other
adventurers from reading it...

00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:14.709
[WELF] "Tomorrow night, we shall
make our way to the entrance

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:17.614
of Knossos hidden along
Daedalus Street."

00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:21.021
[WELF] "We kindly request
your assistance,"... eh?

00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:22.290
(BELL somber)

00:14:23.593 --> 00:14:25.329
[HESTIA] "I have assembled
several key magic items

00:14:25.429 --> 00:14:29.070
in preparation for our
mission."... Sounds
great, but...

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:34.114
I dunno... It feels an
awful lot like being
lured by a siren's voice.

00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:39.057
[HESTIA] Let's settle
this once and for all.

00:14:39.157 --> 00:14:41.796
[HESTIA] It's time to choose
which path we wanna take:

00:14:41.896 --> 00:14:46.739
[HESTIA] Option one: Rescue the
Xenos... and live the rest of
our lives as social outcasts.

00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:51.682
[HESTIA] Option two: abandon
them, wait for this to blow
over, and go back to our normal
lives?

00:14:51.783 --> 00:14:54.588
[HESTIA] Those are
our only choices.

00:14:57.895 --> 00:14:59.632
[BELL] My mind... is made up.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.034
(BOTH notice)

00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:06.813
[BELL] Look... The Xenos...
Wiene.. And Mr. Lido...

00:15:06.913 --> 00:15:10.052
[BELL] They need help and
I wanna save them!

00:15:10.152 --> 00:15:13.158
[BELL] But... there's
also you guys...

00:15:15.162 --> 00:15:19.537
[WELF] Lady Hestia... y'mind
if I propose a third option?

00:15:19.638 --> 00:15:22.110
[WELF] Whaddya say we try
getting creative...

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.349
Let's sneak 'em back in the
Dungeon! No one gets pissed...

00:15:25.449 --> 00:15:27.520
And we'll avoid getting
a bad rap.

00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:28.690
(HESTIA satisfied)

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.226
(BELL confused)

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:31.495
Check it out.

00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:32.931
New magic sword.

00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:35.770
[WELF] Got three more sittin' in
my workshop.

00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:37.373
[MIKOTO] I wouldn't expect
anything less.

00:15:37.473 --> 00:15:40.981
(sigh) Five days of work and
only made four stinkin' swords?

00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:43.820
Can't you squeeze out one more
for a nice round number?

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.057
(HARUHIME small laugh)
[WELF] I forged my ass off!

00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:49.698
[WELF] If we wanna save the
Xenos... and maybe get the jump
on everyone...

00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:51.736
we can't afford to put quantity
over quality!

00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:56.011
Y'see Bell? Everyone's
been behind you since
the very beginning.

00:15:56.111 --> 00:16:00.452
There is no doubt in my mind!
Master Bell... I shall follow
your lead.

00:16:00.553 --> 00:16:02.523
You have already saved
my life once, Bell

00:16:02.624 --> 00:16:06.231
I'm sure you remember. There's
no way I could lose everything.

00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:09.037
Honestly... I wouldn't
turn my back on you...

00:16:09.137 --> 00:16:11.809
And I don't want you doing
the same to somebody else.

00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:13.980
I'm used to being
an outcast, anyway!

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.888
[WELF] Hear that, Bell? No
leavin' us behind this time.

00:16:19.224 --> 00:16:20.660
[BELL] You guys...

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.563
[SYR] ...but what
matters most...

00:16:22.664 --> 00:16:25.002
will always be by
your side, Mr. Bell.

00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:29.678
[BELL] Thank you... All of you!

00:16:29.778 --> 00:16:31.147
[HESTIA] That's that, then.

00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:34.722
Now let's get out there...
and save the Xenos together!

00:16:35.489 --> 00:16:37.961
(ALL happy)

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.667
Let's go save Wiene!

00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:22.985
[FELS] A few moments ago,
I received a response from
Bell Cranel.

00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:25.857
[FELS] He and his Familia have
offered their full cooperation.

00:17:25.957 --> 00:17:30.165
[FELS] Tonight, upon emerging
from the sewers and forcing our
way through Daedalus Street...

00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:33.071
[FELS] ...we shall flee
into the Dungeon via Knossos.

00:17:33.171 --> 00:17:36.077
[FELS] Now, the Loki Familia
might anticipate us, however...

00:17:36.177 --> 00:17:41.121
[FELS] ...given that Uranus
cannot take any kind of overt
action, there's no alternative.

00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:43.358
[REI] But will we be safe
once we reach the door?

00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:46.031
[REI] I'm worried of adventurers
that may pursue us...

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:49.137
[FELS] Currently, we are the
only ones in possession of a
key.

00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:52.443
[FELS] After we pass through
that door, we should be out
of harm's way.

00:17:52.543 --> 00:17:55.650
[GLOS] What about Fia,
Rhett, and the others
who got separated?

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.459
[FELS] Our only option is to
send a signal from our position
once the mission begins.

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:03.332
[FELS] Arousing suspicions
is a risk we'll have to take.

00:18:03.432 --> 00:18:06.104
[WIENE] Does that mean
Bell's coming with us?!

00:18:06.204 --> 00:18:08.075
[FELS] No...

00:18:08.175 --> 00:18:10.512
[FELS] Bell Cranel is
going to act as a decoy.

00:18:10.614 --> 00:18:15.255
(XENOS shock)
[REI] That's awful... You would
manipulate Mr. Bell yet again?

00:18:15.356 --> 00:18:17.460
[GLOS] Boney bastard!
[LIDO] Low-life!

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.730
[WIENE] I hate you, Fels!

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.999
[FELS] Wait, hear me out!

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.638
And don't bring my
skeleton into this!

00:18:22.738 --> 00:18:24.507
(XENOS frustrated)

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:26.779
[FELS] Due to recent events,

00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:28.515
Bell Cranel is far
too conspicuous.

00:18:28.616 --> 00:18:32.490
Drawing attention to himself
would be the most efficient
approach.

00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:34.160
[GLOS] Like a diversion
of sorts...

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.298
[LIDO] Yeah, but... I don't
feel good about putting

00:18:36.398 --> 00:18:38.936
this type of burden on Bell
and his friends again.

00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:40.539
[FELS] Please try
to understand...

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.147
[FELS] They are the only ones
we can rely on right now.

00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:45.215
(LIDO somber)

00:18:45.316 --> 00:18:47.921
[LIDO] It makes sense
in my head, but...

00:18:48.021 --> 00:18:51.729
[WIENE] Lido... Haruhime told
me... an old fable.

00:18:51.829 --> 00:18:55.336
[WIENE] The surface-dwellers
have a story, "The Spirit Who
Returned the Favor."

00:18:55.436 --> 00:18:57.373
[LIDO] "...Returned the Favor"?
(WIENE nod)

00:18:57.473 --> 00:18:59.310
[WIENE] It's when you say
thanks to someone...

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.684
by doing something very super
nice for them in return.

00:19:02.784 --> 00:19:08.228
Sounds fun, right? I think
we should do something...
really special... for
Bell in the future!

00:19:08.328 --> 00:19:11.468
[LIDO] (shock) There's somethin'
different about you...

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:13.906
[LIDO] I can't quite put
my claw on it though...

00:19:14.007 --> 00:19:15.376
[WIENE] You think so?

00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:17.781
[LIDO] Alright!
When all's said and done,

00:19:17.881 --> 00:19:20.653
we shall repay Bell's
kindness ten-fold!

00:19:20.754 --> 00:19:22.156
(WIENE agree)

00:19:22.256 --> 00:19:23.558
[FELS] Now then, let us open

00:19:23.659 --> 00:19:27.033
a direct line of communication
with their Familia.

00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:31.842
[FELS] Can you hear me,
Bell Cranel?

00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:34.247
[BELL] Loud and clear, Mr. Fels!

00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:37.486
[WIENE] It's Bell!
Bell, Bell, Bell!
[BELL] Wiene!

00:19:37.587 --> 00:19:39.524
[WIENE] How are you, Bell?!
[REI] It's wonderful to hear
your voice.

00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:41.461
[WIENE] I can't wait
to see you again!
[LIDO] Bellcchi, it's me! Lido!

00:19:41.561 --> 00:19:44.100
[WIENE] Bell! Bell, Bell!
[GLOS] Quiet down!
They'll find us!

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.772
[HESTIA] There are six known
entrances to Knossos...

00:19:46.872 --> 00:19:48.843
They're Hidden beneath
Daedalus Street...

00:19:48.943 --> 00:19:50.546
The Northeast, The Northwest...

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:54.320
Then the west... Southwest...
Southeast... And lastly to the
east.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.558
[HESTIA] However... according
to our intelligence,

00:19:56.659 --> 00:20:01.501
the Loki Familia only has
four organized defense units
at most... Which means...

00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:05.710
[WELF] ...they've only found
some of the doors... Meaning two
are unattended.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:06.779
(HESTIA nod)

00:20:06.879 --> 00:20:08.048
[MIKOTO] Understood...

00:20:08.148 --> 00:20:09.517
We'll find one of these
unguarded doors...

00:20:09.618 --> 00:20:12.323
and penetrate the Loki Familia's
defensive line.

00:20:12.423 --> 00:20:13.760
(nod) Although...

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.032
nobody knows which units are
stationed outside of which
doors...

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.638
Even Uranus hasn't
cracked that yet.

00:20:19.738 --> 00:20:23.412
[FELS] Unfortunately, there's
no time to investigate the
matter beforehand.

00:20:23.512 --> 00:20:28.990
[FELS] We must accept the risks
and locate an accessible door
while we push forward with the
mission.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.060
(sigh) So then basically...

00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:35.102
we're bound to have a run-in
with the Loki Familia at some
point, aren't we?

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:40.012
[FELS] Be that as it may, I
would prefer to minimize the
number involved in the battle.

00:20:40.112 --> 00:20:43.251
[FELS] And that, Bell Cranel,
is where you come in.

00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:44.420
(BELL nod)

00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:48.128
[FINN] Bell Cranel is
a diversionary tactic.

00:20:48.228 --> 00:20:50.432
[FINN] In other words,
they'll use him as a decoy.

00:20:50.532 --> 00:20:52.604
[FINN] Hard to say if he's
acting on free will..

00:20:52.704 --> 00:20:57.714
But he's in the position to be
exploited by those monsters and
their ringleader.

00:20:57.814 --> 00:20:59.183
[FINN] Based on their
actions so far,

00:20:59.283 --> 00:21:01.221
I'm almost certain of it.

00:21:01.321 --> 00:21:03.391
[FINN] While we're preoccupied
with the boy,

00:21:03.492 --> 00:21:07.299
our enemies will try to make a
break for the nearest entrance
to the labyrinth.

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:11.141
[FINN] We ought to focus our
attention... on everything but
Bell Cranel.

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:14.648
[FINN] We must protect the
doors... no matter the cost.

00:21:14.748 --> 00:21:19.625
[FINN] Furthermore... we must
use extreme caution... when
engaging that black minotaur.

00:21:19.725 --> 00:21:23.098
[FINN] If it shows up,
prioritize its death
over the rest.

00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:26.639
The enemy will attack soon...
Don't let them pass.

00:21:26.739 --> 00:21:28.375
Stop their rampage!

00:21:30.445 --> 00:21:32.884
[HERMES] Mr. Former Sage might
have old-man wisdom...

00:21:32.984 --> 00:21:36.592
but if he plays this by the
book, he'll never outsmart
Braver.

00:21:36.692 --> 00:21:40.132
[HERMES] That guy's far too
clever for that.

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.102
[HERMES] Although, Finn Deimne
probably won't account

00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:44.808
for the slew of magic
items they possess...

00:21:44.908 --> 00:21:48.215
Makes for a good means
of escape, at least.

00:21:48.315 --> 00:21:51.054
[HERMES] But the most
important thing is him...

00:21:52.757 --> 00:21:54.293
[HERMES] Bell Cranel.

00:22:08.455 --> 00:22:12.429
[BELL] I'm going to
save them. All of them.

00:22:15.202 --> 00:22:21.314
(Ending Song, "Evergreen")

00:23:46.551 --> 00:23:49.390
[HESTIA] Next time: "Invisible."
