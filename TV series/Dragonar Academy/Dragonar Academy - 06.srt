1
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:44,041
The princess is in high
dudgeon over your lack of ability.

2
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,958
She commands you
to visit St. Valeria tomorrow,

3
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:50,666
where you shall
offer prayers of repentance.

4
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:56,500
Intel indicates that this individual
may have infiltrated Ansullivan.

5
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,875
The former mountain guerilla terrorist:

6
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,833
Avdocha, She Who Condemns.

7
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:11,500
St. Valeria once said,
"Love the sinner, hate the sin."

8
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,291
Death to all sinners!

9
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,666
I am Avdocha, She Who Condemns!

10
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:24,291
<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

11
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:29,250
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

12
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:33,583
<i>The "something" you and I have</i>

13
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,750
<i>Starts with a tiny thrum</i>

14
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,708
<i>Now teach me about</i>
<i>the sky one more time</i>

15
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:44,458
"Dragonar Academy"

16
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:49,250
<i>The weight of flapping</i>
<i>wings that only a bird knows</i>

17
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:54,250
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

18
00:01:54,333 --> 00:02:02,500
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

19
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,916
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,375
<i>But if your tears can be fewer</i>

21
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,875
<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

22
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,416
<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

23
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,875
<i>I'll embody any kind of hero for you</i>

24
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:19,291
<i>I'll never, never,</i>
<i>never, never let go</i>

25
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:24,333
<i>Even if I die,</i>
<i>I'll be your knight alone</i>

26
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:28,666
<i>But you cried for</i>
<i>real and got angry:</i>

27
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,916
<i>Saying "Don't be so cold to me"</i>

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,625
<i>I wipe your tears</i>

29
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,125
<i>Even without a sacred blade</i>

30
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,166
<i>I don't care if I'm not a hero</i>

31
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:47,416
<i>If I can protect you with all I have</i>

32
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,916
"Blue Brionac"

33
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,125
What's with that smoke?

34
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,875
It's coming from St. Valeria!

35
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,666
No!

36
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,333
Princess, let us return to the <i>Sylvanus</i> .

37
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,208
Mmm.

38
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,791
Wait! Didn't you see that?

39
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,500
The princess might be in there!

40
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,250
Never fear.

41
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:20,708
We'll make the <i>Magiship</i>
<i>Sylvanus</i> our strategic HQ.

42
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,291
Transmission from
St. Valeria Church incoming.

43
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,958
Go ahead.

44
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,625
Long time no see,

45
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,583
Veronica Lautreamont.

46
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,000
I should have known you
were behind this,

47
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,458
Avdocha, She Who Condemns.

48
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,208
Huh? Could it be...

49
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,791
It's someone else entirely!

50
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,666
Why take over the church?

51
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,708
Are you after my head--again?

52
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,416
That's not all.

53
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,083
Look at this.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,500
Jessica!

55
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,500
Is that...

56
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,583
An Imperial-made mechanical bomb.

57
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:20,166
If it goes off, this church'll be
blown to smithereens.

58
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,500
What's more,

59
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,333
I'm not what you'd
call a patient person.

60
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,375
Every time the church bell tolls,

61
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,708
I'm killing another hostage.

62
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,000
What?!

63
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,041
There's less than
an hour until the next bell.

64
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:39,083
I look forward to having your head.

65
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,166
Your Highness?

66
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,166
I refuse to give in to terrorists.

67
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,625
If it comes to it,
the <i>Sylvanus</i> 's guns can blow away

68
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,666
the whole church and everyone in it.

69
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,708
You wouldn't!

70
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,583
Don't get worked up, boy.

71
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,083
Stay vigilant!

72
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,541
Who knows what that woman will do?

73
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,916
Yes'm!

74
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,666
Jessica...

75
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,875
Wait.

76
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,833
Who knows what she'll
do to you if she finds out

77
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,583
you're Princess Veronica's sister.

78
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:27,958
But if I reveal who I am and
demand the hostages be released--

79
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:32,916
I know you want to help,
but not by sacrificing yourself.

80
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,291
Now hear this!

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,208
I am Jessica Valentine!

82
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:45,250
Despite all appearances,
I am well-known Lautreamont nobility!

83
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,916
Out of respect to my name,

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,208
swear you'll not lay a finger on
the remaining hostages!

85
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,833
Valentine, you say?

86
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,500
Never heard of 'em. But... very well.

87
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,958
And then...

88
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,625
...even as her clothes were torn from her,

89
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,458
even as they strung her up,

90
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:07,666
she never said a word...
and shed not a single tear.

91
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,250
Jessica...

92
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:13,875
You're a far higher-minded woman
than any noble in these parts.

93
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:17,333
And in return, I...

94
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,958
That's Avdocha, She Who Condemns.

95
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:29,791
If I tell her I'm a fellow Tantalos...

96
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,750
No, I'd better not.

97
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,208
I'll just let this play out for a while.

98
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,500
I just came looking for my friend.

99
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,791
What have I gotten myself into?

100
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,041
A firefight? Are you serious?

101
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,833
Calm down, Ash Blake!

102
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,458
Princess Veronica, I have an idea.

103
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes? What is it?

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,541
I see. Interesting.

105
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,416
Avdocha!

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,375
Ash Blake,

107
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,375
we're sending you to
the church as a negotiator.

108
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,375
Whaaat?

109
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,708
Now hang on!

110
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,041
Why are you sending
him somewhere so dangerous?!

111
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,541
They have no idea
that Ash is capable of

112
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,666
Archdragonar-level might.

113
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,916
While he buys us time inside the church,

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,041
we Archdragonars will
use the underground passage

115
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:49,166
and break through the
church's foundation from below.

116
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,875
Oh, I get it!

117
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,208
What do you think, Ash?

118
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,500
Sounds like a plan.

119
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,416
Good. Now for a strategy meeting.

120
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,000
Hey, Eco...

121
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,208
What?

122
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:06,416
I have a favor to ask.
About the next Arch you make for me...

123
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,625
Huh? But I can't--

124
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,125
Sure, you can.

125
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,625
I <i>know</i> you can.

126
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,416
I'm counting on you.

127
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,708
This means triple the crepes.

128
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,541
Sure. But hold the anthar.

129
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,083
Halt!

130
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,333
I'm Ash Blake, sent here to negotiate.

131
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,458
I seek entry!

132
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,666
Ash!

133
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,125
They sent a brat like you to negotiate?

134
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,708
They must not think much of me.

135
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,208
The <i>Sylvanus</i> has its largest
gun aimed right at this church.

136
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,833
The princess will not yield to terrorists.

137
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,625
Silence!

138
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,000
You're not much of a negotiator, are you,

139
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,125
terrifying the hostages like that?

140
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:18,541
Enough pointless resistance.
You don't want to die for nothing.

141
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,500
The truth is...

142
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:26,666
I'm here looking for my long-lost sister.

143
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,541
I understand Veronica
has three sisters of her own.

144
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:37,333
She should know the sorrow
of being torn from her beloved siblings.

145
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,541
This isn't working.
There's no negotiating with her.

146
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,541
Eco, please! Hurry!

147
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,166
I'm working on it!

148
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,541
I'm working on it...
but it's not easy!

149
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,375
Just slap together
an original Arch already.

150
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,916
L-Like I'd bother for the likes of him!

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,166
He can ride any
dragon--very mysterious.

152
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,250
He should be riding you, too,
in your true form.

153
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,708
My true form?

154
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,250
While this human
form is indeed your reality,

155
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:19,875
you <i>are</i> of the dragon race,
and Ash Blake's parr.

156
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,291
It's high time you realized that.

157
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,666
Ugh! Be quiet! I can't work!

158
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,041
One day you'll see.

159
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,708
I have my hands full with this.

160
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:36,625
He asked me for an Arch
that can stop a mechanical bomb.

161
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,250
Ash Blake.

162
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,041
That's his name--I remember now.

163
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,333
Wh-What? You want to nurse?!

164
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,625
But there's nothing in there!

165
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,791
No! No squirming allowed!

166
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,583
What's that racket?

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,458
Very well. This one should
be good and hungry, too.

168
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,083
It's a bit early, but mother and child

169
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,041
shall be the first sacrifice.

170
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,291
No!

171
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,666
It can't be!

172
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,291
Wait!

173
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,500
What?! Are you crazy?

174
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,916
"Dragonar Academy"

175
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,916
"Dragonar Academy"

176
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,958
Who's this?

177
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,875
I-I am...

178
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,583
I am the fourth princess of the
Lautreamont royal knight family,

179
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,750
Silvia Lautreamont!

180
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:10,333
Oh. Fourth princess, was it?

181
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,875
Out of respect to my name,

182
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,333
release these two at once!

183
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,458
What is she doing?

184
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,125
That fool.

185
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:33,041
So you must be Veronica's sister.

186
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,541
No! Don't touch her!

187
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,833
Silence!

188
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,458
If you're volunteering your name like that,

189
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,250
you must be ready for what comes next.

190
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,041
I-I am a princess! I can't just stand by

191
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,958
and watch my people be slaughtered!

192
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,583
I... I wish to die a knight's death.

193
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,125
That's the spirit!

194
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,916
Princess!

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,625
There's your true form.

196
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:22,166
By simply revealing your nudity,
you go back to being a woman.

197
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,375
Gone is the prestige
of your knightly name...

198
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,416
...along with any worth in killing you.

199
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,500
You disappoint me.

200
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,916
"One must do one's utmost,
no matter the contest."

201
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,166
So goes my family motto.

202
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,791
That's all.

203
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,458
Standing around
chit-chatting there, of all places?

204
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,166
Don't you realize how annoying that is?

205
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,583
Did you <i>hear</i> her?

206
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,000
She's getting carried
away just because she's royalty.

207
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,416
Like brother, like sister.

208
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,541
Sorry, Your Highness. It was my fa--

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,791
All this horsing around on
dragons is out of the question!

210
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,166
Now calm down!

211
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,083
Behave yours--

212
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,791
Such ineptitude you've put on display.

213
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,000
And you count yourself part
of the House of Lautreamont?

214
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,208
That's you in a nutshell:

215
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,333
You act pretentious, but really,
you're nothing but a little girl.

216
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,500
Never mind
your Dragonar ambition--

217
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:29,125
it's far more appropriate
for you to settle down!

218
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:33,125
I wasn't prepared.

219
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,083
If you don't like it, you'll have
to surpass Princess Veronica.

220
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:42,125
I expect my elder sister to
scold me, sure, but...

221
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:46,250
I'll carry you, and we can look
for the Mother Dragon together!

222
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,958
I made him a promise.

223
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,000
That I'd be a fine, upstanding knight...

224
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,708
I must thank you, Avdocha.

225
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,166
What?

226
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:03,083
You made me realize
how weak I am, how ill-prepared.

227
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:07,958
But the old me is gone.
She died when you cut her down.

228
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,833
And now...

229
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:19,875
...I am reborn as a
new Silvia Lautreamont!

230
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,583
This I declare:

231
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:31,375
I shall be that most
royal knight: a paladin!

232
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,375
Well said, Silvia!

233
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,333
We're under enemy attack!

234
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,625
O ye sure-striking mystic spear...

235
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,750
Its name: Gae Bulg!

236
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,583
O ye lightning-quick mystic brand...

237
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,625
Its name: Caladbolg!

238
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,916
Don't toy with me, brat!

239
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,166
Ash!

240
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,958
Ash!

241
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,416
Sorry 'bout the wait.

242
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,958
Right on time!

243
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,125
Thanks, Eco!

244
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,625
I-I didn't do it for you!

245
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,791
Not so fast!

246
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,333
Stop right there!

247
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,458
Unless you want me
to push this detonator button!

248
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,875
Nice try!

249
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,833
Manifest now...
O ye sacred glacial carbine...

250
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,916
Its name: Brionac!

251
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,750
W-Wait! I--

252
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,541
Oh, my!

253
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,500
Guess those stories
are good for something.

254
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,041
The Heavenly Dragonar...

255
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,833
Sir Ash!

256
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:05,958
Huh?

257
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,000
We meet at last, Sir Silver Knight!

258
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,958
J-J-J-Jessica?!

259
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,625
Now to plant your seed in me...

260
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,541
K-K-Keep 'em on!

261
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:25,541
I decided that our first time
would be on the church altar.

262
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,541
Liar--you just came up with that now!

263
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,666
Off with your clothes, now, Sir Ash!

264
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,166
Are you even listening?

265
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,958
Cut that out.

266
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,000
Rebecca!

267
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,916
Off with you.

268
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,250
You all right?

269
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,125
Of all the times,
<i>this</i> is when my legs buckle. Pitiful.

270
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,208
Not at all.

271
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,750
You were amazing.

272
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,583
Th-That's preposterous!

273
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,333
C'mon.

274
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,791
Don't be shy.

275
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,416
Why is it?

276
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,625
Why do I feel a rush of nostalgia

277
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,833
when Ash is carrying me like this?

278
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,208
Underpants? 

279
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,666
J-J-J-Jessica?!

280
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,250
I'm here to enter into the
Child-Bearing Covenant, Sir Ash!

281
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,666
H-How did you--

282
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,916
My preparations are complete!

283
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,375
But from the waist down, you're--

284
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,875
How about the rest?

285
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,916
That's not what I meant!

286
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,583
I thought you said our first time
would be on the altar.

287
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:21,458
I'm prepared to cast aside
my beliefs at a moment's notice

288
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,083
for <i>you</i> , Sir Ash!

289
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,875
Let's, uh, let's hang onto
that particular belief, shall we?

290
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,791
It's time, Ash. Plant your seed in me!

291
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,458
W-Wait! Stop!

292
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:37,083
Oh, Sir Ash... you're so hot...
and hard... and <i>big</i> ...

293
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,541
What shall we name our baby, hmm?

294
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,500
I knew it.

295
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,625
When you vanished from
the girls' dorm, I came right over.

296
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,708
What?

297
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,166
Jessica's joining the student council?!

298
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,458
Yes--because she learned
who the Silver Knight really is.

299
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,041
We had her quit
as president of the fan club

300
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,458
and had her join our group instead.

301
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,791
Call it leak prevention.

302
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,291
Let's hurry. Princess Veronica is waiting.

303
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,958
I am Avdocha, She Who Condemns!

304
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,625
Wh-What are you doing here?

305
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,291
It was all my elder sister's scheme.

306
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,791
A scheme?

307
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,375
To correct my unworthy sister.

308
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,625
Wait, so... you knew?

309
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,458
I wasn't at all sure, though.

310
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,208
As you know,

311
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,250
I was once part of
an antigovernment group,

312
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,750
where I failed in my task of
assassinating Veronica five years ago.

313
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,791
After that, I surrendered to her

314
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,041
and began working as her agent.

315
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,541
That's the shape of it.

316
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,625
Talk about eating humble pie...

317
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,250
B-But you look completely
different on your wanted poster.

318
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,125
One of my people made
that based on complete hearsay.

319
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,000
The timing was right, so I let it be.

320
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,583
But why would you
work for Princess Veronica?

321
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,458
To find my long-lost sister.

322
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,875
Her name is Shamara,
and she's turning fifteen this year.

323
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,500
So the part about your sister was true.

324
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:43,833
I can't give up the ghost until I find her.

325
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:47,500
We got to hear
this little tidbit, thanks to you:

326
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:52,541
I shall be that most
royal knight: a paladin!

327
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,875
--I shall be that most royal knight: a paladin!
--S-Stop that!

328
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,250
Ash?

329
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:01,250
Do you know where the
<i>Magiship Sylvanus</i> gets its name?

330
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,500
Where?

331
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,041
Don't the names sound similar?

332
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,375
<i>Sylvanus</i> and Silvia?

333
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,208
Huh!

334
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,500
Veronica! Enough already!

335
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:15,583
That takes some
real sisterly love, doesn't it?

336
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,583
Please, stop laughing and answer me!

337
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:28,875
During that incident, Princess Veronica
mobilized a detached force

338
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:34,791
and rounded up a bunch
of Avdocha-inspired agitators.

339
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:40,208
All that payoff from a single action...

340
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,291
I still have so far to go.

341
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:46,041
I think you'll be fine.

342
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,166
Huh?

343
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,958
Well, see...
