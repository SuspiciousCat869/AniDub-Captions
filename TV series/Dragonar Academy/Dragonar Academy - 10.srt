1
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,791
The Continental Congress.

2
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,291
Held every five years among
the leaders of five nations,

3
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,958
this most critical conference
determines the future

4
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,500
of the entire Arc Strada continent.

5
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:56,708
This time, Lautreamont Knight
Country was chosen to host.

6
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,333
Why would Eco and I be summoned
for such an important event?

7
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,916
And this city we're going to-- this Fon...

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,916
Fontaine?

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,541
Yeah, that. What kind of place is it?

10
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,666
The capital of Lautreamont Knight Country.

11
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,041
Cappy-tall?

12
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,583
It's so big, there's no
comparing it to Ansullivan.

13
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:19,291
So they might have
crepes I haven't tried yet!

14
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,875
Maybe.

15
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,666
There it is!

16
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,125
That's it?

17
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,625
Yes...

18
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,250
...our nation's capital, Fontaine.

19
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,208
In between the
Zepharos Empire to the north

20
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,458
and the Chevron Kingdom to the south,

21
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,458
lies Lautreamont Knight Country.

22
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,541
Known as "the Dragon-Rearing Land,"

23
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:46,083
it boasts the largest dragon
population on the Arc Strada continent.

24
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,583
This small country with
fewer than five million citizens

25
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,583
is home to a unique school:

26
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,833
Ansullivan Dragonar Academy.

27
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,958
It aims to educate
and guide dragon masters

28
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,125
and the so-called Breeders,
young men and women

29
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,375
who have entered
into bonds with dragons.

30
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:10,333
<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

31
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:15,291
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

32
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:19,625
<i>The "something" you and I have</i>

33
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,833
<i>Starts with a tiny thrum</i>

34
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,666
<i>Now teach me about</i>

"Dragonar Academy"

36
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:35,291
<i>The weight of flapping</i>
<i>wings that only a bird knows</i>

37
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:40,291
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

38
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:48,541
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

39
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,958
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

40
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,416
<i>But if your tears can be fewer</i>

41
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,916
<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,458
<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

43
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,916
<i>I'll embody any kind of hero for you</i>

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,375
<i>I'll never, never,</i>
<i>never, never let go</i>

45
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:10,375
<i>Even if I die,</i>
<i>I'll be your knight alone</i>

46
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,708
<i>But you cried for</i>
<i>real and got angry:</i>

47
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,958
<i>Saying "Don't be so cold to me"</i>

48
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,666
<i>I wipe your tears</i>

49
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,166
<i>Even without a sacred blade</i>

50
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,208
<i>I don't care if I'm not a hero</i>

51
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:33,458
<i>If I can protect you</i>

"Assembly in Fontaine"

53
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,375
Welcome home, Princess Silvia.

54
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,625
I know you've just arrived,
but the Paladin awaits.

55
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,583
I'll show my guests around first.

56
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,125
That won't do.

57
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,875
First you must greet the Paladin.

58
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,833
Sorry about this.

59
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,375
If there's anything you need,
just ask Frieda here.

60
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,375
Princess?

61
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,083
Let's just get this over with.

62
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,833
Please follow me.

63
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,083
Security's pretty tight.

64
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,916
The host country must be responsible,

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,291
taking the utmost care to
ensure the visiting leaders' safety

66
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:40,041
and providing them with
hospitality during their stay.

67
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,666
It's only natural.

68
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,166
Yes, of course.

69
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,250
You understand we have
little time to entertain your type.

70
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,791
Huh?

71
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,291
If you need anything further,
please contact the attendant

72
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,708
provided by Her Highness
Princess Veronica.

73
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,958
Princess Veronica?

74
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,416
In here.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,083
I-I-I-I'm so sorry!

76
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,333
Prim?

77
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,416
Why, you...!

78
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,166
Prim!

79
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,666
What is the meaning of this?!

80
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,458
My clothes get really
dirty while I clean, so...

81
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,083
...I clean in my underwear.

82
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,625
Your maid uniform
is permitted to get dirty!

83
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,250
I-I'm sorry!

84
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,250
--I thought I was doing the right thing!
--Hey! Quit staring!

85
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:45,041
Why so many outfits?

86
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:50,750
My clothes get so dirty,
I need a lot of changes on standby.

87
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,333
Ah, I see...

88
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,833
Ugh, so tight... I don't know
how you can wear these things.

89
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,958
Prim, will you take care of those two?

90
00:05:59,041 --> 00:05:59,791
Yes, ma'am!

91
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,458
But first: tidy up!

92
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,458
Yes, ma'am...

93
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,791
Please excuse me.

94
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,666
Tidy up, hmm?

95
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,250
That's your behind.

96
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,375
S-So it is.

97
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:24,500
Sometimes we can get soaked
right down to our underthings...

98
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,041
See? I'm not wearing any, either.

99
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,916
I <i>said</i> , quit staring!

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,083
Oh, Prim...

101
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,791
I-I'm sorry!

102
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,500
Silvia Lautreamont has returned.

103
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,291
How long I've waited for you,

104
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,500
my darling daughter!

105
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:57,375
This old familiar pain...
the bite of your fist...

106
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:02,625
How closely you resemble
your late mother, Elisabeth!

107
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,791
How irritating.

108
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,250
And you sound just like her, too!

109
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,625
You should be ashamed,
getting off on your daughter scolding you!

110
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,208
Now, where were we?

111
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,875
Father, to what do I owe the pleasure

112
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,500
of my invitation to the Congress?

113
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,625
I am but a mere student, still in training.

114
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:29,500
You're the fourth princess and
a Dragonar. You're plenty qualified.

115
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:34,291
I'm not the one who recommended you.
That was Veronica.

116
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,708
My elder sister?

117
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:41,125
She talks tough,
but she recognizes your skill.

118
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:48,250
Then why bring Ash Blake
and Eco here at such a busy time?

119
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,791
It is indeed a busy time for our nation.

120
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:56,208
But as you know, I'm just a figurehead.

121
00:07:56,291 --> 00:08:00,291
The more everyone buzzes
around me, the more free time I have!

122
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:06,375
In other words,
you wanted someone to kill time with.

123
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:10,291
And I've been hearing so
many rumors about those two!

124
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,958
You're such a child.

125
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,291
Thank you so much.

126
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,791
Now, then...

127
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,208
Shall we check it out?

128
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:37,708
Well, if you insist,
I suppose I could go with you.

129
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,125
Let's do it!

130
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,916
Then allow me to lead the way!

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,750
Ugh! Let's hurry up and change
so we can get out of here!

132
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,458
Whoa, whoa!

133
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:51,916
Father, there is one more matter
after which I must inquire.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,750
Why so stuffy?

135
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,250
It's about my brother, Julius.

136
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,958
Was he really executed?

137
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,833
Of course. What are you saying?

138
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,958
He was a dragonslayer who had
killed his own parr by his own hand.

139
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:13,583
Such a crime is unforgiveable--
even for a prince!

140
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,708
Yes, of course...

141
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,666
Princess?

142
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,916
He's a terrible liar.

143
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,500
Wow!

144
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,041
Wow!

145
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,125
<i>Wow</i> !

146
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:51,416
This place really is
nothing at all like Ansullivan!

147
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,333
500 years ago,
King Lionel III of Chevron

148
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:01,083
named Durham the very first Paladin.

149
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:05,833
This statue commemorates that ceremony.

150
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:10,208
After that, Durham became
independent of the Chevron Kingdom

151
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,708
and went on to establish
Lautreamont Knight Country.

152
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,041
Ooh, what's that?

153
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,000
Hey, reel it in, wouldja?

154
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,166
Sorry for running you ragged today, Prim.

155
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:02,458
Not at all... I apologize for
lacking the energy to keep up.

156
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,041
Ash!

157
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,541
Hurry up or I'll pop ya one!

158
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,083
I can't very well come
all the way to the capital

159
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,375
and not eat crepes!

160
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,875
What kind of logic is that?

161
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,916
Got it! I'll have a choco-mint
and a cheese and raspberry!

162
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey... why are those
people so stuck on each other?

163
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,375
Huh?

164
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,791
And why are you staring
at them like you're jealous?

165
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,833
Was I?

166
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,166
Like a starving dog.

167
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,708
Ouch!

168
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,166
So why are they all
over each other like that?

169
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,708
Well, uh...

170
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,125
...probably because they're lovers.

171
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,625
Lovers?

172
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,125
Oh.

173
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:14,333
You... you can hold my hand if you want.

174
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,583
Okay--if you say so.

175
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,666
Hands only! Hands only!
That's as far as I'll allow!

176
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,916
I know, I know!

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But <i>do</i> you? Do you <i>really</i> ?

178
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,250
I do, really!

179
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,041
That...

180
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,166
...that crest...

181
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,250
It's the crest of the
House of Witershausen.

182
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,916
He's attending the Continental
Congress from the Zepharos Empire.

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,666
as a representative of the emperor.

184
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,583
Cosette! Wh-Where'd <i>you</i> come from?!

185
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,041
I'm here to pick you up.

186
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,916
"Dragonar Academy"

187
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,000
"Dragonar Academy"

188
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,291
--Banquet time! Time for meat!

189
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,041
--Guess I'm not used to these clothes.
--Banquet time! Time for meat!

190
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,125
--They just feel so stiff...
--Banquet time! Time for meat, meat, meat!

191
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,833
--Banquet time! Time for meat, meat, meat!

192
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:37,333
Just don't make a scene, okay?
If we offend the head of state...

193
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:41,541
I'll be quiet. I've gotta make
it through the very last dessert!

194
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,166
What is it, Ash?

195
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,666
Uh...

196
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,708
I-It's just... I was just
thinking how beautiful you are.

197
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,916
Now you listen here...

198
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,541
You didn't say a thing about <i>my</i> dress!

199
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,291
Y-You're beautiful, too, Eco!

200
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:24,875
Like a forced compliment
is going to make me happy!

201
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,083
The preparations are complete.

202
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,458
She's going commando!

203
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,125
Hey!

204
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,583
You may enter.

205
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:41,625
Ah, so you're Ash!
What a pleasant face you have!

206
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:46,750
And you must be Eco!
Just look at those horns!

207
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,208
Thank you both for coming all this way.

208
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,208
Please, relax and enjoy yourselves.

209
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,750
Here we were all nervous
about meeting the Paladin...

210
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,541
I like 'im! This dude is super easy to talk to!

211
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,375
Eco!

212
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,833
Let me thank you again for
handling that Necromancia incident

213
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,958
and the Willingham Mausoleum affair.

214
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,208
P-Please, don't bow to me!

215
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:15,125
And so, Ash, from this
day on, you are a Dragonar.

216
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,125
Y-Yessir.

217
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:17,916
Wait...

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,583
<i>What</i> ?!

219
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,416
That's why I called you here.

220
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,958
But, uh...

221
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:30,250
Isn't that title given to Maestro riders,
like the princess?

222
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,916
Eco is a special dragon in
the shape of a human.

223
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,666
It would be odd to measure her
and regular old dragons

224
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,958
by the same yardstick.

225
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,875
Besides,

226
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,208
given the splendid
showing she's made so far,

227
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,916
can you swear she's <i>not</i> a Maestro?

228
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,625
Well...

229
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:51,708
And so I, as Paladin, have decided
that you are a Dragonar as of today.

230
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,833
Frieda, if you would.

231
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,458
Certainly.

232
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:04,000
In the name of Paladin Oswald, Ash Blake

233
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,708
is hereby appointed Dragonar.

234
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,666
I humbly accept.

235
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,875
Ash--a Dragonar?

236
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,125
If he goes on to become an Archdragonar,

237
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,708
he'll have the same standing as nobility.

238
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,625
Which means he can marry royalty...

239
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,208
<i>M-M-M</i> - <i>Marry</i> ?!

240
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,916
Your face is awfully red, Princess.

241
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,708
I-It's nothing!

242
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,875
So, Father,

243
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,875
I heard the emperor of Zepharos
won't be attending this Congress.

244
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,750
He declined, citing his advanced age.

245
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,750
And they have sent
a mere noble in his place?

246
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,875
They had no choice. No one
is immune to the ravages of time.

247
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,958
You're too trusting, Father.

248
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:11,708
First we talk. We must not cause another war.

249
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:15,541
Which is why tomorrow's
masquerade ball is so important.

250
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,208
A masquerade ball?

251
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,916
Attendees cover their faces
with masks and speak freely,

252
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,708
with no thought given to country or delegation!

253
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,833
Say, would you two like to go?

254
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:27,958
Us?

255
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,375
I know I'm going.

256
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,291
What about you, Eco?

257
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,208
If they have meat, I'm there.

258
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,875
Then it's settled!

259
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,125
Make the most of your evening
at tomorrow's masquerade ball!

260
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,916
Y-Yessir...

261
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,666
By the way, Ash...

262
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,791
Yes?

263
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:48,625
There's just one thing I have to ask.

264
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,750
Wh-What might that be?

265
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,416
You're not in an impure
relationship with Silvia, are you?

266
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,333
Pardon?

267
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,500
Father! What are you--

268
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:03,625
Ash... if you ever lay
a finger on my darling Silvia...

269
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,750
I, Oswald, shall punish you myself!

270
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:15,208
Honest! There's nothing
between me and the princess!

271
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,083
C'mon, Your Highness--tell him!

272
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,500
Master Milgauss!

273
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,583
You're looking well, I see!

274
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,041
Not bad.

275
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:55,333
Looks like you didn't
know about Milgauss's arm.

276
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,875
Mahogany--the color of maturity.

277
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:03,000
Perfect for me now,
facing this particular juncture.

278
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:07,125
Are you that Tantalos
girl he's got working for him?

279
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,958
Y-Yes. Anya.

280
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,000
I am Klaus Witershausen.

281
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:18,875
Klaus... Military nobility
from the Zepharos Empire.

282
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,791
This is ten years ago now.

283
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,041
A young man wandered
lost throughout my country

284
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:29,291
having lost his name, his rank, his fame,

285
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,083
and, finally, his left arm.

286
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:38,833
He carried a curse,
having committed a taboo in his homeland.

287
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,666
You talk too much, Klaus.

288
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:47,583
Whoops--a gag order. Too bad.

289
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,125
Do you know what this is?

290
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,666
A magica-technica device?

291
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,250
Well, aren't you observant.

292
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:17,250
I call this the magic Yggdrasil device.

293
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:22,583
Who cares what it's called?
The question is, can we use it?

294
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,625
We can start testing it tomorrow.

295
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:31,041
All we need is a test subject...

296
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,000
A subject?

297
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:38,500
This device will force
the young dragon Eco to awaken.

298
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,000
It was Milgauss's idea.

299
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,791
You mean... in there...?

300
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,083
So your duty is?

301
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,041
To... capture Eco.

302
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:54,958
Correct. What a splendid
little underling you have, Milgauss.

303
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,458
Is this a dream?

304
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,041
How did I never notice?

305
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,958
That face, that build...

306
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:29,166
That was none other
than my brother's parr, Mordred.

307
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,041
Silvia?

308
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:40,125
My sister! And Glen...
and even Avdocha?

309
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,916
What do you mean, "even"?!

310
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,541
Are you saying you
don't want to be around me?

311
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,541
Maybe I'll just lay
bare those udders of yours!

312
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,083
Ow!

313
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:53,166
Since when have you ranked
high enough to insult my sister?

314
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,833
K-Keep that up and
I'll get taller and taller!

315
00:21:55,916 --> 00:22:00,250
The very idea that you'd grow
another inch past the age of twenty!

316
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,833
I heard that!

317
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,916
What business do you
have here so early in the morning?

318
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,583
Oh... just something on my mind.

319
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,041
Mordred's ashes?

320
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,000
You, too?

321
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,583
Yes. After the Willingham incident,

322
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:20,041
I investigated all of
the dragon mausoleums.

323
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,250
And?

324
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,291
As expected, someone
had removed dragon ashes

325
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,041
from every mausoleum in the country.

326
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:30,875
Mordred's ashes,
interred here, were no exception.

327
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,541
I knew it.

328
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,875
Did this Mordred thing ring any bells for you?

329
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:40,083
This man I saw at the Willingham
Mausoleum the other day,

330
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,166
calling himself Milgauss...

331
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,083
We know of him.

332
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,208
This is just a hunch, but...

333
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:51,208
I think that man might
actually be our older brother.

334
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,541
Impossible!

335
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,541
For him to have survived--

336
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,916
and become an Imperial army spy?

337
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,416
It's just not possible!

338
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,541
There's more.

339
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:08,166
I sensed Mordred among the
Necromancia that attacked Ansullivan.

340
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,708
Silvia...

341
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,583
Don't talk to anyone else about this.

342
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:17,333
The Lautreamont name
stands to be deeply wounded

343
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:21,625
just by Julius being alive.

344
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,125
I won't... sister.

345
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,625
How beautiful it is!

346
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:38,083
Yggdrasil is complete. With this,
the dragon's power will be ours.

347
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,625
Soon the imperial throne
will be a dream no longer...

348

We meet at last, Ash Blake.

368
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,416
--Shoo.
--What?

369
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,125
This is where I have
a fun time chatting with girls.

370
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,916
I don't need men in here.
Go on now, scat!

You call me here
only to treat me like this?

372
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,666
You've got some nerve.

I'll have to show you a thing or two...

374
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,916
"Next Episode: Yggdrasil Rising"
Wait, how exactly did you mean that? Hey!
