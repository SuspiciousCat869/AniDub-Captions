1
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,458
Pardon me, Princess.

2
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:06,250
Cosette... can I ask you something?

3
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,708
What might that be, Princess?

4
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,333
Why do I have to take a bath

5
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,916
just because my dress is in for alterations?

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,583
What are you saying?

7
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,666
It's only right for a lady to beautify her body

8
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,875
in preparation for tonight's masquerade ball.

9
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,916
I've prepared my special lotion.

10
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,916
And do <i>what</i> with it?

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,958
Give you a better full-body massage than before.

12
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,250
Now, Princess... let's get down to business.

13
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:47,041
S-Stop <i>doing</i> that!

14
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,250
How about this?

15
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,083
Not bad.

16
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,291
Then what about this?

17
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,125
It's all right...

18
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,708
It's not exactly
screaming "pick me," though.

19
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,750
Oh, no?

20
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:13,125
Everyone'll be dressed up
fancy at this ball thing, right?

21
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,208
Even though I'm just after the meat.

22
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,750
This daughter of dragonkind
isn't gonna be outdone

23
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,416
by any stupid dummy dum-dum human!

24
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,916
Understood! I'll find just
the right gown for you, Miss Eco.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,041
I'll crush you if you don't.

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,958
I'm bored stiff.

27
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:37,958
It's not like it matters what
a man wears to these things.

28
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:38,791
Yes?

29
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,041
It's me.

30
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,375
Princess?!

31
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,958
May I?

32
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:54,250
<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

33
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:59,250
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

34
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,625
<i>The "something" you and I have</i>

35
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,750
<i>Starts with a tiny thrum</i>

36
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,666
<i>Now teach me about</i>
<i>the sky one more time</i>

"Dragonar Academy"

38
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,208
<i>The weight of flapping</i>
<i>wings that only a bird knows</i>

39
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:24,208
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

40
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:32,458
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

41
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,875
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

42
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,333
<i>But if your tears can be fewer</i>

43
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,833
<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

44
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,375
<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

45
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,875
<i>I'll embody any kind of hero for you</i>

46

<i>I'll never, never,</i>
<i>never, never let go</i>

47
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:54,291
<i>Even if I die,</i>
<i>I'll be your knight alone</i>

48
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:58,625
<i>But you cried for</i>
<i>real and got angry:</i>

49
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,875
<i>Saying "Don't be so cold to me"</i>

50
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,583
<i>I wipe your tears</i>

00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,083
<i>Even without a sacred blade</i>

52
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,166
<i>I don't care if I'm not a hero</i>

53
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:17,375
<i>If I can protect you</i>

54
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,333
What's going on here?
Wh-What <i>is</i> all this?

55
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:37,000
Why am I sitting beside
the princess on--on my bed?

56
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,000
And what's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?!

57
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:48,958
Uh, P-Princess...
don't you have a fitting to go to?

58
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,458
M-My gown is being tailored.

59
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,875
It's gotten tighter in
the chest this past year, so--

60
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,166
Now look what you made me say!

61
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,875
S-Sorry!

62
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,500
Is... is something bothering you?

63
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,083
Yeah. Hear me out?

"Yggdrasil Rising"

65
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:15,583
Nope.

66
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,333
Nope.

67
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,000
Nope!

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,375
Are you yanking my chain or what?

69
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,541
N-Not at all!

70
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,500
You're just so demanding, Miss Eco...

71
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:40,041
I told you: as a dragon,
I have to be better than these humans!

72
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,833
Especially that Silvia!

73
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:45,041
Do you dislike Princess Silvia?

74
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,833
Not exactly...

75
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,875
But she's been getting
really chummy with Ash lately.

76
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:55,541
It makes me feel all mixed-up inside.

77
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,041
You certainly have it rough, Miss Eco.

78
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,125
How so?

79
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:03,166
Well, Ash is human and you're a dragon.

80
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,500
One day he'll fall in love
with a human girl, get married,

81
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,625
have babies, and...

82
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,541
Ash is human and you're a dragon.

83
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:20,875
One day he'll fall in love
with a human girl, get married,

84
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:25,416
have babies, and...

85
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,208
M-Miss Eco?

86
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,625
Milgauss... is Prince Julius?!

87
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:45,541
Father could never bring himself
to go through with his execution.

88
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,416
The way Father was acting yesterday...

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,166
...the stolen ashes...

90
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,625
...what Milgauss said at
the Willingham Mausoleum...

91
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,083
...that first Necromancia...

92
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,083
The clues were all there.

93
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,458
I just didn't see them.

94
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:08,916
I'd be genuinely happy
if my brother were still alive.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,125
But what do I do now?

96
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,041
You know, my dad...

97
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:20,125
He up and left right
after my little sister was born.

98
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,958
We were forbidden
to talk about him after that.

99
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,125
But one day, I asked my mom:

100
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,125
"Why did Dad leave?"

101
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,791
And?

102
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,708
She didn't answer.

103
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:38,125
But she promised
she'd tell me when I was older

104
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,791
and could better understand.

105
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,625
So I stopped obsessing about it.

106
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,083
What I mean is...

107
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,625
Rather than spending your
time worrying and wondering,

108
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:50,291
it'd be faster to corner
the guy and just ask him.

109
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,500
Right?

110
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,541
That sure would make my life easier.

111
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:59,333
You're right. Thank you.

112
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,250
It's nothing.

113
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,875
Um...

114
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,541
Er... Princess?

115
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,208
A-Are you all right?

116
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,416
The lightning's pretty
far off now, so you can let go--

117
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,375
N-No! No no no no no!

118
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,833
What the hell are you thinking?!

119
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,833
She's the fourth princess
of Lautreamont Knight Country!

120
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:14,125
She's got her mind on
this whole Prince Julius thing!

121
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,583
I can't--

122
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,416
Pardon me, Princess.

123
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,666
Your gown is tailored and ready.

124
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,916
I-Is that so? I'll be right there.

125
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,083
Pardon the intrusion.

126
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,666
Say...

127
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,125
What's keeping Eco?

128
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,958
I knew full well...

129
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,083
I knew all along, and yet...
this tightness in my chest...

130
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:17,541
One day he'll fall in love
with a human girl, get married...

131
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:22,958
One day he'll fall in love
with a human girl, get married,

132
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:27,041
have babies, and...

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,833
Ash is a human and I'm a dragon...

134
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:43,875
When he starts a family, I'll--

135
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,916
But... but that's...!

136
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:53,875
Eco?

137
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:02,250
She's gone. And with the
ball starting any minute, too...

138
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,666
Is something wrong, Ash?

139
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,541
Where...?

140
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,208
I'm so lost.

141
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,750
What the--?
What are they doing there?

142
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,000
It's her!

143
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,083
Where are you?!

144
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,083
Miss Eco!

145
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,125
Stay back! Get out of here!

146
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,541
Eco's gone?

147
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,708
Uh-huh. Prim can't find her, either.

148
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:56,458
Understood.
Please attend the ball as planned.

149
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,958
But--

150
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:03,291
We servants know this
castle like the backs of our hands.

151
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:07,208
Please don't worry.
We'll find her before you know it.

152
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,000
Thanks--I appreciate it.

153
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,166
Where could she be?

154
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,416
Ash?

155
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,375
I heard about Eco and Prim.

156
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:43,583
No need to worry.
Cosette will find them right away.

157
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,583
Yeah... you're right.

158
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,833
Milgauss!

159
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,583
What are <i>you</i> doing here?!

160
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,375
Dear me! You have
business with my servant?

161
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,250
Just a case of mistaken identity.

162
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,333
Wait!

163
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,625
Stop. I've seen that noble before.

164
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,291
What?

165
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,875
He's representing the Zepharos
Empire at the Continental Congress--

166
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,166
Margrave Klaus Vandenhul!

167
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,875
"Dragonar Academy"

168
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,916
"Dragonar Academy"

169
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,125
Stay back! Get out of here!

170
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,291
Huh?

171
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:15,458
If I can just carry out
Master Milgauss's orders...

172
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,875
Quit glaring at him, Ash.

173
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:29,833
Huh?

174
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,666
He may be from the Empire,
but he wouldn't dare start anything here.

175
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,166
But--

176
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,625
Focus more on your footwork.
You're terribly out of step.

177
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:44,416
Easy for you to say--I've only
learned the basics so far.

178
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:52,583
Thank you, Ash. I feel better
now that I've confided in you.

179
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,250
Princess...

180
00:14:54,333 --> 00:15:01,666
M-Make no mistake! I'm thanking
you for listening to me, that's all.

181
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,625
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:09,000
No sign of Miss Eco on these floors.

183
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,958
Nor these.

184
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,833
So that leaves...

185
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,416
I was so nervous...!

186
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,083
Think this is tougher than
the Dragonar battle skills exam?

187
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,583
Maybe so.

188
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,875
What a marvelous dance that was!

189
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,041
Won't you dance another round with me?

190
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,916
Another dance? Gladly. But...

191
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,166
...with that gentleman there.

192
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,166
Cosette!

193
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,166
It's Prim!

194
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,500
I've never seen anyone dance so beautifully.

195
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,333
Are you... my brother?

196
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,625
Why did you call me Silvie?

197
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:24,791
The Necromancia in Durham
Square--was that Mordred?

198
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,041
Answer me!

199
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:33,041
Is it proper in Knight Country
to ask questions during a dance?

200
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,333
Princess!

201
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,833
How'd it go? Is he--

202
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,208
I'm not certain. However...

203
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:48,041
He definitely dances
in the Knight Country style.

204
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,125
Princess Silvia, Master Ash.

205
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,208
We've found Prim.

206
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,583
P-Please forgive me, Ash!

207
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,208
Why are you apologizing? What happened?

208
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,875
If I hadn't said what I did...

209
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,083
Said what?

210
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,916
That Miss Eco was a dragon...
and you were a human...

211
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,416
That one day you'd marry
a human girl and have babies,

212
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,208
and didn't that make Eco sad?

213
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,916
You imbecile!

214
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,291
Eco's a dragon, sure, but inside,
she may as well be a human girl.

215
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:32,958
Why was she born in human form,
instead of looking like a dragon?

216
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,791
If I were Eco, I know I'd be
fretting about that very question.

217
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,291
And you...

218
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,291
I-I'm so sorry!

219
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:46,166
That's all right, Princess.
Thank you.

220
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,166
Prim says Miss Eco
was abducted at the old palace.

221
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,833
Abducted?!

222
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,916
Who was behind it?
What'd they look like?

223
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,500
They looked like they were from the palace.

224
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,416
Oh, but the one maid
who seemed like the leader,

225
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,875
she was a Tantalos girl.

226
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:09,250
A Tantalos girl...?

227
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,375
Milgauss!

228
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,500
Wait!

229
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,916
It'd be pointless to confront him directly.

230
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,583
But--

231
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:21,250
We scoured the castle for Miss Eco,
but she's nowhere to be found.

232
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,500
If they abducted her,
they won't be wanting to kill her.

233
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:30,125
What would be a safe place to
hide her during the ball?

234
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,291
Margrave Klaus Vandenhul's airship--

235
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,666
<i>Beowulf</i> !

236
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,333
There you are, Anya.

237
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,041
The experiment has begun, I see.

238
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,708
It's going smoothly so far.

239
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:01,541
Ubermana Beam No. 11, prepare to fire.

240
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,833
Cartridge loaded.
Preparations complete.

241
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,583
Commence countdown.

242
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:21,666
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

243
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,750
Ubermana Beam No. 11: Fire.

244
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,416
We're shooting her with a
concentrated beam

245
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,875
of the immense
amount of mana in milenium.

246
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:44,875
Yggdrasil here can forcefully
awaken adult dragons

247
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,541
that never became Maestros.

248
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:53,041
Milenium, the mana-rich
crystals said to come from

249
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,541
thousand-year-old dragon fossils...

250
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,416
It's that mana we give to our subject.

251
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,708
And make her reveal her true form...

252
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,916
Am I going to die like this?

253
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,041
Ubermana Beam No. 12:

254
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,500
Fire.

255
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,375
Ow! It hurts!

256
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,958
It hurrrts!

257
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:27,125
Stop... please... please!

258
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,708
No change to Subject Alpha.

259
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,000
I guess we have no choice.

260
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,625
Set milenium output to the maximum.

261
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,083
Eco...

262
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,625
Nooo!

263
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,333
Ash!

264
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,458
<i>Ash</i> !

265
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,125
Ash...!

266
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,500
I can't feel it... my connection to Ash...

267
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,500
How stupid can I get...?

268
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:09,791
This is what it took for me to realize...

269
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,416
My feelings... for Ash...

270
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,916
All milenium engaged.

271
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,833
Final Ubermana Beam:

272
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,291
Fire.

273
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,958
Wh-What's this?!

274
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,708
The mana detector's picked
up an unknown mana reaction!

275
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,666
Yggdrasil is out of control!

276
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,041
It's not accepting the
emergency shutdown signal!

277
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,875
Wh-What...?

278
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,666
Quick, stop the device--before it runs amok!

279
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,958
No chance of that.

280
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,125
Huh?

281
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,416
All that energy harvested from the milenium

282
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,875
has been absorbed
into Subject Alpha's body.

283
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,833
E-Eco?

284
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,083

285
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,791

Ash! What is it?!

00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:00,583
I don't know... but something's
happened to Eco, for sure!
