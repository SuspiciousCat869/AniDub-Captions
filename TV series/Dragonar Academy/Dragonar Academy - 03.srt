1
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,916
Um...

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,750
Er... why are you sitting next to me?

3
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,916
If you want to know your companion,

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,375
it's most effective to sit beside them.

5
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,750
That's Dating 101.

6
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,166
See? And now you know!

7
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,250
Now you won't commit the boorish blunder

8
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,625
of sitting across from your date.

9
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,833
Whoa--way too close!
Please, back off a little!

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,833
I want you.

11
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,208
Huh?!

12
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,833
In between the Zepharos Empire to the north

13
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,083
and the Chevron Kingdom to the south,

14
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,000
lies Lautreamont Knight Country.

15
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,125
Known as "the Dragon-Rearing Land,"

16
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:34,625
it boasts the largest dragon
population on the Arc Strada continent.

17
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:38,125
This small country with
fewer than five million citizens

18
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,166
is home to a unique school:

19
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,458
Ansullivan Dragonar Academy.

20
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,583
It aims to educate
and guide dragon masters

21
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,750
and the so-called Breeders,
young men and women

22
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,916
who have entered
into bonds with dragons.

23
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:58,833
<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

24
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:03,791
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

25
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:08,125
<i>The "something" you and I have</i>

26
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,250
<i>Starts with a tiny thrum</i>

27
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,250
<i>Now teach me about</i>
<i>the sky one more time</i>

28
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,958
"Dragonar Academy"

29
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:23,750
<i>The weight of flapping</i>
<i>wings that only a bird knows</i>

30
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:28,750
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

31
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:37,041
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

32
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,416
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,916
<i>But if your tears can be fewer</i>

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,416
<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

35
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,916
<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,416
<i>I'll embody any kind of hero for you</i>

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,791
<i>I'll never, never,</i>
<i>never, never let go</i>

38
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:58,791
<i>Even if I die,</i>
<i>I'll be your knight alone</i>

39
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:03,166
<i>But you cried for</i>
<i>real and got angry:</i>

40
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,458
<i>Saying "Don't be so cold to me"</i>

41
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,125
<i>I wipe your tears</i>

42
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,625
<i>Even without a sacred blade</i>

43
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,708
<i>I don't care if I'm not a hero</i>

44
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:21,958
<i>If I can protect you with all I have</i>

45
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:31,208
Yes, you--here in the student
council room. I must ask:

46
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,708
Ash Blake.

47
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,333
Y-Yeah?

48
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,708
Don't you want to
be on the student council?

49
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,666
Huh?

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,208
"Riot in the Streets"

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,458
How's it taste, Lancelot?

52
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,083
Oh, Lancelot. I became a Dragonar

53
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,708
all because you grew into a Maestro.

54
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,125
Next I'll be an Archdragonar.

55
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,250
I promised him I would.

56
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,625
That I'd be a fine, upstanding knight...

57
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,458
But still...

58
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,916
...what is <i>with</i> that joker Ash Blake?

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,791
Being able to ride others' parrs
like that is beyond common sense.

60
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,500
He must have something up his sleeve...

61
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,458
Watch out!

62
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,666
Dragon on the loose!

63
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,291
Y-Your Highness! A young Strada just up and--

64
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,291
M-Me? On the student council?

65
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,291
That's right.

66
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,750
But...

67
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,416
About that sketchy pair
you ran across in the woods...

68
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,541
Just supposing
they <i>were</i> Imperial spies,

69
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,500
there is a non-zero chance
that the Academy is in their sights.

70
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:17,250
Ever since the war fifty-two
years ago, the Zepharos Empire

71
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:22,166
has mistaken Ansullivan Dragonar
Academy for a military school.

72
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,291
But it's not.

73
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,208
Exactly.

74
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,666
And as long as Rebecca Randall
and Cu Chulainn are around,

75
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,291
they won't get away with it, either!

76
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,708
Which is why I'd like your help,
as a student council member.

77
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,916
B-But I--

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,083
Think it over, won't you?

79
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,208
What's that?!

80
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,458
A Level 2 alert?

81
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,833
Now calm down!

82
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,750
Behave yours--

83
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,625
What?! Why would the
princess do something so rash?

84
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,333
Probably out of a rivalry with you.

85
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,875
Huh?

86
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,708
Her Highness is a perfectionist
and an extremely sore loser.

87
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,666
She wouldn't have blithely
accepted having a classmate

88
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,625
who can expertly ride
any dragon you throw at him.

89
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,375
No need to worry.

90
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,291
Rebecca!

91
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,166
Heed my call...

92
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,041
Cu Chulainn!

93
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:40,541
Rebecca Randall commands thee:
Present the Arch thou hath created unto me!

94
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:50,250
Rebecca Randall commands thee:
Present the Arch thou hath created unto me!

95
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,500
So that's Arch!

96
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,500
Mmm, scrumptious!

97
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,958
All that commotion--

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,833
Everything worked out
in the end, thanks to Rebecca.

99
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,208
But the princess? My rival?

100
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,291
Ow! Ow ow ow!

101
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,625
You've got a lot of nerve
to ignore me like that!

102
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,000
S-Sorry! I was just thinking...

103
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,625
I said, what's with all
those people gathered there?

104
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:36,625
Those are tourists,
come to see the statue of St. Durham.

105
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,541
St. Durham?

106
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,750
First-generation paladin
Durham Lautreamont.

107
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,666
This was some
five hundred years ago now.

108
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,916
That armor... it's Arch, right?

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,291
You can tell?

110
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,666
The Draguarth includes
some Arch design sketches.

111
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,000
Huh...

112
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,583
Although the sketches
our ancestors left behind

113
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,541
are really just for reference.

114
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:03,500
So will you make me
an original Arch one day, too?

115
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:08,666
I guess you'll have
to become a Maestro first, huh.

116
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,458
How dare you?! Why should
I have to make an Arch for my dog?

117
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,583
It's against the laws of nature!

118
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,625
Sheesh, where did that come from?

119
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,583
That's right--we learned about it in class.

120
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,041
For dragonkind,
presenting an Arch to their master

121
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,833
is part of giving
up their entire selves--

122
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,791
Ow!

123
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:40,500
It can't be! Is he the same...

124
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,500
How am I going
to tell Master Milgauss?

125
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,166
Well, well!

126
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,750
We meet again, I see,
and in such a lovely setting!

127
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,916
The Dragonfang Inn is
second to none in taste and volume.

128
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,958
Plus, student council
members can eat here for half off.

129
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,583
Go on--eat up!

130
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,666
But why are you two here?

131
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,375
That date ticket
from the Dragonar Festival.

132
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:29,208
Her Highness must fulfill
her obligations as the winner, too.

133
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,666
She seems to have
a lot on her mind lately.

134
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,666
I wanted her to open
up and talk to me today, but...

135
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,458
well, you see how she is.

136
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,250
Ow ow ow!

137
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,458
Anya?

138
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,416
Anya!

139
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
What's wrong?

140
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,500
N-Nothing.

141
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,791
How are things in town?

142
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:09,791
Carefree. They've all
but forgotten about the war.

143
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:15,333
Of course. No one here
uses dragons as weapons.

144
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,958
Ansullivan is a very kind town.

145
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,083
But its kindness is without meaning.

146
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,666
Now: Deep One.

147
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,333
A darkness and light more
irresistible than death's abyss.

148
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,208
Its blood, its flesh...

149
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,416
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

150
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,916
Come forth, promised
child of magica-technica!

151
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,458
What is it?

152
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,833
Nothing good!

153
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:08,458
"Dragonar Academy"

154
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,458
"Dragonar Academy"

155
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,166
Hurry--run!

156
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,458
Wh-What <i>is</i> that?!

157
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,000
A... a dragon?

158
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,541
Its flesh--it's rotten!

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,125
Eco!

160
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,916
Hold it, you oaf!
Just who do you think I am?!

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,375
This town is full of fantastic
boutiques, you know!

162
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,958
What on earth is she doing?

163
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:01,583
So be a good boy
and back off, wouldja?

164
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,000
Eco!

165
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,041
Watch where you're grabbing!

166
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,333
Why, you...

167
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,458
That is <i>enough</i> !

168
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,958
Dammit! What do we do?

169
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,291
Rebecca!

170
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,458
Manifest now...
O ye sure-striking mystic spear...

171
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,125
Its name...

172
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,916
...Gae Bulg!

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,500
Get him!

174
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,041
Yes!

175
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,750
It's growing back?

176
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,208
What <i>is</i> this thing?!

177
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,750
Ash! Take the princess
and get out of here! Hurry!

178
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,000
Princess!

179
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,041
Snap out of it, Princess!

180
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,125
Geez! What's with this thing, anyway?

181
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,000
Eco...

182
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,500
It's not done with her yet!

183
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,041
Princess!

184
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,708
Hmph! Some princess <i>you</i> are!

185
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,083
This is no time to question
your capacity as a royal!

186
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,208
Here, I'll apologize in advance:

187
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,541
Sorry!

188
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,583
Ash...?

189
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,458
I need to ask you a favor!

190
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,875
Summon Lancelot and let me ride him!

191
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,041
Ride him? Where?

192
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,791
Over there!

193
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:24,166
I can ride any dragon--
I might be able to hold him off!

194
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,708
<i>What</i> ? Are you crazy?!

195
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,333
C'mon, just call Lancelot already!

196
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,750
Eco!

197
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,791
<i>Eco</i> !

198
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,250
Get on! You might still have a chance!

199
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,250
H-Hey!

200
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,333
Don't be touching me there!

201
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:03,416
Do you know who I <i>am</i> ?
I'm of the proud dragon race, and--

202
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,583
Hey!

203
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,250
That's enough!

204
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,541
Hello, Eco. This is the
Highdragon Workshop,

205
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,708
and I am Navi.

206
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,250
Navi?

207
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,041
Someone to teach and guide
you while you're still immature...

208
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,833
Yes, that sounds about right.

209
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,041
Why... do you look like that?

210
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:45,708
Listen. If this keeps up, he <i>will</i> die.

211
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,750
Are you all right with that?

212
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,958
Ash!

213
00:15:55,583 --> 00:16:00,291
True, he has a natural
talent for riding any dragon at all.

214
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,833
But he needs more. The way he is now,

215
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,708
he can't win against a Necromancia.

216
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,541
Necromancia?

217
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:12,083
A dead dragon,
resurrected by artificial means.

218
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,250
When you say he needs more...

219
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,583
His Arch?

220
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,208
Bingo.

221
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:27,125
This Highdragon Workshop
was built by the sacred Maestro,

222
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,958
a shared space for craftworking dragons.

223
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:35,416
The Arch is one of
the things Maestro produce.

224
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,083
But an Arch is a made-to-order set of armor.

225
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,625
A mere copy would fit poorly,

226
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,875
perhaps even endangering
the life of the one who wears it.

227
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,083
So what do I do?

228
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:52,083
Simple: Pick and
choose the best-fitting parts

229
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,250
from among the many sketches here

230
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,208
and put them all together.

231
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:01,625
I have his size data right here.

232
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,833
Where did all this come from?

233
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:08,375
I fiddled around a bit in
his dreams before you were born.

234
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,041
Don't mess with my dog, you hear me?

235
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,708
So what will you do?

236
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,875
Are you put off by the
sheer number of sketches?

237
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,125
Is the idea of selecting
each part so daunting

238
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,000
that you'll give up
before you even begin?

239
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,458
That smirk of yours really ticks me off!

240
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,708
Of course!

241
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,000
Of <i>course</i> I'll do it!

242
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,083
Are you all right?

243
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,541
Y-Yeah... Sorry.

244
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,458
Lancelot's reached his limits...

245
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,833
...and you won't hold
out much longer yourself.

246
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,125
I know!

247
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,166
But... I <i>know</i> .

248
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,833
The astral flow is telling me,
through my starbrand.

249
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,000
Eco's still alive!

250
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,666
As long as this is glowing,
I'll never give up.

251
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,083
So you better hang in there, too, Eco!

252
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,791
I'll save you--don't give up!

253
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:08,208
Hmph... pretty full
of himself for a pet dog...

254
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,791
The mana is increasing...
The bond between Breeder and parr--

255
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,500
no, between Ash and Eco...

256
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,208
I see it!

257
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,416
<i>Almete</i> , <i>gorjal</i> , <i>peto</i> ,
<i>espaldar</i> , <i>brafonera</i> , <i>falda</i> !

258
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:29,958
<i>Bujeta</i> , <i>hombrera</i> , <i>brazal</i> ,
<i>guarda</i> , <i>greba</i> , <i>escarpe</i> !

259
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,833
<i>Espolazo</i> !

260
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,708
Ash!

261
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,041
What a waste, giving this to a dog...

262
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:42,583
Huh?

263
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,208
Take it!

264
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,916
B-But this...

265
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,041
It's Arch!

266
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,416
How awe-inspiring...

267
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,291
I-It's not like I made
it just for you or anything!

268
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,208
It's not an original--it's just
some makeshift armor!

269
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,750
I didn't, like, <i>present</i> it to you!

270
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,083
Thanks, Eco.

271
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,166
With this... I feel like I can't lose!

272
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,791
Princess!

273
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,083
Understood!

274
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,750
Lancelot sure is a good dragon.

275
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,250
What?

276
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,208
You've got the best parr.

277
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:32,750
Don't be trying anything
crazy like riding other dragons.

278
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,291
Wh-What are you talking about?
And why <i>now</i> ?!

279
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,791
Ash...

280
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,583
You may be deity or devil,

281
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,250
but as long as you're
a dragon, I <i>will</i> ride you!

282
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,500
Master Milgauss...

283
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,166
Quite the unexpected ambush.

284
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:06,208
The experiment has ended
in failure. But not for nothing:

285
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,625
We have that boy... and that girl.

286
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,750
The girl?

287
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,458
Let us retreat.

288
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,208
Necromancia? Is that you?

289
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,708
Ah, so you had a master once, too.

290
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,541
Are you... sure about that?

291
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,166
All right. Leave it to me.

292
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,500
Manifest now...
O ye light-graced sword...

293
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:43,125
Grant unto me the
power to purge all darkness.

294
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,500
Its name, the divine blade, Aix-les-Bains!

295
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,916
Eco!

296
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,250
Ash!

297
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,208
Congrats once again on getting your parr!

298
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,916
Thanks, Raymond.

299
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,500
This has made me painfully aware
of the student council's shortcomings.

300
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,416
Ash, Silvia.

301
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,000
Again, I urge you two
to join the student council.

302
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:15,083
If Lancelot and I would
be of any use, I'll join.

303
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:19,458
We mustn't let an attack
like that happen ever again.

304
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,083
And you, Ash?

305
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,416
I...

306
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,583
All right. I'll do it.

307
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:30,083
Then let's bring this little
joining ceremony to a close.

308
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:41,875
Hey! How dare my pet go all
googly-eyed over a human female!

309
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,291
Er, Miss President...?

310
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,958
That's not how <i>my</i> joining ceremony--

311
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:50,708
And to celebrate our new
additions to the student council...

312
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,541
Cheers!

313
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,708
I-I can't reach...

314
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,791
<i>Ain't it su-su-su-su-super awesome?</i>
<i>Top-quality training in love</i>

315
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,916
<i>Makes me wanna</i>

<i>Can't you feel?</i>

real sadist. And a real masochist.
