1
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,625
What a foolish boy indeed,

2
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:10,166
putting his own life in danger

3
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,125
so that the girl's wish could come true.

4
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,000
And yet...

5
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,500
Ash Blake.

6
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,583
You deserve better than being left to die.

7
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,916
Let us take a chance
on the possibilities you hold.

8
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:09,333
<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

9
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:14,291
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

10
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:18,625
<i>The "something" you and I have</i>

11
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,791
<i>Starts with a tiny thrum</i>

12
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,541
<i>Now teach me about</i>
<i>the sky one more time</i>

13
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:29,416
"Dragonar Academy"

14
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,250
<i>The weight of flapping</i>
<i>wings that only a bird knows</i>

15
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:39,250
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

16
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:47,541
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

17
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,916
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,375
<i>But if your tears can be fewer</i>

19
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,875
<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

20
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,416
<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

21
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,875
<i>I'll embody any kind of hero for you</i>

22
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:04,333
<i>I'll never, never,</i>
<i>never, never let go</i>

23
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:09,333
<i>Even if I die,</i>
<i>I'll be your knight alone</i>

24
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:13,666
<i>But you cried for</i>
<i>real and got angry:</i>

25
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,916
<i>Saying "Don't be so cold to me"</i>

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,625
<i>I wipe your tears</i>

27
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,125
<i>Even without a sacred blade</i>

28
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,208
<i>I don't care if I'm not a hero</i>

29
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:32,458
<i>If I can protect you</i>
<i>with all I have</i>

30
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,583
Huh?

31
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,333
I-I can't move!

32
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:01,125
It's all right. Don't be afraid, Ash Blake.

33
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,583
I'll treat every last inch
of your body juuust right.

34
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,958
H-How do you know my name?
Who--Who <i>are</i> you?

35
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,541
Why are you...

36
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,125
I am Navi.

37
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:42,583
This is a kind of ceremony.
For the Navi who's about to be born.

38
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,791
To... entrust her to you.

39
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,583
What a dream!

40
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,500
"A Boy and His Dragon"

41
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,791
G'morning!

42
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,541
I hope we're in the same class again!

43
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,083
It's almost here--

44
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,208
the Aries Dragonar Festival.

45
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,541
I can't wait!

46
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,958
Will you be taking part, Jessica?

47
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,166
Maybe. I'm still thinking about it.

48
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,708
Hey, look.

49
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,708
That's Ash Blake!

50
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,208
The school's number-one problem child!

51
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,458
It's amazing he's made it to Senios

52
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,875
when his parr hasn't even been born yet.

53
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:50,416
You know what they say:
They take after their masters.

54
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,208
I bet his parr'll be a problem child, too.

55
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,708
Ah-ah-ah!

56
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,541
Raymond!

57
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,916
Can't you do something
about that short fuse of yours?

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,166
I'm not going to stand here
and let them mock my parr!

59
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,250
I see <i>you</i> haven't changed a bit.

60
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,833
Hey, Max.

61
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:15,041
Ash, we're Senios now.

62
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,416
Develop some self-restraint.

63
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,000
I... I know, but...

64
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:25,958
Anyway, I sure hope we've got
some cute girls in our class!

65
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,666
You said the same thing last year.

66
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,625
Talk about arrested development.

67
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,458
The new term has begun,

68
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,625
and everyone who's
completed the basic Unios course

69
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,041
will now spend the next three years

70
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:45,458
in the advanced Senios course.

71
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,958
It goes without saying
at this stage of the game,

72
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,000
but dragons are extremely special entities.

73
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,458
The starbrands you all bear?

74
00:06:55,541 --> 00:07:00,625
Those mark you as Breeders,
and are a portal to the astral flow

75
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,708
linking you to your parr:
the partner dragon born from within you,

76
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:09,791
where it has been since the
Orphan's Rite that bound you to your role.

77
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:14,750
Thus no one but the master
with whom it shares lifeforce

78
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,375
can ride a parr.

79
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,416
There <i>are</i> exceptions.

80
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,000
Lautreamont Knight Country
gained its independence

81
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,125
when the Chevron Kingdom gave it the task

82
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,166
of dragon rearing and management.

83
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,541
But we remain in a cease-fire with
the Zepharos Empire to the north,

84
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,208
with its mechanical and magical engineering.

85
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,458
War, huh? May as well be
another world far, far away.

86
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,000
With that in mind, please conduct yourselves

87
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,875
with the pride and
responsibility befitting students

88
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,666
of Ansullivan Dragonar Academy.

89
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,875
Yes, ma'am!

90
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,500
Don't let it get to you, Ash.

91
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,083
Let what?

92
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,208
That stuff about exceptions.

93
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,916
I'm not.

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,708
Still, how come you're the only one
who can ride other people's parrs?

95
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,125
You're asking the wrong guy.

96
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,416
Out of my way!

97
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,958
Standing around
chit-chatting there, of all places?

98
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,083
Don't you realize how annoying that is?

99
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,250
Oh! S-Sorry about that!

100
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,875
Did you <i>hear</i> her?

101
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,375
So stuck-up!

102
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,875
Oh, boy...

103
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,833
Wasn't that Whozis?
She's in our class for the first time.

104
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,208
Yep...

105
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,250
Silvia Lautreamont.

106
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,625
The fourth princess of
Lautreamont Knight Country.

107
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:48,625
Her grades are superb, but with
her personality and noble rank,

108
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,500
people tend to give her a pretty wide berth.

109
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,083
So aren't you running in the race?

110
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,375
What race?

111
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,625
That race.

112
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,333
The Aries Dragonar Festival.

113
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,875
Not without a parr, no.

114
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,375
Sheesh, you're not still
worried about that left arm of yours!

115
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:17,625
If you ask me, that starbrand is kickin' rad!

116
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,375
Yes, I'm worried!

117
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,416
Miss President?

118
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,291
President Rebecca!

119
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,583
Here comes third-year class
president Rebecca Randall!

120
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,375
The Archdragonar who commands Cu Chulainn,

121
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,500
the mightiest Maestro in the whole academy!

122
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,416
That's not to mention her
gorgeous face and seductive body...

123
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,291
Just once I'd love to take her on...

124
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,625
...if you know what I mean.

125
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,125
Idiot.

126
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,708
Uh-oh--do you think she heard me?

127
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,250
Don't ask me!

128
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,375
You traitor!

129
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:02,666
Now let's start our Dragonar battle training.

130
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:08,666
These weaponless techniques are
the basis for all Dragonar battle skills.

131
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,916
Thanks, Raymond.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,625
Don't sweat it.

133
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,750
Good girl, Brigid.

134
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,875
Again, be very careful when touching a dragon

135
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,000
that's not your practice partner.

136
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,333
Don't want to cause any major accidents.

137
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,041
Ready? Mount up!

138
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,250
Begin!

139
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:48,750
Whoa! Seeing so many
all move at once really is something!

140
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,000
Go, Lancelot!

141
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:04,250
That's the Ice Blue Princess
for you--such power! How's Ash?

142
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,333
Hey, this is fun!

143
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,041
Ah--something's clicked!

144
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,458
Go, Brigid!

145
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,416
That's the way!
A body slam, then a rear dodge,

146
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,541
then straight for the jugular!

147
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,583
Yes!

148
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,291
Ash! Behind you!

149
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,583
It's okay, Lancelot! Calm down!

150
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,291
I'm sorry, Brigid! So sorry!

151
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,458
Hang on! Stop right there!

152
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,916
What do you think you're doing, Ash Blake?

153
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,916
I told you to be careful touching
any dragon but your own partner!

154
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,458
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:03,916
Hmm. Neither seems to be badly hurt...

156
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,791
...but don't let this happen again, all right?

157
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,166
Yes, sir.

158
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,833
Sorry, Your Highness. It was my fa--

159
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,625
What do you think
skill practice is for, anyway?

160
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,041
All this horsing around
on dragons is out of the question!

161
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,333
I-I wasn't horsing around--

162
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:31,583
This only happened because
you were riding someone else's dragon!

163
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:35,791
Now just hang on!
He has his own reasons for--

164
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:40,333
That's right--you haven't been
graced with a parr yet, have you?

165
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,958
That'll be one bonehead dragon,
just like its master.

166
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,625
Or maybe it already died ages ago.

167
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,166
Hey.

168
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,583
Is that some kind of joke?

169
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,541
What did you just say?

170
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,833
Did I stutter?

171
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,500
I said, maybe your parr is already dead.

172
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,250
Ash!

173
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:14,833
Sorry--he flies off the handle
when someone makes fun of his parr.

174
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,666
That's why they call him a problem child.

175
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,416
You take that back!

176
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,041
What?

177
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,625
I'm not enough of a Mr. Nice Guy
to take that comment sitting down!

178
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,541
Then how's this?

179
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:35,583
If you can beat my standing at
the upcoming Aries Dragonar Festival,

180
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,583
I'll take back what
I said--and apologize to boot.

181
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,166
Sounds promising. I accept.

182
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,875
It's high time someone put you in your place.

183
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:55,291
"Dragonar Academy"

184
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:59,333
"Dragonar Academy"

185
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,083
Not again...

186
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,625
Don't look so scared.

187
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,083
Night after night, you touch
the body of a man who can't move.

188
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,166
Where's the fun in that?

189
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:24,333
Oh, it's fun, all right.
Your reactions are so... innocent.

190
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,458
Why are you doing this?

191
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,875
I already told you.

192
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,416
It's to entrust myself to you.
The Navi who's about to be born.

193
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,583
I'm examining your body.

194
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,166
Examining it?

195
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,958
Would you like to examine mine?

196
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:47,125
If you can move your arms, that is.

197
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:52,708
Don't look so scared!
This is our last night together.

198
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,041
Let's enjoy it.

199
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,000
Our last--

200
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,333
And that's why I'll be checking
that most sensitive part of you,

201
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,500
measuring what I've saved
for last all these nights,

202
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,791
with my mouth.

203
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,250
H-hey, whoa--wait!

204
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,000
Navi...

205
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,500
Ash! You up?

206
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,833
Ash?

207
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,291
Yeah, I'm up! I'll be right there!

208
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,000
Good morning, all!

209
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,666
Such lovely weather we're having...

210
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,833
But let's dispense with the pleasantries.

211
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,916
The Aries Dragonar Festival
is no ordinary race.

212
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,333
I'm counting on you again, Brigid.

213
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,333
The results of this traditional Ansullivan event

214
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,333
become public record for posterity.

215
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:55,750
Enter, and you must aim
for the center of the winner's podium.

216
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:59,750
But maybe winning alone
isn't motivation enough.

217
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:05,625
So to the winner I shall present
a ticket for one day-long date

218
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,583
with me, Rebecca Randall!

219
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,666
Is she serious?!

220
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,750
Hey, Ash, give Brigid back! I'm in!

221
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,500
Now, now...

222
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,041
Silence!

223
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,041
Now a word from the
competitors' representative,

224
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,666
first-year Senios student

225
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,250
Her Highness the Princess Silvia Lautreamont.

226
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,875
"One must do one's utmost,
no matter the contest."

227
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,125
So goes my family motto.

228
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,375
That's all.

229
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,000
What was that? Ugh, creepy!

230
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,833
She's getting carried away
just because she's royalty.

231
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,708
Like brother, like sister.

232
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,875
Oh, yeah--Julius the dragonslayer.

233
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,791
Didn't he get thrown in prison
for breaking the biggest taboo?

234
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,375
Not so loud!

235
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,458
What a rotten atmosphere.

236
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,958
Dredging up something
from over a decade ago...

237
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,583
She's suffering more than you'd think.

238
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,875
On your mark!

239
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,791
Go get 'em, Ash!

240
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,541
Here they come!

241
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,333
Go for it!

242
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,875
You can win this!

243
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,750
Bringing up the rear was a bad way to start...

244
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,333
Lancelot's already flown far ahead.

245
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,000
Is that...

246
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,208
...the princess and Lancelot?!

247
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,208
Those girls...

248
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,000
Hey, what <i>is</i> all this?

249
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,625
Let me be.

250
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,500
Blocking and team play
aren't against the rules.

251
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,166
Oh, is that so?

252
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,458
What are you doing?!

253
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:44,125
Sorry! It's a borrowed
dragon--kinda hard to control.

254
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,458
Hey, aren't you Ash Blake?

255
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,625
The problem child?

256
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,541
Stay away from us!

257
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,833
Get back!

258
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,166
That problem-child
reputation can come in handy!

259
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,541
Don't expect me to thank you.

260
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,041
Fine by me.

261
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,750
C'mon, Brigid!

262
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,166
I'm sorry, Brigid.

263
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,500
I shouldn't try to make an Earthia like you

264
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,208
keep up with a Maestro.

265
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,000
So much for my match against the princess.

266
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:46,208
Wonder why I don't feel so bad about losing?

267
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:52,250
Maybe because I had fun
back there, racing with her.

268
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,500
Is someone there?

269
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:02,666
Could be a dropout.
Wait here--I'll go take a look.

270
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,750
That's weird.

271
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,500
What the--

272
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,208
It's a Zepharos airship.

273
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,000
They used them in the last war.

274
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,916
Is that one of the
empire's mechanical weapons?

275
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,333
Are you an Imperial soldier?

276
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,000
Is that what you think?

277
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,041
Young man, how old are you?

278
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,958
Sixteen... but what of it?

279
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:03,291
How odd. To have an immature
dragon in you at that age...

280
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,541
How do you--

281
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,500
I can see it.

282
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,833
Thanks to the curse I bear, that is.

283
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,375
Curse...?

284
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,750
Get away from Master Milgauss!

285
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,916
What's going on?

286
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,750
What did I do?!

287
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,250
Your luck ran out when you met us!

288
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,041
This is insane!

289
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,291
That's war for you!

290
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,458
But there's a cease-fire!

291
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:43,541
The Empire and the Kingdom
are still fighting behind the scenes!

292
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,875
She could've killed me--why did she hesitate?

293
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,541
Let's go, Anya.

294
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,291
Yes.

295
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:37,333
A-Am I just going to die like this?

296
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,375
Could this be... my parr?

297
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:21,708
It's human... Not a dragon?

298
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:34,791
Why a human?
Although my starbrand <i>did</i> react...

299
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,125
For the Navi who's about to be born.

300
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,916
To... entrust her to you.

301
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:47,791
It can't be... No, this isn't Navi.
It looks like her, but... no.

302
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,250
This girl...

303
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,000
...is she my parr?

304
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,875
