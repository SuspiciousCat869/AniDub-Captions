00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,625
No!

2
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,541
This is--

3
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,541
It's too much...!

4
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,916
Why aren't you here for me?

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,583
Ash!

6
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:28,500
Let us end this once and for all,

7
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:31,791
daughter of Avalon...

8
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,291
A dream?

9
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,750
What are you doing up so early?

10
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:30,041
Uh... i-it's just... my bed--I...

11
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,833
You mean--

12
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,583
Fafnirite?

13
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,500
That dragon discharge?

14
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,958
Lemme see!

15
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,625
No way!

16
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,625
It's too embarrassing!

17
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,583
Embarrassing?

18
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,125
Well, obviously!

19
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,583
It's okay, I promise I won't laugh.

20
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,416
I accept you just the way you are.

21
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,083
Really?

22
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,083
Yep!

23
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,083
All right...

24
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,708
Huh?

25
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,875
You... you wet the bed?

26
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,416
What did you think?

27
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,708
I figured it'd be fafnirite.

28
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,000
That would be even <i>more</i> embarrassing!

29
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,375
Seriously?

30
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,666
In between the
Zepharos Empire to the north

31
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,916
and the Chevron Kingdom
to the south,

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,875
lies Lautreamont Knight Country.

33
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,041
Known as "the Dragon-Rearing Land,"

34
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:49,541
it boasts the largest dragon
population on the Arc Strada continent.

35
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:53,041
This small country with
fewer than five million citizens

36
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,041
is home to a unique school:

37
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,291
Ansullivan Dragonar Academy.

38
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,458
It aims to educate
and guide dragon masters

39
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,583
and the so-called Breeders,
young men and women

40
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,750
who have entered into bonds with dragons.

41

<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

42
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:18,708
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

43
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,041
<i>The "something" you and I have</i>

44
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,208

48
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:43,708
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

49
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:51,958
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

50
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,375
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

53

<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

64
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,125
Honestly!

65
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,125
Three employees just up
and quit, at a time like this?

66
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,416
This is our high season!

67
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
And all three quitting
to get married, too.

68
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,166
This is no laughing matter!

69
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,750
And the icing on the cake?

70
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,208
You should find yourself a man, too, miss!

71
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,375
The nerve!

72
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,416
Well, Princess Veronica
is single! And me?

73
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,583
My work is my life!

74
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,166
So, uh...

75
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,291
Oh, right, the interview!

76
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,166
Yes, yes, you're hired!

77
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,416
Thank you so much!
I'll do my very best in the kitchen!

78
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,625
In the kitchen?

79
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,416
It'd be a waste to
keep you behind the scenes.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,041
Pardon?

81
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,000
I need you to be front of the house!

82
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,250
Whaaat?!

83
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,916
Huh? Eco's taking the day off?

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,250
Yeah... she's pretty cranky.

85
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,708
We'll need a lot more dialogue
if we're gonna fix the rift

86
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,250
between human and dragonkind.

87
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,916
It's already Gemini.
Almost time for camp.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,458
Are they announcing the
attendees at today's assembly?

89
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,875
Most of the glorious Order of the
Sacred Dragonars of Lautreamont

90
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,541
went to this training camp.

91
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,416
It's like a gateway to the elite track.

92
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,208
Not that it has anything to do with us.

93
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,666
Yeah.

94
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,625
First-year Senios Jupito Dion!

95
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,541
Here!

96
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,208
First-year Senios Alis Vargan!

97
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,250
Here!

98
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,791
Please approach the stage.

99
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,958
And though she's absent today,
our final camp attendee is:

100
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:27,041
third-year Unios Lucca Saarinen.

101
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,416
Playing hooky <i>again</i> ?

102
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,041
I guess that's how
you get picked for camp!

103
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,166
What a crock!

104
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,250
Wow. Why all the backlash?

105
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,291
She hasn't been to class
for going on three months now.

106
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,250
Who is this--this Lucca, was it?

107
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,583
How do you not know her?
She's the student council secretary!

108
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,791
Maybe so, but I've never met her.

109
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,541
Lucca Saarinen. So talented,

110
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,541
she's the youngest person
ever to be chosen as a Dragonar.

111
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,458
She even beat Rebecca's record.

112
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,375
Rebecca?! That's amazing!

113
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,500
Silence!

114
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,041
These, then, are our
training camp attendees.

115
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,833
Like I said: nothing to do with us.

116
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,416
Yep.

117
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,125
And finally, we have a student
attending by special invitation.

118
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,250
Special invitation?

119
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,125
This year, we have created a new category

120
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,791
for those students not selected to attend.

121
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,250
Now for the head of the
selection committee, Rebecca.

122
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,625
Yes, sir.

123
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:35,125
I have chosen one student
to attend by special invitation:

124
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,625
first-year Senios Ash Blake.

125
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,708
Huh?

126
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,500
Why would you choose me?

127
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:56,458
The fact that you've
been given a unique parr in Eco.

128
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,833
That you've defeated Necromancia

129
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,375
and driven out Avdocha,
She Who Condemns.

130
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:07,125
You definitely have talent.

131
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,541
Huh...

132
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,041
But under the old selection criteria,

133
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,291
there's no way you'd've made the cut.

134
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,875
So I came up with a whole new category

135
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,166
just so you could
attend training camp.

136
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,250
All that, just for me?

137
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,125
Yes. Just for you.

138
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,000
I want to develop that talent of yours.

139
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,041
Can I expect great things from you?

140
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,041
Um...

141
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,291
Miss President!

142
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,250
Eavesdropping is most unbecoming.

143
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,083
Miss President! It's an emergency!

144
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,375
--A fire?
--Where?

145
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,250
Isn't that the Ecbladian's room?

146
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,333
A-A coffin?!

147
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,583
No way!

148
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,041
I-Is she dead?

149
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,125
Oh, no! What are we gonna do?
This is the worst!

150
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,375
What do we dooo?

151
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:38,916
So all that smoke was from the incense?

152
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,583
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused.

153
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,708
At least you're all right.

154
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,125
Just be careful not
to burn too much at once.

155
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,916
You're always right.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,458
So yes, I will be careful.

157
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,083
There's trouble,
and then there's <i>trouble</i> .

158
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,416
I mean, what's with the coffin?

159
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,791
It's not a coffin.

160
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,041
It's an Ecbladian bed.

161
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,625
A high-end bed you
can also use at your funeral.

162
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,000
So it <i>is</i> a coffin!

163
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,708
Lucca's sensitive.
Don't be too hard on her.

164
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:22,291
Lucca? So she's the Unios
that got picked for training camp?

165
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,208
This is the first time
you student council newbies

166
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,791
will have met her.

167
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:32,583
Lucca Saarinen is an Ecbladian,
a fairy of the forest.

168
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,916
Her people have a
knack for herbal medicine,

169
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,583
and their concoctions
are highly valued the world over.

170
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:43,166
The Ecbladians are also a warrior clan,

171
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,166
with many Dragonars among them.

172
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,916
Of course, Lucca's skill is no secret.

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,916
She's broken my record

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
to become the youngest Dragonar in history.

175
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,375
By the way, Lucca,
how are things with your parr Gawain?

176
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,041
Not good.

177
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,583
Any idea what could be causing it?

178
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,333
No.

179
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,875
It's not just that I can no longer ride him.

180
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,791
Gawain won't <i>let</i> me ride him.

181
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:24,708
So it's been three months
since Lucca last rode Gawain...

182
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,208
We can't do much to help if we don't know

183
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,416
why he won't let her ride.

184
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,166
I wouldn't be so sure.

185
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,875
The problem lies in an
interruption of the astral flow

186
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,541
that connects Lucca and Gawain.

187
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,750
If this goes on much longer,
Gawain's life will be in danger.

188
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,250
Ha haaa!

189
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,875
Smells like sunshine!

190
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,791
Let us end this once and for all,

191
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,625
daughter of Avalon...

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,708
Dragons draw lifeforce from
humans through the astral flow.

193
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:17,250
If that's been interrupted
for three months now...

194
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,291
"Dragonar Academy"

195
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,333
"Dragonar Academy"

196
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,958
I've been undercover in
the dining hall for two weeks.

197
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,375
I'm bound and determined to
do a thorough investigation

198
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,125
and figure out his weaknesses once and for all!

199
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,791
Just you wait!

200
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,333
Owie ow ow ow...

201
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,375
How did <i>that</i> happen?

202
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,750
Anya?

203
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,791
Coming!

204
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:25,791
Huh?

205
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,708
Your help is needed at the training camp?

206
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:32,291
And I can't very well close this place down...

207
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,291
Why don't you let me run it, then?

208
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,458
What?

209
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,500
Oh, pretty please?

210
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm coming in, Eco.

211
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,208
Wh-What was that for?

212
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,416
You're late!

213
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,833
Hey, slow down, huh?

214
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,708
What's wrong?

215
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,166
You all right?

216
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,041
Eco?

217
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,333
I had a scary dream.

218
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,333
You did?

219
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:27,500
And the bad guy in my dream...
he looked like Necromancia,

220
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,166
but it wasn't.

221
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,500
He had nine eyes, for one thing.

222
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,000
He was super-huge and totally bizarre...

223
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,500
Just this, like... absolute evil.

224
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,416
And though I shouldn't
have known this--this <i>thing</i> ,

225
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,916
it's like we'd met lots of
times before, way back when.

226
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,333
'Scuse me.

227
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,458
Wh-What?

228
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,000
What's going on?!

229
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:12,416
This is what we did when
I was little and too scared to sleep.

230
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,583
Ash...

231
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,416
And if we sleep together like this,

232
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,041
you probably won't
wet the bed again, either.

233
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:24,458
Do you seriously think I'd
commit such an indignity again?

234
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,916
N-No! I meant no offense, honestly!

235
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,625
Well, you better reel it in!

236
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:41,208
So does this mean you're feeling better?

237
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,666
Why are dragons seen in a different light?

238
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,958
--Why do we consider them sacred?
--The old Eco is back, I see.

239
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,333
--There are many reasons, to be sure,
--Yep, sleeping like a baby.

240
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,875
but chief among them is their capacity for magic...

241
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:03,958
So you fixed that human-dragon
rift you were talking about.

242
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,791
Trust me, we still have a long way to go.

243
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:08,708
Ow, my back...

244
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,958
A long way to go?

245
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,125
All those late-night "discussions"...!

246
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,666
Whatever you're picturing, it didn't happen.

247
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,458
I wonder what Eco's like at night...

248
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,666
Probably all "No, donnn't..."

249
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,208
Lucca?

250
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,708
Gawain...

251
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,291
Lucca...

252
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,583
Rebecca,

253
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,458
how can we get Lucca and
Gawain back the way they were?

254
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,458
Well, this is rather sudden.

255
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,375
I didn't see my
parr for the longest time...

256
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,125
...and then I met Eco.

257
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:29,250
I can relate to how Lucca must be feeling.

258
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,541
I can't just leave her like that.

259
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,875
I want to help her!

260
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,708
There <i>is</i> a way, but...

261
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,250
Please, tell me!

262
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,083
It could be very dangerous...

263
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,875
You must ride Gawain.

264
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,000
Huh?

265
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,416
When you rode Necromancia,

266
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,916
it looked like you
could sense his intentions.

267
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,375
Well... yes, vaguely...

268
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,875
I want you to try the
same thing with Gawain.

269
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,750
All right, I will.

270
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,083
But first...

271
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:12,083
Lucca, can you try
communicating with Gawain again?

272
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,583
Hmm... maybe not "communicate."

273
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,708
Try talking with Gawain again.

274
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,916
Is that better?

275
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,625
What are you mumbling about? Let's go!

276
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,875
I'm still psyching myself up!

277
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,291
Hey!

278
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,916
Stop that...

279
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,416
It'll melt...

280
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,458
Quit staring!

281
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,666
Lucca, we need to talk. It's serious.

282
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,375
How cute!

283
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,000
Those horns!

284
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,875
Gimme!

285
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,125
Please can I have them?

286
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,958
Of course you can't!

287
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,583
Then can I taste them?

288
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,833
No! Not the horns!

289
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,291
I belong to the p-proud dragon race!

290
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,875
Wh-What are you--

291
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,916
I'll c-crush--

292
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,458
N-No, please... please, stop!

293
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,875
Cut that out.

294
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,416
Well, I guess I'll go back to sleep.

295
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,458
Lucca, listen to me.

296
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,625
Rebecca's waiting at Dragon Pen 7.

297
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,250
What are you going to do to Gawain?

298
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,333
Don't worry, we're not doing anything.

299
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,166
This is for you and Gawain.

300
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,625
All right. I'll get ready.

301
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,041
Why are you undressing?!

302
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,583
I'm changing, to go meet Gawain.

303
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,583
I'm glad you came, Lucca.

304
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,291
Ash is about to ride Gawain.

305
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,250
That way, we can ask why he's rejecting you.

306
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,625
But first, could you try
talking with Gawain one more time?

307
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:27,083
That'd be the best way to solve this.

308
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,416
Gawain?

309
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,125
Did that do it?!

310
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,625
It's... it's not working.

311
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,000
Let's begin.

312
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,708
<i>Bujeta</i> , <i>hombrera</i> ,
<i>brazal</i> , <i>guarda</i> , <i>escarpe</i> !

313
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,708
<i>Espolazo</i> !

314
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:30,166
Ooh! Sir Silver Knight!

315
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,125
Just don't do anything rash.

316
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,583
I won't.

317
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,500
Thanks, Eco.

318
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:40,750
Save your words, thank
me with crepes!

319
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,250
We're counting on you, Ash.

320
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:58,333
Gawain... why are you rejecting Lucca?

321
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:02,000
Tell me how you feel!

322
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,000
Gawain?

323
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,500
Ash! Above you!

324
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,666
<i>Ash</i> !

325
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,625
<i>Ain't it su-su-su-su-super awesome?</i>
<i>Top-quality training in love</i>

326
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,750
<i>Makes me wanna</i>
<i>kiss-kiss-kiss-kiss ya, so watch close!</i>

327
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:44,958
<i>Joy! Joy! Joy! First-class, right? Bomb!</i>
<i>Bomb! Bon! Cute! Bon! Bon! Bonsoir?</i>

328
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:48,250
