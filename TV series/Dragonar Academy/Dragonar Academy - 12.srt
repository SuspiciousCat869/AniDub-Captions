1
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,625
You say Eco is in there?

2
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,541
Please, Princess, take me over there!

3
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,958
All right. Lancelot!

4
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,666
What's wrong? Why aren't we going?

5
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,833
It seems to me that Lancelot
is aware of something over there.

6
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,166
You can tell?

7
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,541
More or less.
I can sense Lancelot's will.

8
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,541
Are those all Maestros?

9
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:15,333
What in the world is about to happen?

10
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,291
Ash!

11
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,750
I knew it... No doubt about it.

12
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,625
I can tell.

13
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,625
That... is Eco!

14
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:04,416
<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

15
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,416
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

16
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,666
<i>The "something" you and I have</i>

17
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,791
<i>Starts with a tiny thrum</i>

18
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,750
<i>Now teach me about</i>
<i>the sky one more time</i>

19
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,500
"Dragonar Academy"

20
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:29,375
<i>The weight of flapping</i>
<i>wings that only a bird knows</i>

21
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:34,375
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

22
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:42,583
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

23
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,916
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,500
<i>But if your tears can be fewer</i>

25
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,875
<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

26
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,500
<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

27
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,875
<i>I'll embody any kind of hero for you</i>

28
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:59,416
<i>I'll never, never,</i>
<i>never, never let go</i>

29
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,458
<i>Even if I die,</i>
<i>I'll be your knight alone</i>

30
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,708
<i>But you cried for</i>
<i>real and got angry:</i>

31
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,916
<i>Saying "Don't be so cold to me"</i>

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,708
<i>I wipe your tears</i>

33
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,083
<i>Even without a sacred blade</i>

34
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,375
<i>I don't care if I'm not a hero</i>

35
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:27,541
<i>If I can protect you</i>
<i>with all I have</i>

36
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,958
"The Star-Branded Dragonar"

37
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,583
Who knew that the Maestros
would reject the control

38
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,375
of the head Dragonar?

39
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,458
It is utterly disgraceful.

40
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,041
If we were to be attacked
by the empire now,

41
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,041
Lautreamont Knight Country
would fall overnight.

42
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,833
However, securing the safety
of the guests comes first.

43
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:08,291
Oh, how can this be?! One of the
dragons the Knight Country keeps

44
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,041
is destroying my nation's airship!

45
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,291
This is a grave situation, is it not?!

46
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:18,291
Klaus Witershausen? Nobody asked him.

47
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,916
J-Just a moment! Our country
knows nothing of such a monster!

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,125
It is too late for that now.
When you say "dragon,"

49
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,875
you think Lautreamont Knight Country.

50
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,583
Giving me the runaround is most unseemly.

51
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,083
Y-You're wrong!

52
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,166
Hmm, apparently, that's all for that.

53
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,208
Quickly, you must evacuate!

54
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,916
Princess, you, too! Hurry!

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,916
I'm afraid I can't.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,500
We still have a guest here.

57
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,000
You are Milgauss,
the one who was in our report.

58
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:10,833
Indeed, you do look like Julius.
Take off your mask.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,166
Julius...

60
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,416
No.

61
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,041
Well, more precisely,
physically, I may be Julius,

62
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,291
but on the inside, I am not.

63
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,333
How do you mean?

64
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,208
I am Mordred.

65
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,916
Mordred?!

66
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,875
That's right.

67
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:40,875
I am the other mind that
dwells within Julius' parr, Mordred.

68
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,875
The true heir of the
dark kingdom of Nehalennia,

69
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:48,000
which has fought for many
years with the sacred empire of Avalon,

70
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,458
the two bloodlines of which split
from the wise dragon king Imbloc,

71
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,875
as recorded in the <i>Old Covenant</i> .

72
00:05:54,958 --> 00:06:00,000
Julius became aware of my existence,
and plotted my demise.

73
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,083
When I became aware of this,
I took on spectral form,

74
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,083
and possessed Julius instead.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,833
If I may ask, why must dragons
and humans enter into bonds?

76
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:16,333
It is to receive the
astral flow that comes about

77
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,583
when dragons and
humans are connected.

78
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,833
Correct. But if the astral
flow is all that is to be obtained,

79
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,708
there is a simpler way.

80
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,375
Humans can become livestock,
and we can prey on them!

81
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,166
That's why Julius would even
commit the taboo of dragonslaying--

82
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,666
to kill you!

83
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,333
I knew it!

84
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,458
I knew that Julius had not gone mad!

85
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,958
You were the cause of all of this!

86
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,125
Why, you...

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,125
How I have waited for this moment!

88
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,916
Descendants of the
wise dragon king Avalon!

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,083
I now take on this physical
body to fulfill my return!

90
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,875
I won't let you get away with it, Mordred!

91
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,541
Wh-What is this darkness?

92
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,333
You bastard...

93
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,916
Who do you think I am?

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,208
I am a royal Dragonar of
the house of Lautreamont!

95
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,083
Such humiliation is--

96
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:57,500
It's no use... if this keeps up, I'll break...

97
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,375
I'll--I'll be broken!

98
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,833
Veronica? Veronica!

99
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,125
You!

100
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:14,708
Hold on a second! It's me. It's Julius.

101
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,708
Julius? For real?

102
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:23,041
There's no time. Mordred's
soul has already possessed Eco.

103
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,875
Julius!

104
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,625
Glen...

105
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:34,041
There's so much I have to say to you,
but for now, let me say this--

106
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,291
I can guess what it is, but go ahead.

107
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,625
You big dumb idiot.

108
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,416
Eco!

109
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,458
What's wrong? She looks
like she's in pain over something.

110
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,875
Wh-What is happening to her? Is that...

111
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,375
I don't remember summoning
you here, dark king Mordred.

112
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,125
Navi... Thou may call thyself such,

113
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,750
but I know thou art not a simple "navigator."

114
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:33,625
Thou art, in very deed, the Dragweiss, yes?

115
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:38,500
Now, grant to me thy
great wisdom. If I join with thee,

116
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:42,125
I shall be completely reborn as the dark king.

117
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,958
Nope. I don't much
like Nehalennia, after all.

118
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,333
What?

119
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:51,333
I fully support the
princess and knight of Avalon.

120
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,250
Especially the knight.

121
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:57,708
I mean, Ash Blake is a
far better man than you are.

122
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:03,291
Hmm, you vixen.
In that case, I'll just take it by force!

123
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,416
Eco!

124
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,666
Wait, Ash!

125
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,583
I'm someone who can ride any dragon!
If I can just ride her...!

126
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:26,000
But how?!
Right now, even Lancelot is gone.

127
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:30,666
And are you sure you can ride
Eco in that form in the first place?

128
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,208
Silvia...

129
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,750
Milgauss!

130
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:42,708
Take it easy. He is no longer
the Milgauss that you knew.

131
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,708
You mean...?

132
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,666
M-My brother...?

133
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,875
Ash, the first thing we have to do

134
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,708
is get Mordred's mind
out of Eco's body.

135
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:11,666
You're the only one who
can save Eco. Understand me?

136
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,375
Yes.

137
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:34,333
As long as Navi resists him,
Mordred cannot be completely reborn.

138
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,666
This is our chance to get Eco back.

139
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,416
How do you know that?

140
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,083
Just as Mordred appears to have
gained knowledge from my memories,

141
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,458
I have also gained knowledge from Mordred.

142
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,166
I'm impressed that
you got Princess Veronica

143
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,791
to give up her ship so readily.

144
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,250
I had something up my sleeve.

145
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:03,125
I'm afraid this is where you all get off.
Ash and I will stay here.

146
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,375
What do you think you're doing?

147
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,750
Be a good girl and obey your brother.

148
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,916
Or would you prefer I end things right here,

149
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,500
in front of the people who adore you?

150
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,208
Telling them all about the goodies you have

151
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,083
stashed away in your room?

152
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,041
Portraits...

153
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,750
...worn clothing...

154
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,791
...a detailed growth record you add to daily...

155
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,250
...life-sized dolls...

156
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,666
...your original poems...

157
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,166
...and, courtesy of a device
"borrowed" from the Empire... this.

158
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:48,750
When he comes back, I'll kill him.

159
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,791
So don't be a stranger, Julius.

160
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,208
Do you read me, Ash?

161
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,541
Yes.

162
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,708
I'm moving the <i>Sylvanus</i>
directly over Mordred.

163
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,916
After that, pick your moment,
and swoop down.

164
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,416
Understood!

165
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,416
I thought Navi was
supposed to be resisting him!

166
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,333
I am!

167
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,625
What's that?!

168
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:50,166
Ash, the <i>Sylvanus</i>
can't hold out any longer.

169
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,958
If you're going to jump,
it's now or never!

170
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,916
Prince Julius...

171
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:28,208
Hang in there, Eco. I'll protect you.

172
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,666
Where is this place?

173
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,875
And what's the big idea,
locking a dragon like me up in a bird cage?

174
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,458
Even in this situation,
you won't be kept down, will you?

175
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,583
Navi, are you...

176
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,750
I've been playing around with Mordred.

177
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,916
His tentacle predilection
did cause me some annoyance.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,791
Mordred? Who's that?

179
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,625
Give me your hand.

180
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,916
I have given you a portion
of the information I possess.

181
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,375
I see, so this Mordred fellow
is trying to steal my body, is he?

182
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,625
That's correct.

183
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:33,000
It looks like he's up
to yet another crazy stunt.

184
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:33,916
Huh?

185
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,833
Why?

186
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,708
Why?

187
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,416
How come he's going to
those lengths... for my sake?

188
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,625
When doing this could get him killed?

189
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:08,000
When... When I've
been such a nuisance to him?

190
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,333
Why?!

191
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,541
That's obvious, isn't it?

192
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,541
When you think about who you are to him?

193
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,416
Tell me what I can do!

194
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,041
That's more like it.

195
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,750
Eco, what you can do
is dedicate an Arch to him,

196
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,708
as a princess of Avalon.

197
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,125
You don't stand a chance against Mordred

198
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,291
with the kind of knockoffs
you've made up to now.

199
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,125
But there's no time.

200
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,291
An Arch's strength is determined
by the strength of your feelings.

201
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,625
Even if you don't have a set design,

202
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,500
as long as you have feelings for him,

203
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,958
your Arch is sure to materialize.

204
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,583
But...

205
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,416
He is risking his life to try to save you.

206
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,541
What are you going
to do to respond to him?

207
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,125
Damn it, stop moving!

208
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,083
Lucca!

209
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,083
I noticed a change come over Gawain,

210
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:52,000
and came here, clinging
to his back. So did the others.

211
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,708
Hey, Ash!

212
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,750
I see you're creating a scene again.

213
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,958
Sir Ash!

214
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:08,125
I've come to help you, Sir Ash!

215
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,375
Guys...

216
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,750
Ash!

217
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,375
Princess! Lancelot!

218
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,291
We all know what's going on!

219
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:20,166
We're going to help get
you over to where that thing is!

220
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,500
Let's go!

221
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,041
Princess!

222
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,458
I can keep this up! Keep moving forward!

223
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:44,125
Manifest now...
O ye sure-striking magic spear...

224
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,000
Its name: Gáe Bulg!

225
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,708
Lucca, you're on!

226
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:01,625
Now!

227
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,625
Thank you, Lucca!

228
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,166
Ash!

229
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,333
Almete, gorjal, peto...

230
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,166
Where am I?

231
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,625
...espaldar, brafonera, faldaje...

232
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,750
Eco?

233
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,250
...guarda, greba, escarpel...

234
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,541
Eco...

235
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:49,208
Be sure to accept...
my feelings for you, okay?

236
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,625
Espolazo!

237
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:16,583
That is an original Arch that
Eco has produced all on her own.

238
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,583
It's still unfinished, so its
shape isn't quite established.

239
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,666
What are you spacing out for?!

240
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,583
Hurry up and break
out the unique enchantment!

241
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,750
Yeah! Thank you, Eco!

242
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,875
O ye steel to sunder all creation,

243
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:37,291
a holy sword worthy
of a knight among knights...

244
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,916
Its name: Excalibur!

245
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,333
Eco, I'm coming to save you right now!

246
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:56,916
I am your knight,
and you are my parr, after all!

247
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,250
Why, you... If you destroy this body,

248
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,875
the daughter of Avalon will also suffer!

249
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,250
I know her better than anyone!

250
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,500
The way she oversleeps, how she pigs out...

251
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,041
...and what her vulnerability is!

252
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,041
Halt! Who goes there?!

253
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:58,041
That scarf... Could she be... my...

254
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,083
Is that right?

255
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,833
Yes. He escaped from us.

256
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:12,208
I sensed Mordred's spectral form
flying off into the eastern skies.

257
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,708
I'm sorry.

258
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,625
Not at all. I have to say,
I'm surprised you're all right.

259
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,125
It was a close call.

260
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:21,541
After we left, the Continental
Congress was cancelled.

261
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,416
Everyone left in a panic, after all.

262
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,750
Including Klaus Witershausen.

263
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,375
I see.

264
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,791
In any case, I think this is a good start.

265
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,583
From here on, it's the domain of politics.

266
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:39,416
Well then, it's about time we were leaving.

267
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,708
Feel free to rest up
here until you've recovered.

268
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,750
We'll be waiting for you at school.

269
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,583
Right.

270
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,166
See you, Ash!

271
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,875
Get well soon!

272
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,625
Sir Ash, if you get lonely and
need someone to sit up with you--

273
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,250
That will probably have the opposite effect.

274
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,250
I'm sorry. This happened because of me.

275
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,625
It will grow back in soon enough.

276
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:24,875
Don't go selling a dragon's
recuperative ability short.

277
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,875
O-Okay.

278
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,250
Eco...

279
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:37,958
I am your knight. No matter
what happens, that will never change.

280
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,583
So I'd like to keep on...

281
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,208
No, I won't have it! No way!

282
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,625
Huh?

283
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:49,166
I mean, I'm glad and all,
but I want something more.

284
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,750
I want our relationship to be different.

285
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:56,583
I couldn't even find a name
for this feeling in the Dragweiss.

286
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,416
Do you know what it is?

287
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:16,500
In Lautreamont Knight Country,

288
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:21,125
boasting the largest dragon
population on the Arc Strada continent,

289
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:24,541
sits the Ansullivan Dragonar Academy.

290
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:28,000
Young men and women who
have entered into bonds with dragons

291
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,750
spend their time there
together with their dragons,

292
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:36,000
and then, when their
dragons grow to be Maestros,

293
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,583
they become known as "Dragonars."

294
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:43,916
"Dragonar Academy"

295
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,416
