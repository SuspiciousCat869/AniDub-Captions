1
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:46,333
That's Princess Veronica's
personal vehicle, the <i>Magiship Sylvanus</i> .

2
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,000
Princess Veronica has come into view!

3
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,666
So that's...

4
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,833
...Veronica Lautreamont, First Princess...

5
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:12,208
<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

6
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:17,166
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

7
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,500
<i>The "something" you and I have</i>

8
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,666
<i>Starts with a tiny thrum</i>

9
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,666
<i>Now teach me about</i>
<i>the sky one more time</i>

10
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,416
"Dragonar Academy"

11
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,125
<i>The weight of flapping</i>
<i>wings that only a bird knows</i>

12
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:42,166
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

13
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:50,416
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

14
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,833
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

15
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,291
<i>But if your tears can be fewer</i>

16
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,791
<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

17
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,333
<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

18
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,791
<i>I'll embody any kind of hero for you</i>

19
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:07,208
<i>I'll never, never,</i>
<i>never, never let go</i>

20
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:12,208
<i>Even if I die,</i>
<i>I'll be your knight alone</i>

21
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:16,541
<i>But you cried for</i>
<i>real and got angry:</i>

22
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,791
<i>Saying "Don't be so cold to me"</i>

23
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,541
<i>I wipe your tears</i>

24
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,041
<i>Even without a sacred blade</i>

25
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,083
<i>I don't care if I'm not a hero</i>

26
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:35,333
<i>If I can protect you with all I have</i>

27
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,958
"Ice Blue Princess"

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,291
There is loyalty in coming to greet me.

29
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,958
Is Silvia here?

30
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,125
Yes.

31
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,791
It's been a while, sister.

32
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,666
Four years, two months,
and thirteen days.

33
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,458
Indeed. I see you're well.

34
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,833
How I've looked
forward to this day.

35
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,208
Do you mean to deceive me?

36
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:29,041
That's the Veronica I know.
There's no fooling you, is there.

37
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,541
Cosette!

38
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,541
Out with it: Where is the real Silvia?

39
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,666
H-Here I am!

40
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,708
It's been too long.

41
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,416
Sist--

42
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,541
What is it, little sister?

43
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,666
Weak in the knees, I see.

44
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,333
N-No, I--

45
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,125
Such ineptitude you've put on display.

46
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,375
And you count yourself part
of the House of Lautreamont?

47
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,625
You disappoint me.

48
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,291
Time for your punishment, Silvia.

49
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,583
It seems you've only grown in
your breasts and your behind.

50
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:50,458
Will you be this ashamed on the battlefield?

51
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,291
That's you in a nutshell:

52
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,458
You act pretentious, but really,
you're nothing but a little girl.

53
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,625
Never mind your Dragonar ambition--

54
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,291
it's far more appropriate
for you to settle down!

55
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,458
Now just a moment!

56
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,083
Humiliating your own
family in the public eye--

57
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,291
is that any way
for knight royalty to act?!

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,500
Ash!

59
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,708
He is merely a student, Glen.

60
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,083
Hey, now!

61
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,416
Don't talk to my dog like--

62
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,083
Ah, I see. So you're Ash Blake.

63
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,000
That simplifies things.

64
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,250
Glen: seize him.

65
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,791
As you wish.

66
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,416
What's the big idea?!

67
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,291
Dammit! Put me down! Why, you...

68
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,916
The Tantalos clan was in the
midst of a horrible ethnic conflict.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,666
Because Master Milgauss put a stop
to it, we can live the way we do today.

70
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,541
And that's why I'd do anything--

71
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,208
Shamara! This is real bad!

72
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,791
How many times do I have to tell you?

73
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,750
I'm Anya now, head of the Tantalos!

74
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,500
Don't use my old name ever again!

75
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,083
I-I'm sorry, Anya... ma'am.

76
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,416
So what is it?

77
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,666
Well, uh...

78
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:12,958
The Iron Blood Valkyrie
has come to Ansullivan!

79
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,250
Once word got out,
everyone headed off into town,

80
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,041
bent on avenging their friends!

81
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,125
Rushing into the
fray with no battle plan?

82
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,833
I've got to stop them.

83
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,125
My goodness!

84
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,291
That suits you to a tee!

85
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,416
Er...

86
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,375
Why am I dressed like this again?

87
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,708
I have been charged with
providing you guidance, Master Ash.

88
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,000
My name is Primrose Shelley--

89
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,500
but please, if you would, just call me Prim!

90
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,083
O-Okay...

91
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,500
But, uh, what exactly
is going on here?

92
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,375
Princess Veronica's orders.

93
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,041
"Just a little diversion," she said.

94
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,375
Diversion?

95
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,416
Now off we go, Master Ash!

96
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,125
There's much work to be done!

97
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,166
P-Prim! Not that way!

98
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,375
Hmm?

99
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,083
Is... is she okay?

100
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,333
I'm beat.

101
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,333
And with all that,
Prim still handles her servant duties...

102
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,875
<i>The Heavenly Dragonar</i> ?

103
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,500
So this is where the
Silver Knight thing started.

104
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,083
Will you be this ashamed on the battlefield?

105
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,666
Eek!

106
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,041
P-Prim?!

107
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,625
I'm so sorry for kneading--

108
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,166
I-I mean, for reading
this book without asking!

109
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,458
I just... I'm sorry!

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,416
The Silver Knight is just the coolest!

111
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,083
Especially when he used ice magic
to freeze that mechanized dragon

112
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:08,166
and bring it to a stand-still!

113
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,333
An iced dragon, eh?

114
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,833
Oh, that's right!

115
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,000
The princess has returned,
and she's asking for you.

116
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:15,708
Eh?

117
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,625
What are you doing? Hurry up and get undressed!

118
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,916
But I'm a junior here! Can't I get a pass?

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,375
Why do I have to do this, anyway?

120
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,916
This is the undressing room.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,416
So clearly, this is where you get undressed!

122
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,708
Now come on, Ash!

123
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,208
That's not really the issue...

124
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,916
Veronica is waiting!

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,083
I see I'll have to resort to
my special undressing technique.

126
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,750
Hi-yah!

127
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,041
P-Prim!

128
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,250
Undressed the wrong person!

129
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,750
Argh! Stay out of this, Prim!

130
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,083
Hey, er...

131
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:03,041
This <i>is</i> per the princess's command, Ash.

132
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,500
Wait!

133
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,208
I need more time to prepare...
mentally <i>and</i> physically!

134
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,791
There's no use arguing.

135
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,375
Shall we, Professor?

136
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:17,375
When else would I have the chance
to soak in the Sylvanus bath?

137
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,666
S-Stop...!

138
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:30,250
You two were affected
by Necromancia's attack.

139
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,791
What's your take?

140
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,666
It seems to me the
perpetrator has Imperial ties.

141
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,041
Necromancia is a fusion of
magic and engineering,

142
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,125
a product of scientific study.

143
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,375
Engineering? That's Zepharos's forte.

144
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,333
But without any definite proof...

145
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,458
Um...

146
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,500
Why might I be here in the bath with you?

147
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,875
What's wrong?

148
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,958
Does bathing with us
displease you in some way?

149
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,875
I-It's not that...

150
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,916
This bath smells great!

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,041
Kinda makes me feel all soft an' fluffy...

152
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,083
I thought I'd try
anthar-scented bath salts today!

153
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,625
Aaack! Eco!

154
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,083
Who'd think a couple of scrubs like you

155
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,416
could be the heroes
who defeated Necromancia?

156
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,750
So this is the young dragon Eco,
who threw together Arch

157
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,958
from whatever she could find.

158
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,125
And Ash Blake,
who can ride any dragon around.

159
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,500
Princess?

160
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,458
Her Highness the Fourth
Princess is here to see you.

161
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,916
Begging your pardon... sister.

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,291
P-Princess?!

163
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,458
Ash?! A-And Rebecca?!

164
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,458
Oh, Ash! Fancy seeing you here!

165
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,208
Is that you, Cosette?

166
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,333
Hi, sis!

167
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,458
Sis?

168
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,166
As it happens, Silvia,

169
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,875
I come bearing a marriage proposal.

170
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,458
Ever since the rightful heir,
our brother Julius,

171
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,166
was executed for
the crime of dragon-killing,

172
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,500
the future of our royal line
has remained uncertain.

173
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,458
You're already sixteen.

174
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,375
Bear a healthy child now,
while you're still young.

175
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,000
We can't let our bloodline
end here, now can we?

176
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,458
B-But--

177
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,791
Aren't you the first princess, Veronica?

178
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,833
The only affairs
that interest me are military.

179
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,333
Honestly... If only Julius were still here,

180
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,250
instead of losing his life to a foolish trifle.

181
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,291
I-I'm sure our brother had his reasons.

182
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,000
The way you talk...

183
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,500
You always did have a soft spot for Julius.

184
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,041
Good news, then:

185
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,958
Your marriage prospect
was a friend of his.

186
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,916
You don't mean...

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,125
That's right. One of
my knights, Glen McGuire.

188
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,500
You were equally attached
to them both, once upon a time.

189
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,041
I'm sure you'll be satisfied.

190
00:11:54,125 --> 00:12:00,125
B-But my dream is to become
an Archdragonar with Lancelot.

191
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:04,000
To get married a-and have
children before that happens...?

192
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,666
Considering your poor
showing during this last attack,

193
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,375
it's an interesting ambition, indeed.

194
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,791
It wasn't like that at all!

195
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:18,583
If she hadn't sent Lancelot forth,
I could never have ridden Necromancia!

196
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:24,000
In other words, Silvia served
as little more than a courier.

197
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,250
No!

198
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,791
It only matters if she gets results.

199
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,375
Silvia.

200
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,166
With your dreams and ambitions,
you're all talk and no action.

201
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,125
Are you kidding me?

202
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,291
The princess can be
honest to a fault sometimes.

203
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,125
But she <i>always</i> does
the absolute best she can do!

204
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:45,166
You haven't even
seen what she's capable of!

205
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,958
Well, then...

206
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:59,791
As it happens, there'll be
a match in my honor tomorrow.

207
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:04,333
Prove to me the
value of your little dream.

208
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,000
I will.

209
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,000
"Dragonar Academy"

210
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:19,000
"Dragonar Academy"

211
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:33,708
Phooey! I wanted to play, too!

212
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:38,500
You mean you want to be
out there with those dragons?

213
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,625
Why did I have to be
born looking like this, anyway?

214
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,458
Dragons are an
extremely intelligent species.

215
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:51,500
There must be a reason
you were given human form.

216
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,000
You'll understand some day.

217
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,750
A-Amazing!

218
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,375
Princess!

219
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,583
Hey!

220
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,708
My room...?

221
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,000
Are you all right, Princess?

222
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,208
Wh-What are you doing here?

223
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,916
Ash carried you here.

224
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,583
He... he did?

225
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,375
I was worried about you.

226
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,541
Lancelot's one great dragon,

227
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,125
but even he can't take a head-on collision

228
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,750
with the Academy's toughest, Cu Chulainn.

229
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,416
I had to show her.

230
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,500
To show my sister how
I fight as a real live Dragonar.

231
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:44,208
But now, even as Lancelot's master, I'm a failure.

232
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,333
No need to beat yourself up about it.

233
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:52,291
Silence! I <i>knew</i> Lancelot
should have been his--

234
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,916
Silvia, it's me.

235
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,875
Rebecca? Come in.

236
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,541
Pardon me. I need to speak with Ash.

237
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,750
And... I've brought a guest.

238
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:13,333
I've come to ask after
your condition, Princess Silvia.

239
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,625
I see. My apologies.

240
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,166
No--on Princess Veronica's orders.

241
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,041
As you can see, it's nothing serious.

242
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,708
I understand.

243
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,458
I also bring with me a message
from Princess Veronica.

244
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,916
Which is?

245
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,791
The princess will be touring
the town at noon tomorrow.

246
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,125
At which time...

247
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:41,708
I know: Don't make a
scene as her escort, right?

248
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:46,250
No. It will not be necessary
to accompany her.

249
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,500
What?

250
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,958
She commands you
to visit St. Valeria tomorrow,

251
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,166
where you shall
offer prayers of repentance.

252
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,291
Repentance?!

253
00:16:55,375 --> 00:17:01,208
The princess is in high dudgeon
over your lack of ability.

254
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,333
Your simple tactics mistake
recklessness for bravery,

255
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,750
revealing how
shallow your dream really is.

256
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,458
And when you go to pray,
bring no servants with you.

257
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,500
You must do your
soul-searching alone.

258
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,541
So says the princess.

259
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,208
If you'll excuse me.

260
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,708
Wait, Glen.

261
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,958
Did... did my sister tell you
about the marriage proposal?

262
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,333
Yes.

263
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:35,375
Would you really be
willing to take me as your wife?

264
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:39,000
If Princess Veronica commands it.

265
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,708
I see.

266
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,125
That's all. Go.

267
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,666
Hey, what's with the attitude?

268
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,708
Ash!

269
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,208
Getting married is a lifelong deal

270
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,708
and you'll do it at a single command?

271
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,958
My mistress's word is law.

272
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:59,583
And if she told you to drop dead,
you would, no questions asked?

273
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,333
Of course.

274
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:05,833
You're a puppet!
Have you no will of your own?

275
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,291
Ash Blake, was it?

276
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,750
Perhaps you are riding
high after saving the town.

277
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:15,583
I applaud your
luck and skill. However...

278
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,208
Be mindful of your place.

279
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,208
Geez! What's with
that coldhearted creep?

280
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,583
He wasn't always like that.

281
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,083
But ten years ago,

282
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,333
when my brother
was executed for dragon-killing,

283
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,958
he grew despondent,
and became a whole other person.

284
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,666
My sister proved to be his salvation.

285
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:44,958
She's of high enough caliber
to tolerate a knight like Glen.

286
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,750
Princess...

287
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,791
Ash, I've got a message for you:

288
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,750
The student council is
meeting tomorrow morning

289
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,625
about the royal tour.

290
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,708
Don't be late.

291
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,958
B-But what about me?

292
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:01,416
We can't give you student
council work like this.

293
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,041
But--

294
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:07,041
If you don't like it, you'll have
to surpass Princess Veronica.

295
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,833
Surpass my sister...?

296
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,125
Excuse me!

297
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,541
Eco? What's going on?

298
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,583
You're laaate!

299
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,208
It's no use...

300
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,833
My body's so hot... I can't take it...

301
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,125
Is that <i>anthar</i> I smell?!

302
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,541
Hang on--what've you got in there?

303
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,666
In there?

304
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,166
You mean... in here?

305
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,166
<i>No</i> ! Not your skirt! Your <i>mouth</i> !

306
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:54,375
Candy? So that's the culprit! Spit it out!

307
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,750
Did you just--

308
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:07,458
A rather unhealthy
relationship you have there, no?

309
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,791
Though it made for a pretty good show.

310
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,083
Those <i>are</i> my underthings she's wearing.

311
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,500
And did you give her this candy?

312
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,666
She gets that pleading look
in her eyes--I just can't say no.

313
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,708
Now come on in.

314
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,916
Rebecca...

315
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,041
Our vice president and
secretary are absent today.

316
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,250
It's a little lonely here with just us three,

317
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,500
but let's get this meeting underway.

318
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,458
We will be accompanying Princess Veronica

319
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,041
on her tour through town.

320
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,625
However, intel indicates that this individual

321
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,458
may have infiltrated Ansullivan.

322
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:48,541
Five years ago,
this former mountain guerilla terrorist

323
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,000
attempted to
assassinate Princess Veronica.

324
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,041
She's been undercover ever since.

325
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,833
Avdocha, She Who Condemns.

326
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,708
Oh, Princess Veronica!

327
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:09,083
How nice of you to come all this way!

328
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,916
Do not slow your hand! Keep working!

329
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,208
Yes, Your Highness!

330
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,791
To think any one
of them could be a terrorist...

331
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,583
Your nerves are showing, Ash.

332
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,875
But...

333
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,458
My favorite crepe shop!

334
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,791
Hey, Eco, I might wind up
needing that Arch again, okay?

335
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,958
Hmph! You can have
that patchwork pile of parts!

336
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,583
Just... as soon
as that place is rebuilt...

337
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:41,208
Yeah, sure. I'll buy you
as many crepes as you want.

338
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,833
You will? Deal!

339
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,791
I hope the princess is okay.

340
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,833
O St. Valeria...

341
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,791
I pray before you with purest heart,

342
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,458
in punishment for my own arrogance.

343
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,708
Forgive me my imprudent behavior.

344
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,000
O St. Valeria...

345
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:13,458
May the Silver Knight impregnate me!

346
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,833
What kind of prayer is <i>that</i> ,
Jessica Valentine?!

347
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,958
Oh, Princess Silvia!

348
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,541
What do you mean, "oh"?

349
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,083
How dare you talk about...
g-getting impregnated

350
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,708
in such a holy place!

351
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,416
Whatever do you mean?

352
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,208
I'm simply praying for a safe pregnancy!

353
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,333
St. Valeria is the patron of the law!

354
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,833
You're saying the wrong prayers!

355
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:38,333
Nobles don't concern
ourselves with such trivialities.

356
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,625
Surely our dear
saint is generous of heart.

357
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,250
What a convenient excuse.

358
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:46,291
With nobility comes great capacity.

359
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,708
Why, that's true of
Princess Veronica, is it not?

360
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,833
What?

361
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,833
Though I suppose a fourth princess

362
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,333
wouldn't be nearly
as capable as her older sister.

363
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,708
Now you listen here!

364
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:16,833
St. Valeria once said,
"Love the sinner, hate the sin."

365
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,291
What imbecility!

366
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,875
Indeed, the foolish heart is
the very root of all evil!

367
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,541
Death to all sinners!

368
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:29,666
I am Avdocha, She Who Condemns!

369

I hear you're a complete pervert, Ash Blake.

389
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,416
There's some real
misinformation going around!

390
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,083
And that you really love
it when a princess berates you.

391
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,833
Oh, so it keeps getting better!
