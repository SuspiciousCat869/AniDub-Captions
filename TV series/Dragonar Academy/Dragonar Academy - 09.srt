1
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:51,291
You've made it through
five days of intense training!

2
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,958
Be proud of yourselves--
you are mighty indeed!

3
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,833
And as a small gesture in recognition

4
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,083
of both your growth and the end of camp,

5
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,166
I would like to welcome
you all to our wrap party.

6
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,833
Now go on--enjoy yourselves!

7
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,083
--Cheers!
--Cheers!

8
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,958
Are you all right, Ash?

9
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:29,375
Yeah, I'm fine. That healing
magic really did the trick.

10
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:34,166
I bet they saw right through that one.

11
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,208
Still...

12
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,708
Gawain--he's--

13
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,625
Gawain is gone?

14
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,750
But where could he be?

15
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,458
I don't know...

16
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,750
With our astral flow interrupted...

17
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,375
The Willingham Mausoleum.

18
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,875
Have you heard the fairy tale
about the Willingham Mausoleum?

19
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,583
Well, I... I've heard <i>of</i> it...

20
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:09,375
It's about the young Maestro Nuada
and his young master girl.

21
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:14,166
Pained at seeing his master
suffering from a grave illness,

22
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,250
Nuada closed off their
astral flow and vanished.

23
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:26,125
He didn't want her to
see him waste away and perish.

24
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,375
At long last, the girl recovered.

25
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,625
But only after Nuada
had quietly breathed his last

26
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:39,791
inside the Willingham Mausoleum... alone.

27
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,916
You don't think Gawain's
planning to pull a Nuada?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,083
It's possible.

29
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:52,625
The mausoleum is a
resting place for young dragons...

30
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,708
...and Gawain is still a juvenile...

31
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:59,166
All right. We call off the wrap
party and organize a search party.

32
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,166
If we all scour the area
around Willingham Mausoleum...

33
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,500
Wait.

34
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,458
The camp was pretty grueling, right?

35
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,500
Everyone's been
looking forward to this party.

36
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,291
Okay. Just the student
council members, then.

37
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,000
No, that won't work, either.

38
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,583
If the whole student
council goes missing,

39
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,083
everyone'll know something's up.

40
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,291
So much for the celebration.

41
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,291
Then...

42
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,000
It's all right.

43
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,250
I'll handle this.

44
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,500
And you can bet I'll find you, too,

45
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,000
Gawain!

46
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:48,208
Hmph. The princess approaches.

47
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:55,166
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

48
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,875
Come forth, promised
child of magica-technica!

49
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:07,208
<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

50
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:12,166
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

<i>The weight of flapping</i>

56
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,166
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

57
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:45,416
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

58
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,833
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

59

<i>But if your tears can be fewer</i>

60
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,791
<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

61
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,333
<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

62
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,791
<i>I'll embody any kind of hero for you</i>

So Gawain's in there?

73
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:47,583
Hard to say. But we've received intel

74
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,375
that Professor Angela is holed up inside.

75
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,000
What's <i>she</i> doing here?

76
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,333
Wh-What the--

77
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,375
Look!

78
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:13,250
It's just like before--this
sense of foreboding...

79
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,791
I'm sure of it!

80
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,125
Look at that!

81
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,875
What <i>are</i> they?

82
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,250
They're in the lake, too!

83
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,666
And in the forest!

84
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,375
That's...

85
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,583
Stop!

86
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,000
This is highly indecent!

87
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,625
Nooo!

88
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,875
Princess!

89
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,791
Princess! Are you all right?

90
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,166
Yeah...

91
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,083
What about me, Ash?
I was pretty scared, you know!

92
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,208
Necromancia--at
the training camp!

93
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,541
All we can do is
trust the camp director.

94
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,666
Saddle up.
We're storming the mausoleum!

95

Troops, in formation!

96
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,625
Time to show off
the fruit of your training!

97
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,041
Here we go.

98
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,000
Commence counterattack!

99
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,958
They just keep coming--no end in sight!

100

Eco?

101
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,916
Bring out my Arch.
I can't help anyone like this.

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,875
What are you, stupid?

103
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,583
Even a fake suit of
Arch would put too much strain

104
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,958
on someone as wounded as you!

105
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,166
You're just going
to have to grin and bear it!

106
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,166
Couldn't you make me
something more lightweight?

107
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,541
Whaaat?

108
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:28,166
I bet you can make me
exactly the Arch I need now.

109
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,833
Why are <i>you</i> so confident?

110
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,791
Isn't it obvious? I have you for a parr.

111
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,416
Oh, all right.

112
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:46,833
But while I'm at the Workshop,
my spirit will be far from my body...

113
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:51,291
I know. I'll keep your body safe.

114
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,333
How's this?

115
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:58,666
M-Make sure you
hold me up properly, or else...

116

Gawain...

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,041
What is it, Lancelot?

118
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,208
We meet again, boy.

119
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,750
Milgauss!

120
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,666
Now hear this, Milgauss!

121
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,041
In the name of the
knight family of Lautreamont,

122
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,000
I shall rain down
divine retribution upon you!

123
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,791
What's so funny?!

124
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,000
To think: It wasn't one
of the greatest warriors alive,

125
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,333
Veronica Lautreamont,

126
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,333
but <i>you</i> , so cowardly and needy,

127
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,750
who made a pact with
a dragon in the Orphan's Rite.

128
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,125
What...?

129
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,250
My, how you've grown... Silvie.

130

Hey! There you are!

131
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:10,750
C'mon, big bro! Why are
you always talking with Glen?

132
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,750
You mean in that knightly family...

133
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,500
...is one who would
commit the greatest taboo?

134

Lancelot has a
lot of fight in him, I see.

137
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,625
Or are you using some kind of
esoteric trick again, boy?

138
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,291
What?!

139
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,791
Though the Imperial Princess
of Avalon can't do much in that state.

140
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,708
Avalon...
What do you know about that?!

141
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,750

here is no mere juvenile.

You Knight Country people
are familiar with it, I believe?

144
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:03,000
The sad tale of the dragon who
loved his master so much, he chose death?

145
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:07,291
That's right... his name was Nuada:

146

"Dragonar Academy"

149
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:30,708
I see. You want to make some Arch,
but you don't have time,

150
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,291
so you want to sample my work...

151
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,750
...and remix it.

152
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:41,416
Yep. Much as I hate to admit it,
you <i>do</i> seem to know more than me.

153
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,416
Sure. You and I are
two sides of the same coin.

154
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,833
I don't mind helping. However...

155
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,291
You must promise me one thing.

156
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,708
What?

157
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,541
That one day,
you'll present the finest original Arch

158

to Ash Blake.

159

Y-You mean...

161
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,291
Yes: for dragonkind, it's like saying,

162
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,375
"I offer myself to you, body and soul."

163
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,333
B-B-B-But I--

164
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,916
You can't?

165
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,458
Fine. I promise.

166
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:32,291
Almete, gorjal, peto,
espaldar, brafonera, falda...

167
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,041
What is it?

168
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,208
He's got himself into
a pretty sticky situation.

169
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,208
Can you hurry it up?

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,875
I suppose I'd better.

171
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,166
Why, you...

172
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,291
Let me go! N-No--stop!

173
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,041
S-Stop that...

174
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:18,583
No, don't! N-Not there!

175
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,000
What are you doing?!

176
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,083
I am of the house of Valentine! I--

177
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:28,000
No! Stop that! Not even Sir Ash has--

178
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,333
Thanks for that, Rhiannon!

179
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:54,750
They're not letting up.
We've got to break through somehow...

180
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,833
There's <i>more</i> ?

181
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,750
Princess!

182
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:11,250
Stay your hand!
I shall pacify Nuada's spirit!

183
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:15,416
No! Don't touch me there!

184
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,250
No--stop--

185
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,291
Nooo!

186
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,791
Lucca!

187
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,958
Eco!

188
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,708
Eco...

189
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,125
Eco...

190
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,583
Eco...

191
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,333
<i>Ecooo</i> !

192
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,208
Wh-What the--?!

193
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,458
What's going on here?

194
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,416
Eco!

195
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:11,291
Honestly! Whatever
would you do without me?

196
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,125
Espolazo!

197
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:25,000
Is this... Arch light?

198
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,125
That's the daughter of Avalon for you.

199
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,708
Are you sure you
don't want to take on Nuada?

200
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,625
The princess said to stay out of it.

201
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,958
Calm thyself, Nuada!

202
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,750
So you're not the real thing after all.

203
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,416
Ash!

204
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,041
That Arch is made for defense,
so lay off the kicking and punching!

205
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,166
Hurry up and make with the magic!

206
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,666
Got it!

207
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,916
Manifest now...
O ye impregnable shield...

208
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,541
Its name: Aegis!

209
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,208
Go!

210
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,750
Petrification magic!

211
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,916
I was sure that had been
outlawed in Knight Country...

212
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,458
Well? Come on, then, boy!

213
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,500
Then I guess I'll have to come to you!

214
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,791
Milgauss!

215
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,875
Ash Blake!

216
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,208
Stop right there!

217
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,916
Nuada's spirit
has returned to the heavens!

218
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,041
Accept your fate!

219
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,333
Surprised?

220
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,625
The left one was false all along.

221
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:36,875
It seems I must revise
my opinion of the fourth princess...

222
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,583
Wait!

223
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,333
Look at them all...

224
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,833
Lancelot!

225
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,958
Dammit...

226
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,041
We're in no position
to go help them, either.

227
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,291
Lucca?

228
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,041
Lancelot and Silvia...

229
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:16,500
...and you and Eco--
you all fought so hard.

230
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:22,083
Who alone among us didn't?

231
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,000
Ash!

232
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,375
Lucca?!

233
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:40,000
You risked your life
for me and for Gawain.

234
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:44,875
When I'm with you,
I feel like I can give it my all.

235
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:49,791
I want to help them.
No--I <i>will</i> help them.

236
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,375
You can do it. I'm with you.

237
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,500
I'm sorry, Gawain...

238
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,166
I won't be afraid of you anymore.

239
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,750
So please... take me back, Gawain!

240
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,041
Here, Gawain, have some.

241
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,250
Tap into my astral flow.

242
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,916
Drink me in...

243
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
After all...

244
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,458
...you're...

245
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,333
...you're my parr!

246
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,458
Caring for the injured
is our top priority!

247
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,333
We need tight coordination--don't
rush out into the fray!

248
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,625
There are just too many of them.

249
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,375
I think we might be done for...

250
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,625
Wh-What's that?!

251
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,583
Not another Necromancia!

252
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,250
No, not this one.

253
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,833
That's--

254
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,750
Lucca!

255
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:01,416
Grab on tight so you won't get flung off.

256
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,583
He's so fast!

257
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,791
You can do it, Lucca. I'm with you.

258
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:56,458
Dragon Dance, First Movement:

259
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,250
Cleansing Amrita!

260
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,375
The Necromancia! They're--

261
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,291
They're fading away!

262
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,166
Lucca...

263
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,708
Lucca!

264
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:39,666
You finally pulled it off, Lucca.

265
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,291
Since ancient times,
the Ecbladian Dragonars

266
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:48,958
have been known as "elfin dancers"...

267
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,083
...and now Lucca's shown us why.

268
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,250
I see.

269
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,875
But now we know the
extent of their military power.

270
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:12,541
With this single incident,
we alone have the technique

271
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,541
for calling Necromancia back.

272
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,250
So it's not a total loss, then.

273
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,375
I shall crush them both--

274
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,541
Lautreamont Knight Country
<i>and</i> the Chevron Kingdom.

275
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,958
My ambition demands it.

276
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,541
Just wait until the Continental Congress.

277
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,625
Cheers!

278
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,875
Congrats on leaving the hospital, Ash!

279
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,000
Thanks!

280
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,416
All student council
members are safe and sound,

281
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,958
and Professor Angela was
found in the mausoleum, unhurt.

282
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,166
So all's well that ends well.

283
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,125

What's it say?

288
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:13,833
He wants me to attend Elysion,
the Continental Congress.

289
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,458
He does?

290
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:21,500
And... he'd like to meet you and Eco.
I'm to bring you with me.

291
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,541
You are?
