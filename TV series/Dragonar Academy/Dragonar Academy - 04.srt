1
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,625
Lancelot!

2
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:07,083
You can't go see the
Mother Dragon with your leg like that.

3
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,958
Better just give up.

4
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,666
As if I'd ever do that!

5
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,791
I <i>need</i> a parr!

6
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,291
I didn't come all
this way to turn back now!

7
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:24,458
I understand. So you need a parr, huh?

8
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,166
Then there's only one solution:

9
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,666
I'll carry you, and we can
look for the Mother Dragon together!

10
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:41,750
That was right after my seventh birthday,

11
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:46,916
the time of the Orphan's Rite,
when the Mother Dragon

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,625
gifted humans with baby dragons.

13
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,000
I wonder what that boy's up to now?

14
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,750
A... A dragon?

15
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,708
This looks like...

16
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,583
I can't remember.

17
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,833
In between the
Zepharos Empire to the north

18
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,083
and the Chevron Kingdom to the south,

19
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,041
lies Lautreamont Knight Country.

20
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,166
Known as "the Dragon-Rearing Land,"

21
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,666
it boasts the largest dragon population
on the Arc Strada continent.

22
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,166
This small country with
fewer than five million citizens

23
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,166
is home to a unique school:

24
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,416
Ansullivan Dragonar Academy.

25
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,541
It aims to educate
and guide dragon masters

26
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,708
and the so-called Breeders,
young men and women

27
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,958
who have entered into bonds with dragons.

28
00:02:56,166 --> 00:03:01,041
<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

29
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:06,041
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

30
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:10,500
<i>The "something" you and I have</i>

31
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,625
<i>Starts with a tiny thrum</i>

<i>Now teach me about</i>

00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,125
"Dragonar Academy"

34
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:25,958
<i>The weight of flapping</i>
<i>wings that only a bird knows</i>

35
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:30,958
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

36
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:39,208
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

37
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,708
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

38
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,125
<i>But if your tears can be fewer</i>

39
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,750
<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

40
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,166
<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

41
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,750
<i>I'll embody any kind of hero for you</i>

42
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:56,041
<i>I'll never, never,</i>
<i>never, never let go</i>

43
00:03:56,125 --> 00:04:01,041
<i>Even if I die,</i>
<i>I'll be your knight alone</i>

44
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:05,500
<i>But you cried for</i>
<i>real and got angry:</i>

45
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,750
<i>Saying "Don't be so cold to me"</i>

46
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,500
<i>I wipe your tears</i>

47
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,875
<i>Even without a sacred blade</i>

48
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,958
<i>I don't care if I'm not a hero</i>

49
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:24,166

"Iron Blood Valkyrie"

51
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,750
Today we welcome three new
members to the student council

52
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,458
of Ansullivan Dragonar Academy.

53
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,625
Allow me to introduce them to you.

54
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,958
First, in charge of public morals:
Silvia Lautreamont!

55
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,250
Thank you.

56
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,708
I am Silvia Lautreamont,
public morals officer.

57
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,250
As a novice, I'm sure
I have my share of flaws,

58
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,041
but I shall endeavor
to do my utmost.

59
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,708
I look forward to my service.

60
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:17,958
Next, our number-one problem child,
in charge of general affairs:

61
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,166
Ash Blake!

62
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,916
Ash Blake, general affairs.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,666
To be honest, I'm still not
sure what I can bring to the table...

64
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:49,750
...b-but I'll do my best regardless!
Thanks in advance!

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,583
You can do it, Ash!

66
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,208
Go get 'em!

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,791
And finally, a familiar face to you all,

68
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,875
Ash Blake's parr:

69
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:13,708
the humanoid dragon Eco!

70
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:18,791
Let's give a warm welcome to
our new school mascot!

71
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,166
Say hello, Eco!

72
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,416
Rawr!

73
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,916
Wh-What's all this?

74
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,250
How irritating!

75
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:12,083
Making a laughingstock out of
the proud dragon race is a grave sin!

76
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,666
Stupid dummy dum-dum humans!

77
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,333
Cosette was being
thoughtful, in her way.

78
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,791
Besides, no one was
making fun of you--trust me.

79
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,250
Huh?

80
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:27,041
They saw how interesting
you are and felt a bond with you.

81
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,250
Is that a good thing?

82
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,458
Sure it is! It means
everyone wants to be your friend.

83
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:38,791
Hmm... Then I'd be happy
to make them all my servants!

84
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,166
Now listen here...

85
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:46,708
So...

86
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,708
...this is your first job
as student council member?

87
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,375
Yeah--take down anything posted
without permission.

88
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,333
Just remember who your master is.

89
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,625
Don't go letting anyone else
boss you around, you hear me?!

90
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,750
Actually, I'm <i>your</i> master.

91
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,916
"Silver Knight Fan Club"?

92
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,833
Who's this Silver Knight, anyway?

93
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:17,125
It's the hero from this popular novel,
<i>The Heavenly Dragonar</i> .

94
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,666
They say he got his name because
he resembled the Archdragonar

95
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,208
who saved the town from Necromancia.

96
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,416
So wait--is this <i>your</i> fan club?

97
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,916
I guess you could say that.

98
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,541
Watch where you're aiming!

99
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,708
I'm runnin' out of ammo!

100
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,875
It's her!

101
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,333
The Iron Blood Valkyrie!

102
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,666
Fire!

103
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,708
Little embers like you,

104
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,250
if left to burn,

105
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,916
can grow to engulf an entire nation!

106
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,375
Study hall, huh?

107
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,958
Hey, Eco!

108
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,083
You looked so adorable in that dress!

109
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,750
Say, Ash, wanna swap--

110
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,166
He had that coming.

111
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:49,208
Hello! I'm first-year
Senios Jessica Valentine,

112
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:53,958
president of the Silver Knight
Fan Club, or SKFC for short!

113
00:09:54,041 --> 00:10:00,541
And I'm the SKFC vice-president,
first-year Unios Lynette Worth!

114
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:06,250
We have not met the Silver Knight,
the object of our admiration.

115
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,291
Therefore, we are seeking information.

116
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:15,333
Did anyone here see the hero
who vanquished Necromancia?

117
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,791
We're in the middle
of class here. Please leave.

118
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:23,375
Oh, my! If it isn't the princess!

119
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,083
Not now it isn't.

120
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,500
I'm warning you as the student
council's public morals officer.

121
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,833
Public morals? How very trivial!

122
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,458
Why, that pales in
comparison to my ambition!

123
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,166
What ambition?

124
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,208
Allow me to elucidate!

125
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,875
My ambition...

126
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,208
...is to...

127
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,541
...bear the Silver Knight's children!

128
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,083
Miss President!

129
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:05,208
That statement is in violation
of Statute 127, SKFC's motto:

130
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,958
"Pure, True, Lovely"!

131
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:12,500
That's our vice president for you.
Nice catch, Lynette.

132
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,125
I hereby retract that statement.

133
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,166
Retraction acknowledged.

134
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,041
Why so by-the-book?

135
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,875
Resistance is useless--and painful.

136
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,541
She's from a long and
distinguished line of nobility.

137
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,458
In point of fact...

138
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,958
Mm-hmm...

139
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,750
What's that? The princess
was at the Necromancia scene?!

140
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,666
Mm-hmm...

141
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,250
And riding Lancelot at that!

142
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,791
So mightn't <i>you</i> know
the Silver Knight's secret identity?

143
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,875
D-Don't be ridiculous!

144
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,666
Listen...

145
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,208
We <i>are</i> in the middle of class here.
Could you leave?

146
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:03,208
To think a mere commoner would
speak his mind to me, of all people!

147
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:08,791
Acting the fool again, eh, Jessica?

148
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,625
Rebecca! Can I help you?

149
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:17,208
I have business with
the student council members.

150
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:22,791
Perfect! As president of the SKFC,

151
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,875
I demand that the student
council disclose information

152
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,541
on the Necromancia incident!

153
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,750
I-I'll forgive you just this once, b-but...

154
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,708
...this isn't over!

155
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:54,375
"Dragonar Academy"

156
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:58,375
"Dragonar Academy"

157
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,541
So Jessica <i>isn't</i> nobility?

158
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:11,458
That's right. Her family's been
in the service of us Randalls for generations.

159
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:17,208
So when she starts making trouble,
I threaten to expose her.

160
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,791
But why the ruse?

161
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:26,083
Jessica's a good person,
but between her dreamy personality

162
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,458
and her admiration
for royalty and nobility,

163
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,583
it seems she's come to believe
that she herself is high-born.

164
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,875
The things we talk ourselves into...

165
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:39,416
But if she finds the Silver Knight,
she really <i>can</i> be nobility.

166
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,375
What do you mean?

167
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,416
In this dragon-rearing country of ours,

168
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,750
Arch corresponds to a noble rank.

169
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,583
If she were to marry the
Arch-bearing Silver Knight,

170
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,708
her future would be all but guaranteed.

171
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,833
If she finds out
the Silver Knight is really you, Ash Blake,

172
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,958
Jessica will set her sights on
your essence for sure.

173
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,916
E-Essence?!

174
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,250
What's that? Is it yummy?

175
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,458
You do <i>not</i> need to know!

176
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:13,875
But if <i>you</i> know,
it's only fair that I know, too!

177
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,291
What kind of logic is that?

178
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,291
Hmph! I have a little
something called the Draguarth!

179
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,416
E-Essence?!

180
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:36,791
In any case, Ash, you must take
care to keep your identity under wraps.

181
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,875
Jessica is one tenacious woman.

182
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,083
Understood.

183
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,000
Now on to our main topic.

184
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:53,333
As it happens, First Princess
Veronica Lautreamont

185
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,333
will be paying a visit
to the town of Ansullivan

186
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,791
in the wake of its Necromancia attack.

187
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:03,416
A sympathy call from First Princess Veronica?
That's serious business.

188
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,375
First princess--that must mean...

189
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,541
Yes... she's Silvia's big sister.

190
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,375
No!

191
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,958
Setting course for Ansullivan.

192
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,500
Roger.

193
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,791
We'll be seeing her soon, Glen.

194
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,333
Indeed.

195
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,875
I'm so looking forward to it...
my little sister... Silvia.

196
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:51,708
M-My elder sister--that
tyrant--here, in Ansullivan?

197
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,250
Bye now!

198
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,708
Beautiful flowers for sale!

199
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,708
Master Milgauss told me to learn more

200
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,541
about the boy
who killed Necromancia...

201
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,208
...but he's not that easy to find.

202
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,708
What's gotten into the princess, anyway?

203
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,208
Must be Veronica's impending visit.

204
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,458
She's been like this
ever since she heard the news.

205
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,041
Well, then...

206
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,750
...shall I explain?

207
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,666
Cosette!

208
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,583
Are you concerned about the reasons
behind her state of shock as her classmate?

209
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,916
Or as a man?

210
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,958
Wh-What are you talking about?

211
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:07,791
We've fought together,
and we're both student council members.

212
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,291
It's only natural that I'd be worried!

213
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,666
Then let's leave it at that, shall we?

214
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:19,250
Even though Veronica
wasn't selected as a Breeder,

215
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,208
she rebelled against that rejection

216
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,625
by strengthening her body
and perfecting her sword skills.

217
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,208
Soon she earned herself another name--

218
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,625
The Iron Blood Valkyrie.

219
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,916
So intense was her personality
that she put her young sister

220
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
through various drills, all "for her own good."

221
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,916
Drills--now that's an exaggeration.

222
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:47,458
Not at all. Those were... brutal days.

223
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,958
Survival exercises in the mountains...

224
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,250
If you want to live, cut a path for yourself.

225
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,541
Take up that sword!

226
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:22,958
And so Veronica has become
a symbol of terror for the princess.

227
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,208
How traumatic.

228
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,083
No wonder she's afraid of her.

229
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,291
Princess?

230
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,875
Princess!

231
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,500
Um... if you like,
you could come to me for advice.

232
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:47,000
I, uh... I don't really
know how I could help, but...

233
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,833
Look how far I've fallen...

234
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:49,875
Huh?

235
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,875
To think <i>you</i> would pity me!

236
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,000
Save your concern.

237
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,750
Geez... I go out of my way, and--

238
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,500
She's just bluffing.

239
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,208
Tomorrow, eh...?

240
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,750
What a marvelous fragrance.

241
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:39,041
Lavender. It can make
mental tension melt away.

242
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,416
Mental tension, eh?

243
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,625
You haven't been sleeping well
these past few days.

244
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,666
I didn't realize you knew.

245
00:19:55,833 --> 00:20:00,416
This should help you relax
and drift right off to sleep.

246
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,541
Y-You can skip that part!

247
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:09,291
I beg your pardon. Now, then...

248
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,750
Cosette!

249
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,291
I beg your pardon yet again. Let's see...

250
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,541
No--stop...

251
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,916
Isn't that quite enough?

252
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,500
Cosette!

253
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:30,333
It's been so very long since
I've seen you laugh, princess.

254
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,791
Cosette...

255
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,875
Pleasant dreams.

256
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,875
Then there's only one solution:

257
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,958
I'll carry you, and we can look
for the Mother Dragon together!

258
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,916
Okay, here we go.

259
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,708
I made that boy a promise.

260
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,250
That I'd be a fine, upstanding knight...

261
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:30,041
Behave yourself
around Princess Veronica, Eco.

262
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,500
And <i>you</i> behave yourself around <i>me</i> !

263
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,458
I don't want a big scene, all right?

264
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,916
Just be a good girl and I'll buy you a crepe.

265
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,875
You will?! Then I suppose I'll do what you say!

266
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,458
Where's the princess?

267
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:49,166
I couldn't force her to come--not
when she's that terrified.

268
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,750
You're right. Still, to be
that scared of your own sister...

269
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,000
Who's scared of what now?

270
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,208
Princess!

271
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,208
Greetings.

272
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,500
Are you all right?

273
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:14,541
To whom do you think you're speaking?
I am Silvia Lautreamont!

274
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,791
You may have seen me in
a rather... unbecoming moment,

275
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,083
but I'm fine now.

276
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,375
Ah. Well... good.

277
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,333
Here she comes!

278
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:41,833
Oh! That's First Princess Veronica's--

279
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:45,375
It looks like an Imperial airship...

280
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:49,958
That's Princess Veronica's personal vehicle,
the <i>Magiship Sylvanus</i> .

281
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,666
How does a thing like that even fly?

282
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,708
It runs on a special kind
of fafnirite called milenium.

283
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,583
There's other kinds of fafnirite?

284
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:05,625
Thousand-year-old dragon fossils
turn into mana-rich crystals.

285
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:08,500
So that's milenium.

286
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,750
Princess Veronica has come into view!

287
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,750
So that's...

288
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,583
Veronica Lautreamont, First Princess...

289
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,833
<i>Ain't it su-su-su-su-super awesome?</i>

306
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:26,083

307
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:28,458
"Next Time..."

308
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,375
"If the nightingale doesn't sing, kill it!"

309
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,333
So goes my family motto.

310
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,291
<i>That's</i> your family motto?!

311
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,916
What's wrong with it?

312
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,041
Nothing... but how many mottos
do you Lautreamonts have, anyway?

313
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,458
1,086.

314
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,541
--That's a lot!
--And now I shall list them all!

Oh, no, you don't!

00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,250
