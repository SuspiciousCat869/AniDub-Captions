00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,041
This girl...

2
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,875
Is she my parr?

3
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,958
How dare you stare into
the face of a sleeping lady?

4
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,250
How tactless can you get?!

5
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,166
Y-You're crazy strong...!

6
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,375
'Course I am!

7
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,833
That's 'cause I'm a dragon!

8
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,041
So you're...

9
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:32,916
...you're my parr.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,375
Yup. Got a problem with that?

11
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,500
Okay, then!

12
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,166
I'm Ash, and I'll be your master.

13
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,000
Nice to meet you.

14
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:45,583
Huh? I think you
might be a little mixed up.

15
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,166
Remember this:

16
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,958
You're not my master-- <i>I'm</i> the master of <i>you</i> !

17
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,541
Whaaat?

18
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,375
In between the
Zepharos Empire to the north

19
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,666
and the Chevron Kingdom to the south,

20
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,583
lies Lautreamont Knight Country.

21
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,750
Known as "the Dragon-Rearing Land,"

22
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:14,125
it boasts the largest dragon
population on the Arc Strada continent.

23
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,750
This small country with
fewer than five million citizens

24
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,750
is home to a unique school:

25
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,125
Ansullivan Dragonar Academy.

26
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,041
It aims to educate
and guide dragon masters

27
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,208
and the so-called Breeders,
young men and women

28
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,791
who have entered into bonds with dragons.

37
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:16,583

<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

Eh, whatever.

54
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,291
Huh?

55
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,583
Hey, that's--

56
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,458
Is there a problem?

57
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,541
--So where do you expect <i>me</i> to sleep?

58
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,041
--The floor seems about right for a dog.
--So where do you expect <i>me</i> to sleep?

59
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,083
Whaaat?

60
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,375
C'mon, you can't--

61
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,666
Is she for real?

62
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,958
Hey!

63
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,000
Are you sleeping? Hey! Wake up!

64
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:06,583
Could these be the play bites
I've heard so much about?

65
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,791
I guess that makes me a real Breeder now.

66
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,666
Yum.

67
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,250
Wait--you can't mean you're going to--

68
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,333
Ow!

69
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,666

72
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,375
Coming...

73
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,500
Hello, Ash Blake!

74
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,958
Oversleeping does not
impress--even on a day off.

75
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,958
M-Miss President! This is the boys' dorm!

76
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,166
Think nothing of it. Pardon me.

77
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,000
And there's no need to
use such stuffy titles with me.

78
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,583
My name will do.

79
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:59,708
Er... can I help you, Miss Rebecca?

80
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,166
I've come to check up on your parr.

81
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,041
What a great night's sleep...

82
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,166
This is highly inappropriate!

83
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,541
A-And... what about these?
They sure looks like hickeys to me!

84
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,541
It's not what you think!

85
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,875
How can that be?!

86
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,375
It doesn't look like
they slept in the same bed.

87
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,958
Of course we didn't!

88
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,875
And these are a
baby dragon's play bites!

89
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,208
Then why is she naked?

90
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,791
That's a no-brainer!

91
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,625
The proud dragon
race has no use for clothing!

92
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,625
Look, just put this on, will you?

93
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,958
--This is how you treat your master?!
--I see.

94
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,625
Just because she's a woman
doesn't mean she'll have clothes.

95
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:47,875
Dress her in these. Just some
of my hand-me-downs, I'm afraid.

96
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,000
Thank you!

97
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:51,916
Now then...

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,541
...about her.

99
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,125
It has been decided

100
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,083
that the Academy will request
an investigation from Dr. Cornwell

101
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,041
as it determines the
best way to deal with her.

102
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,291
By Dr. Cornwell, you mean...

103
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,916
The foremost authority on dragon research.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,958
Until Dr. Cornwell weighs in,
your parr will be living here.

105
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,083
Understood.

106
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll be sure to take good care of her.

107
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,333
I've spoken with the registrar's office

108
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:25,083
so you can bill them
for your parr-raising funds.

109
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,833
Buy her the things she needs.

110
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,833
That'll be a huge help!

111
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,583
Not bad!

112
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:58,083
For something designed by stupid
dummy dum-dum humans, that is.

113
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,250
That's one high horse you're on...

114
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,125
So what should we buy first?

115
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,750
Ooh, what's that?!

116
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,125
Even your stomach
rumbles are dragon-sized!

117
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:17,791
Wh-What did you expect?
I haven't even had breakfast yet!

118
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,083
This is really delicious!

119
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,416
That does it!

120
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,125
These anthar crepes will be my staple food!

121
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:34,083
These are just a snack.
Dragons eat meat, you know.

122
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,541
You'll never get bigger eating crepes.

123
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,625
Did I ask for your opinion?

124
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,166
What's wrong?

125
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,500
Hey!

126
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:48,375
My body... it's gotten
so... so hot, suddenly...

127
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,833
C'mon, hang in there. Can you stand up?

128
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,125
Let's get you to a hospital!

129
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:53,583
No.

130
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,958
Huh?

131
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,458
I can't...

132
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,791
I...

133
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,250
I can't take it anymore...

134
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,250
Huh?

135
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,541
Please... do something...

136
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:15,416
If this keeps up... who...
who knows what'll happen...

137
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,708
Such behavior--in public?
Have you no sense of decency?!

138
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,708
Y-Your Highness!

139
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,000
You disappoint me, Ash Blake.

140
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:31,333
Is <i>that</i> any way for
an Ansullivan student to present herself?!

141
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,666
N-No, wait!

142
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,416
Th-This is, uh...

143
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,625
S-S-String...

144
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,791
--No peeking!
--...bikini?

145
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,875
I haven't done anything wrong...

146
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,333
Honestly! Feeding
her crepes with anthar?

147
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:10,416
This should weaken
the anthar component. She'll be fine.

148
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,916
Thanks for that, uh...

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Cosette. And you're welcome.

150
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,708
Anthar is like alcohol to us humans.

151
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,375
Giving it to underage
dragons is strictly forbidden.

152
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,916
Have you learned
<i>nothing</i> at the Academy?

153
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,875
Now, now--don't be angry.
Look on the bright side:

154
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,125
You were just looking for Ash,
and now you've found him!

155
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,875
You were looking for me?

156
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,291
Ash Blake!

157
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,708
There's something I must tell you.

158
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,625
Me?

159
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:51,041
What I said about your parr earlier...

160
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:56,458
I said, maybe your parr is already dead.

161
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,750
That...

162
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,541
That was a... a mistake on my part.

163
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,916
I lost my temper, and I just...

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,625
Sorry.

165
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,791
Well then, goodbye!

166
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:15,291
And there you have it.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

167
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,083
If only she were always that agreeable.

168
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,208
You're not defying your master

169
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,291
and entertaining any special
<i>feelings</i> for that female, are you?

170
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,833
Nuh-uh!

171
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:27,916
--Shtop zhat!

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,958
--Quit screwing around!
--Shtop zhat!

173
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,333
Will this be a present
for your little sister?

174
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,250
His sister?
Don't be ridiculous! I'm his master!

175
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,791
Hey, now!

176
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,458
I'm beat.

177
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,333
Are we forgetting anything?

178
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,958
Another crepe!

179
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,458
You don't seriously still want to eat.

180
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,666
Cut out the dopey eyes and
go buy me another crepe already!

181
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,666
Look, you were feeling sick
until a minute ago!

182
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,166
Well, I feel fine now!

183
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,333
Look...

184
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,333
"Look," "look," he says. Hmph!

185
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,166
Use my name when you address me!

186
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,541
Your name?

187
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,375
My name...

188
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,291
That's right.

189
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,333
I get to name you, don't I.

190
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,541
If you must.

191
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:35,333
I've had a name picked out for ages.

192
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,708
You have?

193
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,833
Your name... is Eco.

194
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,666
Eco?

195
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:52,166
It's what the first Breeder,
Rosa Maria, named her Parr, Eco.

196
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,916
Eco...

197
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,583
Bond complete!

198
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:26,416
Now my astral flow has joined with yours.

199
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,416
Astral flow, eh?

200
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,625
It's not half bad!

201
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:36,125
Eco. Pretty nice name, coming from you.

202
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,083
Well, I'm just glad you like it.

203
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,958
"Dragonar Academy"

204
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,958
"Dragonar Academy"

205
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,833
How nice that you
were able to speak with Ash.

206
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,625
I was merely adhering to our family motto:

207
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,583
One must acknowledge one's faults gracefully.

208
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,833
Huh?

209
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,458
What's the holdup?

210
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,833
You disappoint me, Ash Blake!

211
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,958
Trying to sneak into the ladies'--

212
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:34,250
is <i>that</i> any way for
an Ansullivan student to act?

213
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,791
Wrong! You are <i>so wrong</i> !

214
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,333
Eco went in there and she never came out!

215
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,250
Eco? Your parr?

216
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,958
This was in there, too.

217
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:50,791
What is it?

218
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,333
Fafnirite dust.

219
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,458
Someone must have
used this to abduct your parr.

220
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,250
So what I thought I saw earlier--

221
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,625
Calm down!

222
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,291
You don't mean to just run
around looking for her all willy-nilly?

223
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,500
Did you have a better idea?

224
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,541
Have you learned <i>nothing</i> at the Academy?

225
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,958
Huh?

226
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,791
You and Eco are joined
by the astral flow, aren't you?

227
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,833
I-Is that your starbrand?

228
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,208
Pretty much.

229
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,416
So what should I do?

230
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,208
First, focus your
consciousness on your starbrand.

231
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,875
Then think about Eco,
as strongly as you can.

232
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,750
All right. I'll give it a shot.

233
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,416
Eco... Where are you?

234
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,500
Please... tell me...

235
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,458
Where's Eco?

236
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,541
What are these?

237
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,666
So you can see them.

238
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,416
They're only visible to those
pairs bound by the astral flow.

239
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,791
Follow them.
They should lead you to Eco.

240
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,916
Hang tight, Eco!

241
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,041
In here!

242
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,916
Damn--it's locked!

243
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,416
Fafnirite?

244
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,708
Okay, let's go.

245
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,750
D-Don't just leave me here!

246
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,250
Wh-What <i>is</i> all this?

247
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,250
Don't bother.

248
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,666
You think you can get away
with whatever you're doing to me?

249
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,666
Aren't <i>you</i> a lively one!

250
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,166
Not that I'm complaining.

251
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,583
For a dragon to be born
looking like a human is quite...

252
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,166
...unexpected.

253
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,750
You mean you know about me?

254
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:32,625
That's right. I've brought
you here as my research subject.

255
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:37,125
For what purpose would
a dragon assume human form?

256
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,041
<i>You</i> tell <i>me</i> !

257
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,625
You mean you don't know?

258
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,666
But don't you all share the Draguarth,

259
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,500
the memories passed down
through generations of dragonkind?

260
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,666
I tried looking myself up in it,
but I was locked out!

261
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,708
The Draguarth, access denied?
One mystery leads to another...

262
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,250
Now I'm <i>really</i> curious.

263
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,500
If even <i>you</i> have no idea,

264
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,666
I'll have to try asking your body directly.

265
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,625
Dissection is the foundation
of biology, after all.

266
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,708
Eco!

267
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:16,791
Dammit!

268
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,083
Stand back!

269
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,416
Crimson Express!

270
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,083
Eco!

271
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,666
Get over here and rescue me!

272
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,083
What a rude bunch.

273
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,875
What are you doing to my parr?

274
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,833
I'm just responding
to the Academy's request,

275
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,500
albeit in a slightly pushy way.

276
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,875
What request?

277
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,458
You mean you're--

278
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,500
Doctor Angela Cornwell!

279
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,041
Doctor Cornwell? You mean...

280
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,166
The Academy will request
an investigation from Dr. Cornwell

281
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,791
as it determines the
best way to deal with her.

282
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,750
So this is the foremost
authority on dragon research?

283
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,750
I wasn't into it at first.

284
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:09,625
But when I heard about a
dragon born in human form, well...

285
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:14,291
From the moment I laid eyes
on this one, I wanted to dissect her.

286
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,750
They don't let you go quite that
far at the Academy, do they.

287
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,750
So <i>you're</i> the one
I sensed hanging around!

288
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,458
Whatever your reasons,
you committed a kidnapping.

289
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,708
Now give me back my parr!

290
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:32,125
I'm not going to give up such
an intriguing sample that easily.

291
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,625
Fafnirite!

292
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,916
Doctor... what have you done?

293
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,625
This mansion is protected by an Oracle field.

294
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,291
Those stone markers?

295
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,083
Exactly right!

296
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,791
Call out to your parrs all you want,

297
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,125
but you won't be able to summon them.

298
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:58,708
I'll need you to be quiet
until I'm done dissecting her.

299
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,333
Dark Mother's Lullaby.

300
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,958
A-A magic circle...?

301
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,791
Your Highness!

302
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,791
Your Highness... Cosette...

303
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,750
Sweet dreams!

304
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,875
By the time you open
your eyes, it'll all be over.

305
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,583
G-Give Eco back...!

306
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,625
Ash!

307
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,541
Stubborn boy!

308
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:36,375
Don't worry. I have
no intention of taking your life.

309
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:41,958
After all, I don't want to be
a taboo-breaking dragonslayer...

310
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,333
...like Prince Julius.

311
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,333
As if...

312
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,333
I'll just...

313
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,791
...sleep...!

314
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,875
You've come all
this way, and for what?!

315
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,125
You fall asleep and
I swear I'll never forgive you!

316
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,708
You better listen...

317
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,291
Listen to your master!

318
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,166
Could it be--?

319
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,250
Impossible!

320
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:21,041
Has her magic poured
into you through the astral flow?

321
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,583
Spare me the particulars!

322
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,000
I-It can't be!

323
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,416
I won't let you get in my way.

324
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,041
I'm taking back my parr!

325
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:41,708
It's all so... so fascinating!

326
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,958
Y-You sure took your time!

327
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,791
Look here...

328
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:03,416
Is that any place for you
to be touching your master?!

329
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,541
Pretty full day today, huh.

330
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,125
Eco...

331
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,291
So you're my parr.

332
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,958
Hey, Ash!

333
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,958
I heard all about the craziness
that went down yesterday!

334
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,125
Got a royal right hook in
front of the whole town, eh?

335
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,000
It's all over the Academy!

336
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,333
Oh, so no one's talking about the doctor?

337
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,958
What doctor?

338
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:59,291
Uh, nothing. I never want to have
anything to do with her again.

339
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,125
I'll be your new homeroom teacher.

340
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,583
Angela Cornwell.

341
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,000
Wow! Shot through the heart!

342
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,875
You must be joking.

343
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,000
When will she ever learn?

344
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:25,166
You may call me Professor Angela.

345
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,250
Let's make this a great year!
