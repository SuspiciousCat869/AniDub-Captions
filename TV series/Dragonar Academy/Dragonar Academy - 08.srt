1
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,958
Gawain... why are you rejecting Lucca?

2
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,666
Tell me how you feel!

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,833
Ash! Above you!

4
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>Ash</i> !

5
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:12,750
Ash!

6
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,708
Ash!

7
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,875
<i>Ash</i> !

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,375
<i>Meeting you smack</i>
<i>in the middle of the world</i>

9
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:33,333
<i>It leaves me breathless</i>

10
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:37,666
<i>The "something" you and I have</i>

11
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,833
<i>Starts with a tiny thrum</i>

12
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,750
<i>Now teach me about</i>
<i>the sky one more time</i>

13
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,500
"Dragonar Academy"

14
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:53,333
<i>The weight of flapping</i>
<i>wings that only a bird knows</i>

15
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:58,333
<i>Everyone longs for it,</i>
<i>though they know nothing about it</i>

16
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:06,583
<i>You smiled with</i>
<i>a slightly sorrowful look</i>

17
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,000
<i>I... I have nothing</i>

18
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,458
<i>But if your tears can be fewer</i>

19
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,958
<i>And you'll smile like you mean it</i>

20
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,500
<i>Then I can be a hero--any kind you need</i>

21
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,958
<i>I'll embody any kind of hero for you</i>

22
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:23,375
<i>I'll never, never,</i>
<i>never, never let go</i>

23
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:28,375
<i>Even if I die,</i>
<i>I'll be your knight alone</i>

24
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,708
<i>But you cried for</i>
<i>real and got angry:</i>

25
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,000
<i>Saying "Don't be so cold to me"</i>

26
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,708
<i>I wipe your tears</i>

27
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,208
<i>Even without a sacred blade</i>

28
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,250
<i>I don't care if I'm not a hero</i>

29
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:51,500
<i>If I can protect you</i>
<i>with all I have</i>

30
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,916
"Moonlit Roar"

31
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,750
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,541
I failed.

33
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:05,458
I'm just glad you're not hurt.

34
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,791
Still, such extreme opposition...

35
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,291
It's absolutely pointless to try talking to him.

36
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:14,541
If we only knew why Gawain
was rejecting Lucca...

37
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,291
The upcoming training camp
would have been a good chance

38
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:21,083
for the two of them
to reconnect. But now...

39
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:25,000
Now, I'm not sure if
Lucca should even attend.

40
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,166
Rebecca?

41
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,791
May I have permission to
enter Meabh House?

42
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,833
I'd like to speak
with Lucca one more time.

43
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,583
Whaaat? What've you got up your sleeve?

44
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,125
All right. You may enter.

45
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,083
Huh?

46
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,291
But take Eco with you.

47
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:47,500
It's unseemly for a man to
be alone in the women's dorm.

48
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,125
Thank you so much!

49
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:53,750
Now wait just a minute! I never said
anything about coming along!

50
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,583
Gawain...

51
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,583
It's Ash Blake from the student council.

52
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,458
May I come in?

53
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,875
Please, have some tea.

54
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,208
I wasn't able to get
Gawain to tell me how he felt.

55
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,666
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,333
Ah.

57
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,541
Um, you're going to camp, right?

58
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,708
They say the nearby
Nog Woods has been

59
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,541
a kind of dragon
health resort for eons.

60
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:16,250
If you go there, I bet Gawain
would get better in no time.

61
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,833
And they say a change of
scenery can do a lot of good, too.

62
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,833
I'd like you to face
Gawain one more time.

63
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,750
Parr and breeder--it's like...

64
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,375
It's... something irreplaceable.

65
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,500
It's like your destiny.

66
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,291
And that's why...

67
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,500
Argh! Get off the fence already!

68
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:46,291
E-Eco?!

69
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,208
You stupid dummy dum-dums

70
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,083
and all your pointless worrying!

71
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,416
Hey! Cut that out!

72
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
How dare my pet dog
speak to me in such a tone!

73
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,125
I'll crush you!

74
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,083
I'll crush you,
and you'll take it, and you'll <i>like</i> it!

75
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,208
What are you going on about?!
This is going <i>way</i> off track!

76
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,916
I'll go.

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,375
Huh?

78
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,791
I'll go to the training camp.

79
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,000
Master Milgauss!

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,750
It's good to see you again.
When did you return?

81
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,583
Just recently.

82
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,083
I see you've infiltrated the Academy.

83
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:48,083
Yes, to research
Ash Blake and his parr Eco.

84
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,750
I'll be accompanying them to
their training camp on kitchen duty.

85
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,166
Training camp?

86
00:06:55,625 --> 00:07:00,625
Ah, yes--the Willingham Mausoleum
on the shores of Lake Allonnes.

87
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,041
Yes?

88
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:06,916
The ashes of dragons who
died young are interred there.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,416
Though young, they do not
lack in material for experiments.

90
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,625
We'll meet up there.

91
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,708
Stay close on their heels until then.

92
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,166
Yes, sir.

93
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,583
So you have been born
among us, descendant of Avalon...

94
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,416
Eco, eh?

95
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,125
Quite an ironic name
your master has given you.

96
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,500
Still...

97
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:41,875
No matter what name you're given,
it's far better than being killed.

98
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:46,083
Don't you agree... Julius?

99
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:53,208
Now to set out for
camp--at Lake Allonnes!

100
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,750
And we're off!

101
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,833
I hear Gawain's
gone ahead. Don't worry.

102
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,500
He's a smart one--I'm sure
he'll go straight for the resort.

103
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,041
Uh-huh.

104
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,666
Don't even think
about riding my Arianrhod.

105
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,541
Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm not
even touching your dragon, okay?

106
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,958
Hey, not so tight!

107
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,416
S-Sorry!

108
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,416
Off you go!

109
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,208
Lancelot's gonna be
the first to Lake Allonnes!

110
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,041
Hey! Don't be bossing him around!

111
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,750
And Lancelot, don't you listen to her!

112
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,375
He's a good dragon--he respects me!

113
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,750
Isn't that right, Lancelot?

114
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:53,000
Between you and Ash, I barely
even know what's going on anymore...

115
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,875
Wh-What are you doing, Eco?

116
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,708
Wow! They're so big! And soft!

117
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,708
Mmm, nice and bouncy!

118
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,541
H-Hey, now, cut that out!

119
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,666
That Ash--I catch him looking
at your chest, and Rebecca's, too!

120
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,000
Even though he doesn't seem
to care about mine at all!

121
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,625
It ticks me off!

122
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,083
A-Ash looks at my--

123
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,666
There must be some
male-bewitching magic involved!

124
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,166
It's high time
I get to the bottom of this!

125
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,666
N-No, just s-stop that!

126
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,333
Th-That's enough, Eco...!

127
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,916
Now, then...

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,208
Camp is about to begin.

129
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,041
Your experience these next few days

130
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,750
will have a huge impact on your futures.

131
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,875
All of the Sacred
Dragonars of Lautreamont

132
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,375
completed their training
here with flying colors.

133
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,791
If you wish to
be among their ranks,

134
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,958
I want to see your fighting
spirit as you aim for the top.

135
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,041
Everyone's so serious...

136
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:02,000
You should rest today in
preparation for tomorrow's training.

137
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,375
That is, you <i>should</i> ...
but since we're here...

138
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,750
I suppose I could permit a
little splashing around.

139
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,416
Take that!

140
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,375
Huh? Where are
you going, Professor?

141
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,083
It's a secret!

142
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,083
Jessica?!

143
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,375
Come now, Sir Ash, let's go!

144
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,000
G-Go? Where to?

145
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,541
On our honeymoon, of course!

146
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,750
Hey, now, Cosette...

147
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,041
You don't really mean for me to...

148
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:11,333
But of course.
You'll have all eyes on you for certain.

149
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,750
Well, I don't actually want...

150
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,541
For <i>certain</i> , miss.

151
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,041
No, it's just that...

152
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,541
If you continue to be unreasonable,

153
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:25,041
I'm afraid I shall have
to change you into it by force.

154
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,083
Wa--Wait-wait-wait-wait!

155
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,583
This must be heaven!

156
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,458
Seeing the student
council prez in her swimsuit?

157
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,291
Now I can die happy!

158
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,333
Look! Here comes the princess!

159
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,500
D-Don't you think there's just
a tad too little fabric?

160
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,916
I can't relax with the
breeze whipping my flesh like this!

161
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,916
Not to worry. I'm sure
Ash will be very pleased.

162
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,583
What? Ash?
Why would you bring him up?

163
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,583
Please, stooop!

164
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:14,833
This isn't half what my
parr Rhiannon is capable of!

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,666
Lancelot... and Eco?!

166
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,833
I'm borrowing your parr!

167
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,041
W-Wait! Why--how--?

168
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,916
I'm gonna stop
that Jessica in her tracks!

169
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,125
After all, <i>I'm</i> Ash's master, not her!

170
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,208
That's not what I meant!

171
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,416
Well, come on!

172
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Are you with me or what?

173
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,250
I'm coming, too!

174
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,250
Attagirl!

175
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,041
Hey! Wait!

176
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,791
Jessica!

177
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,875
Help meee!

178
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,875
"Dragonar Academy"

179
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,875
"Dragonar Academy"

180
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,791
Ooh, my aching body...

181
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,958
Too much horsing around today.

182
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,791
Lucca?

183
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:39,041
Whoa, look at that mud!
This must be the way.

184
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,000
Gawain...

185
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,666
Hey... Won't you talk to me?

186
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:02,916
I was so happy
when you became a Maestro.

187
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,416
I wanted us to be
together forever and ever...

188
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,666
So please,

189
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,583
one more time,
like it used to be...

190
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,000
Why...?

191
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,833
Why? Why won't you say anything?

192
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,833
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

193
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,375
You know, I'm a little ticked off.

194
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:47,458
We keep trying to talk to you,
but you just keep brushing us off.

195
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,916
Isn't that right, Gawain?

196
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,541
Stop--you can't--

197
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,250
So that means...

198
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:58,916
I'm going to have to
force those feelings out of you!

199
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:07,125
Can't afford a single
hit without my Arch...!

200
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,458
Over here, Gawain!

201
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,458
No... Stop it!

202
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,541
All right! And now...

203
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,708
S-Some kind of...
reflection magic? For defense?

204
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,208
Is he mistaking
my ability for an attack?

205
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,291
No!

206
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:16,250
If I leave him like that, he'll die.

207
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,916
Punishment for getting
in Master Milgauss's way.

208
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,875
Wh-What do I do?

209
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,416
Hands off!

210
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,333
His life is in danger!

211
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,833
I'll handle this. You go get help!

212
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,833
And you are...?

213
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,375
Just go! Hurry!

214
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,416
I-I'm going!

215
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,083
Now we're even.

216
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,250
Wh-Where am I?!

217
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,583
Hello, sleepyhead.

218
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,000
Navi?!

219
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,291
This is Highdragon Workshop,

220
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,625
a special place that
only the spirit may enter.

221
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,125
I summoned you here
to tell you how he feels.

222
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,916
What? Who is this?

223
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,750
Gawain.

224
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,375
This thing?!

225
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,833
He may be a Maestro,
but he's still emotionally immature.

226
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,125
Hence this form.

227
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,208
He's apologizing to you.

228
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:40,916
Says his back belongs only to
his master, Lucca, so he got serious.

229
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,083
I get it...

230
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,875
That's not all.

231
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,416
Three months ago,

232
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,166
Lucca Saarinen was
riding Gawain and fell off his back.

233
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,875
She did? Three months ago now?

234
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,958
Have you heard of the Dragon Dance?

235
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,500
No.

236
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,750
It's a secret Ecbladian art
passed down through generations.

237
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:08,250
Mastery requires natural
talent and unflagging effort.

238
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,083
While practicing that...
there was an accident.

239
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:17,458
She's had an unconscious
fear of riding her dragon ever since.

240
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:21,083
In that state,
it could be deadly for her to ride,

241
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:26,166
and so, Gawain
has been rejecting her--

242
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,291
even if it means breaking their bond

243
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,166
and cutting himself off from the astral flow.

244
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,583
Gawain...

245
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,250
You would go so far as
to put your own life on the line

246
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,833
to protect Lucca?

247
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:43,291
But Gawain has
only five days left to live.

248
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,875
Huh...?

249
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,666
Wh-What's this?

250
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,041
Seems the time has come...

251
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,125
Good luck.

252
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,208
I'm sure you can
bring back their bond.

253
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:01,250
And I look forward
to seeing how you turn out...

254
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,750
...knight of Avalon.

255
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,083
I hope you can ride me soon...

256
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,875
Is this... the infirmary?

257
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,291
Fafnirite?

258
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,958
Oh, right...
from the healing magic.

259
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,916
Wh-Why are you--

260
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Your temperature was dropping,
so I thought I'd warm you up.

261
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,375
Er, uh, th-thanks.

262
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,875
Oh, hey, Lucca!
I talked to Gawain!

263
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:51,916
Huh?

264
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,708
I don't know
if you'll believe me, but...

265
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,500
All to protect me?

266
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:07,500
Yeah. He was thinking
about you this whole time.

267
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,208
And now... because of what I've done...

268
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,791
Get a hold of yourself!

269
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:16,041
Gawain's not long for this world.
He has maybe five days left.

270
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,708
This is... the sixth day of camp...

271
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,875
Already?!

272
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,208
We've got to get to Gawain right away.

273
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,500
We have to think about him now, and only him!

274
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,250
Just like he was thinking about you!

275
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,250
O-Okay...

276
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,375
Could this be...

277
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,041
A hidden dragonkind chamber?
How marvelous!

278
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,958
The fruit of their history and culture!

279
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:09,791
It can't be--

280
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,875
The Old Covenant?

281
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,041
I thought this was banned ages ago...

282
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:21,708
"Two great bloodlines broke off
from the wise dragon king Imbolc:

283
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,916
"the sacred empire of Avalon
and the dark kingdom of Nehalennia.

284
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,958
"These two houses
fought one another unceasingly..."

285
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:33,500
All that really happened,
in the Zono Toen era.

286
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,291
You're those Imperial--

287
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,083
Stop. Your power is no match for mine.

288
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,625
It's always been that way, hasn't it...

289
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,166
Ann?

290
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,666
Th-That nickname!

291
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,083
Prince... Julius?

292
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:03,666
What now?

293
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,208
I don't care. Kill her.

294
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,625
Master Milgauss?!

295
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,500
Damn you...

296
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,541
Think you can stand in my way, do you?

297
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,791
Leave her. Instead...

298
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,375
I shall unleash Necromancia.

299
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,541
Y-Yes, sir!

300
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,333
Ash!

301
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,875
Ow! Eco?

302
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,875
You idiot! I thought you were a goner!

303
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:52,125
Don't be wandering off
where your master can't see you!

304
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,916
Ow! <i>Ow</i> ! That hurts!
I can't breathe! Ouch!

305
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,250
Give her this.
She's been worried sick for five days.

306
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,208
Too worried to sleep, in fact.

307
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,666
Has she?

308
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,166
I'm sorry, Eco.

309
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,083
At least you've come back around.

310
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,208
L-Lucca? What is it?

311
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,875
I-It's him--it's Gawain--

312
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,666
Gawain--he's--

313
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:25,416
<i>Ain't it su-su-su-su-super awesome?</i>
<i>Top-quality training in love</i>

314
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,541
<i>Makes me wanna</i>

315

<i>Bomb! Bon! Cute! Bon! Bon! Bonsoir?</i>

316

<i>Gimme a supernova named love</i>

317
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:48,041
<i>Joy! Joy! Joy! So cliché</i>
