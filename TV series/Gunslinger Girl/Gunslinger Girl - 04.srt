1
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,416
[Triela] Hurry up
before he leaves.

2
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,791
[Henrietta]
But...

3
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,583
You want to
ask him, right?

4
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,291
Yeah... It's just...

5
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,458
Come on.

6
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,083
[Henrietta]
Jose?

7
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,250
Yes... What is
it, Henrietta?

8
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,291
Umm, uhh.

9
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,916
It's okay.

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,166
Well, Christmas is
coming up soon, and...

11
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,875
Yes?

12
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,583
So, I was thinking...

13
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,333
How's a drive sound to you?

14
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,375
As long as we get to
spend time together

15
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,083
it'll be a
perfect Christmas.

16
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,708
Go back to your room.

17
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,333
Good night, Jose.

18
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,875
Good night, Henrietta.

19
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,416
Jose said yes. We'll be
spending Christmas together.

20
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,250
See? What'd I say?
It's as simple as asking.

21
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,500
You were right.

22
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:39,083
It really wasn't that
hard... Thanks Triela.

23
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,750
[Hilshire]
Giacomotti...

24
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,250
Relax. I just want to ask
you a couple of questions

25
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,958
about your
organization.

26
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,250
Triela, I wanted to get
information from him,

27
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,583
not kill him.

28
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,541
I determined that he was
an imminent threat to you.

29
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,750
Maybe so, but you could've
been more gentle about it.

30
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,875
Listen, from now on

31
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,291
no more shooting
without my permission.

32
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,875
If that's the case...
then what's stopping you

33
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,333
from increasing the
level of my conditioning?

34
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,583
Take our friend here
and put him in the car.

35
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,125
Yes, sir.

36
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,041
[Jose] You do know
she's correct, right?

37
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,583
[Hilshire] I'm not going to
give her excess conditioning.

38
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,000
If you truly
feel that way,

39
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,375
then it's your responsibility
to train her correctly.

40
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,666
Though to be perfectly honest,
I'm not really one to talk.

41
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,333
Seems we both got
stuck with a job

42
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:29,208
that we're not
very good at.

43
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,416
Then what do you
recommend I do

44
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,083
to get along
with Triela?

45
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,666
Well, it's your
job to condition her,

46
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,500
not be her best friend...
However, she's a smart girl.

47
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,791
All she needs is to be
treated with respect.

48
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:56,083
[Henrietta] One,
two, three, four,

49
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,250
and five...

50
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,708
and that makes six!
You're one away from seven...

51
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,666
You know, seven
is a lucky number.

52
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,666
Hurray for me.

53
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,750
[Henrietta] I wish
I had some too.

54
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,666
Why don't you ask your
nice brother for some?

55
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,500
It's almost Christmas.
He'd buy them all for you.

56
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,000
No thanks... Spending
Christmas with him

57
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,750
is enough of a
present for me.

58
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,500
Do Hilshire's presents not
make you happy anymore?

59
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,166
He doesn't even
care what I like.

60
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,125
He just gets me the
same thing every year.

61
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,916
Sometimes I wonder if
he gives me these gifts

62
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,708
to please me or to
please himself.

63
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,333
You don't look too
good... Are you okay?

64
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,166
Not really. It's
that time of the month.

65
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,291
It's irregular
and the cramps

66
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,250
have been killing
me since yesterday.

67
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,000
It's too bad they won't
let us take any medicine.

68
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,250
I shouldn't have
said anything.

69
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,500
Just thinking about it
makes it feels worse...

70
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,375
But this pain reminds
me that I'm alive so,

71
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,041
I'll endure it.

72
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,583
That's the spirit.

73
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,583
I'll never know what
that feels like.

74
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:09,250
They took out my uterus
during conditioning.

75
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:14,000
Right, I forgot.
Sorry about that.

76
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,166
Triela. Hilshire's
looking for you.

77
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,833
Rico... Did you know
that you're bleeding?

78
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,666
It's nothing.

79
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,166
Jean scolded me during
conditioning, that's all.

80
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,458
Here. Let me help you.

81
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,666
Triela. He said to wait
in the Section One office.

82
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,833
Jose sees Henrietta
as his little sister...

83
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,125
and Jean sees Rico as
his little work dog...

84
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:46,875
Which makes me... What
does he want me to be?

85
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,166
If the conditioning
decided it all,

86
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,250
it would sure
be easier on me.

87
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,500
Hey, check it out.

88
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,500
We got ourselves a
princess from Section Two

89
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,416
gracing our office. What do
you think she's doing here?

90
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,416
She must be waiting
for a prince.

91
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,833
That's funny...

92
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,833
I thought we were all
frogs, here in section one.

93
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,250
He's not in
Section One.

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,125
Did Giacomotti talk?

95
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,833
I guess so.

96
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,291
Where to today?

97
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,500
The airport.

98
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,583
We'll be looking for
a retired Mafia boss.

99
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,541
Affirmative.

100
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,541
What is it?

101
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,625
Nothing.

102
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,750
I'm sorry for
the inconvience sir.

103
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,750
We didn't realize you
were with the government.

104
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,000
[Hilshire] We're searching
for a man named Mario Bossi.

105
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,416
He's been seen
wandering around Europe

106
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,541
after leaving the
Mafia several years ago,

107
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,000
but word has it
he's back in Naples.

108
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,666
[Triela] Are we killing
Mario Bossi once we find him?

109
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,916
[Hilshire]
No Triela,

110
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We're taking him back
with us for protection.

111
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,166
[Triela]
Protection?

112
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,708
He holds
information we need

113
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,083
if we want to prosecute
his organization's Don.

114
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,583
Once he's safe,

115
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,125
we're going to have Mario
testify under an escape clause.

116
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,541
Naturally, the Mafia's
willing to go to any lengths

117
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,208
to stop that
from happening.

118
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,500
[Triela] So what
you're saying is

119
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,083
they're going to kill him
if we don't step in.

120
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,250
Precisely. We're to protect
him until the trial.

121
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,166
Why can't Section One
do this instead of us?

122
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,958
Because Mario and I
are old associates.

123
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,333
I know several places in
town that he used to frequent

124
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,750
and with any luck, we'll be
home in time for Christmas.

125
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,958
So keep your
eyes peeled.

126
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,750
Wishful thinking
usually leads to nothing,

127
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,000
especially when you're
depending on luck.

128
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,000
Triela.
Is something wrong?

129
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,375
Huh?

130
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:56,416
I don't know. You've looked
a little pale recently.

131
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,708
Stop it.

132
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,083
You don't have to
worry about me...

133
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,375
I see.

134
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,416
[Hilshire]
Who is it?

135
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:37,666
An old friend.
Mario from Vesuvio.

136
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,416
Hilshire!

137
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,208
Nice to see you
again... Mario.

138
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,125
So why didn't
you go to the DA?

139
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,916
You know there are countless
Mafia hitmen and dirty cops

140
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,875
eager for a handout and all
of them are looking for you.

141
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,583
I'll go to your
precious trial...

142
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,333
but I still have unfinished
business here in Naples.

143
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,375
Sorry, but I have
strict orders

144
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,291
to bring you back
to the Agency.

145
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:19,958
You've still got
a cold heart...

146
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,541
And by the way Hilshire...

147
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:25,416
What the hell am I doing
attached to this little girl?

148
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,291
I'm sure you've heard all
about our cyborg units...

149
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,791
I wouldn't bother bother
trying to run away

150
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,750
while attached to her.

151
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,916
So she's one of them.
That explains things.

152
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,500
What? You can't be serious!
Why do I have to go in too?

153
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:47,750
I'll be watching the door.
Nobody's gonna bother you.

154
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:52,875
Come on, unless you want me to
piss my pants right heres.

155
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,208
Don't let your guard down.

156
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,916
Hurry it up.

157
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,166
Don't rush me. Why does
everyone at your agency

158
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,458
have a chip on
their shoulder?

159
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,875
Did you learn about the
agency from Hilshire?

160
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,208
I suppose.

161
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,333
Hilshire doesn't seem
like the type of guy

162
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,958
to have friends with
Mafia connections.

163
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,875
Many years ago a rookie
Europol investigator

164
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,291
caught a Mafia boss
in Amsterdam.

165
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,875
What did
he do?

166
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,083
Their black market
tobacco business

167
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,416
wasn't bringing
in enough cash

168
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,250
so they turned to
exporting children,

169
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,000
also known as 'lambs',
through Amsterdam.

170
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,083
And that investigator
was Hilshire...

171
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,375
Around
that time,

172
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,208
I was seriously considering
leaving the Mafia

173
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,250
for a career elsewhere.

174
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,791
He helped me escape in return
for some insider information.

175
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,750
The organization's been
after me ever since,

176
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,625
and Hilshire was was fired when
they found out he was involved.

177
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,166
Lucky for him, he got
picked up by the agency.

178
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,000
As for me, I've been
running ever since.

179
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,083
Did you two correspond even
after he joined the agency?

180
00:13:56,166 --> 00:14:00,166
For just a short while.
It was a give and take thing.

181
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,083
Did he ever happen to
mention anything about me

182
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,083
before we caught
up with you?

183
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:08,083
No... Tell me, do
you two get along well?

184
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,833
Look Mario. Just
because we're a fratello

185
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,458
doesn't mean
we're best friends.

186
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:32,000
Mario!

187
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,500
Damn!

188
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,250
What's going on?!

189
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,208
I'll get him!

190
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,541
Sorry, little girl.

191
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,458
You know it's a lot
easier to find a traitor

192
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,083
when they return to the
city they left behind.

193
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,041
I'm sick and tired of
running from you guys.

194
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,125
I want this to end.

195
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,666
You can talk all you want
later for all I care...

196
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,375
The boss is waiting for us.

197
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,875
See Naples and die.

198
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,083
Huh? What did
you just say?

199
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,541
Just an old saying...

200
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,000
It means that
before you die

201
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,875
you must experience the
beauty and elegance of Naples.

202
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,833
Well, in that case it means
you can die in peace old man.

203
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,916
If you're gonna
take me to your boss,

204
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,083
you'd better
hurry it up.

205
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,291
Huh?

206
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,083
Someone you don't want
to play around with

207
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,291
is about
to show up.

208
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,916
[Triela] Did you get hit?

209
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,625
[Mario]
Huh? No.

210
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,458
If you try to run again I
won't hesitate to shoot.

211
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,083
What's with the
attitude, little girl?

212
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,791
Female stuff...

213
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,916
Someone forced me to run
all over town to catch him.

214
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,791
Are you alright?

215
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,791
Actually, no,
I'm not. It's painful.

216
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,291
Tell me...

217
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,541
Why did you risk
coming back to Naples

218
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:36,666
with all this
heat... on you?

219
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,083
To see my...
my only daughter.

220
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,666
Daughter?

221
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,541
The first time I ever seriously
thought about leaving the Mafia

222
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,125
was when my
daughter was born...

223
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,250
Having her made me realize
that I despised everything

224
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,958
I had done
with my life.

225
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:55,458
Every year I've sent
her a Christmas present...

226
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,916
But since I've
left the Mafia...

227
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,208
I haven't laid eyes on her
once... I promised myself...

228
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:11,583
that I'd deliver a present
to her in person this year.

229
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:19,083
A girl needs a father,
or so I'm told... right?

230
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:24,833
I'll tell Hilshire
that you got away.

231
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,291
Triela... Do you have
any idea what happened

232
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,083
to your real parents?

233
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,791
Afraid not...

234
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,666
All I've been told is
that the agency found me

235
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,916
somewhere in Amsterdam.

236
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,791
After listening
to your story,

237
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,708
I guess I might have
been a 'lamb' myself.

238
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,416
I couldn't possibly ask
for... your forgiveness.

239
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,750
There's no need for that.

240
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,541
Who's to say it was
your fault anyway?

241
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,208
I'm sorry.

242
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,625
Just go see your daughter and
treat her like a princess.

243
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,000
And you try to get
along with Hilshire.

244
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,500
Now hold on... 
Believe it or not, Mario,

245
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,416
he and I get along quite
well most of the time.

246
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,416
I don't hate him
specifically...

247
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,083
It's the rest of
you selfish adults

248
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,500
that I hold a
grudge against.

249
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,083
Mario got away?

250
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,500
Sorry.

251
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:34,750
It's no big deal. It was
just a favor for Section One.

252
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,291
Triela.

253
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,500
Uh, yeah.
What is it?

254
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,958
We still have some time
until our flight leaves...

255
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,291
What do you say we get
in some shopping first?

256
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,875
I just realized that
I've only ever given you

257
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,375
boring dolls for presents.

258
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,250
How 'bout a...
a nice dress

259
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,458
or a...
pair of shoes?

260
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,916
What I like is...

261
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,291
I like the
way it feels

262
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,958
when I tighten my
bow around my neck

263
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,958
or the clicking sound
of my leather boots

264
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,416
when I walk on
cobblestone...

265
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,125
or my jacket...

266
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:15,166
Okay. I've always... had a
tough time trying to figure out

267
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,833
what kids would like
for presents...

268
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,958
So, I don't know. I just
assumed they like teddy bears.

269
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,000
But if you'd like
something else this year,

270
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,291
don't hesitate to ask.

271
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,750
You know now that
I think of it,

272
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,875
just get me a teddy bear
like you always do...

273
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,250
Henrietta says that the
number seven is good luck.

274
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,416
I already have six,
so please, one more.

275
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,333
If that's
what you want.

276
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,958
Triela.

277
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,541
Coming!

278
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,666
That tree looks great.

279
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,208
Thanks. Hey,
welcome back.

280
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,708
Are you
feeling any better?

281
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,250
Not yet.

282
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,458
I give in.
Maybe once a year

283
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,541
it's okay to have
a day like this.

284
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,875
[Henrietta] Huh?

285
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,833
Just talking to myself.

286
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,875
Incidentally, on
Christmas morning,

287
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,458
I found two gifts waiting
for me under the tree.

288
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:43,291
One from Hilshire and
one from Mario Bossi.

289
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,125
As it turned out I ended
up with one extra teddy bear,

290
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,583
which was fine with me...

291
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,541
Just another sibling
to spend Christmas with.
