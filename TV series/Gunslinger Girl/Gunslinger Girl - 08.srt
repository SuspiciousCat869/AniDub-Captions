1
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,041
[Doctor]
All right, Henrietta.

2
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,041
How have you been feeling
lately? Any trouble sleeping?

3
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,000
Or nausea, slight
fevers or muscle aches?

4
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,625
None of those,
Mr. Bianchi.

5
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,583
You need to be
honest, Henrietta.

6
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,250
It's for your own sake.

7
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,416
I'm telling the truth.
I've been feeling fine lately.

8
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,125
So then... are you confident
you can listen to your handler?

9
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,375
And control
your emotions?

10
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,458
Yes, sir.

11
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,125
I'll try my
very best.

12
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,375
Henrietta's as cute as
ever. What a darling.

13
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,125
You got that right.
Kinda makes me wish

14
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,875
I had a daughter
of my own.

15
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,583
If I could have my way,
I'd round up all the girls

16
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,083
before you men could get
your hands on them...

17
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,875
And start the best
ballet company

18
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,583
that Europe
has ever seen.

19
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,250
You sure they'd
enjoy that?

20
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,500
Of course
they would.

21
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,041
Hey, Amadeo. I think
I have a better idea

22
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,583
of what to do
with these girls.

23
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,083
Oh yeah? What's
that, Giorgio?

24
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,583
We should put 'em
on a soccer team.

25
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,666
That's
perfect!

26
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,791
You Italian men
are all the same.

27
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,583
Now, now... You all
know my Henrietta

28
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,541
is not your
play-thing.

29
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,541
Easy there, tiger. 
We're just joking around.

30
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,333
Yeah, heavies like
us don't know jack

31
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,041
about taking care
of a little girl,

32
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,958
but that's
obvious, huh?

33
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,833
Alright... I'm done
with Henrietta...

34
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,750
Could you bring in Angelica
in about 10 minutes?

35
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,291
Yes, sir.
Of course.

36
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:30,916
Henrietta.

37
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,958
I'm going to ask
you one more time

38
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,541
since Ferro
left the room...

39
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,958
Are you honestly
feeling okay?

40
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,875
Doctor... Please don't
keep me from working.

41
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,375
It's all there
is for me to do.

42
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,125
I've only killed 4
people this month.

43
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,791
But the month before I
killed at least ten...

44
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,041
That's probably more
than Triela's got.

45
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,583
So you're lying? About
not feeling alright?

46
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,500
I'm fine!

47
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,708
But if... if I don't say
how many I've killed,

48
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,833
I'm afraid you'll think
I'm not usable anymore.

49
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,958
You always report to
someone about that, right?

50
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,416
Man, that girl
is delicate.

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,166
So please...

52
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,666
Listen,
Henrietta.

53
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,583
Steady your
emotions.

54
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,458
Once you can do that, you
won't need to worry anymore.

55
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,750
Alright.

56
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:30,125
If I could only make that
girl into a ballerina...

57
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,458
[Giorgio] Olga.
You're up next.

58
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,291
[Olga]
I win.

59
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,375
Come on in.

60
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,083
Well, good morning,
Angelica... Come and sit down.

61
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,625
Do you
remember me?

62
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,583
You're Doctor...
Bianchi.

63
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,916
That's my name, but it says
it right here on my ID card.

64
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,916
You look like you're
doing pretty well lately.

65
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,291
Oh, I finally
made it!

66
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,500
Aww. Don't tell me my sweet
Henrietta is already done!

67
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,125
Don't even bother
asking, Priscilla.

68
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,583
Jose. You'll have to lend
me Henrietta sometime.

69
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,083
I found a great boutique
that she would adore.

70
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,708
[Doctor]
Angelica...

71
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,708
How many people do you
recognize in these pictures?

72
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,375
Number 6 and
number 9...

73
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:47,791
Number 13...
and number 20.

74
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,333
Doctor. How many
have I forgotten?

75
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:58,041
Have I lost any... important
people in my head?

76
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:02,250
It's just a little test.
Nothing to worry about.

77
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,208
Do you remember
this story?

78
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,875
Once upon a time, there was
a kingdom made of pasta.

79
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,625
In this kingdom there lived
a prince who loved pasta,

80
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,125
and would eat it for
every meal of every day.

81
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,416
[Priscilla] That
brings back memories.

82
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,958
Well then...
That ring a bell?

83
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:34,541
[Angelica] Doctor. Can I
start working again soon?

84
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,958
I'm not the one who
decides that, Angelica.

85
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,500
You'll have
to ask Marco.

86
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,916
Okay.

87
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,541
Jose, are you a little
more satisfied now

88
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,791
that you know what
she's thinking?

89
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,375
The only reason I allowed you
to watch Henrietta's interview

90
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,041
was because you
requested it...

91
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,791
Don't waste your time
looking for more knowledge.

92
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,458
What you need
is faith.

93
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,041
And Marco...

94
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,791
The reason I forced you
to sit through this

95
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,333
was to hopefully
renew your interest

96
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,583
in being
Angelica's handler.

97
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,833
What happened to
your enthusiasm?

98
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,041
Come on,
Bianchi...

99
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,541
You of all
people should know

100
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,333
how I ended up
feeling this way.

101
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,833
We went through
it together!

102
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,500
I worked long and hard to
teach her everything I could,

103
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,041
but it was those damn
cyborg engineers.

104
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,000
The conditioning
process wiped her mind!

105
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,541
Everything I
taught was useless!

106
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,708
Look, maybe you can
rationalize it in your head

107
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,208
because you're
a doctor,

108
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,833
but can you honestly say you'd
have no problems with this

109
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,750
if you were a
Handler yourself?

110
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,166
I understand
how painful it is.

111
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,583
They're studying the effects
of the implants as we speak...

112
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,208
Soon the side effects
will be avoidable

113
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,250
and possibly
even reversible.

114
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,833
Perhaps Angelica could
hold out until they're done.

115
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,666
But abandoning all
hope for her is wrong.

116
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,125
[Angelica]
Marco!

117
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,916
They finally
released me today...

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,125
Now we can be
together again.

119
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,666
The doctor gave me this book
to read. It's pretty good.

120
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,750
But... when can
I start work?

121
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,125
Your unsteadiness is a
handicap you can't afford.

122
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,750
It's much too
early for work.

123
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,875
Go change clothes and
start running laps.

124
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,083
[Marco] All of the girls from
the Social Welfare Agency

125
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,375
are far
from happy,

126
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,375
but they're not
necessarily unhappy,

127
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,000
if they even know
the difference.

128
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,666
A few
years ago,

129
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,250
there was an unfortunate
little girl named Angelina.

130
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,333
Hi, Pero.

131
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,708
[Marco] Her own parents
tried to kill her.

132
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,500
Apparently right before her
father's business went bankrupt

133
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,375
he took out a large
insurance policy on Angelina

134
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,208
and was looking
to cash in.

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,041
Around that same
time, I was...

136
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,500
[Patricia] So they
dismissed you because

137
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,916
your eyesight
got worse?

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,916
But I thought it was
a workplace injury.

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,500
I don't care
about the job,

140
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,166
I'm just happy that
I can still see.

141
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,041
Even if I my eyesight is bad,
I can still see your eyes.

142
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,166
Oh, Patricia...

143
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,708
They're the most beautiful
things I've ever seen.

144
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:04,083
I must say, you have quite an
impressive resume here, Marco.

145
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,375
Consider
yourself hired.

146
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,458
Thank you, sir. This
is a great honor.

147
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,541
Oh, and by the way,
do you like children?

148
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,416
Uh, yeah. Children
are wonderful.

149
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,208
So, who is this new
organization working under?

150
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,541
The State
Department?

151
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,708
Doctor Bianchi highly
recommended you, Marco...

152
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,041
Did... he not tell you
anything about this job?

153
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,208
He just said I'd like the job
and he couldn't talk about it.

154
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,416
Sounds like you have a lot
of trust in his judgment.

155
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,833
Come over here. I'll
explain your job to you.

156
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:06,416
Daddy...
Mommy... Pero.

157
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,250
Why am I
in this bed?

158
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,750
And who are you?

159
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,375
You are in a
hospital right now

160
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,500
that's part of the
Social Welfare Agency.

161
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,666
A hospital?
That's strange...

162
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,875
I remember going on
an errand with Pero...

163
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,916
then this car
came after me...

164
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,750
Next thing I knew
I couldn't move.

165
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,041
The doctors used their
magic to help you get better.

166
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,541
Where's my
daddy? And Pero?

167
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,708
Your parents had
to do something,

168
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,041
so they'll be
back later.

169
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,916
And Pero is
with them too.

170
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,333
Are you gonna
stick me with that?

171
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,916
Why? Do you not
like getting shots?

172
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,458
Of course not. No kid
likes getting shots.

173
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,458
How about if I
tell you a story

174
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,416
so you won't even
know it's happening...

175
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,083
Now let's see
what we've got...

176
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,041
Do you
like pasta?

177
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,875
I love it.

178
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,666
I'll tell you... about
the Prince of Pasta.

179
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,708
A long,
long time ago,

180
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,791
there was a great
kingdom made of pasta.

181
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,125
In this kingdom there lived
a prince who loved pasta

182
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,583
and he would eat it
every single day.

183
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:29,125
This was great for him,
but there was a problem.

184
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,041
There was only one fork
in the entire land,

185
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,583
so the prince always had to
eat his pasta all by himself.

186
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,583
Well, even the most delicious
pasta has no flavor

187
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,416
when you're forced
to eat it alone.

188
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,708
It still hurt anyway.

189
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,541
Yeah, I should
have figured that.

190
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,958
Well, keep going.

191
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,666
What happens with
the pasta man?

192
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,250
I'll wait to tell you more when
it's time for your next shot.

193
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,666
Now you behave
yourself, okay?

194
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,083
[Marco] The nearly dead
Angelina was reborn

195
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,750
as a cybernetic
test subject.

196
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,041
I decided to rename
her Angelica...

197
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,708
Her parents were the
scum of the earth

198
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,041
for what they
did to her,

199
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,166
but I felt they were right
in calling her an angel.

200
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,041
And who's the little cutey,
Marco? Is she your daughter?

201
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,541
She is the most adorable
thing I've ever seen.

202
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,500
You two both know
she's not my daughter.

203
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,750
Angelica is our
newest employee.

204
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,208
Oh,
okay.

205
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:38,000
They call me the missionary
of love, Amadeo... It's a...

206
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,125
Well, I'm the fallen
angel of love, Priscilla.

207
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,333
[Marco] Back then, Section 2
was in its infancy.

208
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,416
We had under ten
people on staff.

209
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,375
We never got any real work,
so we had plenty of spare time.

210
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,333
So how
is she?

211
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,375
Almost too good. Those
implants are incredible.

212
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,833
Does she ever ask you any
questions about her family?

213
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,291
Yeah,
sometimes.

214
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,708
But whenever
she brings it up

215
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,791
I pull out the
Pasta Prince story.

216
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,875
Once she hears that,
she forgets all about it...

217
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,041
It's kind of
funny because

218
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,875
I keep making up the
story as I go along.

219
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, you mean you made up that
story about the pasta guy?

220
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,791
I just always
assumed it was from

221
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,750
one of Patricia's
children's books.

222
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,750
Have you told her
about your new job yet?

223
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,750
No. I'll get around
to it next week.

224
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,083
Welfare? I thought you were
with the military police.

225
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,375
Well, remember that old
friend of mine, Bianchi?

226
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,250
He's the one
who got me in.

227
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,041
So what is it exactly
that you do for them?

228
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:48,083
How should I put it? I kind
of take care of children.

229
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,208
That's great news. We can see
each other more often now...

230
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,833
It's the perfect
job for you, Marco.

231
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,500
[Marco] Every time
I saw Angelica,

232
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,916
she would pester me about
the rest of the story.

233
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,750
I had completely
run out of ideas,

234
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,416
so I had some of my colleagues
help me thicken up the plot.

235
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
We really had nothing
else to do at the time.

236
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,000
All the fairy tales
I've ever heard

237
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,458
have had a
princess at least.

238
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:15,083
And maybe the princess could
be kidnapped by a dragon.

239
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,625
A dragon, huh? I don't know...
Seems kind of ordinary.

240
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,166
[Priscilla] Well we're not
professionals, you know,

241
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,750
and it's not like the
story has to be complex.

242
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,375
[Giorgio] What are former
military and intelligence

243
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,583
agents doing
yapping about this?

244
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,708
Ah, who the hell cares?
Nothing better to do.

245
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,083
I wish they'd get that
girl into combat shape

246
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,041
so we can get back
into the field.

247
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,750
I'm sick of
waiting around.

248
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,083
This storytelling is
easier than I thought.

249
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,208
Just as Giorgio
was hoping,

250
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,666
Angelica's implants were
finished a short time later.

251
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,791
By the time Prince Pasta
had met Princess Pizza,

252
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,750
Section 2 was finally
strong enough

253
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,458
to be used in
anti-terrorist operations.

254
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,833
Why did you name
the prince Pasta?

255
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,708
Because only the prince of the
pasta kingdom can eat pasta...

256
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,666
There's only one fork available
in the whole kingdom...

257
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,125
so only one person
can be named Pasta.

258
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,041
In all this time that
you've been away at work,

259
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,541
the last thing
I expected you

260
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,125
to be doing was writing a
fairy tale for a little girl.

261
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,750
So, uh... what are
you writing down?

262
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,416
This all sounds very
interesting to me

263
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,375
so I wanted
to take notes...

264
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,041
Marco... Can't you
tell me where you work?

265
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,916
I'd really
like to know.

266
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,041
The Social
Welfare Agency...

267
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,416
It's your typical
government job.

268
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,875
Is that...
Is that so?

269
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:34,791
Yep.

270
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,375
Spread your feet apart
about shoulder's width...

271
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,541
and be sure your arms are
firmly locked in place.

272
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,208
Don't touch the trigger
until you're ready to shoot.

273
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,083
Now, go ahead
and take a shot.

274
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,416
Don't let the sound or
recoil startle you.

275
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,583
Wow! That's an impressive
first shot for a girl your age.

276
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,083
Those cybernetic implants
really are amazing.

277
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,166
Hey, Priscilla. Just riding
around wasting time again?

278
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,208
What's with the
stealthy sunglasses?

279
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,250
Hey, give me
some credit here...

280
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,000
I just finished hand
to hand combat training.

281
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,125
You mean you train just
like me, Priscilla?

282
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,875
Normally, I'm just a boring
intelligence analyst,

283
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,083
but I figure if I'm going to be
hanging around with you guys,

284
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,416
I should toughen
myself up a little bit.

285
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,916
Strength brings
possibilities.

286
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,666
Possibilities?

287
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,750
That's right...
Possibilities that can be used

288
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,875
for good or
bad things.

289
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,833
I wanted to help you just
like the Pasta Prince

290
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,291
saved Princess Pizza,

291
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,541
but from the looks of it,
you should be protecting me.

292
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,500
So tell me,
Angelica...

293
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,333
Did you find it scary shooting
a gun for the very first time?

294
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,791
No. It was something I had to
do, so I really enjoyed it.

295
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,458
This conditioning creeps
me out sometimes.

296
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,625
Man... What the
hell's your problem?

297
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,125
We do nothing but
baby sit all day

298
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,958
and I'm sick
and tired of it.

299
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,250
So? Take a look
at your paycheck.

300
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,125
It's not a
bad day's work.

301
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,208
You know, I get the
feeling you're just here

302
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,125
to hit on chicks,
you marine trash!

303
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,625
Tell me, Giorgio, are all
ex-army as pinheaded as you?

304
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,291
Do you really love
murder that much?

305
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,291
Shut up!

306
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,333
Looks like the little baby
wants to pick a fight.

307
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,458
Come on!

308
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,708
[Jean] If I could have it
my way I'd fire you both,

309
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,541
but the Agency doesn't
see it that way.

310
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,375
I'll make you
suffer instead...

311
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,875
I'm sending you to
army operations

312
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,541
for the next
3 months...

313
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,666
If you both want to
act like macho thugs

314
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,041
you can do
it there.

315
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,000
[Both]
Yes, sir!

316
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,666
I guess I tested
the possibilities

317
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,041
that Priscilla was
talking about...

318
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,583
Do you think
I failed?

319
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,000
Not at all. You did
great, Angelica,

320
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,125
and I am so
proud of you.

321
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,458
[Marco] Ironically, this
incident convinced the Agency

322
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,083
to put the
cybernetic implants

323
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:25,833
into a real life test, and soon
enough Section 2 was in action.

324
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,666
It was after that test that
we first started learning

325
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,041
of some of the
negative side effects

326
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,916
to the cybernetic
transformations.

327
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,250
They're so pretty.

328
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,250
Yeah.

329
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,583
Angelica.

330
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,041
Amadeo! Giorgio!

331
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,666
Hey, you're finally back.

332
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,791
Those 3 months seemed
like an eternity.

333
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,583
You guys brought
it on yourselves.

334
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,958
Yeah, we know...
Angelica. Here.

335
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,375
Come on...
Apologize.

336
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,041
Yeah, thanks,
I know...

337
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,208
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

338
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,583
And what happened? 
I must have missed it.

339
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,208
I have to admit
I'm shocked.

340
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,583
I thought you two would
be together forever.

341
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,583
Doctor Bianchi...
What is it that Marco

342
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,750
actually does
for his job?

343
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,750
I'm not
at...

344
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,000
You're not at
liberty to tell me?

345
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,833
He said the same
thing to me...

346
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,416
And the whole while
I could still smell

347
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,666
the gunpowder
on him.

348
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,125
I can't live my
life with someone

349
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,708
who may or may not
come home alive...

350
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,916
All I want is a simple
man with a normal job.

351
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,250
Oh!

352
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,541
What ever happened to
that story he made up?

353
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,333
The one about
the Pasta Prince.

354
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:11,041
Right... He finished it and
it turned out really well...

355
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,416
We actually all pitched
it and helped him out.

356
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
You know, I never got
the chance to hear

357
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,958
the finished story.

358
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:20,333
Would you mind telling it
to me? If that's alright...

359
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,250
I'd... really love to
turn it into a book.

360
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,916
[Marco] I stopped telling
Angelica the story

361
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,500
a while back.

362
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,541
I don't want to think that
everything I did for her

363
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,250
back then was in vain.

364
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:43,583
Poor girl. She no longer
remembers the story.

365
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,000
Do one more lap and then
we'll call it a day.

366
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,750
Yes, sir.
