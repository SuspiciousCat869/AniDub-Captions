1
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,791
[Jose] Don't make a move

2
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,166
until I've determined
that the mark is inside.

3
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,500
[Henrietta]
Yes, Jose.

4
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,541
If I don't ID this guy, then
we walk out of here, quietly.

5
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,416
Okay.

6
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,833
Good morning, sir.

7
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,291
I apologize for intruding like
this. Do you have a minute?

8
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,250
No. What do you want?

9
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,666
Just a few moments
of your time.

10
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,250
I am a reporter
from Libero Italia.

11
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,958
What is it you're reporting?

12
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,416
I heard that Mr. Scallo of
the Costelo Company was here.

13
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,166
I would love to
get an exclusive.

14
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,333
Yeah, well, there ain't
nobody here by that name.

15
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,041
So, good luck finding
your interview.

16
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,375
Wait...

17
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,708
I'm positive that
he's in this building.

18
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,041
And I told you that you
got the wrong room, chief.

19
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,458
You hard of hearing?

20
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,958
No...

21
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,875
Then maybe it's a learning
disorder. Your guy ain't here!

22
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,083
Sorry, I...

23
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,375
Now, get lost before
I pop your eyes out

24
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,166
and make your
sister watch!

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,041
[Head Baddie] Louie,
what's going on--

26
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,041
Hey--

27
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,083
Throw your grenade!

28
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,458
Take him.

29
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,500
Let's pack up
and go home.

30
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,791
[Jose] Now
you've done it.

31
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,791
[Jose] Ferro... The
mission has failed.

32
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,250
I repeat: Mission
has failed.

33
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,458
[Ferro] Roger.
We're on our way.

34
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,666
Yeah.

35
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,708
Henrietta, why did
you lose control?

36
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,000
Uh...

37
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,208
This isn't
like you...

38
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,250
I've never seen you
lose it like that.

39
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,833
Your arm's been hit.

40
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,666
Are you okay?

41
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,250
Yes...

42
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,208
[Jose] Let's go.

43
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,208
Right.

44
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,916
[Henrietta]
Jose...

45
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,208
[Jose] Is your
arm hurting?

46
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,250
I only--

47
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:30,291
I just wanted to
help you, Jose.

48
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,166
[Jose] We'll have a doctor
take a look at that arm

49
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,500
as soon as
we get back.

50
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,833
[Jose] Officially, the Social
Welfare Agency is a

51
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,750
government-sponsored
corporation that's

52
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,000
in the business
of saving lives.

53
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,000
At least
that's the ruse.

54
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,000
In reality, it's an agency
on the fringe of technology.

55
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,375
They give terminal patients
another shot at life

56
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,750
using cybernetic
implants.

57
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,375
This conditioning process
then shapes the patient

58
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,291
into an efficient
machine for handling

59
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,083
all of the government's
dirty work.

60
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,541
How's she
coming along?

61
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,375
Do you think you'll be
able to fix her, doctor?

62
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,291
[Doctor] The damage
was minimal.

63
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,208
The bullet shaved off some skin
and artificial muscle tissue.

64
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,708
We won't need to
replace the arm.

65
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,583
That's good to hear.

66
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,041
Don't
misunderstand...

67
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:41,166
She'll need surgery every
time she sustains injuries.

68
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,208
The conditioning process takes
a huge toll on their bodies.

69
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,875
If she continues to
suffer damage, she,

70
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,041
or any of the units
for that matter,

71
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,208
could grow dependant on
the reconstruction process

72
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,875
or suffer from severe
memory dysfunction.

73
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,708
So, you're saying...

74
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,541
Any of our implants are
replaced with little effort.

75
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,958
They're designed
that way.

76
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,541
But their impact
on the brain

77
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:09,125
and other living
tissue is substantial.

78
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,541
What happened out
there today, anyway?

79
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,375
People are saying
that she lost it,

80
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,208
ignored her orders
and spun out of control.

81
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,750
[Jose] I don't know.

82
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:22,208
She claims she killed those
people to protect me.

83
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,458
That's a little disturbing.

84
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,166
Sounds like a lost
cause if you ask me.

85
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,833
[Doctor] Jose, I know you're
fond of this girl.

86
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,208
You think she's
special somehow.

87
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,625
So, don't you think
you should increase

88
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,541
her level of
conditioning?

89
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,583
[Doctor] I mean, treating
a cyborg assassin

90
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,500
like a normal
little girl?

91
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,791
Come on, that just
doesn't seem natural.

92
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,000
[Jose] Children brought into
the agency undergo

93
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,416
what they call 'conditioning'
in addition to

94
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,875
their physical modifications.

95
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,500
Fortunately, for her,

96
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,000
the conditioning erased any
and all memories of her past.

97
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,791
Good and bad.

98
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,208
Henrietta, let's go.

99
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,916
Coming.

100
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,833
[Ferro] It's nothing. Just
fill out the location

101
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,875
and the reason
for the trip.

102
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,125
And, just sign here...

103
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,125
[Jose] Okay.

104
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,833
A day pass?

105
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:20,791
Yeah.

106
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,458
Where's your field
trip headed?

107
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:27,666
Oh... Just around...
Anything else?

108
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,875
The pomodoro
there is superb.

109
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,875
Today you learn
that not only

110
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,208
must you study and
train for work,

111
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,833
but you also have to
learn how to act properly

112
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,250
in the outside world.
To blend in.

113
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,666
Yes...

114
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,416
When you drink tea, hold
the saucer close to the cup

115
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,541
so it doesn't rattle

116
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,250
Yes...

117
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,166
Henrietta!!!

118
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,666
[Jose] Let go of him and
take your seat.

119
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,208
Yes sir.

120
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,375
Are you all right?

121
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,333
I'm terribly sorry.

122
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,208
I Hope this helps.

123
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,041
Uh, thanks.

124
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,708
Now, if you
don't mind,

125
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,916
cancel the Grappa and
bring out dessert.

126
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,416
Yes sir. Yes sir.

127
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,583
Did I do
something wrong again?

128
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,541
Let's just continue
with our meal, shall we?

129
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,583
Okay.

130
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,666
[Jose] As
time passed,

131
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,250
I began to put in more
effort with Henrietta.

132
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,375
[Jose] Now pay attention.
To do a job, any job,

133
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,875
you have to learn many
different things.

134
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,208
Every successful job is
just the completion

135
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,791
of many smaller,
simpler tasks...

136
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,916
I'm going to start giving
you notes to study each day.

137
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,500
[Henrietta] Okay.

138
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,583
Make sure the muzzle doesn't
stick out over the edge...

139
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,416
stay down as low
as you can...

140
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,250
And if your rifle
doesn't have a bipod,

141
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,583
then you'll have to grip
that barrel tight

142
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:52,833
with your
bracing hand.

143
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,750
Anything closer than
six hundred meters,

144
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,666
you aim for the head.
Anything past six hundred,

145
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,500
aim for the center
of the body.

146
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,041
What?

147
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,000
Take a look at the sky.

148
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,000
See the little
dot by that cloud?

149
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,208
Can you tell me
what that is?

150
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,583
No, sir. Sorry.

151
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,583
How about a guess?
Come on, anything will do.

152
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,916
Who knows? Maybe
it's a magic pixie.

153
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,541
Is it an airplane?

154
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,791
That's a good answer...
In wars past,

155
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,458
plenty of people mistook
that light for a plane...

156
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,125
But what if it were
night right now?

157
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,375
What would you
think then?

158
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,083
A star?

159
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,416
Close. It's the planet Venus,
not far from Earth's orbit.

160
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,875
Make sure you don't
look directly at the sun

161
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,708
with that thing.

162
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,375
Of course, we'd probably
need something

163
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,166
a bit more powerful if
we were going to shoot

164
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,666
a Venusian in the head.

165
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,958
Jose...

166
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:41,041
You know everything,
don't you?

167
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:55,958
[Doctor] Are we awake?

168
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,708
[Doctor]
No baths.

169
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:06,041
No baths until that skin
on your arm takes hold.

170
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:10,208
What's the matter? You
have bad dream?

171
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,708
I don't think
I know.

172
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:16,083
The tears just started
pouring out of nowhere.

173
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,333
[Triela]
Henrietta!

174
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,541
Rico just
told me...

175
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,083
You flipped your lid
out there today.

176
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:47,500
I couldn't control
it. I just snapped.

177
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,083
Triela...

178
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:55,541
I don't know
what to do.

179
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,833
Don't sweat it.

180
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,000
Hey, I know! We can go have
a drink in Claes' room.

181
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,083
A drink?

182
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,583
Yeah. She's got
the best tea,

183
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:11,916
and I swear she puts
magic in her cakes.

184
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,958
[Triela] You just wanted
to make him proud of you.

185
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,041
That's all.

186
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,041
Yeah... I guess so.

187
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,333
[Claes]
But Triela,

188
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,583
isn't that the only
thing any of us can do?

189
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:28,541
We all seek approval.

190
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,083
And if I were him
that kind of devotion

191
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,875
would make me feel
uncomfortable.

192
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,583
Hey, but it's okay...

193
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,625
'Have fun while
you're still young,'

194
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,916
that's what I always say.

195
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,291
Is that so? I thought
that was from TV.

196
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,916
No, those are
my own words.

197
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,916
[Jose] Henrietta,
are you in there?

198
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,583
Yes--

199
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:33,250
Come in, please.

200
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,708
So... How's that arm
of yours doing?

201
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,291
Fine... It still feels kind of
heavy and I'm not used to it,

202
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,250
but it's going
to work.

203
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,166
I'd like you to join me on the
roof of the main building.

204
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,166
Okay, I
will.

205
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,333
It's cold out,
so put this on.

206
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:59,375
Are you sure that I'm
allowed to accept this?

207
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,916
I'll be waiting for
you on the roof.

208
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,791
Glad you could
make it.

209
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,791
Come check
this out.

210
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,500
What's that?
A telescope?

211
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,666
[Jose] Isn't
she beautiful?

212
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,458
I wanted to be able to
show you the stars...

213
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,458
and not through
a rifle scope.

214
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,625
This is... This is the first
time I've seen stars...

215
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,583
[Henrietta] What
made you do this?

216
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,166
I haven't seen a better
night for stargazing

217
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,416
in a long
very time.

218
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,000
And it's your reward for
all of your hard work today.

219
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:01,708
You're not angry?
About today?

220
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,083
Do you want me to be?

221
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,791
Take a look...
Orion's bright tonight.

222
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,791
[Jose] In Greek mythology,
Orion was mistakenly killed

223
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,125
by his love,
the goddess Artemis...

224
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,375
Stricken with grief over
her love's death...

225
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,875
She carried Orion's
body high into the sky

226
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,666
on her silver
Moon-chariot,

227
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,250
and she left him in
the darkest place

228
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,041
in the heavens where he
would shine the brightest.

229
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,333
[Jose] Such a sad story.

230
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,041
[Henrietta]
Jose...

231
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,416
You know everything,
don't you?

232
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,333
[Jose] Yeah. Yeah, I do.
