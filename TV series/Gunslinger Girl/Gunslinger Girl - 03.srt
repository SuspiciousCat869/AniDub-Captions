1
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,708
What exactly have you been
doing this whole time?!

2
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,625
I've been here! The one
place you're too busy for!

3
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,125
I take care of
her! By myself!

4
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,750
Do you know how much
these hospital bills are?!

5
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,833
[Rico] Because of my sickness,
my parents argue constantly.

6
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,541
They try to do right.
Follow the doctor's orders.

7
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,833
And 'sign away on seventeen
separate documents'.

8
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,750
I've heard
that one a lot.

9
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,333
I had never left that hospital
room once in my whole life.

10
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,875
But then on my
birthday two years ago,

11
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:55,250
I got a new body and now I'm
free to move however I want to.

12
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,958
[Henrietta] Good
morning, Rico.

13
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,875
Oh, Good morning.

14
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,375
I was about to do my laundry.
You wanna come with?

15
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,750
Yeah.

16
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,833
[Rico] I really like my new
life here at the agency.

17
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,708
Everyone here
is so nice.

18
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:21,333
As long as I follow the
rules and do like I'm told,

19
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:26,041
I know they'll keep being
nice. It's the... It's like...

20
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,666
The quiet
morning air

21
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,916
and the smell of fresh
laundry detergent

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,125
coming across it. The sky
and the clouds and the sun.

23
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,000
And my
own body.

24
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,375
No matter how
hard you look,

25
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,458
you just can't find any of
those things in a hospital bed.

26
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,708
[Triela] Henrietta, do you know
what our schedule is today?

27
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,625
I think we're training at the
outdoor shooting range later.

28
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,916
Sounds fun.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,458
I thought you didn't
like shooting practice...

30
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,625
Anything is better
than sitting through

31
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,208
another one of
Hilshire's boring lectures.

32
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:11,208
Triela. Page thirty-six. Begin
from Shylock's line please.

33
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,875
I don't get what you mean,
but it's fun to sit and watch.

34
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,708
There's still so much I
don't know. It's interesting.

35
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,666
[Claes] Yes, you're interested
in everything. We know, Rico.

36
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,541
So, Henrietta, do you have
any favorite classes so far?

37
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,291
How about music?

38
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,708
If I'm not mistaken,

39
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,958
I've heard you around
playing a violin.

40
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,625
[Claes] Have you always
liked the violin?

41
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,250
Did you ask for lessons?

42
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,041
Not really...
I like it...

43
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:26,166
But Jose suggested it...
He got sorta mad at me--

44
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,708
So, even though
you never asked,

45
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,875
he's pushing violin
lessons on you?

46
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,250
Not pushing... I really
like playing the violin.

47
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,416
I didn't mean
it like that.

48
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,833
Jose thinks the world
of you, Henrietta.

49
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,708
Do you think so?

50
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,791
That was
terrible.

51
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,875
Don't just listen to me-
hear what I have to say.

52
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,458
You need to be
more flexible.

53
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,375
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,000
Now, fire ten
second bursts.

55
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,250
Raise your
arms higher

56
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,833
and line up the front
sight with the rear.

57
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,375
Only when you have your
line of sight do you fire.

58
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,375
Hilshire, you're
not actually trying

59
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,541
to instruct
Triela are you?

60
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,041
Not much. She always
fares better on her own.

61
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,500
With a brother like you
what choice does she have?

62
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,583
Speaking of,
where's Angelica?

63
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,250
Her implants aren't
functioning well,

64
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,833
so I'm letting her rest.

65
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,875
She'll be out of commission for
a while, during recalibration.

66
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,208
How about some
news on our next job?

67
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,541
Some hot shot politician.

68
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,541
He made an inquiry regarding
'personal business.'

69
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,208
Of course,
that's just great...

70
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,625
I don't want these girls

71
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,375
wasting their talents
on meaningless jobs.

72
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,708
[Hilshire] Telling them
to kill the bad guys

73
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,458
and flush out the Republican
Faction's safehouses

74
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,666
is one thing.

75
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,875
'Personal business'
that's something else.

76
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,750
Anyway, sounds like a job
for Special Ops Section One.

77
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,083
Not us.

78
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,333
That's just the problem.

79
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,208
This politician is a big
supporter of all of us

80
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,041
over here in Cybernetics
Section Two.

81
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,500
We have to say yes.

82
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,208
You should always be
worried about those

83
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,958
who favor you
for no reason.

84
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,666
Lose your footing during the
real thing and you're dead.

85
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,833
Yes, sir.

86
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:50,750
We'll be there assembled and
on time, sir. Out... Jose...

87
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,125
We have a date for
the next mission.

88
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:57,666
You're gonna have to put
a hold on your training.

89
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,000
[Chief] Jean, if you'd run
down the plan for us...

90
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,333
[Jean] Thank
you, sir.

91
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,458
This is the mark, Congressman
Mascart of the Radical Party.

92
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,416
Our mission commences
one week from today

93
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,875
at the Villa
Gadd Hotel,

94
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,541
where the Congressman
will be staying.

95
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,041
Before each session
of Parliament,

96
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,708
he and his
secretaries set up here

97
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,916
and scour over documents
nearly twenty-four-seven.

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,541
He's staying in room number
two on the third floor.

99
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,125
So... we've booked
all of the other rooms

100
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,791
on that floor
anonymously...

101
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,916
You don't have to worry
about anyone coming up

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,791
during the operation...
The details are here,

103
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,250
but if you have questions...
now's the time.

104
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,750
Jean... Is this mission what
our congressman asked us to do?

105
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,083
Yes.

106
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,291
I've been told he and
Mascart oppose each other

107
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,375
in regards to the
amendment of the Conrad Act.

108
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,291
Mascart is very vocal in
his criticism of terrorism,

109
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,541
so we have
plenty of options

110
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,291
when it comes to
placing the blame.

111
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,666
[Jean] Hilshire
and Marco,

112
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,583
you two to gather our teams
and prep for departure.

113
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,958
We're on
top of it.

114
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,458
Hey, Ferro...

115
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,958
It almost seems like Mascart's
a criminal in all of this.

116
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,708
There's no 'almost' about
it. He is a criminal.

117
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,166
Which you don't seem to
have a problem with, Ferro.

118
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,208
Haven't you ever heard the
term 'love thy neighbor'?

119
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,583
Where in your little saying

120
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,416
does it tell you that
they're gonna love us back?

121
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,708
[Black Detective] You've
got no sense of romance.

122
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,708
[Alfonso] Maybe
you should teach her.

123
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,500
[Black Detective]
Ha, ha. Very funny.

124
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,500
[Jean] Here's
the plan, Rico.

125
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,083
The mark is staying in
that hotel across the street.

126
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,875
After a successful
assassination...

127
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,708
they'll find hair
and footprints...

128
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,083
This will lead them back to
the Republican Faction...

129
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,208
Today's a survey.

130
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,083
We'll check inside later.

131
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,416
[Rico]
Right.

132
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,750
But for now,

133
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,375
I want you to go and
check out the back entrance.

134
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,750
Tell me what you see.

135
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,041
Can I help you
with something?

136
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,791
You know this area out here
is for employees only.

137
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,541
Do you work here?

138
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,791
Uh-uh, I don't...
I was just...

139
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,125
Oh, yeah...
I get it.

140
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,625
You were looking for a
place to play your instrument.

141
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,250
What is it that you're
carrying? A violin, right?

142
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:07,458
Uh, yeah.

143
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,666
You can play it right
here if you want to.

144
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,833
I'd love to hear...

145
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,375
What kind of songs
do you like to play?

146
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,500
I, uh...
I can't play.

147
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,333
Oh, why not?

148
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:20,375
I'm not any good... and I
don't really know any songs.

149
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,500
So, you're not a musician yet.
You're still an apprentice...

150
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,083
Like me at the hotel.

151
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,041
My name is Emilio.
What's your name?

152
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,750
Rico.

153
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,250
Weird... I thought
that was a boy's name...

154
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,125
But in a cool way it
does kind of suit you...

155
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,375
I used to know a boy
named Rico once...

156
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,625
This boy seems to like
talking nicely to me.

157
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,708
I wonder if all boys
are like this one.

158
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,750
I'm not sure what I should
say to him. I'm nervous.

159
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:54,458
Yeah, my dad, he... just
kinda up and left me...

160
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,583
so now...
it's up to me

161
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,708
to make it on my
own in this world.

162
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,708
I see.

163
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,375
So, I told
you about my dad.

164
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,541
What does your
dad do for a living?

165
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,125
Uh... He's probably with the
city's waterworks bureau

166
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,583
or something.

167
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,291
Probably? You mean the two
of you don't live together?

168
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,541
No, I've been on my own
for a couple of years now.

169
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,083
Oh, you must live in
one of those dormitories

170
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,083
that they have at
the good schools.

171
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:22,083
Well, uh... It's
something like that.

172
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,541
Don't you ever
get lonely there,

173
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:27,875
never being able to see
your mother or father?

174
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,708
No, it's not that bad...

175
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,750
I have some friends there.

176
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,750
[Emillio]
Friends are good.

177
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,708
She's taking her time.

178
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,333
Yep.

179
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,333
She's incapable of doing
anything by herself.

180
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,375
So then I just told Daniel
right to his face, I said...

181
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,375
'I may be just a
poor kid now,

182
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:58,083
but someday I'll make it big
and laugh at all of you!'

183
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,708
...That's what I said,
I couldn't believe it.

184
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,541
Emilio?

185
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,375
Yeah?

186
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,041
You should get back to work.
You've been out here a while.

187
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,083
Is something wrong?

188
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,541
No, it's just...

189
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,583
It's time for me to get
back to where I live...

190
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,666
And you'll get in trouble if
you don't go back to work.

191
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,416
I guess
you're right.

192
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,666
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,666
Wait...
Rico!

194
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,500
I work
everyday,

195
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,958
so if you ever
wanna play a song,

196
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,041
come back I'd
like to hear it.

197
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:37,916
Okay...
Goodbye... Emilio.

198
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,833
Emilio, enough
of your slacking!

199
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,708
Daniel, you won't
believe what just happened!

200
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,166
What's that?

201
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,541
Just now, I met this cute
girl out here in the alley!

202
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,791
In the
alley? Huh...

203
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,333
Oh, yeah, she was
so nice to talk to.

204
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,000
She was blonde and
carried an Amati violin...

205
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,375
I think she'll come back
and play for me sometime.

206
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,833
Oh, yeah... Love
at first sight, kid?

207
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,958
Take my advice.
Forget about her.

208
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,208
What?!
Why?!

209
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,583
You think a cute girl
with an expensive violin

210
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,916
is interested
in you..?

211
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,541
The elite don't hang
with the help, kid.

212
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,500
You're
late, Rico.

213
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,375
Sorry.

214
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,375
Did you happen to
run into anybody?

215
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,250
No.

216
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,041
If you are
seen on a job,

217
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:45,000
it is your duty to kill who
sees you... Is this clear?

218
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,208
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,666
Henrietta, I
have a question.

220
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,916
What is it?

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,791
Is it difficult learning
how to play the violin?

222
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,958
It's not too bad.
Why do you ask?

223
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,583
When I surveyed the
mission site earlier today...

224
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,625
Yeah...

225
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,958
I met this boy. His
name was Emilio.

226
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,875
He's a bellhop who works
at our mark's hotel...

227
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,875
Really?

228
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,666
I think he mistook
my weapon case

229
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,041
for some kind of
violin case...

230
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,500
And he asked me to
play for him sometime.

231
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,625
I can only play some practice
things like scales and stuff.

232
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,500
I don't think
I'd be much help.

233
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,375
Oh, that's okay.

234
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,916
Anyway...

235
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,666
It would probably be pretty
hard for you to see him again.

236
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,041
Sure... You
have a point.

237
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,458
Then again... Maybe he
fell in love with you

238
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:51,500
and wonders if he'll ever
get to see you again.

239
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,416
I wouldn't know how to figure
out anything like that...

240
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,750
But if anyone ever felt
like that about me,

241
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:01,750
especially if it was
Emilio, it'd make me happy.

242
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,833
Rico, if you wanna try my
violin... I'll show you how.

243
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:06,916
Really?

244
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,541
Sure.

245
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,750
Your turn.

246
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,041
There you go. Now relax
your right hand a bit.

247
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,875
Isn't that sound
just the loveliest?

248
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,041
Lobby
surveillance here...

249
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,583
Is the hotel...
delivering room service now?

250
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,250
Are his bodyguards
with him?

251
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,250
[Hilshire] No, just
he and his secretary,

252
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,291
asking for
room service.

253
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,041
How is our bug
working in there?

254
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,041
The room is loud
and clear, boss.

255
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,708
He said he was getting
ready to take a shower...

256
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,791
Should we wait?

257
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,708
Yes... We'll time
out until he's in.

258
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,625
[Jean] Henrietta and Triela,
you two remain on standby.

259
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,958
I want us to have as little
visibility as possible.

260
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,416
Room service here.

261
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,083
It's finished.

262
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,750
[Jean] Return immediately.
I'm sending in the cleaners.

263
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,125
I'm leaving right now.

264
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,250
Jean, we have a
hotel employee.

265
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,416
He just walked
onto the third floor.

266
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,916
[Jean] Rico. Rico,
do you read me?

267
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,833
Hi, Rico.

268
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,250
What are you doing here?

269
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:44,750
And why are you wearing a hotel
uniform...? I don't get it.

270
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,958
I can't... I can't
remember what to say.

271
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,083
What do I say at
a time like this?

272
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,708
Rico...

273
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,541
What are those words
I'm looking for?

274
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,875
Of course...
I remember.

275
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,916
I am sorry.

276
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,083
Every morning when I wake up,

277
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,416
my first thought
is always a worry.

278
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,541
I worry if my body
will still be here.

279
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,750
And it's always
wonderful discovering

280
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,750
that my body
still works.

281
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:39,416
Nothing could ever be
the same kind of relief.

282
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,458
One day I'm locked
in my own head,

283
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:46,541
and now I have a body
to move however I want.

284
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,083
At the Social
Welfare Agency...

285
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:54,583
I really like my life here.
I can finally be myself.
