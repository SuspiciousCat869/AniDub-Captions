1
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,833
What do you think?
What if Jose's mad at me?

2
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:13,125
I heard you put on
quite a show in Sicily.

3
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,458
Maybe I over
did it a little.

4
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,458
Yeah, do
you think?

5
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,083
I just hope he's
not mad at me.

6
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,208
I wouldn't worry. When I saw
him, he seemed pretty normal.

7
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,750
Really?

8
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,208
Mm hmm.

9
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,791
I hope you're right.

10
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,333
Henrietta, Triela, move out.

11
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,333
Good job guys.

12
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,583
Stay
focused.

13
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,583
Yes sir.

14
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,583
See what I mean?

15
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,250
Uh-huh.

16
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,041
Next team- Angelica,
Rico, move out.

17
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:17,708
Okay!

18
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,583
Angelica!

19
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,083
Are you okay?

20
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,166
Angelica's gone down!

21
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,875
Shut the program down.

22
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,916
You okay?

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,583
I'm gonna
be fine.

24
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,500
Marco... I'm sorry... 
See, I'm okay now.

25
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,625
Not when you're limping
around like that, you're not.

26
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,791
Have Ferro take you
back to the infirmary.

27
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,458
Yes, sir.

28
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,041
Maybe you should
have waited

29
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,416
before getting her
back into training.

30
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,958
You're responsible
for being aware

31
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,083
of Angelica's limitations.

32
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,750
Look, she practically begged
me to let her do it, so I did.

33
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,458
Back to the
training room!

34
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,708
Yes, sir!

35
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,250
First the problem with Elsa,
and now Angelica's injury.

36
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,958
Seems we've had
some setbacks.

37
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,333
It's just like
we expected.

38
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,458
We'll have setbacks
and progress-

39
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,833
it's all part of the process.

40
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,916
Come now, why don't you
just level with us?

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,625
Section 2 is
not working out.

42
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,250
You should just be honest
about it and admit it.

43
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,916
That's only
your opinion.

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,541
Overall, I think
there's still a lot

45
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,041
of potential
in Section 2.

46
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's try giving
it some more time.

47
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,750
Be honest, Chief... 
What's wrong?

48
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,375
It's not going
quite as we planned.

49
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:42,375
You see... they're
still very much human.

50
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,875
You're going to have to
start making progress soon.

51
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,500
I can't keep putting
them off forever.

52
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,041
Yes, I know.

53
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,958
According to our source
within the Republican Faction,

54
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,125
they're planning to kidnap
Senator Viste's daughter.

55
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,208
What
source?

56
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,833
Fillipo Adani-

57
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:07,250
He handles the cash for
their operations. He's solid.

58
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,666
Adani says they're going
to grab Caterina Viste.

59
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,333
Fortunately, she's matches up
with one of Section Two's girls

60
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,500
in age and appearance.

61
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,083
They'll kidnap
one of our cyborgs

62
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,875
in place of the
Senator's daughter.

63
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,875
Then we take 'em down.

64
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,875
A cyborg as a decoy?
That's risky.

65
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,958
Yeah, he's right, I
don't know about this...

66
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:31,375
This is what Section Two's
for, or course it's risky!

67
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,625
But, what if we...

68
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,458
Section Two's under a
microscope right now...

69
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:41,208
We're going to have to push the
envelope if we want to survive.

70
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,291
We'll use Claes
as the decoy.

71
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,708
They're saying our next mission
is going to be a big one.

72
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,875
Oh, yeah... And
according to Hillshire

73
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,583
it's going to be
dangerous, too.

74
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,916
Are you scared, Claes?
To be used as a decoy?

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,458
Not really-

76
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,166
Is it that grain
of wheat thing?

77
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,625
Not at all, I'm just
doing what I'm told.

78
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,125
Wheat...?
What wheat?

79
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,750
A grain of wheat must
fall to the ground

80
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,083
before it can
do any good.

81
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,916
New life springs
from fallen grains.

82
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,791
The moral is that nothing good
happens without some sacrifice.

83
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,375
Marco.

84
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,375
Oh, won't you please let me
take part in the mission!

85
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:39,375
This is for real... I cannot
tolerate another failure.

86
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:44,625
I'll do my very best Marco,
I promise... Please, let me!

87
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,250
I'll think about it.

88
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,041
Thank you...

89
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,500
Jean, the car is on
its way downtown.

90
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,416
Copy that.

91
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,250
Ready?

92
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,291
Let's go.

93
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,625
We've got the
transmitter's signal...

94
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,333
The car's heading
north now...

95
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,666
Away from
downtown.

96
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,041
Were there any problems
tracking the vehicle?

97
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,416
We placed a tracking beacon
in one of Claes' teeth

98
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,541
before we sent her out.

99
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,500
And we also scattered
Section 2 lookouts

100
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,166
on all the major roads
into and out of Rome.

101
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,583
But the vehicle headed into
the mountains north of town

102
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,916
and we lost the signal.

103
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,208
The terrorists have already
contacted the Senator

104
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,625
at his home.

105
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,000
We're holding their
comrades in a local prison.

106
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,541
They want them released.

107
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,083
At least we know they
haven't figured out

108
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,708
she's not the real girl.

109
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,083
And if they do find
out she's a decoy-

110
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,541
Claes- she hardly any
combat experience.

111
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:24,166
If they find out she's a
decoy, they will kill her.

112
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,875
The whole thing's
a big mess...

113
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,166
Chief-

114
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,541
I'm calling a friend
in the military.

115
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,458
For backup.

116
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,916
I knew we could
strike a deal.

117
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,541
Would you mind if I spoke
with her alone for a moment?

118
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,708
Alright, make it
quick, okay-

119
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,250
Hi there. What are
you doing, studying?

120
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,083
No... it's just
a book on plants.

121
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,625
Reading about
plants, huh?

122
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,916
You know, the plant
life in the north

123
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,083
is totally different
than the south.

124
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,958
Yes... Evergreens are more
common in the mountains

125
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,541
where the altitude is higher.

126
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,041
So, aren't you afraid?

127
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:33,250
Not really... Besides, I find
reading to be therapeutic.

128
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:37,125
I've always liked reading,
ever since I was a little girl.

129
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,458
And, besides...

130
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,333
Someone like me could
never be a grain of wheat.

131
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,000
Well-

132
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,916
Good luck.

133
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,125
Thanks! See you later.

134
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,791
That's odd... They don't care
if the girl sees their faces.

135
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,291
Yeah, they must be
planning to kill her...

136
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,583
What a bunch of idiots,

137
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,041
if they only knew who
they were holding.

138
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:09,583
I tell ya, I hope that kid
teaches them a good lesson.

139
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,583
A grain of
wheat, huh...?

140
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,208
What did you say?

141
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,666
Forget about it, let's
just get out of here.

142
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,125
Hey, Chief!

143
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,541
The city police just
received an anonymous call.

144
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,291
What?

145
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,333
They're at a villa up
north, in the mountains.

146
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,375
There's even a sketch
of the villa's layout.

147
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,625
How reliable is
this information?

148
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,958
The R.F. could have
leaked this stuff

149
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,708
just to throw
off the police.

150
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,750
Apparently the anonymous
caller was a woman.

151
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,083
A woman?

152
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,583
Well, it looks like
that's the info we got.

153
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,416
We can send a team
out to recon the area

154
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,166
but that'll take time,
which we don't have.

155
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,458
And, the whole mission will
fail if we hesitate any longer.

156
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,958
I know it's a
risky proposition

157
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,916
however we have no
choice but to move in

158
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,333
and take down
the villa.

159
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,541
Okay, we're going to
approach the target location

160
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,041
from the mountains on
the southeast side.

161
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:34,166
We'll move out in teams- Jose
and Henrietta, Jean and Rico.

162
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,083
You two teams will engage
the front entrance

163
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,000
and draw as much fire
from the terrorists

164
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,916
as you can
that direction.

165
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,416
My team will enter
from the terrace.

166
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,125
Hold up!

167
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,000
Good luck...

168
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,916
All right,
understood.

169
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,750
The army recon team
has reacquired

170
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,125
Claes'
transmitter signal.

171
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,000
Looks like this
was the right move.

172
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,000
But the show's
not over yet.

173
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,458
It's vital that Section 2
take the whole terrorist cell.

174
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,583
Angelica--

175
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,583
It's okay just
remain calm.

176
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,875
Get up here!

177
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,458
We're in position-
what's you status?

178
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,916
We're on the roof now,
moving into position.

179
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,583
We'll move out
in three minutes.

180
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,083
Synchronize
your watch.

181
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:52,750
Five, four, three,
two, one, mark!

182
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,125
Rico, you cover
us from here.

183
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,250
Got it.

184
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,916
All right...
let's go.

185
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,875
'kay

186
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,250
What the hell
is this?

187
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,833
What the...?
The cops?

188
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:22,291
Nope.

189
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,791
All the guards are dead!
We're under attack!

190
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,625
Angelica!

191
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,458
Where are you going?!

192
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,916
Triela, what's up?

193
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,750
Angelica took
off upstairs!

194
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,041
Don't move!

195
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,041
You brought this
all on yourself.

196
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,666
Angelica!

197
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,833
Claes...
Are you okay?

198
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,416
Angelica's been hit!

199
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,125
Angelica?

200
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,375
Sorry
Marco...

201
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,916
You screwed
up bad.

202
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,666
What the hell were you
trying to do in there?

203
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,125
Trying to get
us all killed?!

204
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,125
Ugh... you're
freakin useless!

205
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,458
Marco, ease up!

206
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,416
How you feeling,
Angelica?

207
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,250
Fine.

208
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,416
Well, you sure seem
to be doing better.

209
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,583
Soon you'll be
walking around

210
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,958
and you'll get to come
back to the dorm.

211
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,625
I think you all
know the truth.

212
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,208
What?

213
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,916
We're all
going to die!

214
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We'll all die empty and
alone! It's the truth!

215
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,583
Marco's so angry at me
that I wish I could die now

216
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,708
and get it over with...
Why can't I just die?!

217
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,375
If you want to die
then kill yourself!

218
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,958
I should never have
bothered saving you!

219
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,208
Claes?!

220
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,708
I couldn't see her eyes well
enough from behind her glasses

221
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,875
to tell if she was
crying or just angry.

222
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,708
But I wish
I could have.

223
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,583
I know that what
Angelica said...

224
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,750
We're all
going to die...

225
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,750
Echoed true in
Claes' mind

226
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,291
just like they did
for the rest of us.
