1
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,833
She's my sister.

2
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,083
We're always together,

3
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:33,125
so we're known on the
inside as 'fratello'.

4
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:38,375
Fratello... It means
siblings... brother and sister.

5
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,458
Some people crack jokes about
it, but what are you gonna do?

6
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,208
It's as close to the
truth as you can get.

7
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,875
[Marco] Chief, we strongly
believe he has knowledge of the

8
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,166
Republican Faction's weapons
smuggling... I suggest, for

9
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,541
safety, we might want to take
down all of their safehouses.

10
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,833
Fine... I want the
Hilshire-Triela fratello

11
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,083
to cover the
southern safehouse.

12
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,500
Sir, consider it
taken care of.

13
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,291
[Marco] But the
Jean-Rico team...

14
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,041
They're going to need
at least some kind of support,

15
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,375
don't you think?

16
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,333
I'll take some Section 2
members and we can cover

17
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,833
the building's perimeter...
But I'd want at least two more

18
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,541
fratello to help us
secure the location.

19
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,500
Jean, this is Hilshire.

20
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,958
Look... We've got the southern
safehouse locked down,

21
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,250
but there's an issue...

22
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,291
Our target isn't anywhere
that we can find...

23
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,000
It is possible that he's
already moved down to your end.

24
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,666
Double-check that.

25
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,041
[Hilshire] Roger. I'll work over
those that are still breathing.

26
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,750
I'll notify you the second
I figure anything out.

27
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,416
[Phone] What's going on over
there? Somebody answer me!

28
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,708
Can Jose... handle this?

29
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,333
Uh, Chief... In my
opinion, they're not ready

30
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,166
for group operations.

31
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,666
[Marco] 
Jean, let it go.

32
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,208
Well I think they are.
I'm adding Jose and Henrietta

33
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,708
to the Jean-Rico team...
You got that... Jean?

34
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,791
Sir.

35
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,416
[Jean] We got a message from
the Hilshire-Triela team.

36
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,666
Looks like we are the
ones favored to win today.

37
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,291
Just get a positive ID
on the target first.

38
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,333
And listen, if
he's not with them,

39
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,041
I want you to
let them go.

40
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,083
Don't do
anything. Got it?

41
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,416
[Jose] Let's go.

42
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,416
[Hilshire] Ferro, is the
entrance clear?

43
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,541
Alfonso and I have
covered the front.

44
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:52,416
Amadeo and Giorgio have the
back. The only other way for

45
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
this mark to get out is through
the window you're staring at.

46
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,500
[Jean]
Wait for my orders.

47
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,000
[Ferro] Affirmative.

48
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,500
[Jean] Rico, focus on
any shadows you see

49
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,000
behind the blinds.

50
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,916
Yes sir.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,583
[Head Baddie] The southern
hideout's been attacked.

52
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,708
[All Baddies]
What?!

53
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,500
[Head Baddie] It would
seem that someone

54
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,666
has coming looking
for him, gentlemen.

55
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,166
Then that means... 
that they might...

56
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,708
They might
end up here.

57
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,375
If I understand
it correctly...

58
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,875
they were attacked
by a young girl.

59
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,458
A girl?

60
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,375
Yeah.

61
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,416
I know...

62
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,333
it sounds crazy, but, recently
I've been hearing rumors of

63
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,333
a secret agency
that's been training

64
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,750
little girls
as assasins.

65
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:50,833
[doorbell rings]

66
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,625
Who is it, Louie?

67
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,166
You won't believe this, but
it's a guy in a suit and a...

68
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,958
[Head Baddie]
A what?

69
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,041
Uh... A little girl.

70
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,500
Don't open it.

71
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,708
I'll get them
outta your hair.

72
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,333
Louie! I said don't!

73
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,500
Good morning, sir.

74
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:20,000
I apologize for intruding like
this. Do you have a minute?

75
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,125
No. What do
you want?

76
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,875
Just a few moments
of your time.

77
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,666
I am a reporter
from Libero Italia.

78
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,333
What is it you're reporting?

79
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,916
I heard that Mr. Scallo of
the Costelo Company was here...

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,333
...and I would love
to get an exclusive.

81
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,958
Yeah well, there ain't
nobody here by that name,

82
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,666
so good luck finding
your interview.

83
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,041
Wait, I'm... positive that
he's in this building.

84
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:50,083
Yeah? And I just told you that
you got the wrong room, chief.

85
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,541
You hard of hearing?

86
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,041
No...

87
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,833
Then maybe it's a learning
disorder. Your guy ain't here!

88
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,958
Sorry, I...

89
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,291
Now, get lost before
I pop your eyes out

90
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,541
and make your
sister watch!

91
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,291
[Submachine Baddie] Louie,
what's going on--

92
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,416
Brother...

93
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,208
You planning on visiting
every hospital in Italy?

94
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,833
No, uh...
I'm not.

95
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,666
I've already made
my decision.

96
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,500
Why does it have
to be children?

97
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:49,166
These kids have been
through enough already.

98
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,458
It's the agency's call.

99
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,000
The physical alterations,
the brainwashing...

100
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,333
All the conditioning seems
to take much better,

101
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,208
the younger
the subject.

102
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,083
This is the work of the Social
Welfare Agency, isn't it?

103
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,541
Yes.

104
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,000
[Doctor] Our government's
created quite an impressive

105
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,833
organization. To see it
actively aiding the seriously

106
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,541
injured, I mean, I never
thought they'd follow through.

107
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,833
Dr. Masi, we
came because...

108
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,000
We have heard that your
facility is housing

109
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,416
a very seriously
injured girl.

110
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,875
Yes.

111
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,333
It was tragic... She's in
desperate need of your help.

112
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,125
Last week, her
family was massacred.

113
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,208
But the monsters
kept her alive.

114
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,458
Throughout the night,

115
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,500
the poor girl was
brutally assaulted.

116
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,166
And all the while, her
family members' bodies

117
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,041
lay sprawled,
lifeless, around her.

118
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,791
She's confided in us
thoughts of suicide.

119
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,041
[Ferro] Have you come up
with a name for her yet?

120
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,166
[Jose]
Henrietta.

121
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,458
Henrietta it is, then.

122
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,500
Thank you.

123
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,083
Once she gets used
to the facility,

124
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:25,833
we'll move her into
a room with Rico.

125
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:29,041
She's awake.

126
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:54,416
[Jose] I see
you're awake.

127
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,666
You
thirsty?

128
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,375
No,
thanks.

129
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,416
My name
is Jose.

130
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,375
You're up
early.

131
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,916
Did you get
any sleep?

132
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,166
No.

133
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,125
Why not?

134
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,083
You told me to get
proficient quickly, Jose.

135
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,375
Stop it.

136
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,208
[Jose] Don't use your
sight during practice.

137
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,041
You'll never have time
to use it in combat,

138
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,750
so don't get spoiled by it.

139
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,958
Just shoot in the general
direction of the target.

140
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,375
At close range,
it won't matter

141
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,875
what part of their body
you lodge a bullet,

142
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,750
it'll still keep them
from going very far.

143
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,916
Average, Jose.

144
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:04,833
[Head Baddie]
Hey--

145
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,875
Throw your grenade!

146
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,333
Take him.

147
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,208
[Worker] Good. Now, when you
and your pal there is finished

148
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,791
down there, I got, like,
two tons of rebar I need hauled

149
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,208
all the way
over to site B.

150
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,833
[Jose]
Now you've done it.

151
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,750
Ferro... The
mission has failed.

152
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,916
I Repeat: Mission
has failed.

153
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,500
[Ferro] Roger.
We're on our way.

154
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,166
Yeah.

155
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,541
Henrietta, why did
you lose control?

156
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,625
Uh...

157
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,041
This isn't like you...

158
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:32,083
I've never seen you
lose it like that.

159
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,958
Your arm's been hit.

160
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,958
[Jose] Are you okay?

161
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,416
[Henrietta]
Yes...

162
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,208
Jose, we're here.

163
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:58,333
Ferro. The witness isn't here.
Judging by their reaction,

164
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,500
I'd say he's hiding
in the building somewhere.

165
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,333
I'll put people on it...
Alfonso, Amadeo...

166
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,125
start at the rooftop
and work your way down.

167
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,666
Giorgio, watch the perimeter.

168
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,375
[Jose] Let's go home.

169
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:38,083
Please, don't
shoot! I surrender!

170
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,375
[Jean] Jose,

171
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,000
you need to increase her
level of conditioning...

172
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:50,166
You've got to put a bigger
collar on your hunting dog.

173
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,791
I think you're
wrong about that.

174
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,375
Too much conditioning will... 
will shorten her lifespan.

175
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:59,791
[Jean] Then we just prep a new
patient once she's used up.

176
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,875
You're too emotionally attached
to a tool of the trade.

177
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,291
Jean... enough.

178
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,041
She may have a few issues...

179
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,041
But she's an
excellent assassin...

180
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:14,416
It would be wasteful to dispose
of Henrietta... Anyway...

181
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,666
We got what we came for,
and lost none of our own...

182
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,625
You need to learn to take a
broader perspective of things.

183
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,416
Sir.

184
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,250
Jose... As you know, each
handler is responsible for

185
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,500
the actions of his
own girl in the field.

186
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,250
Now, if you think
Henrietta can work with

187
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,875
little conditioning, then I'd
like for you to give it a shot.

188
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,375
However, further mistakes
are inexcusable...

189
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:51,625
Please make certain this is a
lesson she understands.

190
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,708
[Jose]
Yes, sir.

191
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,916
[Jose] Henrietta stayed
as quiet as she could

192
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,166
when I first brought
her to the agency.

193
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,166
Not that I can
blame her.

194
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,166
Watching her family
get murdered.

195
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,625
How do you get over
something like that?

196
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,916
How could she wrap her head
around the fact that she,

197
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,916
out of everybody,
she survived.

198
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,333
When I first set eyes on
her at the national hospital,

199
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:38,791
her mind and her body were
ragged and worn-through.

200
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,708
I chose Henrietta
as my partner.

201
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,208
Was it because I wanted
to do something nice?

202
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,333
Or did I choose
her out of pity?

203
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,916
Whatever it was, I knew
I wanted to help her.

204
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,916
[Triela]
Henrietta!

205
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,333
Rico just told me...

206
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,083
You flipped your lid
out there today.

207
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:41,458
I-I couldn't control it.
I just snapped.

208
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,541
Triela... I don't
know what to do.

209
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,166
[Triela]
Don't sweat it.

210
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,666
Hey -- I know! We can go
have a drink in Claes' room.

211
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,833
A drink?

212
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,041
Yeah. She's got
the best tea,

213
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,916
and I swear she puts
magic in her cakes.

214
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:10,083
You just wanted to make him
proud of you. That's all.

215
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,666
[Henrietta] Yeah...
I guess so...

216
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,750
But Triela...

217
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,000
Isn't that the only
thing any of us can do?

218
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,166
We all seek approval.

219
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,458
And if I were him...

220
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:27,875
that kind of devotion would
make me feel uncomfortable.

221
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,125
[Jose] Let's go.

222
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,083
Right.

223
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:14,791
[Henrietta]
Jose...

224
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,166
Is your arm hurting?

225
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,458
I only...

226
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,333
I just wanted to
help you, Jose.

227
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,791
[Jose] We'll have a
doctor take a look

228
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,208
at that arm as soon
as we get back.
