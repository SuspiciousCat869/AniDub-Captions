1
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,166
A toy?

2
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,416
Yeah. But can you
really call it that

3
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,291
when it's sole purpose is
to explode and kill people?

4
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,750
This one's a lot weaker.
Not at all like the others.

5
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,375
The timer, the connections,
the explosive used.

6
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,166
It's all way too
amateur to be the same.

7
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,583
I'd be surprised if the
thing even detonated.

8
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,333
So what are you saying?
That this was a diversion?

9
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,958
That this wasn't
the real objective?

10
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,375
Okay, so what about the planned
attack on the National Museum?

11
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,833
We've come across bits and
pieces of intelligence,

12
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,083
but nothing solid.

13
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,416
It's fleeting
information like this

14
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,125
that tickles the
analysts instincts,

15
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,958
sometimes making
their imaginations work

16
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,250
harder than
we'd like...

17
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,875
They think the
militant factionists

18
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,875
are chomping
at the bit.

19
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:07,000
I see... But your people
don't believe that, do they?

20
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:11,125
What's really starting to bug
me is this amateur subway bomb

21
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,666
and how it
all fits in.

22
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,708
It doesn't make
much sense.

23
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,083
The factionists are incapable
of making their own bomb.

24
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,291
So they'd have to hire
someone to build it...

25
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,875
Perhaps they made this
shoddy bomb to...

26
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,083
make it look like
the professionals

27
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,750
they can't hire
have lost their edge.

28
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,000
You know, you'd make a
good mystery writer.

29
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,666
Luckily, no injuries
were reported

30
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,625
and officials aren't
even certain that

31
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,541
the bomb
was made...

32
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,083
--What do you
think, Franco?

33
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,541
...by an established
terrorist group.

34
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,708
We knew from the start that
they couldn't make a bomb

35
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,416
to save their
own hide.

36
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,625
I'm talking about how they
thought they could lure us out

37
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,541
with a stupid
stunt like this.

38
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,625
The fools underestimated
us, that's for sure.

39
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,250
They'll get no
help from us.

40
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,291
Yeah... It's not
even worth our time.

41
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,583
That man in the corner with his
back to us is Enrico Perdini.

42
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,291
He's an ultra
left wing terrorist

43
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,625
within the
Republican Faction...

44
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,583
and responsible for last years
bombing in Republic Square.

45
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,416
As well as four other
bombings in recent years.

46
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,916
Busy guy.

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,333
So tell me, Henrietta? Do you
hear anything of interest?

48
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,833
Mostly politics.
It's complicated.

49
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,875
He's going on and on
about the southern plant.

50
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,208
Keeps criticizing their
development work.

51
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,250
He said that... he
won't allow any more

52
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,916
of the northern
plant's tax funds

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,458
to be fed to the
southern plant...

54
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,625
And if their
plan succeeds,

55
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,416
the government will
be forced to rethink

56
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
its economic approach
for the 3rd quarter.

57
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,416
Changing his stripes
just to get more money.

58
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,166
You know when he first started
out he was an anarchist,

59
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,583
believe
it or not.

60
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,916
What made him change
his way of thinking?

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,625
Nothing... See, this guy
will work for any cause

62
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,750
to get funds for
his own movement.

63
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,291
The R.F.'s Lombardian Plains
Freedom Movement is supported

64
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,375
by northern capitalists
who have followed the flow

65
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,583
of European
right-wingers

66
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,625
and anti-globalism
activists for years.

67
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,833
Much different than these
left-wingers who rob banks

68
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,416
to finance
their agenda.

69
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Alright. Let's see if we
can persuade them to go

70
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
in the wrong
direction with this.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,333
They've lost sight of
the ultimate goal.

72
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,541
If we make them
relearn the meaning

73
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,750
of a just cause
they'll have...

74
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,416
No other
choice.

75
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,750
Right... I'll get the committee
moving on this right away...

76
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,666
I'll also make sure the
package gets delivered

77
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,500
no later than
two tonight.

78
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,583
When that time comes,

79
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,083
give them a lesson
they'll never forget...

80
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,750
Got that,
Henrietta?

81
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,333
Enzo.

82
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,333
Would it be all right with you
if we stopped watching Enrico?

83
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,916
That'd be fine. I've
assigned an auxiliary team

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,583
to trail him
from here on out.

85
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,291
We'll make our
move to capture him

86
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,291
once he's met with
the bomb makers.

87
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,083
Until then, continue
preparing for the assault

88
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,708
at the
branch office.

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,041
Speaking of, will one
fratello be enough?

90
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,250
I'd prefer to take the
bomb makers into custody

91
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,083
while they're
still alive.

92
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,416
That will complicate
things on our end,

93
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,000
but I'll call
headquarters

94
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,583
and see about getting a couple
more fratellos by this evening.

95
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,916
Thanks, Jose. You know
Rome Branch would help

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,041
if they could,

97
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,583
but they're running
thin on personnel.

98
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,250
All of their special ops are
already en route to the museum,

99
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,875
and those that are
left are better off

100
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,625
sitting behind
their desks.

101
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,458
[Jose] So what is
Enrico's plan?

102
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,625
To blow something up. That's
all we can be sure about...

103
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,625
This guy's willing to go
to any lengths necessary

104
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,083
to get what
he wants.

105
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,500
What's wrong,
sport?

106
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,125
Don't look so
disappointed.

107
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,708
Jose and
I love ya...

108
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:18,458
We just know we're gonna need
some extra hands for this job.

109
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,541
And if you and the
backup from HQ

110
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,458
take care of
things smoothly,

111
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,166
you'll be getting
a very nice reward.

112
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,083
What is this?

113
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,958
Perfume?

114
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,208
I suppose I'm guilty
of buying her too much,

115
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:38,041
though the things I buy for her
make up her salary. Trust me.

116
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,875
She more than deserves
everything she gets.

117
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,916
Well, kids are the most
adorable when they're her age.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,875
I can understand
buying her stuff.

119
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,125
After all, incentives to
do better can never hurt.

120
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,458
My own daughter
is old enough now

121
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,750
that she can go out
and party all night.

122
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,583
She rarely comes by the house
anymore to see her folks.

123
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,041
Tommaso.

124
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,916
I've brought the support
from headquarters.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,750
Fine.

126
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,000
Excuse me. This is where
they print the newspaper.

127
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,416
It's government property,
not a place for children.

128
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,958
It's alright,
Pietro.

129
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,583
She's the one I
told you about.

130
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,583
We already have a
room waiting for you.

131
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,708
You should take her
inside immediately.

132
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,416
Right.

133
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,375
Sorry about that, guys.
One of the biggest headaches

134
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,958
about acquiring
outside help...

135
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,333
is having to take their
snotty attitude with a smile.

136
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,958
I'm used
to it.

137
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,500
Well, you two can relax
here until this evening.

138
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,541
Is there anything else I
can get you while I'm out?

139
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,666
Yeah... Some spare
ammo for Henrietta...

140
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,875
Oh, and I could
use an FN57...

141
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,750
Jean, it's me...
Pattern B.

142
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,875
[Jose]
Right.

143
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,375
Yeah? That's right.

144
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,208
Understood.

145
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,583
Bad news.

146
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,375
He gave your
team the slip.

147
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,250
Yeah... And how
did you know that?

148
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,333
One of our teams caught up with
him when he got on the train.

149
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,541
They're on
him now.

150
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,583
Great.

151
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,541
He actually just
got off the subway.

152
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,333
Where?

153
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,291
At Cavour
Station. B line.

154
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,416
All right.
I'll follow him.

155
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,458
Okay.

156
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,916
Wait. Hold on...
If I'm not mistaken,

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,041
that's one stop
before the museum.

158
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,583
If he's at the museum do
you know his real target?

159
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,000
No.

160
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,500
At any rate... It won't matter
after we finish tonight.

161
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,125
I'll contact
our guys there.

162
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,333
The backup?

163
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,750
The backup is already
here, isn't it?

164
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,583
Yes. I called for
Rico and Triela...

165
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,625
We've planned for multiple
contingencies, just to be safe.

166
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,625
You know, it's going to
be at least a few hours

167
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,541
until we find out where
they're hiding...

168
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,666
Why don't you try to
get in a quick nap

169
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,875
while you decide what you
want for your reward?

170
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,416
Actually...

171
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,666
I already know
what I want.

172
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,500
[Enzo] He's not heading
for the museum anymore.

173
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,583
He's going in the
opposite direction...

174
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,458
just kind of
wandering around Rome...

175
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,458
What could his target be?

176
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,541
Enrico is back.

177
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,791
[Walkie-Talkie]
Copy.

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,250
Enrico... What are
you still doing in Rome?

179
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,166
You're supposed
to be gone.

180
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,666
I'd feel much more comfortable
making the deal in Ostia.

181
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,791
[Enrico]
Sorry, Flanca.

182
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,333
I wanted to scope out the
location first before I commit.

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,125
The longer you
stay in Rome,

184
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,375
the better the chances
you'll get nabbed

185
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,708
by this agency I've been
hearing so much about.

186
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,000
It's way too dangerous
to stay here.

187
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,666
Some guys were following me
earlier this afternoon...

188
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,875
but I was able to
shake them off.

189
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,375
I'm certain they have their
hands full right now...

190
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,333
the diversion at the museum
is working perfectly.

191
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,750
Anyway, I'd rather
do this tomorrow.

192
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,375
Just remember to
deliver it tonight

193
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,333
by the time we
already agreed on.

194
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,416
[Enrico] The bomb
arrangements are set.

195
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,083
Did we really have to use them?
I don't trust outsiders.

196
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,041
Yes, we did... Flanca and
Franco's bombs are nearly

197
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,750
impossible
to dismantle.

198
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,541
They're simply
the best in Italy.

199
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,916
That guy is
a lost cause.

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,541
You're right. There's
no cure for a fool.

201
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,125
Since it's an
order from above,

202
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,000
we'll help him
out on this one...

203
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,916
though to be honest I'd
prefer to have people

204
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,083
like him
just disappear.

205
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,416
Where are they
planting it?

206
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,666
If you
knew that,

207
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,750
you probably wouldn't
want to give it to them.

208
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,625
Should we go
through with this?

209
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't know.

210
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:49,041
If they really are serious
about doing it there...

211
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,000
Then maybe it wouldn't be such
a bad idea to give them a fake.

212
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,458
I'm gonna
get ready.

213
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,208
It's time, but the bomb
makers have yet to show up...

214
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,250
Remain on
standby.

215
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,291
Roger.

216
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,708
You positive these
two are gonna show up?

217
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,708
They'll
be here.

218
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,541
Enrico.

219
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,041
Something's going on... All
the traffic beyond the bridge.

220
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,791
It's just stopped.
There's nothing.

221
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:29,916
What?

222
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,291
Maybe there was an
accident or something.

223
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,000
It's too hard to
tell from here.

224
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,291
There's been an
accident reported.

225
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,333
The police have diverted
all traffic on this block

226
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,333
because of a three-car
pile-up east of here.

227
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,166
Damn it.

228
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,875
Hey, Simon.
You there?

229
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,416
Yeah.
Go ahead.

230
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,750
Can you see what's going
on across the river?

231
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,666
No, but I can hear police
sirens in the distance.

232
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,625
Go check
it out.

233
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,250
Yes, sir.

234
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,750
[Jose] Enzo...
It's started.

235
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,041
That's fine
with me...

236
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,875
If the bomb makers were
planning on showing,

237
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,708
they would have
been here by now.

238
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,625
Take Enrico alive... 
and grill the bastard.

239
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,125
Is camouflage really necessary
for a simple car accident?

240
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,625
Guess so.

241
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,291
Cut the lights! Everyone
stay away from the windows!

242
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,083
Lights out on
the third floor.

243
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,791
Southwest side of
the fourth building.

244
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,916
Enrico must be in
there. Can you see him?

245
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,958
No, sir. Not
from this position.

246
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,750
Understood... Hilshire...
What's going on down there?

247
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,833
I've just
ordered Triela

248
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,250
to climb the wall
on the west side.

249
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,958
Good. I'm sending Henrietta
in now so we can surround him.

250
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,916
[Henrietta] Please...
Don't shoot me.

251
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,166
Please...
Please help me.

252
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,791
There's scary people
downstairs... with guns.

253
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,458
And they...

254
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,958
What the hell? How did this
little kid get inside here?

255
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,541
Perfect timing... We can
use her as a hostage.

256
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,541
Don't worry. Come to us.
We'll keep you safe.

257
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,791
Hurry.

258
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,916
Hurry up before the bad
guys come after you.

259
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,083
Now be a
good girl...

260
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,083
Damn!

261
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,625
[Flanca]
Officers!

262
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,375
Did something happen here?
Why is the bridge closed?

263
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,500
There was an arrest
here last night.

264
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,291
This area's off
limits now.

265
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,083
Looks like Place D'Espagne
was able to avoid the bombing

266
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,708
without
her help.

267
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,916
Are you sure a
simple ice cream

268
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,166
is all you want
for your reward?

269
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,375
Especially in the
middle of winter.

270
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,958
I'm sure...

271
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,916
Didn't you know there's
a meaning behind ice cream

272
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,833
in Place D'Espagne?

273
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,666
Oh, my!

274
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,166
Are you okay?

275
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,083
Sorry... I'm really sorry.

276
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,583
Well, I'm glad your
ice cream is all right.

277
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,583
You are in Place
D'Espagne after all.

278
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,083
Yeah.

279
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,833
What is it?

280
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,458
That girl... She was wearing
an expensive perfume.

281
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,791
So what?

282
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:34,083
Designer perfume...
and an Amati violin...

283
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,458
She must be the daughter
of a well-to-do family.

284
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,250
At the end of the day,
it's girls like her

285
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,833
that we Republican Factionists
are out to protect.
