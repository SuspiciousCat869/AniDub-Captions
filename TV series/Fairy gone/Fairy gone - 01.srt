327
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,748
What happens now?
Are you going to arrest me?

328
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,710
[FREE] That's rather dire.
Maybe there's another way.

329
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,339
I'm with Dorothea,
in the First Unit.

330
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,258
Name's Free Underbar.

331
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,302
The question is,
should I arrest you,

332
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,929
or would rather become
a government dog?

333
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,098
Choice is up to you.

334
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,187
My name isn't "you."

335
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,324
It's Marlya Noel.

336
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,159
I wanna talk to Ver.

337
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,286
No matter what it might take.

338
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,931
[door creaks]

339
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,975
[footsteps]

340
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,227
And do you have it with you?

341
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,735
A shame.

342
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,654
Unfortunately, this page
happens to be a fake.

343
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,740
I can tell at a glance.

344
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,283
I see.

345
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,373
[door creaks, closes]

346
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,506
Marlya...

347
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,010
[MARLYA] It looks like the ruins
of some destroyed large city.

348
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,720
[NEIN]
A fairy primordial directly

349
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,554
possessing a human host.

350
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,597
[WOLF]
Weaklings like to swarm.

351
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,973
[KLARA]
They're a Fairy Soldier!

352
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,434
[WOLF] I see you still don't
know when to stop yapping.
