325
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,291
Prime Minister!

326
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,500
[CROWD shouting]

327
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,583
Idiot! [whistling]

328
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,166
You've done enough
for today, pal!

329
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,750
[TED grunting]

330
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,541
The pipe!
Look out!

331
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,041
Should've dropped it!

332
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,375
Are you all right, Excellency?

333
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,625
Shaken, but still alive.

334
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,833
The Prime Minister.

335
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,833
Someone tried assassinating him.

336
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,791
[VERONICA] And yet Ray Dawn
didn't even raise a finger.

337
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,833
Get in.

338
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,291
You're nothing
but Golbarn's dogs!

339
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,500
Probably never once had

340
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,708
an independent
thought in your life!

341
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,666
Far too busy serving
your overlord!

342
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,250
Are you done?

343
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,291
For a man of your conviction,

344
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,666
that was certainly
an undignified act, Livingston.

345
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,125
Undignified?

346
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,916
My father came up with those
artificial fairies,

347
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,125
and what'd he get?

348
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,958
His honor,
his dignity stripped away,

349
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,916
and the Security Bureau
endlessly hounding him!

350
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,791
Golbarn might've used
bureaucracy instead of a knife.

351
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,125
It's still murder!

352
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,666
Maybe you can't forgive him,
but accept this fact:

353
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,583
the war ended long ago.

354
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,291
And murderers are judged
fairly these days.

355
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,500
It's a good era.

356
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,625
So what?
You're saying Golbarn's a man?

357
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,708
Yeah.

358
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:21,916
He's a human.

359
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,875
The same as you.

360
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,083
That's why we refuse
to let you kill him.

361
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,000

[car driving away]

363
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,791
Well, I earned my pay.

364
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,333
Great job everyone.

365
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,583
That was good work
out there today, Robert.

366
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:18,666
Hmm? Oh, thanks.
Same to you.

367
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,833
Good night, Ozz.

368
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,541
And you too.

369
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,583
See you tomorrow!

370
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,708
Feels like this place
has changed

371
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,625
ever since she joined our ranks.

372
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,083
Huh, Robert?

373
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,333
[sighs]

374
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,708
Appears so.

375

[MARLYA] I've spotted
around 10-15 enemies!

-[FREE] Fairy's natural enemies.

377

[BEEVEE] You don't have what
it takes to fire me up.

378
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,375
The mediocre
should learn from defeat.
