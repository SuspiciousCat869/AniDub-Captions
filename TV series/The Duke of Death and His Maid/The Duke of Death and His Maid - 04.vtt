[NARRATOR]
Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
and never once feel
their skin against yours.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.419 position:50% align:center
He takes the life's breath out
of anything he touches.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
That was the curse the witch
so cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
Plants, animals, and people
are no exception, of course.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
Regarding her son,
doomed to live his life

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.972 position:50% align:center
without knowing
the warmth of another,

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
his mother only complained.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.185 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER] That child
is like Death incarnate.

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:01.102 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
...she said.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.146 position:50% align:center
No. I can't do it.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.564 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.525 position:50% align:center
[DUKE moans]

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:08.860 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I might've
been too harsh

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.028 position:50% align:center
in turning her down,

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.989 position:50% align:center
but what on earth
was I supposed to do?

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
I simply can't bear the thought
of hurting her feelings.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:17.577 position:50% align:center
[knock, knock]

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.870 position:50% align:center
Come in!

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Please forgive
the intrusion, Your Grace.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.665 position:50% align:center
Some new books have arrived,

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.584 position:50% align:center
so we're here to add them
to your collection

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.086 position:50% align:center
if it's not inconvenient.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.797 position:50% align:center
Wonderful! And I'd appreciate
it if you'd take some time

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.090 position:50% align:center
and arrange them by genre.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.175 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Very well, Your Grace.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.015 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
She looked away.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.600 position:50% align:center
But, last night,

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:43.645 position:50% align:center
things seemed to
be going pretty well.

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:45.021 position:50% align:center
In another ten years,

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.232 position:50% align:center
I think we should try
going back to that same spot

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.901 position:50% align:center
to watch the
meteor shower again.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.028 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
No, I'm overthinking this,

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.990 position:50% align:center
and what if she ends up feeling
like I'm the one avoiding her?

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.367 position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
There's something different
about you today, Alice.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:00.328 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:01.538 position:50% align:center
Let me guess,

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.415 position:50% align:center
you've changed your hair
and make-up, right?

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'll need some help
reaching the upper shelves.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.544 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
I'll take care of it for you.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.212 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Thank you so much.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.924 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Say, Alice.

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.759 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.429 position:50% align:center
Listen, something's off.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
It's always awkward,
but this feels worse.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.268 position:50% align:center
I mean,
I can't touch you, but...

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.728 position:50% align:center
Alice, please!

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.646 position:50% align:center
Have mercy and stop avoiding me!

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.148 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I'm not avoiding you.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:28.982 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
You are too!

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.525 position:50% align:center
Normally, you'd be like:

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.736 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] "Why don't you check me
out instead of these books?"

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
That's more your style,
wouldn't you agree?

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:36.573 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.576 position:50% align:center
Okay, you've had your fun,
now drop the act already!

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.787 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] You can't say things
about me that aren't true.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.998 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Then should I assume

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.374 position:50% align:center
you're still upset
about what happened

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.585 position:50% align:center
at the lake last night?

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.713 position:50% align:center
Just look at me, I'm totally
defenseless right now.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
Normally, you manage
to harass me three times

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
in the span of 15 seconds.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
Come on, now!

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.721 position:50% align:center
My apologies, but I know
not of what you speak.

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:01.598 position:50% align:center
I must be about my work.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.100 position:50% align:center
See? Here's what
you'd usually say!

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] "You're an
insatiable one, aren't you?"

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
You know I'm right!

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
What the heck is going on
with you, my Alice?

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:13.860 position:50% align:center
[ROB] One might ask the same
thing about you, Your Grace.

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.322 position:50% align:center
There's something a little
different about Alice today,

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:18.948 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.033 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Can't say that I do.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.452 position:50% align:center
She appears
to be her usual self.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
Rob, what will I do

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
if she never sexually
harasses me again?

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Hmm...

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50% align:center
I don't know, but I've
certainly gained new insight

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.044 position:50% align:center
as to your tastes.

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] No,
I simply can't believe Alice

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
could reject me so easily.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50% align:center
There must be some kind of
explanation for it, right?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.392 position:50% align:center
Hey. Alice?

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:46.726 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hmm?

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
Listen, Rob, I wonder
if you would be willing

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.690 position:50% align:center
to touch Alice, on my behalf?

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
Your Grace, what a thoroughly
unwholesome thing to suggest!

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
No, her forehead,
just her forehead!

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
you caught a cold.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I knew I was sick,

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:05.995 position:50% align:center
but I didn't think it
would interfere

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
with my work to this extent.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
You hid it so well it
took me a while to guess.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.168 position:50% align:center
You did fall into
the lake, though,

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
so it stands to reason.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
I think it was later, though.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
I... I believe I caught
a chill while I was standing

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
at your window deep
into the night,

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.470 position:50% align:center
peering in at you as you slept.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Would you stop peeking
into people's bedrooms?

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway,
you should really return

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.268 position:50% align:center
to your room, Your Grace.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
Or else you could catch my cold.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
No, I'm not leaving.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
My curse makes it
impossible for me

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
to nurse you to health,
so the best I can do

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
is just stay by your side.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
I thought it might
help you feel better

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:42.240 position:50% align:center
if I gave you some moral support
while you're under the weather.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] For now, you should
try to get some sleep.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
You look flushed.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center
I bet your fever's gotten worse.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
But that has nothing
to do with my cold.

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
It's chilly.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
It'll get colder tonight.

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:38.481 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Yes, I know.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:41.401 position:50% align:center
Rob said we should even
get some snow before long.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
That explains it.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to warm your
hands if you would like.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
Sticking them in there
will do more than that!

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.492 position:50% align:center
Also, I can't touch you!

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
Still, I hate it when it's cold.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
Makes me feel even
less like going outside.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] That's exactly why
you must brave the weather

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
and learn to tolerate it.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50% align:center
How about we play
in the snow tomorrow?

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
You can count me out, Alice.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.714 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,
but I'll be staying in--

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
It looks good on you.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I don't recall ever
seeing this scarf before.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
Did you knit it yourself?

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Yes.
I made it especially for you.

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:15.769 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
It smells really nice.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
So why don't you put
that scarf on tomorrow,

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.106 position:50% align:center
and then we'll go
outside and have fun?

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
All right, it's a deal.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
You promise?

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I promise.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
So much snow!

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Indeed.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.732 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Who wouldn't get a little
excited at the sight of this?

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Plus, Alice is just the cutest

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.697 position:50% align:center
surrounded by all this snow!

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
I love it!

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
Catch! Oh, or don't!

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
Look, Your Grace,
You got me all wet.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Oh, dear.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
[ROB] You two seem
to be having a good time.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.005 position:50% align:center
Rob! Hello!

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I guess we shouldn't
be goofing around this much

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
just because it snowed.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.343 position:50% align:center
I was hoping
you'd let me join you.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.598 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Someone needs
to be here to supervise.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50% align:center
So, you want to build
a snowman, huh?

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
[ROB] You mustn't let
yourself have too much fun.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
Says the guy who's obviously
having the most fun.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you say
we give Rob a hand?

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
Let's get busy
rolling snowballs.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.447 position:50% align:center
Yes, Your Grace.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
Roll it in time with me.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
One, two, one, two.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.298 position:50% align:center
Your Grace,
you're going too fast.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.133 position:50% align:center
Do you think we
could slow down a bit?

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
That was strangely errotic.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
I guess there's no other choice.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.097 position:50% align:center
This is rather
dull work, though.

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center
So, why don't you take
a break, Your Grace?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Uh? That's no fun.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
Well, if I can't join them.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:27.359 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:28.443 position:50% align:center
How'd you dodge that?

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
You tried to catch me off guard,

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
but that's not going to happen.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
Now, prepare to be fired upon.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
That's a lot of return fire!

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
And what superb
control you have!

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
Ow!

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
Two can play at that game!

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Well, look at that.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
His Grace really has begun
to smile a bit more as of late.

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Rob, looks like you lose!

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Retreat!

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
[ROB roars]

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50% align:center
Well, that was
the most fun ever!

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
Even my panties seem
to be soaking wet.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
I'll go do the laundry.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
Please take off your clothes
and get in the tub, Your Grace.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
--[DUKE] Nuh-uh!
--[ALICE] Pardon?

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I'm not taking off this scarf.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
Not when you made
it especially for me.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'm honored,
but it's only until it dries.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I don't wanna!

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Oh, no!

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
My mother's earring.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
[DUKE cries out]

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I've got to find it.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Darn it all!

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.687 position:50% align:center
Now the snow's getting worse.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
That place is huge!

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50% align:center
An aristocrat's villa, perhaps?

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
I'll get them
to share some food.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center
Or maybe, I'll just take it.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Hey. Hey, are you all right?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
Huh? What, was I asleep?

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
Ah! Who're you?

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
So, you've come to.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
Do you need a hand?

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks but
I can't take your hand

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
'cause I've been
cursed by a witch.

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
Whatever I touch has the
life snuffed out of it.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'm capable
of getting up on my own.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:51.354 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
So, do you live in that mansion?

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
What were you
doing out in this blizzard?

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Looking for something.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
My maid lost an earring

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
that was precious
to her out here today.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] You would go
through all this for a maid?

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Yes, of course I would.

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
Alice is a very
special person to me.

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
I've got to find it.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
So, you sound pretty young.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
What were you
doing out in the woods

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
in this snowy weather?

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
I was with my childhood friend,

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.673 position:50% align:center
but we got separated,
and I ended up here.

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.550 position:50% align:center
I'm starving,
so I was actually about

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.510 position:50% align:center
to shake you guys
down for some food.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
No pretense at all, huh?

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.892 position:50% align:center
Come on, shovel.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.606 position:50% align:center
I need to be careful,
my hands are going numb.

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
That may be all I can take.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Why don't you call it quits?

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
You're sure
to find it next spring

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
after the snow melts, anyway.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
No, it'll be all rusty by then.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
Besides, I want to see
how delighted she'll be

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
when I finally bring it--

00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:56.670 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] This fellow seems
to show a lot of promise.

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
I suppose I should
give him some assistance.

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
So nice and warm.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.559 position:50% align:center
No, wait, that's scorching hot!

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Awake now?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Huh? Where's the snow?

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
I believe I may have found
what you were looking for.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
You think you could
focus on me, now?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
I was going to leave
without introducing myself,

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
but it occurred to me
that it wouldn't be polite.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
So, anyway, the name's Cuff.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
I'm a witch.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.914 position:50% align:center
[ROB] You wouldn't happen
to know where His Grace went...

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
...would you, pot of water?

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Oh. You're
saying you can't break

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
the curse on me, then?

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
No, it's beyond my power.

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.099 position:50% align:center
Are you sure
it's okay to let me in?

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
I am a witch.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.227 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'd like to thank you,

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
and besides, there's
so much I want to ask.

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:59.107 position:50% align:center
Also, I'd love for you
to meet my maid and butler.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Who's that?

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'll introduce you.

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
This is my maid.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center
Alice Lendrott, at your service.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
This is Cuff.

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:10.702 position:50% align:center
She came to my rescue

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center
when I got covered
in snow and nearly died.

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, Your Grace.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you went outside

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.834 position:50% align:center
when you knew
how dangerous it was.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I'm really sorry!

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
But we found your earring.

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
See?

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.340 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Thank you.

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
But it makes me happier
to see you're all right.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.093 position:50% align:center
I mean that.

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I'm sorry
I made you worry.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.683 position:50% align:center
But I can't thank you enough
for finding my earring.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
I want to take a shower.

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:36.561 position:50% align:center
You'd better show me the way.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Where'd that come from?

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
Please wait in the library,
Your Grace.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
I'll join you there shortly.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] What could possibly
be taking her so long?

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
Maybe it wasn't entirely safe

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:54.287 position:50% align:center
to leave her alone
with the witch, after all.

00:15:54.371 --> 00:15:58.124 position:50% align:center
Or maybe--the two of them
are bathing together!

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
Here, let me wash your back.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I'm so jealous!

[ALICE]
Your Grace?

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.580 position:50% align:center
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
No problem!

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Well, that hit the spot.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
And lucky me.

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:47.215 position:50% align:center
Alice here volunteered
to mend my robe.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.848 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
You've saved my hide.

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
After I got separated
from my friend,

00:16:57.017 --> 00:17:00.270 position:50% align:center
I hadn't eaten anything
for two whole days.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.981 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] And is this friend
of yours a witch, as well?

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:03.815 position:50% align:center
And a woman?

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center
No, he's a man.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.109 position:50% align:center
Sometimes men
are called witches,

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.360 position:50% align:center
but that's confusing,

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
so, let's just say
he's a magic user.

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
Look, I really do
feel for you and all,

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
but there are some things
I simply can't disclose

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:15.368 position:50% align:center
about our kind.

00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
You can torture me all you want,

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.830 position:50% align:center
and you still won't get a word.

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Well, that's
not really on the table.

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Now, now,
don't be like that, Cuff.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
By the way, would
you care for dessert?

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] Fine, tell me what you
want to know about witches.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.640 position:50% align:center
Well, I, uh,

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you could help me.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.395 position:50% align:center
That you might know about
the witch who cursed me.

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:43.813 position:50% align:center
Is it all right to talk about?

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center
I ate your food,
so I don't have a choice.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
This one's a straight shooter.

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
I'm sorry, but unfortunately,

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
I don't know a thing
about your curse.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
It's not like all witches
know each other,

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:55.241 position:50% align:center
and if it didn't
happen recently,

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
it's unlikely anyone else
would remember it.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center
Oh. That makes sense.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
One last thing
I could talk about

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:04.584 position:50% align:center
would be myself, I suppose.

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Yourself?

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
You know about
the witch hunts, right?

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:10.757 position:50% align:center
Well, they date quite a ways
back in human history.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.342 position:50% align:center
Well, there are still
some radical groups

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
that continue to go
around killing witches.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
If we used our magic,
we could make them pay.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:22.977 position:50% align:center
It's just that there are
so many humans out there.

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center
My friend and I
both lost our parents.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
The witch hunters got them, too.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
Those people don't
care who they kill.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
You see, my dad,
he was actually a human.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
Growing up half-witch
and half-human,

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:40.245 position:50% align:center
I've lived my entire life
shunned by both groups.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
I haven't attended a witches'
sabbath in a long time.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
I know there's
no place where I belong,

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
but that's fine as long
as I have my friend.

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:50.880 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare come near me!

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
You foul monster!

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
I admire you. Truly.

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
You should hate me
for being human.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
But instead,
you chose to save me

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
when I was in trouble out there.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
Human or witch didn't
matter this time.

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
It was your determination that
piqued my interest.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Huh?

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
[knock, knock]

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.820 position:50% align:center
Pardon me,
I've finished the mending.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Wow, I'm impressed!

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
It's just like new!

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
Tell me, do all witches
have robes like that?

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.328 position:50% align:center
Or is it only you?

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Uh.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
Not all witches have them,

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:27.667 position:50% align:center
but I doubt a single
human possesses one.

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:30.712 position:50% align:center
Hey, Cuff, is there anything
else you can tell us?

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
Maybe a hint on how
to break this curse?

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Now hold on, there!

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.052 position:50% align:center
I'm not the sharpest tool
in the shed, 'kay?

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] That's not
necessarily what I think,

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
but it's what my friend says.

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
Honestly, all the
maneuvering's a real pain.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
I'm constantly afraid
I'll tell you something

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
I'm not supposed to.

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
See there?

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
Thinking so much has given me
the most annoying headache.

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, that hurts.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
Well, you can't
blame me for that.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.530 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
At times like these,

00:19:57.614 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
it's my friend who does
the thinking for both of us.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
Lucky for me, he always
makes the right decision.

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:06.498 position:50% align:center
My, sounds like you've
got a lot of faith in him.

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
You're very fond of
your friend, aren't you?

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
[BULLY A] You're no noble, so
stop hanging around the estate!

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
[BULLY B]
She's just a pauper!

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice, look at me.

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
There's still snow on you.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you, Your Grace.

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for what
my friends did.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
I'll give 'em a
tongue-lashing later.

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:14.357 position:50% align:center
By the way, you look really
beautiful sitting there

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
in the snow.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:17.694 position:50% align:center
Just like a snow fairy.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.913 position:50% align:center
Alice, what are you
doing out here so early?

00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center
You'll catch another cold.

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
Just feeling a bit sentimental.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
Guess we all have
our moments, huh?

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.881 position:50% align:center
Come on. Let's go inside.

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center
What? Is something wrong?

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:44.763 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
No, nothing, Your Grace.

00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:46.306 position:50% align:center
Shall we head back?

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.520 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
For a moment there,

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
your eyes looked as if
you wanted me to hold you

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:56.399 position:50% align:center
and it took me by surprise.

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Every time
my love for you grows,

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:05.116 position:50% align:center
I feel like my heart
is going to burst.

00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:44.924 position:50% align:center
You know, you look really
beautiful in the snow.

00:23:45.008 --> 00:23:46.843 position:50% align:center
 Like some kind of snow fairy.

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:48.595 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hmm?

00:23:48.678 --> 00:23:49.512 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:52.265 position:50% align:center
Uh. What are you laughing for?

00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:54.476 position:50% align:center
Your Grace,
you haven't changed a bit.

00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:56.770 position:50% align:center
Wait. What?

00:23:56.853 --> 00:23:58.188 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
So sweet.

00:23:58.271 --> 00:23:59.689 position:50% align:center
I truly adore you.

00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:02.400 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Hey, hold on, you aren't
teasing me again, are you?

00:24:02.484 --> 00:24:04.444 position:50% align:center
Come on, Alice, no fair!

00:24:07.113 --> 00:24:10.116 position:50% align:center
