[NARRATOR]
Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
and never once feel
their skin against yours.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.419 position:50% align:center
He takes the life's breath out
of anything he touches.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
That was the curse the witch
so cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
Plants, animals, and people
are no exception, of course.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
Regarding her son,
doomed to live his life

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.972 position:50% align:center
without knowing
the warmth of another,

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
his mother only complained.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.185 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER] That child
is like Death incarnate.

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
...she said.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I hate to ask because
I feel like all we do

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.984 position:50% align:center
is talk about your clothes,

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.903 position:50% align:center
but I've noticed that you
only ever wear black

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.614 position:50% align:center
even when you're out of uniform.
Why is that?

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.574 position:50% align:center
I suppose because I like it.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:17.619 position:50% align:center
I'd like to see you wear some
different colors for a change.

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:18.870 position:50% align:center
I'm partial to white, myself.

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:20.330 position:50% align:center
It looks simple and honest.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
Of course, if you say
it's all right, Your Grace.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:23.875 position:50% align:center
Give it a try, by all means!

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.086 position:50% align:center
I think you'd look great
in a white dress.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.088 position:50% align:center
Or a formal gown.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.927 position:50% align:center
Oh dear,
is something the matter?

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.012 position:50% align:center
It's nothing. Perfectly fine.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
What is that
unpleasant-looking thing?

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.275 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
It's a magic pot.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.528 position:50% align:center
They say it was made by a
witch who cared for it daily.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
So, it's a witch's tool?

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
I happened to see it in town the
other day, so I purchased it.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
It was only just now delivered.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50% align:center
And it comes with a recipe book.

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.456 position:50% align:center
Isn't that exciting?

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't know if "exciting"

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.959 position:50% align:center
would be the word
I'd choose here.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.295 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I know, why don't
we try cooking with it?

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
There's something I'd like
you to sample, Your Grace.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
Um, all right, but do you need
to get this close to tell me?

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
If this is a witch's tool,

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
then it's not for
normal cooking, right?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.641 position:50% align:center
What is it you want to make?

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] A love potion,
I mean, just normal soup.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
You just totally let that slip!

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.190 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] All the ingredients
have been prepared.

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.234 position:50% align:center
So, shall we get started now?

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Are you really
going to make me do this?

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
I sure am.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
After all,
we're doing this for you.

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
I'm amazed that
you can actually say that

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
with a straight face.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.828 position:50% align:center
This pot is really quite useful.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
That's why I'd like for you
to see it in action, Your Grace.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:12.210 position:50% align:center
Come on, be my girl,
what do you say?

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
[MAGIC POT] I wouldn't be caught
dead with the likes of you!

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
See? This way, you don't have
to use a stove to heat it up.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
What sort of taste do
witches have, anyway?

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
On second thought, never mind,

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
I learned enough
at that witches' sabbath.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Once the pot comes to
a boil, we add the ingredients.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
We have some lovely
seasoned lizard's tail, amoebas,

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
a snail's shell,
some red clay soil,

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
pinch of fur
from a cat's back.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.694 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Wait, wait!

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
There's no way those are cooking
ingredients! I'm the one--

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Sneak a peek.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
Let's continue, shall we?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Why do I have to
be such an easy target?

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Witches.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
The more I meet,
the less I understand.

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
There are witches like
the one that cursed me

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
and others like Cuff
and Zain who are friendly.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
[DALETH] I would suggest
that you stop wasting time

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
and just give up.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I can't do that.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
But now that I think of it,

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
I also have no idea
what my next move should be.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
[MAGIC POT] What the heck
do you think you're staring at,

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
you perv?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
Pardon me, Your Grace,
but I've found something.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
This magic pot has a
few other handy features

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
if we say the magic words.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Uh... Like what?

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
"Look at that!
You're actually pretty cute

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
now that you've finally
taken off your glasses."

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
[MAGIC POT]
Oh! You idiot!

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
This spell is supposed
to help you create

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
a smokescreen really easily.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Who needs a smokescreen
when they're cooking?!

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Now, this is where
you come in, Your Grace.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
Stir the pot continuously,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
and as you do, think of all
the good things in your life.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50% align:center
That's all it says.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
Um, okay.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
Good things,
fun things, happy things.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
Happy things, happy things,
happy things, happy things.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Got distracted at the end there.

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
It's finished now.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
Honestly, you're right,
this isn't just any soup.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Uh-huh.
I know, you said as much.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
I was amazed when
I ran across this in town.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:17.711 position:50% align:center
See? It's a potion to
remove a witch's curse.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
You mean it wasn't
a love potion?

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
They say it won't
be as effective

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
if you get too unfocused.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd warn
you at first, but then...

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
That would've
distracted me more!

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.556 position:50% align:center
And I already
was pretty unfocused!

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50% align:center
Well, it says it's all right.

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
The main thing is that you
don't think about the curse

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
while you're stirring it.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] So, am I to
understand that the magic pot

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:39.441 position:50% align:center
and those crazy ingredients
were really all for me?

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Yes.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
Since it seems the witch who
cursed you is no longer living,

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
I figured why not?

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:47.323 position:50% align:center
We should try anything
we think might work.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50% align:center
It may be a bit hot, but...

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.412 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay, I'll try it.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:55.957 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Are you kidding me?

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
This tastes like hell!

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
Shall we test it out?

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
I know it's disappointing.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
It certainly is, but I guess
we'll have to accept it.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.809 position:50% align:center
Daleth told us it's not
a run-of-the-mill curse.

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
I will say, the best part
of looking into all this

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.772 position:50% align:center
has been your encouragement.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.148 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:21.691 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad. In that case,

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
I'll start looking for some
other way to break the curse.

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
Good. Thanks, Alice.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50% align:center
In the meantime,

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
what should we do with this?

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] If we tried to get
rid of it, it might curse us.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
You're giving this to me?

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.041 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah! It's a real magic pot!

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.251 position:50% align:center
You can use it however you like.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.880 position:50% align:center
[MAGIC POT]
What a sharp dresser!

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
You mean it?
I'm going to be his?

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
My goodness,
a talking pot, is it?

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
Fascinating.
Thank you very much, sir.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
Oh, my, is it already time
for our honeymoon?

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
Though I'm but a humble pot,

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
I hope we'll last
for better or worse.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:00.772 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Viola?

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50% align:center
How long have you been there?

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
Wait, hang on a second!

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
Hey, Rob!
Better hide that pot, quick!

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.071 position:50% align:center
Alice! You have to stop Viola!

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50% align:center
Alice!

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:14.494 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hmm?

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Wow, this sheet music
is so hard to read.

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
What is this, anyway?

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
The last score the composer
McFarlane wrote before he died.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:45.942 position:50% align:center
Some revere it as the world's
most beautiful piece of music.

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
McFarlane, you said?

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
That's right, but it's got
quite a checkered history.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
They say that anyone
who performs it goes mad.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.159 position:50% align:center
What the--? That's scary!

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
They also say that if
you can play it perfectly,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
doing so will finally
cleanse you of your curse.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
Cleanse me?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.459 position:50% align:center
I'm hopeful that things
will work out this time.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
What do you say?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
Will you give it a try?

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
I'll do it!

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:08.298 position:50% align:center
Just stop using your
breasts to make it happen!

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] While the music
may be hard to read,

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.809 position:50% align:center
it's certainly a lovely tune.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:24.731 position:50% align:center
But... who the
heck is this guy?

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
You can see me, can't you, boy?

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.278 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
He spoke to me.

00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, are you McFarlane?

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:33.823 position:50% align:center
[MCFARLANE]
Indeed, I am.

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
You see, no one will
ever play this perfectly,

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
so I have become a ghost

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
in order to watch over
it even in death.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.373 position:50% align:center
Can you?

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
Definitely not if you stick
your head in my face like that!

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.460 position:50% align:center
[MCFARLANE]
Aw, jeez.

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.878 position:50% align:center
I totally shouldn't have
put the music on black paper

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
just to make it look cool.

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
Real talk, even
I have trouble reading it.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.301 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] You did it just
for the sake of appearances?

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center
Your Grace,
are you feeling all right?

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you've actually
gone mad playing that piece.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
'Course not!

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.393 position:50% align:center
Don't bother trying
to explain it to her.

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
The only one who can see me
is the one playing the piece.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
By the way, this chick is
totally far out, man.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50% align:center
What's happenin?
Are you kids going steady?

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.277 position:50% align:center
People back then used
such passe language.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
[MCFARLANE chuckles]
Check it out.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center
I may be a ghost, but I can get
my kicks doing stuff like this!

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
Whoosh!

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
Oh, my!
That was a naughty gust of wind.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
Did you see that, Your Grace?

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
I didn't! I saw nothing!

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50% align:center
What do you think
you're doing, McFarlane?

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.127 position:50% align:center
Oh, so I haven't messed around

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.878 position:50% align:center
with a girl in centuries
and you actually expect me

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center
not to try and have
a little fun with her?

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
Just concentrate on
your performance, square!

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
Let me and I will!

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
[MCFARLANE giggles]

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
Now I think I'm gonna slip

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
this strange little strap off
her shoulder, like so!

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center
Oh. That naughty gust
is at it again.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
Are you seeing this, Your Grace?

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
It's okay, I'm not watching.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
[MCFARLANE] Why wouldn't
you watch that, you fool?

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Why should I?

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Ah, Goodness,
what's to become of me?

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
That naughty wind is...

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
How many times is it gonna blow?

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
It's you that's
doing the stripping!

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
[MCFARLANE]
I can't take it anymore!

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
Hey, baby, pucker up
and gimme a big kiss!

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
No! Anything but that!

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
Would you please knock it off?

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
[MCFARLANE sobs]

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
Her eyes looked
so cold when she rejected me!

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center
Quit making me dodge
you while I'm playing!

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:19.846 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't happen
to be one of those folks

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
who can see ghosts, would you?

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
I'm not. Sorry to disappoint.

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.060 position:50% align:center
But you're talking to him!

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50% align:center
This leaves me with
but one objective.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
You must play this song
perfectly to the end

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center
with no mistakes, or I'll haunt
you for the rest of your life!

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
Quit being so absurd!

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Come on, concentrate.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.455 position:50% align:center
Concentrate on playing.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
The piano is all I've got.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.626 position:50% align:center
Always has been, always will be.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
All I can do is play.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
For my sake.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
And even more, for the sake of
my future together with Alice!

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.444 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
How do you like that, McFarlane?

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:18.321 position:50% align:center
I played your song perfectly!

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
Now I'm supposed to
be cleansed of my curse.

00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
[MCFARLANE]
My, what a splendid performance!

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
So, I'll be off!

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.128 position:50% align:center
Thank you, friend.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] The curse
I'm cleansed of is you?!

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Good morning, Alice!

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
I woke up early,
so I came to fetch you.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
Come to the mansion right away.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Certainly.
I'll be out in a moment.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
Uh! You've got some
clothes on, right?

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:57.193 position:50% align:center
'Cause I know you
never wear anything

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:58.945 position:50% align:center
while you're in your room.

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Don't worry.

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
As you can see,
I'm fully dressed.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
Lingerie does not count!

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I put it on by mistake.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
It was totally on purpose!

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
Alice never seems
bothered at all

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
when someone else
sees her bare skin.

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
I wonder if she even
considers me a guy?

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
the other day Viola.

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:21.051 position:50% align:center
Yoo-hoo, Dearest Brother!

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
Ah! You startled me!

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center
But it's only you.

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.222 position:50% align:center
Jeez. You flinch
at every little thing.

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:27.390 position:50% align:center
It's annoying.

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
And you better not
get all heart-pounding

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
and fall for me or anything.

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what
you're talking about,

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.563 position:50% align:center
but you sound crazy.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.440 position:50% align:center
The suspension
bridge effect, of course!

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
When they're with someone,
people misread fear and anxiety.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
They assume
their heart's pounding

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center
with love for the other person!

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
In other words,

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
all I have to do is get
Alice's heart pounding

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.451 position:50% align:center
by startling or scaring her.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:49.287 position:50% align:center
This may be the
perfect time to try it.

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:52.540 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh.

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
Your Grace?

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
Ta-da!

00:13:58.755 --> 00:13:59.756 position:50% align:center
I was in your blind spot!

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.133 position:50% align:center
Were you startled?

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
Yes, very much so.

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] This is gonna be
tougher than I thought.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center
Because it's about to get awful.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
We're getting to
the really scary part now.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center
So, the man turned his head,
and he shouted, "I saw that!"

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.442 position:50% align:center
But he no longer
had any eyes or nose,

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
just a creepy mouth slit,
ear to ear.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
Ah! How scary is that?

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50% align:center
It gives me chills
just talking about it.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
It was scary.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
But I have to admit,
when the narrator's spooked,

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
it does lose about
half its fear factor.

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
I should give up.

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
I'm just not any good at this.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
Strange thing is, McFarlane
didn't even scare me at all.

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
Well, if it was up to me,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
I would give your
story a score of 98.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] How can you not
love a lenient grader?

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
I finally found it!

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:48.013 position:50% align:center
Scared yet?

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Is it the right one?

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
Oh, not this one.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
That's strange.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50% align:center
I could've sworn we had
a painting of a woman

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
shedding tears of blood
around here somewhere.

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:02.986 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hmm? Oh. Is it this one?

00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Sure is.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:07.907 position:50% align:center
What's it doing
hanging there, though?

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
I took it down the other day
because it was so creepy.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
Very peculiar.

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:13.955 position:50% align:center
That's it? Aren't you scared?

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
All right, sure.

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:16.708 position:50% align:center
You're so calm!

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
Here I am terrified,

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
and you mean to tell me
your heart isn't pounding?

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:21.921 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
But it is pounding.

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
Come here,
put your ear against my chest

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center
and listen for yourself.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
No, I can't! Think!
The painting moved by itself!

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
I'd say that's pretty
darn freaky, wouldn't you?

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
Scary stuff!

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
Yes, it certainly is.

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
Ah! Come on, what's with you?!
Why won't you get scared?!

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
If your heart doesn't
start pounding,

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
you won't feel the
suspension bridge effect!

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
But I already told you,
my heart is pounding.

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center
All because I'm
with you, Your Grace.

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
She looks even cuter than usual.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:51.576 position:50% align:center
Is it the suspension
bridge effect at work?

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
But how did this
painting get here?

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Alice, forgive me,

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
but didn't you hang that
painting there yesterday

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
because you noticed
some extra space?

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:03.630 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Shh. It's our secret.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] The more
I stand here looking at it,

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
the scarier it gets!

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.347 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Oh! Your Grace!
Look out behind you!

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:16.976 position:50% align:center
Darn it!

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
[ROB] No, Your Grace,
don't touch that!

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.689 position:50% align:center
Please, sir. The plant's
been here for generations.

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
It only flowers once
every 50 years,

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
so it's extremely valuable.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:29.948 position:50% align:center
[screams]
I'm so sorry!

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
Forgive me for asking

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
but what exactly are you
doing in there, Your Grace?

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:42.502 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'm sure Rob
understands it was an accident.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Still, I'd prefer not to
face him until he calms down.

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.340 position:50% align:center
Please shut the door, will you?

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center
I'm not ready to
be found just yet.

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Very well.

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
Wait, what are
you doing in here?

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.639 position:50% align:center
Well, you asked me
to shut the door.

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
What is Rob like
when he gets angry?

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
I'm curious.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.810 position:50% align:center
It's pretty harsh.

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:00.520 position:50% align:center
He won't chew you out,
but he also won't forgive you

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:03.023 position:50% align:center
until you've reflected
on your actions.

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
To tell you the truth,
I'd kind of like to see that.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:08.153 position:50% align:center
You on the receiving
end of his anger, that is.

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:09.446 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Your Grace?

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
Are you in here somewhere?

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
It's Rob.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:21.583 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Phew.

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
I was really freaked out
for a minute there.

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
Hey, you know it's
not safe for you

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
to get that close to me, Alice.

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.256 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. Oops.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
So, tell me, where are
you planning to hide next?

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
This is starting to get fun!

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
This is a huge mansion so there
are tons of places to hide.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.350 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] The thing is, Rob
knows this place inside out.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
Where can I hide
and not be found?

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:41.811 position:50% align:center
How about under here?

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:44.397 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Mm. Mm. What a great
choice, and so romantic!

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
Quit fooling around, would you?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
[ROB] I've been looking
for you, Your Grace.

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:52.322 position:50% align:center
I wanted to speak with
you about the flowerpot.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
Uh, I, um...

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
I'm Alice!

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
I pride myself on
being able to wake up

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
after exactly
seven hours of sleep.

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Ah, it's you, Alice.

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
My goodness, pardon me.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Sheesh, how senile can you get?

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.672 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] That's a pretty
good impression of me.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.590 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Oh. Thanks.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] So... we wound up hiding
together underneath my bed.

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
This is a surprisingly
good hiding place,

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
if somewhat ordinary.

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:23.603 position:50% align:center
Heh. I wanted to be in
a dark, cramped space

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
with you, Your Grace.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:28.608 position:50% align:center
So, hiding from Rob is no
longer the objective, huh?

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure
if you knew this or not,

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
but hide-and-seek
was originally invented

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
as a game for adults,
not children.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Tell me, are you looking forward

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:41.246 position:50% align:center
to becoming a
full-grown adult, Your Grace?

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Hmm... More or less.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
I'd like to experience alcohol.

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
It'd be wonderful if I could
have dinner and drinks

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
with someone
like you every night.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
My heart's really pounding now.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:57.220 position:50% align:center
Am I experiencing
the suspension bridge effect?

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
[ROB] I'm sorry to interrupt,
but something has come up.

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
[DUKE screams]
Rob!

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
What's all this?

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
I found them among the shards

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center
of the flowerpot
you broke, Your Grace.

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
I believe they had been stolen
from the lady and senior lady

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
of the house long ago.

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
You mean from
Mother and Grandmother?

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
[ROB] We had an incident
when this mansion

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
was still the
family's main residence.

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:26.916 position:50% align:center
One of the servants stole
some of the family's valuables.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.543 position:50% align:center
The thief must have
hidden the stolen items

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
inside the flowerpot temporarily

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
and then never got
a chance to retrieve them.

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
Anyhow, I'm so
glad you found them,

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
and I'm sure the
lady of the house will be

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.927 position:50% align:center
very pleased as well
when she hears.

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
You were great, Your Grace.

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
Like a master detective.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
Well, let's not
get carried away, I mean,

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
I didn't even
do anything, really.

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Oh. By the way,
we're having a chat later,

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
regarding the rare
flowerpot you destroyed.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
Guess I'm getting
a talking-to after all.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.915 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Where am I?

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:33.209 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see
you're awake, Your Grace.

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice!

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
Where the heck are we?

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
This is a dream, of course.

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:39.424 position:50% align:center
It is?

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:41.968 position:50% align:center
Why yes, do you not remember?

00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center
A moment ago, we were looking
through old books in the library

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
trying to find some way
for us to break your curse.

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
And the second
we opened one of the books.

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:53.438 position:50% align:center
You must bring me
the white rabbit

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:54.981 position:50% align:center
that carries a pocket watch.

00:21:55.065 --> 00:21:57.359 position:50% align:center
And as a thank-you,
I shall grant you one wish.

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.486 position:50% align:center
After that,
I lost consciousness,

00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:01.529 position:50% align:center
and the next thing I knew,
I was here.

00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:04.240 position:50% align:center
So, I think our real
selves are still asleep,

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:06.076 position:50% align:center
there, in the library,
where we were.

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.077 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.745 position:50% align:center
So, if we catch
that white rabbit

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.663 position:50% align:center
and give it to the girl,
then we might...

00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:12.123 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:15.085 position:50% align:center
This time we may finally
succeed in breaking your curse.

00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:16.086 position:50% align:center
And look.

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:17.295 position:50% align:center
Alice?!

00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:19.839 position:50% align:center
It's all right,
it's a dream, so it's safe.

00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:21.841 position:50% align:center
See?

00:22:21.925 --> 00:22:25.679 position:50% align:center
You're right, in fact,
I can't feel a thing.

00:22:25.762 --> 00:22:28.598 position:50% align:center
Why would you put
my hand on your breast

00:22:28.682 --> 00:22:30.600 position:50% align:center
when I can't enjoy how it feels?

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:32.519 position:50% align:center
It's like torture!
I felt nothing!

00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:34.312 position:50% align:center
Oh look, it's a rabbit!

00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:38.566 position:50% align:center
Let's follow it. You want to?

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.110 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yes.

00:23:08.638 --> 00:23:11.141 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] We had so much fun that
we got totally carried away.

00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:12.892 position:50% align:center
That's a bad habit of ours.

00:23:12.976 --> 00:23:15.770 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] It's been almost seven
hours since we arrived here.

00:23:15.854 --> 00:23:18.148 position:50% align:center
So, we should be
waking up pretty soon.

00:23:18.231 --> 00:23:21.484 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Oh, right.
Exactly seven hours of sleep.

00:23:21.568 --> 00:23:25.071 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Since we're here,
shall we end with a kiss?

00:23:25.155 --> 00:23:27.032 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah,
this is a dream and all,

00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:29.409 position:50% align:center
so I guess we could, but I...

00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:31.745 position:50% align:center
Just kiss me please.

00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:34.247 position:50% align:center
Alice.

00:23:37.834 --> 00:23:41.504 position:50% align:center
This time. I won't back out.

00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:46.092 position:50% align:center
Jeez. You guys
are totally useless!

00:23:46.176 --> 00:23:47.677 position:50% align:center
You can't even bother
to look for the rabbit

00:23:47.761 --> 00:23:51.473 position:50% align:center
because you're all lovey-dovey!

00:23:51.556 --> 00:23:53.224 position:50% align:center
Never summon me again, nerd!

00:23:53.308 --> 00:23:56.102 position:50% align:center
And drop dead
while you're at it!

00:23:58.855 --> 00:24:01.191 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Maybe I can pick up
where I left off.
