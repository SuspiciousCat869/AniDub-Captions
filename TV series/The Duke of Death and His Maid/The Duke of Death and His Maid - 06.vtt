[NARRATOR]
Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
and never once feel
their skin against yours.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.419 position:50% align:center
He takes the life's breath out
of anything he touches.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
That was the curse the witch
so cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
Plants, animals, and people
are no exception, of course.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
Regarding her son,
doomed to live his life

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.972 position:50% align:center
without knowing
the warmth of another,

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
his mother only complained.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.185 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER] That child
is like Death incarnate.

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:01.895 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
...she said.

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:09.110 position:50% align:center
This actually occurred
to me earlier,

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
but something about your
maid uniform bothers me.

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:15.492 position:50% align:center
Would you care
to have a closer look?

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.535 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I can see it
fine from here, thanks!

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.037 position:50% align:center
What I was trying to say,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
is that your shoulders
and such are too exposed,

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.874 position:50% align:center
and it's not appropriate.

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.292 position:50% align:center
Can't you wear something normal?

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
Normal.

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:28.797 position:50% align:center
You mean, like this?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.840 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] No, that's
too sexy in its own right!

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.467 position:50% align:center
And what's with
the picture boards?

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.843 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
All right, how's this?

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.845 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Come on,
no maid would pose like that!

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.390 position:50% align:center
Fine, starting tomorrow
I won't wear anything at all.

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:39.974 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] That's what
you got from this talk?

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Just look at this!

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.903 position:50% align:center
Since it's cold out,

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd do some
reading in the conservatory,

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
but the place is an utter mess!

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I'm terribly sorry.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
With so much to
do around the manor,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
both Rob and I completely
forgot to tend to it.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.958 position:50% align:center
Well, that's not your fault.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center
I realize two servants
aren't nearly enough.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
Let's keep what was always
here and get rid of the rest.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to lend a hand.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
Thanks very much, Your Grace.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.972 position:50% align:center
In that case,
I think we should use these.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] What are you going
to pull out of there next--

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
a rabbit?

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
It's pretty amazing
how thick the greenery

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
has gotten here, huh?

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.692 position:50% align:center
Though, once I expose it
to the power of my curse,

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.277 position:50% align:center
it won't make any difference
how much it's grown.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.532 position:50% align:center
My curse obeys certain rules.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
Any organism that
touches me will die.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
Even clothes
don't always protect.

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50% align:center
But as I've taken
the utmost precautions,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
I've never caused
anyone's death.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
Though.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
I have taken the lives
of many small creatures.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.843 position:50% align:center
Many died at my hands.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
Still, since
I started living here,

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:24.180 position:50% align:center
I've come to learn
what's safe and what's not.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.351 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Living things can get
quite close to me and be fine,

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
as long as there's
no direct contact.

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
And if my clothing
is thick enough,

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
they can touch me
without any harm.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
We can touch the
same objects and be fine.

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
It doesn't appear
to pose any problems

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
if my sweat or spittle comes
in contact with them.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
I can also grab
onto their clothing.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
Though I rarely do
because of the risk.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
And so my life is governed
by arbitrary rules

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
made at the whim of
the witch who cursed me.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
In other words,
from that day on,

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:01.217 position:50% align:center
I have lived at her mercy
and under her control.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
I'd better check on Alice.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
What're you looking at?

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
Blooms?

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
Yes, the flowers have
blossomed so beautifully.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
But I've enjoyed them enough
and it's time to say goodbye.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
Would you wither them for me?

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Huh? Are you sure?

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.407 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'll be right over
there tidying up, all right?

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.117 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice!

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hmm?

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
You made me a garland?

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.053 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Mm-hmm. I did it just now!

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
It seemed like a shame
to wither them,

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.973 position:50% align:center
so I turned them
into dried flowers.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
This way you'll get
to enjoy them longer.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:54.270 position:50% align:center
Ah, what a lovely idea.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
They are a little on
the fragile side, though,

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
so you may want to be
a bit more careful.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
I can't thank you enough,
Your Grace.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
It's one more thing
for me to treasure, always.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
I'm a lucky girl
to have a master like you.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness,
I'm so glad you like it.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Listen, witch.

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
I won't be under
your control forever.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] On the night
of the next blood moon,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
you're coming with us

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
to a gathering called
the witches' sabbath.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] If I attend
the witches' sabbath,

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
I may find a lead on
how to break my curse.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50% align:center
And if I can do that,
then my mother will accept me.

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to go home.

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
I can even dine
with my family again.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.356 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
No, I'm sure by then.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
Mother will have...

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER]
Viola.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
I've noticed you haven't been
dining with us as of late.

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
What have you been up to?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] I've been going
over to a friend's house.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER]
As an aristocrat's daughter,

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
you must take care to
behave yourself at all times.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
Do you understand?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Yes.

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.236 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
So frustrating.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
I can't sleep.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:31.409 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Now you stop that!

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice?

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
Alice, are you all right?

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
Oh! Evening, Your Grace.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.
I was just taking a shower.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Thank goodness you
came to my aid when you did.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
Your Grace?

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I am one with the floor.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
I saw nothing. Nothing at all.

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:54.307 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
A cat got into the bathroom?

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Yes. It slipped in,
and before I knew it,

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
it had run off
with my dressing gown.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
And I had just washed
my uniform, so...

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
In that case, leave it to me.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.736 position:50% align:center
All I need to do is get your
gown back from the cat, right?

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
You stay here
and take your shower.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
Oh my goodness.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
I'm only doing what
any gentleman would do.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
I'll be right back.
Soon as I find it.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.623 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Wonderful.

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
tag along, you know!

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
You'll catch a chill!

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Possibly, but this was
the result of my carelessness,

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
and since there's
a cat involved,

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center
I think it'd be best
if I come along.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center
You do have a point. Very well.

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:35.890 position:50% align:center
Just humor me and wear this
even though I know it's big.

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:38.059 position:50% align:center
It's what we have.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
Oh, it smells like you,
Your Grace.

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50% align:center
Excellent! Good to know!

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
Let's get moving.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50% align:center
Kind of hard looking for a
black cat in the dark like this.

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.198 position:50% align:center
Not exactly ideal, is it?

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
It's dragging my nightgown
around behind it,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
so, thankfully, I doubt it's
been able to get very far.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
I can't take in
anything she's saying.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
Would you like to
touch them, Your Grace?

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
It would be fine
with me, you know.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.008 position:50% align:center
No, it's not that, it's.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
Oh, look! There it is!

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
The cat! We've gotta catch it!

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:15.889 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
But we were having such a
lovely conversation, Your Grace.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Have you completely
forgotten what we're here for?

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
Thankfully we caught it, but...

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:29.486 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] My gown is
chewed up beyond saving.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
It has a litter
of kittens, though.

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
So I assume it was

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
trying to take this
cloth back to her nest.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center
Well, you can't
wear that anymore.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
You should buy
yourself a new one.

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
I know, it's just that
this gown was my favorite,

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
because you liked me in it.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50% align:center
That looks nice on you.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
To think she remembered such
a casual remark of mine.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
She's so pure!

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
It's all yours now, little one.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.262 position:50% align:center
Come again sometime.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:03.186 position:50% align:center
I appreciate all
your help, Your Grace.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.563 position:50% align:center
Looks like my maid
uniform is dry now,

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
so I'll change and
wear it back to my room.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
You must be chilly, though.

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
Why don't you take another
shower before you go to bed?

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.239 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] All right.
Would you care to join me?

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Inappropriate!

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.159 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case,
I'll return your jacket.

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
[DUKE yelps]

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
No, no, tomorrow will work fine!

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I guess
I'll see you then!

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.666 position:50% align:center
Try not to catch
a cold or anything.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:25.959 position:50% align:center
Good night!

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
The worst moment of the day.

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:32.590 position:50% align:center
And the one when
I always feel the most lonely.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.935 position:50% align:center
Good night, Your Grace.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
Sweet dreams.

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
And who might you be?

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Nobody dodgy, don't worry.

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
We're taking the Duke
to the witches' sabbath.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Darn it all!

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
Cuff and Zain will be here
to get me any minute,

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
and I can't figure out
which stuff to leave behind!

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
You do realize where
we're going, don't you?

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
How do you look
so calm right now?

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center
You're not a bit scared?

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
No, I guess I'm not
particularly scared.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.979 position:50% align:center
I'm even taking them some gifts.

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
Tuna and such.

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center
Are you under the impression
these witches are cats?

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Oh, Alice? You in here?

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.363 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Cuff! Zain!

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:37.906 position:50% align:center
What's with all
that useless garbage?

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:40.617 position:50% align:center
It's not like you'll need it
at the witches' sabbath.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
You're in no danger

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:44.871 position:50% align:center
as long as they don't
find out you're human.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
So leave that junk here.

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
Was that really necessary?

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:49.709 position:50% align:center
Nope.

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
Please, do you think
I could come along

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
to tonight's
witches' sabbath as well?

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
Everyone, slow down!

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
Witches' gatherings are
typically scary, aren't they?

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
How is it you
don't seem concerned?

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] The gatherings
are indeed frightening.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
But relax.

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
I'll see to it that
you're safe, Alice.

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
What about me?

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I wonder,

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
why are the two of them
willing to help me like this?

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.860 position:50% align:center
If the others found out
they brought humans

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
to the witches' sabbath,

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:20.240 position:50% align:center
their own standing
would be compromised.

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:22.951 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] All right, looks like
we can use this to get there.

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.120 position:50% align:center
Cuff, give them the robes.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:26.705 position:50% align:center
Done.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.626 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Put those on--they'll
mask your human stench.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
We'll claim you're my
younger brother and sister.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
Easy.

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
Stick with me, Alice.
You'll be fi--

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] Quit your peacocking
and get a move on!

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:49.519 position:50% align:center
Well, it looks like it's
now or never, I suppose.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:50.645 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Your Grace?

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
You're sure you'll be all right?

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.899 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but there's
no need for you to worry.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
Alice is with me,
and we'll be very careful.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
Then I wish you both
the best of luck tonight

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.918 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Here, watch your step, Alice.

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Witches.

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:36.983 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] They definitely seem
different than Cuff or Zain.

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center
In fact,

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
they look like monsters!

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.197 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center
Look, don't worry, Alice,

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
I'm here to protect you, just
try to remain calm if you can!

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
My goodness, are you
all right, Your Grace?

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I wonder if she's here?

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
Could the witch who cursed me
be nearby at this very moment?

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:59.673 position:50% align:center
[BOY WITCH A] Sorry, mister!
Could you grab that?

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.843 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, sir!

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
I've never seen you before.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
Oh dear.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
I think His Grace has
literally frozen in terror.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:13.687 position:50% align:center
Hang in there.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] This certainly
doesn't bode well.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Has everyone arrived?

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:18.942 position:50% align:center
Anyone missing?

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
Excellent! Let's begin!

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
Night duty Witch,
please do the honors.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
[KETO]
All rise! Bow!

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
A very good evening to all!

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Witches are a little
more polite than I imagined.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
[DALETH] Now then,
time to take attendance. Beto?

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
[BETO]
Yes, ma'am!

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:51.850 position:50% align:center
--[DALETH] Lloyd?
--[BOY WITCH B] He's got a cold.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Elle?

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.353 position:50% align:center
[BOY WITCH B] She couldn't come
because her grandma's visiting.

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:56.563 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Next is Daleth.

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's me, so, present.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Daleth is our leader.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.611 position:50% align:center
Rumor has it, she's
actually quite a looker

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center
underneath that mask.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
You don't say.

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.073 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Keto and Teto?

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
[KETO, TETO]
What up, witches?

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Zain?

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Here I am! Right here.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Cuff?

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
What a surprise.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:18.126 position:50% align:center
It's not like you to come
to a witches' sabbath.

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:19.878 position:50% align:center
Who are the two
you've brought with you?

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Well, uh...

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
They're my siblings, you got it?

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:25.300 position:50% align:center
Sure. They're my kids.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
Mine and Zain's.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
[WITCH A]
I knew it!

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
[WITCH G]
Congratulations!

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Have you
completely lost your mind?

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:35.060 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you?

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
Aren't you being
a little hard on her?

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:37.854 position:50% align:center
Dear papa?

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Call me Daddy!

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Your kids, huh?

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
Great! This should
be interesting.

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center
I'm quite pleased at the
attendance this evening!

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I guess they haven't
figured out that we're human,

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
at least for now.

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
[DALETH] All right,
time for our first report.

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, a flower
blossomed on the mandrake

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:55.580 position:50% align:center
we've all been growing.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
Isn't it adorable?

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, it seems we'll
have to wait a little longer

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
for the poisonous Budgett's
frog eggs to hatch.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.715 position:50% align:center
And if anyone would like to
chip in to buy a Voodoo doll,

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:08.635 position:50% align:center
make sure to do so by
the next witches' sabbath.

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:10.261 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
I'm so beyond grateful
that this is a casual meeting.

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:14.724 position:50% align:center
I am, too.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.977 position:50% align:center
[DALETH] Well, that concludes
tonight's witches' sabbath.

00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Already?!

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.984 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
All right, dismissed.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
What should we do now?

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:29.781 position:50% align:center
The witches' sabbath
is apparently over,

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
and we still haven't found
any leads about my curse.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.122 position:50% align:center
[WITCH A]
I must say,

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
I was amazed to hear
you had children, Zain.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:40.041 position:50% align:center
Did you knock her up?

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
Sure did.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Don't you say another word.

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
[WITCH A] Honestly, what in
the world were you thinking?

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
You know Cuff's got human blood
running through her veins.

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Cuff is a respectable witch.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
Now apologize to her.

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
[WITCH A]
Oh, uh...

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
[WITCH A]
Sorry, Cuff.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
Slip of the tongue.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] No problem,
just as long as you know.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
Now, then. Who's up for a game?

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
You want me to play, too?

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Of course, my boy!
You can do it!

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.205 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES cheer]

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
And so, we meet again, Alice.

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure
you knew it was me.

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:28.173 position:50% align:center
[DALETH] Of course. I have a
knack for remembering faces.

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
He blocked it with his face!

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
[DALETH] So, clearly you've
won Zain and Cuff over

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
and made your way here to see
me, but what is it you want?

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:37.640 position:50% align:center
For my part,
to know whether my mother

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:40.018 position:50% align:center
had a connection to you witches.

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
My! I'm not actually sure.

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
You must understand,

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
I was only a slight
acquaintance of your mother's.

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice, do you have a hanky?

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:50.653 position:50% align:center
The ball hit me in the face!

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.113 position:50% align:center
Oh, goodness!

00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
You two certainly seem close.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
Are you an item?

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Uh, no, we aren't,
but do we look it?

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Well, you've grown quite a bit,

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
in spite of
your unfortunate curse.

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
You know me?

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
You know who I am?

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Oh, yes.

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center
I saw you at that fancy mansion
when you were little.

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
And of course, I also know
about the witch who cursed you.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
In that case,
could you tell us who she is?

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
Please, let us meet her.

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
We've come in hopes that
she'll break the curse.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:26.064 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
I'm afraid that's impossible.

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.026 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Because she's dead.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
And no, I have absolutely
no idea how to break your curse,

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
so that's out.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
But, if the curse doesn't
break when the witch dies,

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
can't you at least tell us
how she passed away?

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
And why did she do it?

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.871 position:50% align:center
What did she curse me for?

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
So many questions with you.

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:47.669 position:50% align:center
Listen closely:
she was a whiz at magic,

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
and she died because of it.

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
I'll say no more on the subject.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
I really despise that witch.

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
But I need to--

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
A word of advice.

00:18:58.096 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
The curse you've got
is unlike anything

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:03.518 position:50% align:center
some run-of-the-mill witch
could ever cast.

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
I would suggest that you stop
wasting time and just give up.

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
Ow, that's hot!

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
What'd you do that for?

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
Be careful, Your Grace.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
Without your robe on.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
[BOY WITCH A]
I smell a human.

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center
[WITCH H]
It's a human.

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
[WITCH I]
A human.

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
Uh. What do we do?

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:23.496 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Come on,
let's run back to the mirror.

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:26.249 position:50% align:center
[WITCH B]
A human?

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
[BOY WITCH C]
Yeah, that's what they say.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
[WITCH C]
Don't let them get away!

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
[WITCH J]
Grab them!

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
[KETO] You're totally gonna be
pet food for my magic plant!

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
Alice! You all right?

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes, Thank you, Your Grace.

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
[KETO]
Now it's dead!

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.231 position:50% align:center
[TETO]
Like, why?

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
Don't let them go!

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.404 position:50% align:center
[WITCH E]
After them!

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:00.742 position:50% align:center
[WITCH F]
Zain! Cuff! Get back here!

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
[WITCH E] Why are you siding
with the dirty humans?

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
[WITCH A]
No! Come back! Come back, I say!

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
[DUKE sighs]
We're safe.

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Cuff, Zain, sorry.
You did this for me.

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to thank you.

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN laughs]

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:23.098 position:50% align:center
Did you see how
freakin' pissed they were?

00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:25.767 position:50% align:center
Ooh, they had me scared!

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
We always fight like that,
so don't worry about it.

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
I daresay, they'll forget
about it in no time.

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:34.192 position:50% align:center
Gets us out of going to a
witches' sabbath for a while.

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.111 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Though, I would
take on every witch

00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
in this wretched world
for you, Alice.

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
Are you hurt?

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
Not a scratch.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
Why don't you take another trip?

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
You were great back there.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
It happened so fast.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
You protected me and guarded
my life with your own.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
So, did you manage
to get any good leads?

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:02.137 position:50% align:center
Yes. I got some information
from that witch, Daleth.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
It wound up being a lot
bleaker than I'd hoped,

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
but at least
I know the truth now.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
And that's due to you.
Thank you.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
Well, great. I'm glad.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Tell me,

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:15.692 position:50% align:center
why is it that you've been
helping me out so much?

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
We haven't known
each other for long,

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.155 position:50% align:center
and there's nothing in it for
you, being a witch and all.

00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not sure
I know the reason why.

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:26.661 position:50% align:center
Although, when I think
about the day we first met.

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
When I saw you going all-out
for someone else's sake,

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:32.751 position:50% align:center
I know that's when
I decided we'd be friends.

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
Really? 'Cause
I feel the same way!

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:37.797 position:50% align:center
I hope that you and Zain
and I can all be friends!

00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:38.798 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
This is actually relaxing.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center
The next time we come by
it'll be to hang out as buds.

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
See ya!

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.226 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
So long, sweet Alice! Ouch!

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center
They actually
want to be friends!

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
Did you hear that?

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
I have friends now.
It's amazing!

00:21:56.941 --> 00:22:00.487 position:50% align:center
Seeing you this happy makes
me happy, too, Your Grace.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.031 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I don't know what
will become of my curse.

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
But I feel confident that I'll
get to the truth of the matter.

00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:09.120 position:50% align:center
Thank you for sticking with me
through everything, Alice.

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:10.830 position:50% align:center
I hope that you always will.

00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:14.250 position:50% align:center
Of course, we'll break
the curse no matter what.

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50% align:center
It's tough not being able
to touch the one you love.

00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:18.088 position:50% align:center
Have I mentioned that?

00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:19.798 position:50% align:center
Yes, and I agree.

00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:21.341 position:50% align:center
Would you like to touch me?

00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:23.843 position:50% align:center
Just like that?
Straight for the breasts?

00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:25.637 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't a hand be
a bit more appropriate?

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.974 position:50% align:center
Besides, I can't
touch them anyway!

00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:32.143 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Think I'll come back tomorrow.

00:24:06.488 --> 00:24:09.657 position:50% align:center
[ROB] "The Duke's
and Alice's Uneventful Day."
