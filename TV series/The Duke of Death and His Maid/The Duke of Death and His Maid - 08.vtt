[NARRATOR]
Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.911 position:50% align:center
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love,

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
never once feel
their skin against yours.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
He takes the life of
anything he touches.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
That was the curse the witch
cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
His own mother keeps
him at a distance.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:50.550 position:50% align:center
His former friends
name him a monster.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
Even strangers speak of
him as Death incarnate.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:59.142 position:50% align:center
And yet, he doesn't
feel the least bit lonely.

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:39.367 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
A. B. C.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:40.994 position:50% align:center
E?

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
The fourth letter
of the alphabet is D.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
[CUFF groans]
This is so hard.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.250 position:50% align:center
It's giving me a headache.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.044 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] You've
only just started learning.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] If it helps,
you have our full support.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.048 position:50% align:center
I wanna get this reading
and writing stuff down

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
as quick as I can.

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:57.010 position:50% align:center
Zain will be so surprised
when he finds out.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:58.803 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
That's amazing, Cuff!

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:01.431 position:50% align:center
Who's a smart girl?

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.641 position:50% align:center
Speaking of Zain,
where is he today?

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:04.893 position:50% align:center
He's at the circus.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.062 position:50% align:center
Huh? You sold him to the circus?

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.438 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center
We have nothing else to do,
so we got jobs there.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
"At a place like the circus,

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
no one will look
twice at us

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
or suspect that we're witches."

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
Zain thinks up the
best plans, doesn't he?

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, well...

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:22.118 position:50% align:center
As usual, she seems content to
let him make all the decisions.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
[ROB] You can't underestimate
the value of an education.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
So, please be sure
to study hard, Ms. Cuff.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'm counting
on you, Teach!

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
By the way, what does the
"Ms." in "Ms. Cuff" mean?

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.590 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Not sure.
But it has a nice ring, right?

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:38.051 position:50% align:center
Wow, excellent answer, "Teach."

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.934 position:50% align:center
[MAIDS]
Good morning, Lord Walter.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
We hope you slept well.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Lookin' cool.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.527 position:50% align:center
Auditioning for the part
of teen idol, Dear Brother?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
Viola, don't tell me that you're
planning to run off somewhere.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
You'll miss the
luncheon if you do.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
Leaving me the arduous task
of placating Mother.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.621 position:50% align:center
I can't help it if
I'm a busy young lady.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
Let me guess, you're going
to the former family villa

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
to visit our
wretched cursed brother.

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
It's none of your
business where I go.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
But it most certainly is.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
For I shall soon
inherit the family title,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.510 position:50% align:center
and as the head of our house,

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
I must know all of my younger
sister's comings and goings.

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center
You're the secondborn, though.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center
As the eldest,
our brother simply needs

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
to break the
witch's pesky curse,

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.937 position:50% align:center
and the title will
remain with him.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
How can you be so cruel.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
You know how badly
those words wound me!

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Calm down.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
All I said was
"you're the secondborn son."

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
There, you said it again!

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
You said it again!

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
Curse or not,
I never have cared for him.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
I do not see why
he should be favored

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
for an accident of birth.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
How much longer will
Mother pin her hopes on him?

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Who knows when or even
if he'll break his curse?

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
May I go after I finish my tea?

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50% align:center
I really don't have a second--

00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Secondborn?

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
Why must you
continue to torture me...

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
This is starting to get old.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
Fine, tell me this at least.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
How long does it take
to get to the villa from here?

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Hmm...
About two hours, I guess.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
You've revealed your
true intentions!

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
That is your destination,
after all.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.068 position:50% align:center
Your mention of the number two--

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50% align:center
reminds me of being
the secondborn son,

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.905 position:50% align:center
and I can't stand it!

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
He died.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Why?

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.535 position:50% align:center
Why are you going to see him?

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
You clearly have
a soft spot for him,

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.997 position:50% align:center
but I don't understand why!

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
Can't you see I'd make
a better head of the family

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
than he would?

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
Could you tone
down the desperation?

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center
If it helps, I had no particular
plans to take either side.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.382 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
You have to pick a side!

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center
Specifically, mine!

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Now that you're
done with your tantrum,

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
I'll be leaving.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
Be a dear and
don't inform Mother

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
that I've been
going to the villa.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Well, I can't make any promises.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.854 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Secondborn son.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Please forgive my tardiness.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:06.074 position:50% align:center
Um. Viola is visiting
a friend's house.

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center
[WALTER] One of these days,
I'll show you.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
You'll see once and for all
that I'm better than him,

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
and that I'm far worthier
than he to lead this family.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Yoo-hoo! Dearest Brother!

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
Viola's here!

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
You are?

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
I'm Cuff.

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
A performer in the local circus.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:32.350 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Okay, and where are
the people who live here?

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
No clue.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:34.394 position:50% align:center
Make yourself at home.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] There's something
fishy about her.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
Did she come in unannounced?

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
Well, technically I did, too.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.234 position:50% align:center
This bird looks like Zain.

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
A shiny, golden Zain.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
That gleam in her eye.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's a burglar?

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.201 position:50% align:center
I've got to do something
about this intruder.

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
If I take care of her,

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50% align:center
maybe Rob will reward me
by stroking my hair.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
It's only one girl.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
With a patented Viola tackle,
she'll go down!

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
They're big and soft.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
And squishy, too!

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.219 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.473 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
If I'm anything like Mother,

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
I'll always be flat as a board.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] She attacked me, and
she's the one taking damage?

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center
She's just a child.

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
She probably wants to play.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
Aw, Don't cry. I'll help you.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Here's my chance!

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
I've got you now!

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
That's enough.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
You can let me go.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
No! You won't get away!

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
You're my prisoner!

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
I'd rather not do this,

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
but I can't trust you
to behave yourself,

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50% align:center
so I'll just have to sit here
and prevent you from moving.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
Okay. Can I take a nap?

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Why aren't you upset?

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
Earlier, you called for
your "Dearest Brother."

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Uh, yeah. So?

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
You two.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
Well, you're a lot alike.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait. So let me
get this straight,

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.275 position:50% align:center
not only do you know
my gloomy older brother,

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
but you're daring
to lump me in with him?

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.071 position:50% align:center
He's a good guy, though.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah. Okay.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.158 position:50% align:center
I mean, he isn't too bad.

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
I suppose.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center
You like him, too, don't you?

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
Oh, well... Uh, um,
well, I guess.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.710 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to keep
you waiting, Cuff.

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
Catching the cat took us
longer than we'd expected.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.965 position:50% align:center
Oh, Rob. Hi.

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
Looks like we
interrupted something.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
We'll just come back
later, shall we?

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.095 position:50% align:center
I can explain!

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
Please don't go. Rob!

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.391 position:50% align:center
This is terrible!

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center
What if he refuses
to marry me now?

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
What in the world
are you talking about?

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:44.899 position:50% align:center
So I had you pegged
as a burglar,

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
but you're actually
a friend of my brother's.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
How embarrassing.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
I didn't think gloomy
people had friends,

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50% align:center
so you can't really blame me.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.033 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Relax, I'm not mad.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.159 position:50% align:center
You're just a kid.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center
I am not a kid, thank you!

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
I am a respectable young lady.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Lady Viola.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
If you'll please excuse me.

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
A speck of dust was
marring your beautiful hair.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
Oh, was it?

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.883 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Rob.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
Guess what, world,
my wish came true!

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Lady Viola is such a
charmingly exuberant girl.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Sometimes I get the feeling

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
you do these things
on purpose, Rob.

00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
It's snowing pretty heavily.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
Well, we have had
a lot of clear days lately.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
Besides, nights like these

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
give me an excuse
to invite you for tea.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
Go easy on me.

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
I'm only a beginner, after all.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
No feminine wiles allowed!

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
Hey. Careful taking your eyes
off the board, Alice.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
I might start moving
some pieces around.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
All right, then.

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center
If I lose, I'll strip,
just like we agreed.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
We made no such agreement.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.024 position:50% align:center
And you're already stripping!

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
When it snows like this,

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center
I can't help but remember the
day that I first arrived here.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.519 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
I'm coming in, Your Grace.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
I see that you've made
a mess of your room again.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
And you're sitting in the dark.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.609 position:50% align:center
I'm not interested
in your lectures.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
Leave me and
take the lantern with you.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.114 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Not quite yet.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
I've brought someone
I'd like you to meet.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
You can come in now.

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
Hello, Your Grace.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
It's been ages
since I last saw you,

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
but I'm thrilled to be
working as your maid.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
Alice Lendrott, at your service.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
What? It's been ages?

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
I highly doubt that,
whoever you are.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
And I don't remember saying
you could hire a maid, Rob!

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
[ROB] The lady of the house gave
me her permission, Your Grace,

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
and if I'm not mistaken,

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
you and Alice were good
friends when you were little.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:26.728 position:50% align:center
I thought you would be pleased.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
I don't have
any recollection of that.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
I hated my childhood days,

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.736 position:50% align:center
and I have no desire
to be reminded of them!

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
Go home at once.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
There's no place
for you in this manor.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
Despite all the
time that's passed,

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
I have never forgotten you,
Your Grace,

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:47.874 position:50% align:center
not even for a single day.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
You see, following
my mother's death,

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
I was left in my
aunt's care for a while.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
Being able to see you again

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
is like a dream
come true for me.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
No, stay back!

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.343 position:50% align:center
The slightest touch
from me will kill you.

00:11:58.426 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I'm aware of that.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
Well, none of this matters.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
I won't allow you to
work here, understand?

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
Go back to your aunt's house
and leave me alone.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.354 position:50% align:center
Good. We have His Grace's
blessing on your employment,

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:12.107 position:50% align:center
so let's see about
finding you a room, Alice.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.191 position:50% align:center
I don't know
what you just heard,

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
but it definitely
wasn't a blessing!

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
Your body's grown
since I last saw you,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
but your eyes haven't
changed a bit.

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
They still have that
gentle look, Your Grace.

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
That girl. How dare she?

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
Leave me to rot.
Stay far, far away.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.515 position:50% align:center
Please, I'm begging you.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center
Just let me die alone.

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Are you sure that's
where you'd like to sleep?

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
It's an old storage shed

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
and has certainly
seen better days.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:03.491 position:50% align:center
I'm comfortable
in cramped quarters.

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center
[ROB] You must have been
quite shocked back there.

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
He's an adolescent boy, you see,

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
and lately he acts
like that all the time.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.042 position:50% align:center
Oh, his behavior
didn't bother me at all.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.918 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Well, that's a relief.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:17.088 position:50% align:center
May I say, it's a pleasure
to have you here.

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
The pleasure is all mine.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll work
as hard as I can.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.719 position:50% align:center
[ROB] I'm sure you've
heard this before,

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
but you really do take
after your mother, Alice.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
Yes. People often tell me that.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Hey! You're still here?

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
And why are you wearing
that mourning dress?

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me,
is that your uniform?

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Yes. Your Grace, that hat.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
It looks good on you.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.699 position:50% align:center
Oh, this old thing?

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
It was just lying around,
so I put it on.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
But forget about
what I'm wearing.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.081 position:50% align:center
That's too showy
for a maid uniform.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50% align:center
It's grounds for dismissal!

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
Is it too showy?

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
I didn't know.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.381 position:50% align:center
Is the problem
the bust, perhaps?

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
Leads to distraction and
thoughts of touching?

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
Hold on, yesterday you told me

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
you knew about
my curse, didn't you?

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center
Of course I know.

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Then stay away.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50% align:center
Who do you think you are?

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
I'm Alice.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center
That's not what I was asking.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center
No, I've had enough!

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
I hate you!

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
Don't follow me!

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
Why bother?

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
There's no point.

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:37.711 position:50% align:center
So, this is where you've
been hiding, Your Grace.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:40.130 position:50% align:center
I thought I might tempt you
with some dinner.

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
Won't you try eating
at least a little bit?

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.217 position:50% align:center
I don't want any.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
I told you. I'm not going
to eat a single bite

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
until you leave this place.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling
you don't like me.

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
No, I don't!

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:54.352 position:50% align:center
You act nice,
but I bet you're laughing at me.

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:58.815 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm an ugly grouch
and cursed on top of that.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
Can't you see that
I'd be better off dead?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
You say you want
to be of use to me,

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:07.699 position:50% align:center
but really you're only out
to glorify yourself.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
You have such a way with words.

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
You're very poetic.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
I'll go now, but I'll
leave your dinner here.

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
Just eat whenever you're ready.

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
By the way, I noticed
that you're wearing gloves.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.848 position:50% align:center
They look very nice on you.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
I suspected as much.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Though I'm sorry to hear

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.818 position:50% align:center
you faced such hardship
at your aunt's.

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
I've had my fair share.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:48.573 position:50% align:center
But it's not as though
my aunt's family was well off.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.116 position:50% align:center
But still, when
I think of His Grace,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
I can't help but feel
that my life's been...

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.747 position:50% align:center
Alice, I'd like you to come
with me for a minute, please.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50% align:center
Um. What's with
that look on your face?

00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's just such
a lovely surprise

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
to hear you call me by my name.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
What? Never mind, now come on!

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
My, what a gorgeous room.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Yeah, sure.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
I'm giving you three days to
make it spotless in here.

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:19.354 position:50% align:center
If you fail, then you're fired.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.815 position:50% align:center
And no asking Rob for help.

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.733 position:50% align:center
You have to do it alone.

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
Good luck.

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best!

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Give me your hand.

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
I'll take you to your room.

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.548 position:50% align:center
You sure get sick a lot,
don't you?

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:49.009 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should
stay inside more.

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, your hand's so warm!

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
Do you find it satisfactory?

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
It's done?

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
In one night?

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
Yes. Thinking of how I could
finally be of use to you

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
really motivated me, Your Grace.

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
When I told you to leave,

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:27.797 position:50% align:center
I did it for your own good,
not just mine.

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] There must something
more meaningful for you to do

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
than taking care
of a wretch like me.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I have nowhere else to go,

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
and I'd like to be by your side.

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
It's been some time.

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:51.154 position:50% align:center
You still don't want
to remember who I am?

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm a patient person.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
I can wait until you're
ready to remember.

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Suit yourself.

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] How long are
you going to sit there?

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Until your tears
have subsided, Your Grace.

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
It's gotten chilly in here.

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:20.767 position:50% align:center
Shall I brew us some more tea?

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
No, that's all right.

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.187 position:50% align:center
I would really rather
you not leave just yet.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
You're not leaving,
so I'm leaving!

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I can't feel my fingers.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
My feet are aching
from the cold.

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
I don't know which way
the mansion is anymore.

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
This is so hard.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
I'm lonely and miserable.

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
[WITCH] "No one shall love you,
and you shall love no one.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
You shall live
a life full of misery."

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Are you happy now, witch?

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
This is all your fault.

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
I really wish

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.984 position:50% align:center
I'd gotten the chance
to love someone.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I thought I was a goner.

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.204 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should just die.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
Resign myself to my fate
and let everything go.

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:33.798 position:50% align:center
Ever since I was cursed,

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
I've lived an unhappy
joke of a life.

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
I yearned for even
a single friend.

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
Was that asking too much?

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:45.894 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I remember now.

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
That girl's name was Alice.

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:52.067 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.902 position:50% align:center
I'd hoped that one day.

00:19:53.985 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
I'd see her again,
but then I forgot.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.744 position:50% align:center
To think I'd remember her now,

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
when I'm about to die, and
have lost my chance for good.

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
Goodbye, Alice.

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace?

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
Alice, what?

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
I've already decided
I'm going to die,

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
so you might as well go away
and leave me in peace.

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
Just go. Mind your own business.
Hey, what the--?

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
"Just go"?

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
Leave you here so you
can throw your life away?

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
I'd rather help you come
to your senses!

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
Stop it.

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:44.577 position:50% align:center
You have the right to
be happy, Your Grace!

00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:46.913 position:50% align:center
I don't care whether
you're cursed or not.

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.666 position:50% align:center
I can't stand the thought
of you giving up.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:52.377 position:50% align:center
Please, consider
the feelings of those

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
you would be leaving behind.

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:57.298 position:50% align:center
You may not see it,

00:20:57.382 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
but there are people
who care about you!

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center
I was a sickly child growing
up, and a lonely one.

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
Every day I struggled against
anxiety and hopelessness.

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:11.771 position:50% align:center
But then you showed up
with your kindness

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
and your gentle eyes and
made everything better.

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
I lived through the darkness
because you came to save me.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
Grab on and I'll help you up.

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
Take your time.
There's no rush.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:31.791 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Let's head back
and--let's keep on living,

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:33.335 position:50% align:center
the two of us together.

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:35.337 position:50% align:center
For all of our days.

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:47.432 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Good heavens.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you
made it home safely.

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:53.646 position:50% align:center
Only because Alice
came to save me.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.024 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for making
you worry, though, Rob.

00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:57.192 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Not at all.

00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:58.443 position:50% align:center
So, I take it the two of you

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:01.488 position:50% align:center
are getting along
a bit better now?

00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.156 position:50% align:center
Well, I, uh...

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.328 position:50% align:center
I think...

00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:09.662 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Yes?

00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:12.749 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I think, as it turns out,

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:14.709 position:50% align:center
I like her.

00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:15.919 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Checkmate.

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:16.961 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:18.004 position:50% align:center
How'd that happen?!

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:19.756 position:50% align:center
To be perfectly honest,

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:21.758 position:50% align:center
I noticed that you
weren't paying attention,

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:24.177 position:50% align:center
so I moved the
pieces around a bit.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.428 position:50% align:center
Not fair.

00:22:25.512 --> 00:22:27.722 position:50% align:center
You're adorable,
and it's not fair.

00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:30.225 position:50% align:center
It's impossible not to like you.

00:22:30.308 --> 00:22:32.310 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:34.396 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
It's not fair.

00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:10.075 position:50% align:center
[ROB] "The Duke, Alice,
and the Christmas Eve Vow."
