Death incarnate, huh?

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] "Dear Mother and Father,
how are you faring?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.622 position:50% align:center
I remain a lost cause."

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:28.004 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] "I'm sorry to report
that this wretched curse,

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.423 position:50% align:center
which takes the life's breath
of any unfortunate thing

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:34.260 position:50% align:center
I happen to touch,
shows no sign of breaking."

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.681 position:50% align:center
[MAID] My Lady, another
animal touched the boy and...

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.432 position:50% align:center
[MOM] Living under
the same roof with him

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.393 position:50% align:center
makes me tremble with fear.

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.019 position:50% align:center
Send him to our villa.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.980 position:50% align:center
That child is like
Death incarnate.

[DUKE]
"I don't understand.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.695 position:50% align:center
Why did the witch
put this curse on me?"

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.295 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] "There is something
else that troubles me.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.756 position:50% align:center
A lot. And that's..."

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.632 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Pardon me.

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:13.925 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.052 position:50% align:center
Your tea is ready whenever
you are, Your Grace.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.053 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Too close!

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.319 position:50% align:center
So, aren't you
going to send that?

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
It's a letter for
your parents, right?

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.823 position:50% align:center
No, I couldn't send them that!

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
I hadn't written a letter in a
very long time, so I was rusty.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:06.413 position:50% align:center
That one was honestly
just for practice.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
Mmm.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
This is really good!

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
Well, thank you, Your Grace.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.463 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
My maid's name is Alice.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what
goes on in her head.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.511 position:50% align:center
She knows if I touch her,
she'll die, but...

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50% align:center
My goodness.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.265 position:50% align:center
Chilly today, isn't it?

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] She does things
that don't make sense!

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
Every day she tries
to get a rise out of me,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
and then watches how I react.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
What is it, Your Grace, is there
something bothering you?

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
What on earth are you doing?

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.488 position:50% align:center
Oh, I thought you wanted me to.

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
Do forgive me, Your Grace.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.325 position:50% align:center
No, I didn't drop my
head down to see up your skirt!

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.494 position:50% align:center
I'll keep telling you,
lay off the sexual harassment!

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
It makes things
ridiculously hard for me!

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
It's just.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.377 position:50% align:center
I can't seem to stop myself.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.254 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
But you've got to!

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center
Truly, you should
put your own safety first.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center
After all, you're the one maid

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.345 position:50% align:center
who's willing to
stay here with me.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.388 position:50% align:center
I don't want to lose you.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
Listen, Alice.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.685 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what
I mean to you, but I...

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
Would you care
for another cookie?

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
There are plenty here.

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
Were you even listening?

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
Yes, right up to
the part where you said,

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.860 position:50% align:center
"I don't know what
I mean to you."

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
Was there more?

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
No, there wasn't more,
you heard it all!

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.114 position:50% align:center
You just ignored it!

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.533 position:50% align:center
Come now, you mustn't
let food go to waste.

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
Please clean your plate.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
All right, fine, I will.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Mmmm.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] No! The weird noises
are way too much!

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
Wasn't that an indirect kiss?

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
Really?! Did you have to
say it out loud like that?!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?!

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.078 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I take the life
of anything I touch.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.747 position:50% align:center
A witch put this curse
on me when I was five.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
That's all I know.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Who she was, where she
came from, what she wanted,

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
or why she did it,
my memory fails me.

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:27.554 position:50% align:center
[WITCH] "No one shall love you,
and you shall love no one.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
You shall live a
life full of misery."

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] All I can really
remember are the witch's words.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:39.441 position:50% align:center
My mother turned her back, gave
me this mansion in the forest,

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
and left me here.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen my family since.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50% align:center
If only I could break the curse,
I could go home.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
My real home, where I belong.

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Might I ask what
you're doing, Your Grace?

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.557 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice! No! Not this again!

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
I told you to lay off

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
the sexual harassment
for your own well-being!

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.649 position:50% align:center
See, this is the problem.

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
You always react so innocently,

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
and then it makes me want
to tease you all the more!

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.742 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Alice is the only
daughter of the head maid

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.452 position:50% align:center
at my family's residence.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
I've known her since
she was a young child.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
I hadn't seen her for a while.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
Until about two years ago,

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.837 position:50% align:center
when, for reasons I don't
understand, she came here.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace.

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
Allow me to try
and cheer you up.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
No!

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
That isn't going to
make me feel any better!

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
You stopped, then started again!

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.899 position:50% align:center
Alice, I know I may not
look like it, but I am a man!

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
I mean, what if I were to give
into temptation and touch you?

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
So, you're saying you want to?

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] You've got
to stop toying with me.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.597 position:50% align:center
A very good morning
to you, Your Grace.

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
Why must you always
get so close?

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:37.851 position:50% align:center
What if you touched me
accidentally?

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.436 position:50% align:center
Have you ever thought of that?

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
This is awful.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
She saw the weird faces
I make in my sleep.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I've brought you breakfast.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
I'm not hungry.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.118 position:50% align:center
And this looks
like way too much.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] You said the
same thing last night

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
when you decided
to skip your dinner.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
You need to eat.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.332 position:50% align:center
Didn't your mother
used to insist

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
on three square meals a day?

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
I think it's highly unfair
to bring up my mother.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Your Grace,
I'm worried about you.

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
Please consider carefully.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
I mean, what if you should
fall ill and never be able

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center
to spend your nights fooling
around with me again?

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.057 position:50% align:center
Spend my nights
doing what with you?

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.808 position:50% align:center
All right. Fine.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
I'll admit, I do often feel
guilty that I'm not able

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
to finish the food
you make me, so...

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
...I can eat a little, I guess.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Okay. Open wide.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] You mean
you're really going to feed me?

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
Ahh...

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] She's staring
at the inside of my mouth!

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, I don't get many
chances to see that part of you.

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
I just couldn't resist.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Well, don't! That's weird!

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
Then as an apology, would you
care to have a look inside mine

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
to make things a bit more fair?

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
No, that really
won't be necessary.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
I'll eat on my own.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
Please hand me the fork.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Here you are.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50% align:center
Your Grace, why, if I may ask,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
do you seem so
uninterested in eating?

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
That's easy.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
Because ever since I was cursed,

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
mealtimes were by far
the worst part of the day.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center
That's why.

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
It's been slow progress,
but ever since you came here,

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
I've started eating more.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.253 position:50% align:center
I really am.

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'll just
clear away these dishes.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
I forgot. One more thing.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
Your childhood
friend Philip says

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:48.940 position:50% align:center
he'd very much like to see you,
as it's been far too long.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.330 position:50% align:center
Oh, Mother,
from what I understand,

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
Philip was here just now.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:09.127 position:50% align:center
Well, then that's none
of your concern, dear.

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I told him I'd see him,

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
but now that the day's arrived,
I'm getting cold feet.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
What do you think, is it
too late for me to refuse?

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
I could send a letter
saying I can't meet today.

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.373 position:50% align:center
Yes, it is too late.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
You'll have to go
through with it.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.795 position:50% align:center
We were all much younger then,
but do you remember Philip?

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center
Indeed. He was unusually
lively for a noble's son.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
I remember that quite clearly.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
He used to chase you around

00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
with a snake in his
hand or throw bugs at you.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's him.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
He was a bit of
a troublemaker then.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
I would agree.

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
But, Your Grace,
you're still looking forward

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
to seeing him again, aren't you?

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Let's see, maybe,
"Hello! How have you been?"

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
Stop eavesdropping at my door!

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's definitely
been a long time

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center
since we've had guests.

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:21.616 position:50% align:center
I'll change into formal-wear.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Very well, I'll take
your tuxedo out of storage.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:25.954 position:50% align:center
Now, about that hat.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
I'm not taking it off!

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
I've got circles under
my eyes, and my hair,

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
it's curly and dumb-looking.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
With the hat,
I can hide those flaws.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I wouldn't
call them flaws at all.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
You have hair that
anyone would love

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:44.556 position:50% align:center
to curl around their fingers,
dark, mysterious eyes, too.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.641 position:50% align:center
And...

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
Such kissable lips,
which are now close to mine.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'll go and get
your tuxedo ready.

00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:01.906 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Will this do for the occasion?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
It's perfect, thank you.

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:06.411 position:50% align:center
You can leave Alice.
I need to change now.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
But, Your Grace, I thought
I would stay and help.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.124 position:50% align:center
I'm perfectly capable on my own.

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
I can't just take my
clothes off in front of a girl!

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:15.378 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you would feel
less self-conscious

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
if both of us took
our clothes off?

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.048 position:50% align:center
Of course not!

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:19.257 position:50% align:center
What are you thinking?

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
If you don't start undressing,

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
then I guess I'll
have to go first.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
What kind of threat is
that supposed to be?

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
You know, the thing is,
if I'm being honest,

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
I'm actually hopeful
about today.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
Yes, I gathered as much.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
Careful not to touch me.

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Aren't I always?

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.866 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
When I was cursed

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
and everyone else
started avoiding me,

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
he was the one person
who saw me differently.

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
I've never forgotten that.

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
It meant a lot
to me at the time.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
Now that the day's here,
I feel nervous about seeing him.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
But if he's willing
to give me a chance,

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:04.427 position:50% align:center
that could really change things.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
I dare to hope that perhaps

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center
we could even be
friends again, someday.

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
Well, then, I'd better
put your tie on.

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
All right, stay still for me.

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center
Too close!

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'd prefer that you
not yell into my chest, please.

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
Listen, you can't
behave like this

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
when Philip is
around, all right?

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I can't abide
the idea of another man

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
seeing so much of your,
uh, bare skin.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.667 position:50% align:center
He won't, don't worry.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.836 position:50% align:center
I only do this for you.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
Ah, good. Then,
I guess that's okay.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] There's no point if I
don't get to see your reaction.

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
Scratch that! This is not okay!

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:54.853 position:50% align:center
Welcome! Hello there, Philip.

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
Yes, hello!
Thank you for having me.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:14:59.482 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time.

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
You're not going to start
throwing bugs at me, are you?

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
Why would I do that?

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.532 position:50% align:center
You'd play various
and sundry pranks on me

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:09.576 position:50% align:center
all the time back then.

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center
It seems you've
really mellowed out.

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
Ah! That was so long ago
I can barely remember it.

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center
But please forgive me!

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.503 position:50% align:center
Oh! No, it's not that I wanted
you to apologize for it.

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
[BUTLERS]
My Lord!

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center
Ha! Don't mind them.

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.844 position:50% align:center
They're a little, um...

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
They're just really fond
of making cool poses!

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:50.116 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I wish I hadn't
gotten my hopes up.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
That only makes it feel worse.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
So, what is it you want, Philip?

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, um, nothing
in particular, I guess.

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
Just wanted to visit and
catch up with an old friend.

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
Say there.

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.389 position:50% align:center
Aren't you the daughter
of the family's head maid?

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center
Or am I mistaken?

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
Yes. You really remember me?

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
[PHILIP]
I do, very well, in fact.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
Why are you working
as a maid here?

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
Is it just the two of you?

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
I have a butler, as well.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
He hurt his back
and is recovering,

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
but he'll return soon.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.988 position:50% align:center
So, there are three of us.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
Huh. Interesting.

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:46.172 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace!

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, that was silly.
You okay?

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
Uh. We're all
just fine, thank you!

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Oh dear,
are you leaving so soon?

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
[PHILIP] Yes. I think
we've chatted enough.

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,
where is the lavatory?

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
Follow me. I'll show you.

00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:31.551 position:50% align:center
Problem, sir?

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
Listen, just hear me out.

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
Why don't you come back
into town with us?

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
It's much too dangerous
for you to stay here with him.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
I'll find you another job,
if you like,

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
but you must leave
this place at once.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.398 position:50% align:center
Your very life depends on it.

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
No, thank you.

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center
Wait, why not?

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
Has he already
threatened you, then? Or is it--

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Philip!

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:56.034 position:50% align:center
I sincerely hope you're not
causing Alice any trouble.

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
You can go ahead and disrespect
me as much as you want,

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
but you will not be
doing that with her!

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace, please, calm down.

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
Stay... away!

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare come near me!

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:11.716 position:50% align:center
You foul monster!

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
[PHILIP] The truth is, I didn't
want to come here to begin with.

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Then why did you?

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
[PHILIP] She wanted me
to see how you were doing.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
I was sent by your mother.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.074 position:50% align:center
There's been some talk of
having your younger brother

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
inherit the family title.

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
And knowing your family,
if that does happen,

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
they'll sever ties
with you for good.

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER D]
My Lord?

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
Nothing is amiss.

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
I'll be there shortly.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
It's true, I may be scared
of you, but also, I pity you.

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
Telling you the truth
is my way of trying

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
to make amends if I can.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about all this.

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
I'll never come back again.

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
[PHILIP]
Farewell.

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
Your Grace?

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
[DUKE sighs]

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
I'm perfectly fine, Alice!

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
Let's just forget
about it and eat.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
Let me know when
it's ready, would you?

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
[MOM]
Such a good little pianist!

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
[PHILIP]
Let's play again sometime!

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
I can tell,
we'll be buddies forever!

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] This curse will
be broken. Or it won't.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.879 position:50% align:center
My family will once again love
and accept me for who I am.

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
Or they won't.

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
Alice loves me and
will stay by my side forever.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
She doesn't love me and
wishes she'd never come--

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace?

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to let you
know that dinner is ready.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:31.940 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling any better now?

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Oh, uh-huh.

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:42.575 position:50% align:center
Lost cause. That's me.

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
Whenever you're away,

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
I think about things
that disturb my peace.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:52.460 position:50% align:center
My past self, my future self,
and my present self.

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:55.130 position:50% align:center
I've got no confidence
in anything at all.

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
I bet you hate me, too.

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:01.261 position:50% align:center
And I... I feel like I don't
even have the right

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
to love you as I am now.

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
I won't ever be able
to touch you.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
I'll never know the heat of
another's body against mine

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center
nor the warmth of their tears.

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:16.359 position:50% align:center
If I wanted to
give you a present...

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:20.030 position:50% align:center
...even a flower will
just wilt in my hands.

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
Philip was right.

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
I'll never go back
to the house I grew up in.

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:26.494 position:50% align:center
I'll remain an abandoned
monster for all time!

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace.

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center
Didn't you know?

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
In the language of flowers,

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:36.921 position:50% align:center
a wilted white rose means,

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
"To swear your
whole life to someone."

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:43.636 position:50% align:center
And that's enough.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.014 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's perfect.

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:47.974 position:50% align:center
So, don't fret.

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:50.602 position:50% align:center
We'll break your curse together.

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Someday. I hope...

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:04.366 position:50% align:center
I'll put a ring on your
finger with my own hands.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.471 position:50% align:center
[MOM]
I see, so that's how it is.

00:23:08.555 --> 00:23:11.891 position:50% align:center
[PHILIP] Yes. There's no sign
of the curse being broken,

00:23:11.975 --> 00:23:14.477 position:50% align:center
but he seems to be
leading a peaceful life.

00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:17.313 position:50% align:center
[MOM]
Thank you. You may go.

00:23:26.781 --> 00:23:28.158 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
That was excellent.

00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:31.411 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you thought so,
and that you ate so much of it.

00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:34.122 position:50% align:center
I did. I wonder why.

00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:37.000 position:50% align:center
Maybe because I was
feeling tense today.

00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:42.797 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Alice, you make
such wonderful meals.

00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:44.841 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful.

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:48.261 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'm happy to do it
for you as long as you'd like.

00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:52.057 position:50% align:center
Every day. Breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

00:23:54.851 --> 00:23:57.604 position:50% align:center
For you and only you,
Your Grace.

00:23:57.687 --> 00:23:58.772 position:50% align:center
Always.

00:24:06.571 --> 00:24:10.158 position:50% align:center

His Butler, and a Lost Cat."
