[NARRATOR]
Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.579 position:50% align:center
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love,

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
never once feel
their skin against yours.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
He takes the life of
anything he touches.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
That was the curse the witch
cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.548 position:50% align:center
His own mother keeps
him at a distance.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.217 position:50% align:center
His former friends
name him a monster.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.638 position:50% align:center
Even strangers speak of
him as Death incarnate.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.809 position:50% align:center
And yet, he doesn't
feel the least bit lonely.

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:30.465 position:50% align:center
I caught you!

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
You naughty girl!

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.884 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Mother!

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.344 position:50% align:center
I know, but you've
got to be good

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.221 position:50% align:center
and stay in bed in your room.

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
You know you have
a weak constitution, Alice.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.184 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.937 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I'm not mad
at you, my sweet girl,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.773 position:50% align:center
I just want you to
be safe and well, that's all.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:51.236 position:50% align:center
[SHARON]
Good morning, everyone!

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.780 position:50% align:center
[MAIDS]
Good morning!

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:56.074 position:50% align:center
[HEAD BUTLER]
A lovely morning to you both.

00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:57.492 position:50% align:center
[SHARON]
And to you!

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:59.327 position:50% align:center
[MAID A]
Sharon, I'm really in a bind!

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.788 position:50% align:center
Could you show me how to do
something on the sewing machine?

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.206 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.500 position:50% align:center
I'll be there right after
I take Alice to her room.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.919 position:50% align:center
[MAID B] I just found
some bugs in the kitchen.

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:10.255 position:50% align:center
Oh, try sprinkling
salt water on the floor.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:11.297 position:50% align:center
You'll need to keep at it

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.425 position:50% align:center
for several days
and see how it goes.

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.801 position:50% align:center
That's our head maid for you!

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.594 position:50% align:center
You can always count on her.

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.513 position:50% align:center
Yeah! She really is something!

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
Though I must admit, she lacks
the character of a head maid.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.144 position:50% align:center
Well! That was a
very rude thing to say!

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.020 position:50% align:center
You want character?

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:27.439 position:50% align:center
Then I'll give you character!

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.025 position:50% align:center
Ready? Character!

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:31.776 position:50% align:center
What on earth was that?

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
Oh dear, not funny, then?

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.697 position:50% align:center
What did you think of it, Alice?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.198 position:50% align:center
I think it was perfect.

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.910 position:50% align:center
[giggles] You're too
easy on me, but I love it!

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
[MAID E]
Your Grace, slow down!

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.623 position:50% align:center
Please don't run
in the house, okay?

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.209 position:50% align:center
'Kay! I'm going outside now!

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:57.844 position:50% align:center
Why, Alice!

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
I hadn't realized that you had
made friends with His Grace!

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center
Is that why you
were wandering around

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
the house this morning,
because you were hoping

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.604 position:50% align:center
that you would run
into him somewhere?

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.607 position:50% align:center
Oh, my sweet girl, that's
a long, hard road you tread,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center
but I'll never stand
in your way, all right?

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:14.986 position:50% align:center
Forgive me for teasing you.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center
It's just that your face is so
cute when you blush like that.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Well, good morning
to you, Sharon.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
[SHARON]
Good morning, Rob.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
[ROB] And good morning
to you too, young Alice.

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Always hiding behind
your mother's skirt!

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
[SHARON]
I guess you've got a scary face.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
No need to be afraid.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.132 position:50% align:center
[SHARON]
A smile might help, you know.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.218 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Have you gotten
used to life here?

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.344 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Uh-huh.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:40.261 position:50% align:center
[ROB] And what do
you think of the way

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:41.388 position:50% align:center
your mother does her job?

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
Well, I think she's the best!

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
And when I grow up,
I've already decided

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
that I wanna be a fine
maid just like her, uh, sir.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
My daughter's so
adorable I could cry.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Sounds like you already are.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
I look forward to the day

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.278 position:50% align:center
when you and I can
work together, little Alice.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
What great fun that will be, eh?

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
Good day.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50% align:center
[SHARON]
Okay, I'm going to work now,

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
so please stay in bed like
a good girl, all right?

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:12.752 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
[SHARON]
Oh, my precious Alice,

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
I will always protect you,
no matter what.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
I love you!

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Mother is majorly pissed.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
The fact that Walter
and  I were both gone

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:21.131 position:50% align:center
on Christmas might've
been the last straw.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center
It's all your fault, Walter!

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:26.636 position:50% align:center
I mean, how was I supposed
to know you followed me there?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
It's all his fault,

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
my dear, older brother,
the firstborn.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:39.566 position:50% align:center
[CUFF hums]

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait, that's right.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
I wonder if she'll be all right.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:46.906 position:50% align:center
Okay, look, I know we just met,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
so I shouldn't be saying this,

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:49.492 position:50% align:center
but let's face it,

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
Cuff is a totally useless
good-for-nothing,

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
and do you wanna know why?

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
Because of you, her friend!

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
--[ZAIN] Huh?
--You look out for her too much.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.543 position:50% align:center
You've gotta break that habit.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50% align:center
You could at least let her go
do the shopping by herself

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
sometimes for her own good.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
You really think so?

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Viola may have a point.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
But I'm still worried,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.767 position:50% align:center
so I'll keep watching Cuff
from a distance just in case.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.561 position:50% align:center
I won't bail her out
today, I swear!

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait!

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
Well, will that be all, dearie?

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
Yep! That's everything
on the note.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
Bye, then! Thanks for your help!

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
Miss! Hold on. Where's the cash?

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
Huh, cash?

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.200 position:50% align:center
What you owe me for the goods!

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Hmm...

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
Too bad Zain's
not with me today.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what to do, here.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.124 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN groans]
What the heck is she doing?

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.959 position:50% align:center
I wanna bail her out! I have to!

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.712 position:50% align:center
Grr. No!
I gotta kick that habit!

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
I know!

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:44.923 position:50% align:center
How 'bout if I trade you for it?

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:45.757 position:50% align:center
Well, I...

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.258 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
That's not okay!

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
You're putting
the lady on the spot!

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
Here! Check out this
cat shaped rock that I found!

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:53.348 position:50% align:center
I was planning on giving it
to Zain, but what the hay?

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:54.933 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
No one wants that!

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
Oh, this is awkward.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
Didn't your folks give
you enough money

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.978 position:50% align:center
to pay for these things?

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] Uh. So, "cash" means
"money"? Sorry about that.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
[GROCER]
Quite all right. Thank you.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
Do come again!

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN groans]

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center
[BAKER] Here you go!
Fresh from the oven.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Thank you. Here's some cash.

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
That means "money." 

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.203 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, thanks,
but I knew that.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] She paid the
bill without a hitch.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
You're making some
real progress, Cuff!

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
What soft, lovely bread you are.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
I'll guard you forever.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.803 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
That's kind of unlikely.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
[HUGO]
Sorry.

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.813 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Wait a sec.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
That's not for you.

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.817 position:50% align:center
If you take that money, I'll
get in all kinds of trouble.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.318 position:50% align:center
Zain trusted me with it.

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
[HUGO]
Hey! Let go of me!

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Watch out!

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
You're not hurt, are you?

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center
Um, no.

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
You're nice even
though I tried to...

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
Well, now you know.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
All the stuff Zain
asked me to buy.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Hey there.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
Let's gather this up
and head on home.

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
Bad habits are hard
to break, huh?

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] I don't think I'll
ever be able to kick it.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace?

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
Are you having
trouble sleeping again?

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
Yes, I guess so.

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
I gave up on laying there,
and I hoped

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
a walk around the mansion
might help me get sleepy.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.999 position:50% align:center
Would you like for me
to get into bed with you?

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.000 position:50% align:center
With me?

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
And why are you so close?

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'll go back to
my room and get some pajamas.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
Please wait for me in
your bedchamber, Your Grace.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
Hang on, don't I get a say?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
The whole thing's been
settled with none of my input.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
[knock, knock]

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
May I come in?

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Wait, you're going
through with this?

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll try to stay as
still as I can over here.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
And please, feel free to leave
as soon as I fall asleep.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
Whatever you wish, Your Grace.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.995 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] The one I love
is lying right beside me.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:24.499 position:50% align:center
It's kind of freaking me out.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
Like, a lot. A lot a lot.

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
Look at those long eyelashes.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
Not to mention
her beautiful lips.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
You're my angel,
that's all there is to it.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.891 position:50% align:center
Heh. You really think staring
at me will help you fall asleep?

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.935 position:50% align:center
Ah, I guess you noticed, then.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's not an angel,
but a devil.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.318 position:50% align:center
I'm a little tense now,

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
and it's making it even
harder to fall asleep.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I know what you mean.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
Can I take off my pajamas?

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
What? No! Why?

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] It's just that I always
sleep in the nude in my room,

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
so this is a bit uncomfortable.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Well, you're not in your room!

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
I'll try to make the best of it.

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Actually a Devil
isn't fitting for her.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
More like a Succubus.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.716 position:50% align:center
Your Grace?

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center
This is insane.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
I just pictured
you as a succubus!

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
And did I look good?

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Huh? Definitely.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
Come. Lay down.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
You'll never get to sleep if
you don't put your mind to it.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
You're starting to strip again!

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'm simply not
comfortable in pajamas.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
What if Rob saw us right now?

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
How would we explain it?

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
He'd think that I'm doing
something dirty with you!

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
Is that something
you'd like to try?

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
Now, you're being dirty!

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
You know, on second thought, 

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
it's probably inappropriate
for an unwed couple

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
to sleep in bed together.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
My mother, in particular,
is really straitlaced,

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
so I doubt very much that
she'd approve of it.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.507 position:50% align:center
Tell me more about your mother!

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
I mean, how do you feel
about the lady of the house?

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.350 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I don't have
any strong feelings for her

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
one way or the other now.

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
Like Walter said, she's been
waiting for me this entire time.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
And I do want to have a seat

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
at the family dinner
table once again.

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50% align:center
If I break the curse,
I think we'll make peace.

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
And when we do,
I'll tell her about us.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:22.909 position:50% align:center
I know it's not
the easiest thing

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
for an heir to marry his maid.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
But I'll ask her, anyway.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
And if my family decides
they can't approve,

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
I'll break ties with them and--

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
No, you mustn't.

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
You mustn't even
consider it, Your Grace.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:40.010 position:50% align:center
Please, just don't. Please?

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Huh?

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
First, I've got to
break this curse.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center
That should at least
get the ball rolling.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.896 position:50% align:center
I think I can sleep now.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
Thank you. Feel free to go.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
As you wish.

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
Good night, Alice.

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
I hope I'll see you
again in my dreams.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.703 position:50% align:center
Then I shall see
you in your dreams.

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
Good night, Your Grace.

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.372 position:50% align:center
Sleep well.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.514 position:50% align:center
It still feels warm.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.197 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
He's right.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
Once the curse is broken,

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
His Grace will go back

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
to his family's main
residence as its heir.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
He'll live with them there
in that house, once again.

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
That's as it should be. And yet.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
Why, Alice!

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center
My apologies for bothering
you so late at night.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:14.771 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Rob!

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.024 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, you don't have
to put out your cigarette!

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
Sorry to pester
you on your break.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.903 position:50% align:center
I wanted to show you these!

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
They're a gift from Alice!

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center
She told me she knitted them
a little bit each day,

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
and she thought
of me while she did!

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
Between these mittens
and the scarf she made me,

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
I'll stay toasty warm no matter
how cold it gets outside!

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:38.795 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
What? Say something.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.089 position:50% align:center
Oh, I was just thinking
that you really have begun

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
to smile more lately,
Your Grace.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
It's a far cry from
your old nihilistic days.

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Don't remind me!

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
Even I have to wince when I look
back on that period of time.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.268 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace?

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
I've got your tea ready for you.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.647 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Great! I'm on my way!

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
And you try not to
smoke too much, okay?

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center
As you wish, Your Grace.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.115 position:50% align:center
What memories.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
After His Grace had been cursed

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
and I was ordered
to care for him,

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50% align:center
I was so lost, I honestly
didn't know what to do.

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
It wasn't that I was
afraid of his curse.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.420 position:50% align:center
I'd simply never
raised a child before.

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
I didn't know where to start.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
I feared that I wouldn't be able
to bring him up well all alone,

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
without the help of a woman.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.682 position:50% align:center
Still, he was the
family's precious son.

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.642 position:50% align:center
Your right eye is really scary.

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
There you are, will this do?

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
[ROB] I considered it
an honor to be entrusted

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.361 position:50% align:center
with such a task.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
However, as he grew older,

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:50.367 position:50% align:center
His Grace and I began
to periodically butt heads.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
He fought with me

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
and ran away I don't know
how many times.

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:59.959 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Eventually, His Grace shut
himself in his room completely

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
and started to disappear,
retreating into his shell.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50% align:center
I suspect that his loneliness
had turned into fear.

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:10.178 position:50% align:center
More and more often,

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
he expressed a
desire to end his life.

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center
"If only His Grace
had someone his own age

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
to talk with," I thought.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
And the first person
that came to my mind was...

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
...her.

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
So, you're asking me
to be a maid?

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
Just to be clear,

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:30.407 position:50% align:center
does this mean I could see
His Grace again?

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
[ROB] It was obvious to me
that Alice had been mistreated

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
by her aunt,
whom she lived with.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.997 position:50% align:center
But even so,
I remember her bowing deeply

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
to the woman just
before we departed.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
Now that some time has
passed with all of us living in

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:47.465 position:50% align:center
the same household, it seems
Alice is even more dear

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
to His Grace than I
could've possibly imagined.

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:55.015 position:50% align:center
But there's no doubt
Alice knows exactly

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
where she stands in all of this.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
She knows it only too well.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I'm a little strange, aren't I?

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
Why do you say that?

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
Over the years,
what I've wanted most,

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
is for His Grace to break
his curse and move back home.

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
But the problem is, His Grace
has grown quite fond of me,

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
and I'm a maid.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
So, while I appreciate
his affection,

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
when I think about how it might
estrange him from his family,

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
I can't possibly take
any pleasure in it.

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
How could I?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center

strange at all, my dear.

how you'd like to be together,

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
so I'll keep
my opinions to myself.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.932 position:50% align:center
But the feelings you
have for His Grace

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:40.352 position:50% align:center
aren't strange in the slightest.

00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:42.979 position:50% align:center
They're something far more pure.

One might even call it. Fate.

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
It must be fate.

[ALICE] Rob? You're going to get
a cold if you stay out there.

She's right, come in
and join us for some tea!

So, what did you think of it?

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
Absolutely superb.

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
A wonderful and surprisingly
moving experience.

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
Thank you, I'm glad.

[ALICE] I liked that you played
a cheerful song this time.

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
Not that I didn't love the
ballad you played last time.

Yeah? Really?

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm thrilled that you
liked this one, too.

I didn't only do it to thank you
for the mittens, though.

00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to put it,

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center

Yeah!

I know you've sung
for me several times,

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center

to hear that voice while I play.

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center
Very well, then.

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center

was even possible.

person do you think I am?

I'd better call it a night

I could write a song like that.

That would make sense.

to walk me to my room.

Please forgive me, sweet Duke,

00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:54.833 position:50% align:center

I'm just a lowly servant.

you may think now,

when that fateful day arrives,

00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:01.965 position:50% align:center

each other freely anymore.

still saddens me to no end.

It may not be far,

00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:23.445 position:50% align:center
but you never know what
might be lurking outside.

00:23:23.528 --> 00:23:25.905 position:50% align:center
I very much appreciate
the sentiment,

00:23:25.989 --> 00:23:28.575 position:50% align:center
but a servant can't let
her master walk her to her room.

00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:30.952 position:50% align:center
But none of that matters to me.

00:23:31.036 --> 00:23:35.248 position:50% align:center
I would like to treat you like
the lady I see you as, Alice.

What's wrong?

00:23:37.876 --> 00:23:40.211 position:50% align:center
You know, even if
it hadn't panned out.

00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:43.298 position:50% align:center
I believe the pussy-cat
would've still been happy

00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:45.383 position:50% align:center
just to be able to love the owl.

00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:46.676 position:50% align:center
That's enough.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.220 position:50% align:center
Is that what that
nursery rhyme was all about?

00:23:49.304 --> 00:23:51.681 position:50% align:center
I wonder how
I never noticed that part!

00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:54.684 position:50% align:center
