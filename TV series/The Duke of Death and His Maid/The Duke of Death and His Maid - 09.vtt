[NARRATOR]
Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love,

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
never once feel
their skin against yours.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
He takes the life of
anything he touches.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
That was the curse the witch
cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
His own mother keeps
him at a distance.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.800 position:50% align:center
His former friends
name him a monster.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center
Even strangers speak of
him as Death incarnate.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
And yet, he doesn't
feel the least bit lonely.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.564 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] I want to give Rob
a super special present.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.316 position:50% align:center
Do you have any good ideas?

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.735 position:50% align:center
Uh... How about some glasses?

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.195 position:50% align:center
No, that won't work.

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:11.988 position:50% align:center
Glasses are out of the question.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.282 position:50% align:center
I want us to be able to look
directly into each other's eyes,

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.117 position:50% align:center
without any dumb
lenses getting in the way.

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.243 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Well then,
what are your thoughts

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
about a nice handkerchief?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.996 position:50% align:center
I like how you think!

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.873 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Alice!

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.625 position:50% align:center
Her heart is truly romantic.

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
It reminds me of yours,
Your Grace.

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.515 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
So, today's Christmas Eve.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.017 position:50% align:center
Ah, now I understand.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
That's why Viola
let me know in advance

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
she'd be coming over.

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.773 position:50% align:center
It also makes more sense
why she's giving Rob a gift.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
She is a brave girl,
to take that step.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.695 position:50% align:center
But... I'm a little
disappointed we won't be able

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50% align:center
to spend Christmas Eve
alone together, Your Grace.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.450 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Don't mind me,
just going to barricade

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
all the entrances real quick!

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:24.120 position:50% align:center
Please come back!
I was only kidding!

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
By the way,

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
Cuff and Zain are also planning
to drop by later today.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
It looks like we'll be
hosting a Christmas party.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.421 position:50% align:center
Huh? A real party?

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50% align:center
That could be dangerous.

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50% align:center
Do you truly think
it's okay for me to indulge

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
in such a normal human activity?

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.970 position:50% align:center
Well, you are indeed a human.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
We're talking about
a Christmas party here.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
And look at me, wearing the
same old boring hat and clothes.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.770 position:50% align:center
I think your outfit's
lovely the way that it is.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
Though I did decide to put
on my best pair just in case.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
--Of underwear.
--Ah! Why are they see-through?!

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Yoo-hoo!

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
Merry Christmas to you, Mother.

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER] It seems you've
been going out a lot lately.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Yeah, well,
I've had things to do.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER]
I don't know where you've been

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
running off to,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
but Christmas is a time that
should be spent with family.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
You need to stay home today.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
Well, if you insist.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
One more thing,

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
how much longer do you intend
on dressing like a child?

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.892 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Mother.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
Get everything ready for
my departure as planned.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER D] But the lady of
the house told you not to.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] She wanted me to
spend Christmas with family.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
If you think about it,
I'm only following her orders.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
You guys should stay here.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
All I need is my driver.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
[BUTLERS]
She's going to see Rob.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
There she goes off to
that creep's place again,

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
and for Christmas no less.

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.548 position:50% align:center
Can't be worth
the two-hour trip.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
Two. Two!

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
[MAID A] His second-born son
complex is acting up again!

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
[MAID B]
But look at that core strength!

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
You can call it a party,

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
but we barely have
anything festive.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
Let alone a Christmas Tree.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.191 position:50% align:center
I agree with you.

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
It would be nice
if at the very least

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
we had some sort of Santa Claus.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
Santa, huh?

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace? Your Grace?

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
[giggles]
Your Grace? Your Grace?

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
Your Grace?

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're
enjoying the tea.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
It might not be very festive.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.471 position:50% align:center
But don't you worry.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
I'll serve the most
delicious meal.

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:51.309 position:50% align:center
I think we'll all have
a jolly evening.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
Yes. Well,
I'm looking forward to it.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] I picked Rob out
a nice handkerchief

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
that I'm sure he'll love.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
I just need to be brave
enough to give it to him.

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
I must ask, My Lord.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:13.998 position:50% align:center
Are you certain
it's all right for me

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
to let you drive the carriage?

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
This is the perfect opportunity

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center
to spy on that
accursed firstborn.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center
And little Viola
doesn't suspect a thing.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
Just wait, you miserable
excuse for an older brother.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.264 position:50% align:center
The one who'll
inherit the family title...

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
...is me!

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
[shudders] I just felt
the most peculiar chill.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.022 position:50% align:center
Oh! How awful!

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
Shall we warm each other
with our body heat?

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
You know that we can't!

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
[knocking on glass]

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
We're coming in!

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Merry Xmas!

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:45.989 position:50% align:center
Hi there, Cuff and Zain!

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
Happy holidays!

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Hey, Alice, how goes it?

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50% align:center
Your personal ornaments
are lookin' nice and big--

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
[slap]

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:54.622 position:50% align:center
We brought you this.

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.458 position:50% align:center
What a lovely Christmas tree!

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
I can't thank you enough.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
We were worried we wouldn't be
able to get our hands on one.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.006 position:50% align:center
Now that you finally got one,

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
let's decorate it so well
we knock Santa's boots off!

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
Wait, Santa?

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
You never know, this could be
the year I finally see him!

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] There are witches
who believe in Santa?

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
Who knew?

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
Let's see, the tree's
a good place to start.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center
Want to help me decorate, Alice?

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.815 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] If she's helping,
then I am, too!

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
[DUKE, CUFF]
I don't think so.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Was it really necessary
to shut me down that hard?

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.531 position:50% align:center
Fine, let's leave
the tree to the ladies.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
The room is looking a
little drab for the holidays,

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
but us men can
take care of that!

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
Come on, Lord of the Thighs!

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Let's go!

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
Lord of the Thighs?

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Oh-ho... She must have,
like, quadruple D's.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
Hey! New subject.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
Don't you think it might
take more than two people

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
to decorate an entire room?

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.642 position:50% align:center
We need a few more hands.

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Nah,
we shouldn't make the ladies

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
do all the manual labor.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I understand.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
That's the first halfway
decent thing you've said.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.652 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Cut me some slack.

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
Besides, asking Cuff
to do anything hard

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.699 position:50% align:center
only means double
the work for you later on.

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
This stinks!

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.412 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] She's really pretty
inept at most things.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
At least she's got
her cuteness going for her.

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Oh, so you
acknowledge that, then?

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] She's also ridiculously
honest; she can't tell a lie.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center
Her heart is huge,
and she's pretty sexy

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:25.964 position:50% align:center
when you think about it.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.048 position:50% align:center
Enough already!

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
Why don't you
tell her how you feel?

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.510 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
I can't do that.

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
I've known her forever--

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center
and she's always been the same,
for better or worse.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
Hey, I wanted to thank you,

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.436 position:50% align:center
for being
Cuff's friend and stuff.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.397 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Uh. I'm the one who
should be thanking you two.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Enough about that.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
Let's play some pranks on Alice!

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not allowed!

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:50.864 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] For example,
and I'm just spit-balling here,

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
what if this silky ribbon
just so happened

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
to get all wrapped up
around her?

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center
I don't know about you,

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
but I'm thinking
that would be super sexy

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] How could that
possibly have gotten there?

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Or even better.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.510 position:50% align:center
What if this tiny ribbon
was the only thing

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
covering up all
her naughty bits?

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
[DUKE screams]

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Guess she overheard.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
You're never going
to learn, are you, Zain?

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
Finally done.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:28.693 position:50% align:center
Hey, Zain!

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:31.112 position:50% align:center
Time to wake up!

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
You have to come see
it for yourself!

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:36.368 position:50% align:center
To be fair, Alice
did most of the work,

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
but I definitely
helped out a little!

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Oh, yeah, it's looking great.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.830 position:50% align:center
You really like it?

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
I can't think of
anything this pretty

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
in all the witches' world,
can you?

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
Why don't you
tell her how you feel?

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
I can think of one thing.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:03.144 position:50% align:center
And Cuff, it's you.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
She's asleep?

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
She mentioned she
was going to take a nap

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
in order to be well-rested
in case Santa comes

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
in the middle of the night.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Well, she couldn't have
picked a worse time to do it!

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll find her
a better place to sleep.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
A bit rough, don't you think?

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Nah, she's fine.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
I should've just kept
my big mouth shut.

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I'll go make us some tea.

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:35.010 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Thanks, Alice, you're the best!

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
Jeez, if only my life could be
as carefree and easy as Cuff's.

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.265 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] From where I'm sitting,
your life seems pretty carefree.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN chuckles]
You think so?

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER]
Even Walter.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.744 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
I'm here!

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
She's in a hurry.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
Does she want to see the
infernal firstborn that badly?

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.253 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Viola must have dropped this.

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me it's for him!

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
Curse you, firstborn!

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:21.097 position:50% align:center
It certainly looks like
Death incarnate's home.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
Even on Christmas,
it's completely deserted.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
According to my investigation,

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:30.774 position:50% align:center
the only people that live here
are him and his two servants.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
Regardless of any curse,
that's just pathetic.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
Another prime example of why the
family title should go to me.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50% align:center
I must be quiet.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
Very quiet.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50% align:center
Exceptionally quiet.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
Extremely... Huh?

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
How bizarre, a lone Santa suit!

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50% align:center
Could this be some kind of trap?

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50% align:center
One equipped with a fake beard?

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.050 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
Awwww!

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:00.762 position:50% align:center
You must be Santa!
Your Jolliness,

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:01.805 position:50% align:center
I am honored
to be in your presence.

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it's really you,

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
I've never seen you
before in real life!

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
What are you talking about?

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.646 position:50% align:center
Huh? You're not him?

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
I, uh, umm, well...

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
Well, of course I'm Santa!

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
Oh, Santa! It is you!

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
I just knew you
would come tonight!

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
So, are you here delivering
our presents, or what?

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
This one is for you.

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
This is the first time someone's
ever given me a present.

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
You seriously are Santa!

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.541 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Darnit! That was Viola's.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
Well, Santa's a busy guy.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
Gotta go, ho, ho, ho!

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
Are you doing your whole
across-the-globe trip thing?

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.171 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Yup, that's right. See you!

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] So does that mean you'll
be leaving on your sleigh

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
with the flying reindeer?
You have to show me.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
[WALTER] The sleigh is actually
in the shop right now.

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:40.677 position:50% align:center
That means I couldn't
land on the roof,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.178 position:50% align:center
so you won't get to see me
leave through the chimney.

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
Happy Holidays! Goodnight!

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] I could always
give you a lift to the chimney.

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:55.358 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Are you some kind of witch?

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] I'd say you
practically are, too, Santa.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.324 position:50% align:center
That is so weird.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
Where in the world could
I have dropped the present

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center
that I picked out for my Rob?

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
Ugh. This is the worst.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Hey, there.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Did you find
what you were looking for?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
No, I'll try again later.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
Your mask is
so warm and fluffy!

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
I find it super comforting!

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Yeah...

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Ho! Ho! Ho!

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center
A Merry Christmas to all!

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.392 position:50% align:center
Wow, what's gotten into you?

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.561 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Ho! Ho! Ho!

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] We were able
to put together a Santa suit

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
as a special
Christmas surprise for Cuff,

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.776 position:50% align:center
but we seem to have
misplaced it somehow.

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Oh, so you're trying
to make do by mimicking him?

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Ho! Ho! Ho!

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,
where is Cuff?

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] She woke up and
ran off to look for Santa.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:47.619 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Ho! Ho! Ho!

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Rob's just too cute!

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
Ugh, where could
his present possibly be?

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.544 position:50% align:center
My Christmas is totally ruined!

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
Aw, how comforting!

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Okay, this is getting a little--

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
Ho! Ho! Ho!

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
Merry Christmas!

00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:26.199 position:50% align:center
Santa's here!

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
That's not how I pictured him.

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] I wish I could
say I don't believe it!

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
Did you seriously have the nerve

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
to follow me all
the way here, Walter?

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
Did you say Walter?

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
My little brother?

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
Hey. Watch it.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare
call me little brother!

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
Call me your greatest rival!

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.641 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Huh?

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.768 position:50% align:center
R-I-V-A-L!

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:56.855 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Any idea why that young
man was wearing a Santa suit?

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
No clue. And why'd he
come down the chimney?

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.192 position:50% align:center
Even after all these years,

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
I see you haven't
changed the slightest bit.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:05.155 position:50% align:center
Well, you're looking great!

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
Very dapper.

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
I'm a little jealous.

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
You're jealous of me?

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
That's the last thing
that I need to hear.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.997 position:50% align:center
Viola, why do you like
hanging around this creep?

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
You're the creep.

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:17.250 position:50% align:center
Say you're sorry to everyone
for crashing the party.

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
Just look at how
nasty you made the floor!

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
I'm sorry.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
I don't know what's gotten
into that head of yours, Walter,

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.507 position:50% align:center
but you're a real pain.

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
It's not like I'm here because
I'm fond of him or anything.

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
Not fond of him, not fond
of him, not fond of him,

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:32.140 position:50% align:center
not fond of him,
not fond of him.

00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:36.644 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] She crushed two brothers
for the price of one.

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
[WALTER] This guy must be
a friend of the witch I met.

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
So, he's buddied up
with a couple of witches

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.818 position:50% align:center
and still can't break the curse.

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
Look at the freak.

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
Mother's been
way too easy on him.

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.866 position:50% align:center
Even if he found some
way to break the curse,

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
he would still be a
horrible head of the family.

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
Where'd Santa go?

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
He left.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Whoa, who are you?

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Hey, that's mine!

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:07.008 position:50% align:center
I'm super glad
someone finally found it!

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:08.593 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
This can't be yours.

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:10.428 position:50% align:center
Santa gave me this gift himself.

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
What?

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:14.432 position:50% align:center
[ROB] There don't appear to be
any problems we can help with.

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
Let's get dinner ready.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Sounds good to me.

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Give me the present!

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Not a chance!

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.856 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
My turn for some shut-eye.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
This party has turned
into a free-for-all.

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
You can't even take control
of a room in your own mansion.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
Do you really
want the family title?

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.076 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] That's a precious item
you're flailing around!

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
What don't you understand?

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
It's mine!

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Since I'm
the firstborn son and all.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
I guess I'd like to inherit it.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.334 position:50% align:center
That is,
if I can break this curse

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
and the family welcomes me back.

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Where did you even find it?

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
What are you talking about?

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
Santa gave me this!

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Do you really
expect me to believe that?

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
You've got it easy.

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
Imagine living your entire life
as the family's backup plan.

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
You've been gone
for a long time.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
How do you think I've been
treated in your absence?

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
How should I know?

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:02.897 position:50% align:center
Like I'm nothing
but an alternate

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center
just in case your curse
can't be broken.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.651 position:50% align:center
I'm just a spare.

00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Will you please
get over yourself already?

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:12.532 position:50% align:center
All because I happened
to be born a little later.

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:15.160 position:50% align:center
Your existence alone
determines my entire future.

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Ugh, enough!

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
It's my first present, so there!

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
Let's talk more
after I fix this mess.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
By all means, take your time.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure if you know.

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:28.173 position:50% align:center
The little gold decoration?

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.716 position:50% align:center
It's actually poisonous.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
It can make you grow a beard
or break out in a rash all over.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
You better set it down.

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
What, really? That's awful!

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of it.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
Stand back, Viola!

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
Ah! No, wait!

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Hot! Hot! Hot!
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Uh, you okay?

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I'm good! I knew wearing
gloves would pay off someday!

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
It should be completely
fine if you rewrap it.

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:53.990 position:50% align:center
Here you are, Viola.

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
Are you all right
with this, Cuff?

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
Yeah, fine with me.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
I got a little too excited;
I'm sorry I tried to keep it.

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:01.247 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] As long as you're
positive it's not poisonous,

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
I'll let you have it now.

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
Gee, thanks.

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
Though it was
mine to begin with.

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:10.757 position:50% align:center
And, um, I wanted
to say, dearest brother.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.133 position:50% align:center
Thank you, too.

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:13.843 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Huh? That's the first time

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
you've ever thanked
me for anything.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Uh... Yeah.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
So anyway, you gotta tell us

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
how you made
that massive fireball!

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
I'm a performer, you know.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center
All top secret.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
I'll make you a deal.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.400 position:50% align:center
Whichever one of us is
able to uncover the truth

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
about your curse gets
the family title.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
The loser will always
be the alternate.

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
I don't completely understand,

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
but if that's
what you want to do,

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
then I accept.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Hmm. Now, with that settled.

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:44.624 position:50% align:center
Farewell!

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Huh?

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Aw, he screwed up the tree.

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] Fix the decorations
before you go, buddy!

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] He tries acting
smooth but just falls short.

[WALTER] I just remembered
I can't go home without Viola.

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
So cold.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Everyone's finally gone.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
I can't believe Walter was here.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] He seems like
quite an interesting man.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
You can say that again.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.057 position:50% align:center
With the party over,

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
I guess we're done
celebrating Christmas.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I can think of
one more way to celebrate.

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
On Christmas, you are allowed

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
to ask for a kiss
under the mistletoe.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.111 position:50% align:center
So, let's find some mistletoe.

00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:37.904 position:50% align:center
No way, I can't!

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Oh, dear.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
Do you need my help?

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.414 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
It's just like that day.

00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
That day.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center
When I was freezing in the snow.

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:55.922 position:50% align:center
I was almost ready to die, but
then you came and rescued me.

00:20:56.006 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center
At that very moment,
something inside me changed.

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
Alice. I think that I like you.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
I had no right to say
that out of the blue.

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
You must think I'm weird now.

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center
And, uh...

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:20.613 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Um, I'm sorry.

00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
I'm, uh, I'm very sorry.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
Please don't be.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.414 position:50% align:center
You just caught me by surprise.

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I want to live.

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
If I can do it with you.

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
That's all I need.

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.763 position:50% align:center
I have genuine friends now.

00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
I even hosted a party.

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
I've got you, Viola, Rob,
and thousands of other things

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
that make me glad
I didn't give up that day.

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
And it's all because of you.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.276 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Thank you so much
for sharing that with me.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
This is the best Christmas
present anyone could ask for.

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:05.575 position:50% align:center
And in return,

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.660 position:50% align:center
I give myself to you.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.873 position:50% align:center
You scared me half to death!

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:16.044 position:50% align:center
What ever happened to
the pure you from the old days?

00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:17.587 position:50% align:center
Hey, isn't that cold?

00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:20.256 position:50% align:center
If you're going to feel the
cold, then I want to as well.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.468 position:50% align:center
That's the way
it should be, Your Grace.

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:26.554 position:50% align:center
We should experience
everything together.

00:22:27.764 --> 00:22:29.641 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I stand corrected.

00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:32.519 position:50% align:center
You're the purest person
I've ever known.

00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:35.230 position:50% align:center
[ALICE chuckles]
You mean that?

00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:10.325 position:50% align:center
[ROB] "The Duke,
Alice, and a Song for Two."
