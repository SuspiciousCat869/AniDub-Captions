Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
And never once feel
their skin against yours.

He takes the life's breath out
of anything he touches.

That was the curse the witch
so cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
Plants, animals, and people
are no exception, of course.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center
Regarding her son,
doomed to live his life

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.972 position:50% align:center
without knowing
the warmth of another,

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
his mother only complained.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER] That child
is like Death incarnate.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.561 position:50% align:center

She said.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:04.773 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Hmm?!

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.483 position:50% align:center
Alice, you're too close!

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.193 position:50% align:center
You really have
to stop doing that!

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.237 position:50% align:center
It's just that your reactions
are so adorable, Your Grace.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.698 position:50% align:center
I can't help wanting
to see them up close.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.283 position:50% align:center
All right, fine!

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.328 position:50% align:center
I won't get self-conscious if
I can't see you, so take that!

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.789 position:50% align:center
You're so scrumptious,
I could just eat you up.

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:21.706 position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.084 position:50% align:center
My ears are totally defenseless!

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.218 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Please forgive my
extended absence, Your Grace,

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.095 position:50% align:center
and thank you for
the gracious leave.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
I have at long last fully
recovered from my back injury,

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.310 position:50% align:center
so I shall be returning
to my post, as of today.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:06.770 position:50% align:center
That's wonderful news, Rob.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.355 position:50% align:center
Good to have you back.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
[ROB] I imagine I put you in
a bit of a bind as well, Alice,

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.027 position:50% align:center
as I left the care of His Grace
entirely in your hands.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.029 position:50% align:center
Oh, you needn't worry about me.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
I had the honor of spending
the night with His Grace, so...

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.118 position:50% align:center
Would you stop saying things
that could be misconstrued?

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
The two of you
together never fails

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.830 position:50% align:center
to put a smile
on this old man's face.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
Please keep your subordinate
from harassing me!

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
And now, I shall take
my leave, Your Grace.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
It's the first morning
Rob's back,

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
and it looks like he's
already been hard at work

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.722 position:50% align:center
around the estate, you see?

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Yes, even doing
tasks that are too much

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
for me to handle.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
He's superhuman.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.561 position:50% align:center
That has to be it.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Rob's been my butler

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50% align:center
from the time I lived
at my family's residence.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
He was also the only one
to transfer here with me.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
You could say he was
like a father to me.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Are you standing
there for a particular reason?

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Rob appears to
have taken on the chores

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.751 position:50% align:center
that would normally be mine.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
You should tell me, though,
if my presence here bothers you.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
It's just that I can't
concentrate on my reading.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
[knock, knock]

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.094 position:50% align:center
[ROB] I do hope I'm
not disturbing you.

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
I've brought your tea.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.097 position:50% align:center
He was in the yard a second ago!

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
Aren't you perhaps working
a bit too hard, Rob?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
Who, me, Your Grace?

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.149 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Well, you are still
on the mend and all.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
Why don't you let Alice
do some of the work, too?

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
How kind of you
to concern yourself.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.364 position:50% align:center
I may've been a bit too eager

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
to get back to work after
my absence, it's true,

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
but rest assured, you needn't
worry about me, Your Grace.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.289 position:50% align:center
We'll divide what
needs to be done

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
around the estate and see to it.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
Come, Alice.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
Let's get started.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
What is with her?

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
This is good!

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
Well, Rob's work
hasn't suffered any,

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
there's no doubt about that.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center
It may be silly of me
to fret so much.

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
Still...

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Alice?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
One moment, there's something
I wanted to ask you.

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
Ahh! It's me! What
on earth are you doing, Rob?!

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
Oh, pardon, Your Grace.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50% align:center
My eyes have been blurry lately,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
so it can be hard
to make people out.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
Your eyesight is failing?

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
I've told you before, haven't I?

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
The effects of your age
are getting worse.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
If you touch me, you'll die.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.923 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying
I want you to avoid me,

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
but you have to look out
for yourself a bit more.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:44.928 position:50% align:center
And you can't hear?

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.513 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong, Your Grace?

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.056 position:50% align:center
Oh, Alice, thank
goodness you're here.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
Can you please talk
some sense into him?

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
Pardon me.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.108 position:50% align:center
Forgive the impertinence,

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
but you're positive
that this is Alice?

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.987 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course, she's the
only other one who lives here!

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
Your work around the house
is flawless, and yet.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
as if it's etched
into your very bones.

So, you needn't worry
about me, all right?

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.752 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware of my course.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
I shall serve you
as long as I live, Your Grace.

I've been composing songs,

a living with my music.

For as long as I can remember,

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50% align:center

praise for was my playing.

Having still not found any way
of breaking the witch's curse,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
the piano is both
my dream and my only hope.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center

--Ahh!
--[ALICE] Forgive me.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
While I was cleaning, I heard
this beautiful song playing,

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
and I was curious.

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
Curious or not, couldn't
you have approached me

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
like a normal person?

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
What's "normal"?

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
Not this!
Don't lean in so close to me!

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate
not being disturbed.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
Come on, that was forever ago.

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's right!

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.564 position:50% align:center
I'm going out tomorrow.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
Do go and prepare
the carriage, won't you?

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
So peaceful.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
I'm making excellent progress.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50% align:center
Even better than I'd planned.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
Well, this place is just
as depressing as ever.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
As run-down as it is enormous!

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:17.886 position:50% align:center
The stress of living here

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
would make me break out,
something fierce!

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
Definitely bad for the skin!

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
How does he manage
to live like this?

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
Oh, there you are!

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,
you're just so unobtrusive

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
I didn't even
notice you were there!

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.733 position:50% align:center
How long has it been,
Dearest Brother?

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice! Alice, come quick!

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong, Your Grace?

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] How could you
let her in the house

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
without my permission again?

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Oh my, what a rude thing to say!

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
My apologies, but Lady Viola
is Your Grace's younger sister.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.293 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised
you don't look pleased

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
after I've so graciously
deigned to visit you.

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
It would seem my dearest brother
wishes to speak with me,

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
so do go and wait out
in the garden, won't you?

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.136 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER]
Yes, milady.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Nobody asked for this!

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50% align:center
What a yum!

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:10.939 position:50% align:center
Tea is always best served
with sweet crumpets,

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
don't you agree?

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
I don't think I could
ever get my fill of them.

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
Exactly when are you
planning to leave today?

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Soon, Your Rudeness.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
Would you calm down?
I'm not staying long.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Mother will be
positively apoplectic

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
if she finds out I'm here.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
Could you bring me a few more
sweets from the kitchen?

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
As well as some Assam tea brewed

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
with dried fruits,
if you have any.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
Yes, Lady Viola.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
You know, you've got nerve.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] My sister's obsessed
with frivolous things

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
like sweets and talking about
her love interests ad nauseum.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
I suspect she drops
by occasionally

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
just to experience
a little change of pace.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center
But...

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.896 position:50% align:center
What? What are you looking at?

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
Wait, don't tell me...

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
Have your long years
of isolation turned you

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.401 position:50% align:center
into a creep?

00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I can't handle
her ever-so-charming act.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I brought you
some sticky toffee pudding.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.825 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Ooh! It looks delectable!

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Sorry to put you
through all this trouble.

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
It was no trouble at all.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.043 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Hmmm?

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
All right, now, out with it!

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
Are you fond of that maid,
Dearest Brother?

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
Well, um, yes, of course I am.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
I mean, I adore her.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
Obviously!

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.387 position:50% align:center
That was actually
painful to watch.

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Would you be nice?

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.641 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
That explains everything.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
My dearest brother's in love.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:31.686 position:50% align:center
Well, then,
Little Miss Viola here

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.563 position:50% align:center
will just have
to make you irresistible,

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.106 position:50% align:center
starting with that maid.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.068 position:50% align:center
With "The Viola Method of
Instruction in the Art of Love."

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
You have your own method?

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
For example, everybody's
got a little complex

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
about something,
don't you think?

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
So, all you've got to do
is just hide whatever it is.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
I have a round face,

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
so I use my hairstyle
to hide its contours.

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% align:center
And now, it melts
everyone's heart.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
See? Look how adorable I am!

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you're
tooting your own horn.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.629 position:50% align:center
In your case, Dearest Brother,

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
I would highly recommend
covering up

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:01.132 position:50% align:center
those dark circles
under your eyes.

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
Oh! You think so? Here.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.804 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Eww! Pull it down some more.

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
How's this?

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:08.598 position:50% align:center
I feared as much.

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:10.725 position:50% align:center
You simply don't have what
it takes to get the ladies.

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
You're already giving up?

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:14.771 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA sighs]

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.564 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize
how late it had gotten

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
while we were chitchatting.

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
Well, at least
there were treats,

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
so it wasn't a
total waste of time.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
And I'll be back.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.699 position:50% align:center
No more dropping by
unannounced, though, all right?

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Better yet, you should hurry up

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
and break that curse--so
you can live with us again.

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
Oh, my, look
at those rosy cheeks.

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:34.416 position:50% align:center
If you think I said
that out of concern for you,

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
then you are sorely mistaken.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.294 position:50% align:center
Just who do you
think you are, anyway?

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
The queen of the parting insult.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Hey, what's the
big idea you--It's Rob!

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
Well now, what have we here?

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
If it isn't little Lady Viola!

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Oh my.

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
How... How long has it been?

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
It's been ages,
but I see you've made a

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
special trip all the way here
just to pay us a visit.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:02.235 position:50% align:center
I wanted to see you,
so that's what I did.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.572 position:50% align:center
You'd better be careful or
your hair will get in your eyes.

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
So, the Viola Method's
ineffective.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
What a surprise.

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA hums]

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Who'd've thought
she was into old men?

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
So, I should "Hurry up
and break that curse"?

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:26.217 position:50% align:center
That's easy for her to say.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:35.435 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice!

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
Alice, come quick!

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:38.646 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
Your Grace, what's the matter?
How can I help?

00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Oh, what a darling cat!

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
I think it must've wandered
in here from the forest.

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center
I can't go into the piano room
while it's still sitting there!

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
Please hurry up
and shoo it away!

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.995 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Aw, you truly
are adorable, Your Grace.

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
Look at you, making such
a fuss over one little cat.

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] It's not like
I'm scared of it or anything!

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
It's just that animals
can be very unpredictable,

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.422 position:50% align:center
so I get worried I might
accidentally touch them.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
Here, kitty!

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center
Uh, did you not hear?

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Oh, no, I heard you.

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
But I can't help it.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
I love animals.

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
They're so precious.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.403 position:50% align:center
It has a collar.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
So, maybe it's a house cat?

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:29.239 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it ran away.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.076 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] We should go
set it loose in the forest.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
[DUKE yelps]

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
Nice kitty.

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
Why? Why is it after me?

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
Careful, now!
Try not to fall down!

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
What? Come save me!

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Hmm? Your Grace.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center
You mustn't crawl around
on your hands and knees!

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.175 position:50% align:center
If you think that looks like me,

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
you've got something worse
than a case of aging eyes!

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.096 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Forgive me for picking you up,

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
but, I say,
this feels like a cat!

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:56.891 position:50% align:center
Well, hello, there!

00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Don't get friendly with it!

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Go, run free, kitty cat!

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
After all that
trouble to catch it?

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
Your Grace, look,
did you see what the cat did

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
to the front of my dress?

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.112 position:50% align:center
Not the best time
to point that out!

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry, it'll be fine.

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
I can sew this right up.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
You don't have to widen
the rips, I can see 'em!

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] So, all it really
wanted was my bolo tie.

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
Ugh! What a pest!

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] You were right.
It can be a tricky thing

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:28.965 position:50% align:center
not knowing what
animals will do.

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
Yes, and that includes you.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
Stop fiddling with the rips!

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
What's this?

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
Your Grace, look,
there's a note.

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
You don't suppose
this is the cat's name?

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
Doubtful.

00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:45.273 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I think we can rule out a name.

00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
It says "please forgive me."

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
So, you didn't run away.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
You were abandoned.

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
Like me.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
It's hard, huh?

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.674 position:50% align:center
Being cast aside like that.

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Well, it appears the cat
already found a new family.

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
Your tea is prepared and
waiting for you, Your Grace.

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
Do come inside soon.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't want to catch
a cold out here, would you?

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
Right, I'm coming.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.257 position:50% align:center
♪ [DUKE] Deep in the gloom, in
the darkest wood I've known ♪

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Oh, so this is where
you've been, Your Grace.

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
Your dinner is ready
whenever it suits you.

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
May I ask what you've
been doing out here?

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
The moon is just so beautiful.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
It inspired me
to do some thinking.

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I don't come in here often,

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:37.927 position:50% align:center
but the view from this ballroom

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
certainly is
something to behold.

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:42.140 position:50% align:center
Nobody comes in here much.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
There's no reason to anymore.

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
But Rob once told me
that my grandfather

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
couldn't dance to save his life,

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
so he used to come here
late at night to practice.

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
And apparently,
his dance partner at the time,

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
was your mother.

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
Don't you find it fascinating?

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
Think about that.

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
Long ago, my grandfather
and your mother

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
danced in this very room.

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
I feel like it was fate
that brought us here.

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
Yes, I agree, it certainly
could be an act of fate.

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:20.095 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Then perhaps
we should give it a try?

00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
I mean, obviously,
I can't touch you,

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
but we can coordinate
so it feels like we're dancing.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:25.475 position:50% align:center
Sorry, no.

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
Oh! I see.

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
I thought it
would be fun, but...

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
Unless you ask like a proper
gentleman, I must decline.

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Of course.

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:44.452 position:50% align:center
May I please have this dance?

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
I'd be honored, sir.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Aren't you a little close?

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
Careful not to touch me.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.144 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I'm used to it.

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
I haven't had many
opportunities to dance before.

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Neither have I.

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:18.111 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] It's more difficult
than I imagined.

00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
But delightful.

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:28.663 position:50% align:center
♪ piano playing ♪

00:23:18.148 --> 00:23:20.775 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice, can I ask you something?

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:22.277 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Certainly.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.321 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] What... What exactly
do you think of me?

00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:27.032 position:50% align:center
You're a very important person.

00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:30.618 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] No, not in the sense
of a master and servant.

00:23:30.702 --> 00:23:34.914 position:50% align:center
I'm asking what you
think of me as a man.

00:23:34.998 --> 00:23:37.751 position:50% align:center
I like you, Your Grace.

00:23:37.834 --> 00:23:38.668 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:40.754 position:50% align:center
Yes. I love you.

00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:42.005 position:50% align:center
I adore you.

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.132 position:50% align:center
I only have eyes for you.

00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:45.884 position:50% align:center
All right,
I got it, thank you!

00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:48.928 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] There aren't enough
words to express it.

00:23:49.012 --> 00:23:52.057 position:50% align:center
I just never
thought you'd say that.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.267 position:50% align:center
Think I'm ready for dinner now.

00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:56.895 position:50% align:center
Good. Your Grace.
