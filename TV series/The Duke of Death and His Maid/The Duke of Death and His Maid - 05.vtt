[NARRATOR]
Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
and never once feel
their skin against yours.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.419 position:50% align:center
He takes the life's breath out
of anything he touches.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
That was the curse the witch
so cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
Plants, animals, and people
are no exception, of course.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
Regarding her son,
doomed to live his life

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.972 position:50% align:center
without knowing
the warmth of another,

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
his mother only complained.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.185 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER] That child
is like Death incarnate.

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:01.895 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
...she said.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:06.858 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace.

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:09.694 position:50% align:center
The outfit you have on today
looks very nice on you.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
I dare say,

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.573 position:50% align:center
I shall never tire of the
way you compliment me.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:14.991 position:50% align:center
Alice, don't you
get bored of wearing

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.243 position:50% align:center
that same uniform every day?

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center
Shall I supply you
with some new ones?

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
Well, as it happens,
I do change every day.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.752 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it's skimpy,
or lacy, or frilly.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.337 position:50% align:center
Would you care
to have a look, sir?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.214 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I didn't mean your underclothes.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
And besides, you're
already showing them off!

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Yoo-hoo!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.685 position:50% align:center
Dearest Brother!

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.813 position:50% align:center
The insanely cute
Little Miss Viola...

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.982 position:50% align:center
...has deigned
to pay you a visit!

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
It's Rob! It's you!
I didn't know you'd be here!

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50% align:center
Hi, Rob, how are you?

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Hello there, how long
has it been, Lady Viola?

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Oh, uh...

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
She's always ridiculously
nervous around him.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.285 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
If you'd like,

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
I shall bring you some tea,
how does that sound, milady?

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Uh, yeah, but I mean,

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
I'm totally fine with
rainwater or whatever,

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.958 position:50% align:center
so please don't go out
of your way for me!

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.544 position:50% align:center
He's looking absolutely
dreamy again today.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
I so adore you, Rob.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50% align:center
--You panther.
--Shut your mouth.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.801 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Listen, I'm not a panther.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.720 position:50% align:center
It just happens that the guy
I like is much, much older.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
Well, yes, that's the
definition of a "panther,"

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
so thanks for clearing that up.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center
Whatever. Boys my
age act way too childish,

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.770 position:50% align:center
so I want nothing to do
with them, thank you.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
And there's the issue
of Rob being a servant.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
--[shrieks]
--Gimme a break,

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
you're one to talk!

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Is something the matter here?

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Oh, did you bring sweets?

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
Indeed, I did.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
I also brought some
tea that Rob made.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
So yummy!

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Now that I think of it,

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
I wonder what kind
of girl Alice is.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
I think I'd better
see for myself.

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] While I very much enjoy
the sweets you make, Alice.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.511 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I find there's
something lacking

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.847 position:50% align:center
in you as a maid.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50% align:center
And that's the fact that you are
practically devoid of charm!

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
While you may have
a somewhat pretty face

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
and impressive boobs.

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center
By the way, could I give
them a little squeeze?

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
Be my guest.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
They're unimaginably soft.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
But I digress!

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
To put it simply,

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
you're a bit wanting in
the human appeal department,

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.625 position:50% align:center
but I would be more
than happy to instruct you

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
in the finer points of
charm using the Viola Method.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Whatever she's doing,
it makes me jealous.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the Viola
Method Charm School!

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
"How to Make a Cute Face

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
That'll Melt Their Heart
On Demand, Part One."

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
I want you to blend into
the wall, Dearest Brother,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.851 position:50% align:center
and don't move a muscle!

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
When it comes to charm,
it's all in the face!

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
In a nutshell,

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
what you've got to do
is play the cutesy girl.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
It doesn't work on
everyone, of course,

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:22.072 position:50% align:center
but when it does, it works well.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
So? Think you can do it, Alice?

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
I wonder how she'll react.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
A cool girl would probably
object to this kind of thing.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
It's true, you
are awfully charming.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
Teach me your ways!

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
And thank you, I'm grateful
for the offer of help.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Aw, you're a good girl!

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
My sister's so gullible.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Make a duck face!

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
Tilt your head like a puppy!

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
Hide any flaws with your hands!

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
And always look up!

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm not seeing
enough duck face!

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] How long are
they going to keep this up?

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.102 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Dearest Brother!

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.479 position:50% align:center
We're ready. You can look.

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center
Something like this?

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
I'm all choked up,

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.734 position:50% align:center
and suddenly I want to buy you
everything you've ever wanted!

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:02.987 position:50% align:center
I owe my success to Lady Viola's
impeccable training.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
Well, you've still got a long
way to go to reach my level.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
So tell me, what do
you think, Your Grace?

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
Am I charming?

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
do an erotic edition

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
just for my sake, you know!

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
I'm sorry to intrude.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.669 position:50% align:center
But, Lady Viola,
your butlers tell me

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
that the time is approaching
for you to head home.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.297 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Already?

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
I never got to talk
with Rob today.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Here's an idea:

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
Why not apply the
Viola Method to your own life?

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.556 position:50% align:center
Whoa, good point.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
I should take my own advice.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
It's time I showed you folks
the meaning of charm!

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
The key is to put on your cutest
face for the one you love!

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
Bye, Rob!

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.650 position:50% align:center
I'll be back to see you soon.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
Oh, Rob!
Leaving you is torture!

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
I'm really gonna miss you!

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I guess we all let
ourselves down sometimes.

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
I wonder how long it'll be

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
before we see Lady Viola
back here again for a visit.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:03.840 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I wonder, has Alice
taken a shine to her?

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
Yoo-hoo, Dearest Brother?

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Well, what a lovely
surprise to see you, Lady Viola!

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi!

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
How very good of you to drop by!

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
If you're looking for His Grace,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.027 position:50% align:center
I believe you will
find him in the kitchen.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.445 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Oh, thanks.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
Not that I came here
to see anyone besides you.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
Oh, Rob, you always look
like a total dreamboat!

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'd like for you
to taste the soup stock,

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
that's all.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] You're only saying
that so you can take a peek!

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.333 position:50% align:center
Look, just promise me

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
you won't sneak
a look inside my mouth.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
That sort of thing makes me
very uncomfortable, you know.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
Fine. Say "ah."

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
What are you guys doing?

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Viola? What the--?

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, I can explain this.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
I thought the witch would
be attracted by the smell

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.974 position:50% align:center
and come back.
Right, Alice?

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.935 position:50% align:center
Yes, so I was just
getting everything prepared

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
to throw some bread
and stew together.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.897 position:50% align:center
Interesting, a witch, huh?

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50% align:center
As if I care about that.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.234 position:50% align:center
This may be
my chance to show Rob

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
just how girly I am!

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.532 position:50% align:center
Alice, how about
I help with the cooking?

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:11.866 position:50% align:center
Of course, milady.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
Whatever you'd like.

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Those two really
seem to have hit it off.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
I hope that isn't too tight.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center
No, it feels perfect.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50% align:center
First time I've
ever worn one of these.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
It looks adorable on you.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.382 position:50% align:center
Excellent,
now that you're ready,

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
why don't you
shape the bread dough

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.969 position:50% align:center
with your good friend Rob!

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Good luck, little sis!

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.433 position:50% align:center
So gross.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
I'm all set.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Finally!

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:45.442 position:50% align:center
A chance to have a nice,
leisurely chat with Rob.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
I am so freaking
nervous, though!

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
How cute!

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
He seems to love
rolling those balls!

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.581 position:50% align:center
I hope I come back as
bread dough in the next life.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
All right then,

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
how would you like the dough
to be shaped, milady?

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
Well, um, the truth is,
I'm not sure

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:07.255 position:50% align:center
because I've never
actually made bread before.

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
Why don't you decide?

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
There isn't a man
alive who hates it

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
when a girl depends on him.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
That's the Viola Method.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Hmmm... Let's see, how
about something like this?

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:24.356 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
So fancy!

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Pretty cute, don't you think?

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.652 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] You're the
one that's pretty cute!

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Milady,
why don't you try shaping

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
the dough into whatever
form you wish?

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
You know,
I can't really explain why,

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.161 position:50% align:center
but when I'm with you,
cooking like this.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50% align:center
It feels like we're newlyweds.

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
You all right?

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.792 position:50% align:center
Yep! Everything's fine!

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:44.876 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Not at all.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid the
difference in our ages

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center
is far too great
for you to be my wife.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
He said "wife"!

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
If I weren't a butler,

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
I might even have
had a granddaughter

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.970 position:50% align:center
about your age, milady.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.305 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
"Granddaughter"!

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Here, aren't you going
to make more bread?

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.101 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
"Bread"!

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
Bread. That's right.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center
I'm so jealous of my brother.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
He's got you and
Alice by his side,

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.413 position:50% align:center
and he seems to have fun here.

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
Considering his curse and all,

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
I really am glad that
he's got people around

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.836 position:50% align:center
who care and give
him emotional support.

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center
Still, you'd better tell that
idiot to quit goofing around

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
or else his younger
brother will end up

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
taking his place
as head of the family.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Thank you, milady,
I appreciate it.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Hmm?

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
You may say otherwise

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
and try to convince
people it isn't so,

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
but it's obvious that deep down,
you truly care about His Grace.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
That's some bread!

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
It looks ridiculously cute.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:51.526 position:50% align:center
Don't talk to me

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.361 position:50% align:center
until you can stop
sounding like a creep!

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
Deepest apologies.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] I wish I could've spent
more time with Rob than that.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Lady Viola!

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
Rob! Um. Well, I um?

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
[ROB] Please, take these
with you on the journey,

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
they're hot and
fresh from the oven.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
Please come back to
visit us any time, Milady.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.142 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Rob!

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.675 position:50% align:center
Are you watching me
skate now, Your Grace?

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Yeah! You're doing great!

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Well then,
would you care to see more?

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Of what, exactly?

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
Look at her.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Yeah, she's super cute.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Hey, you see
anyone lost around here?

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
Granted, this may be
because I fell and hit my head,

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
but I think the crow
is speaking to me.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.623 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Hey, I'm picking up
some magical energy

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
coming from you.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.501 position:50% align:center
You're one of us, right?

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:34.921 position:50% align:center
Ah! Well, I'm actually cursed,
so it might be that.

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Oh, I see, you're just a human.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.885 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
So, are you a magic user?

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
That's right.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:45.682 position:50% align:center
So, tell me, the lost person
you were asking about before,

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
was she a young,
red-haired girl by chance?

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.310 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Yep.

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:51.563 position:50% align:center
With a serious look on her face
and not a thought in her head.

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Ah.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center
So, you're the childhood
friend Cuff mentioned.

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Huh? You mean
she told you about me?

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
That's not like her.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
It's not in her nature
to trust anyone but me.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
So, do you know where she went?

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I don't. She left suddenly,

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center
and I haven't seen
her around since.

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
I see.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
Listen, don't you
think you've been staring

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
at Alice a tad too much?

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN chuckles]
You noticed.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Your Grace, I found
something rather surprising

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
out on the lake.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.970 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I just met
someone surprising myself.

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:26.681 position:50% align:center
Cuff's friend came
by for a ch-- Aaa!

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] My name's Zain
and I'm a magic user.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you, Alice!

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you, too.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] He's totally
different around her!

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Alice, my sweet!

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
I think you're majorly cute.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50% align:center
A gorgeous face
and a voice to match.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Back off, mister!

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
What is with you, anyway?

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:44.783 position:50% align:center
She's my Alice.

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
Stop hitting on her!

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Look, I'm crazy about girls,

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
so asking me to stop hitting
on them is a waste of time.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm crazy about girls.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
You don't have to say it twice!

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.670 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] You know
how girls will sometimes

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
put on makeup and
dress a little nicer

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
around the guys they're into?

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh?

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
I find all that stuff adorable.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.011 position:50% align:center
I just love it.

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:07.263 position:50% align:center
But when I mention
that to Cuff, she's like:

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
What's the point
of flirting with guys?

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.559 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Why? She is such a letdown!

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Looks like he's
really fixated on something.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Oh, by the way.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
I've got a definite
thing for boobs.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.986 position:50% align:center
There they are! True colors!

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.155 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
What? Boobs are the best, right?

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
Why are you pretending
like they aren't?

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.242 position:50% align:center
That's not what I'm doing!

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center
And besides, if you must know,

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
I'm more of a thigh guy myself.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
Stop taking notes!

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Now, where could
Cuff possibly have gone?

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50% align:center
I don't understand, couldn't you

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center
just use your magic
to track her down?

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] No! Magic can't solve
everything, you know.

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, I'd better
meet up with her soon.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
She can't seem to handle
anything on her own,

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
so I've got to protect her.

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Stop!

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
You mustn't keep
squirming around like that.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
[graons]

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
--[ZAIN] Cuff?
--[DUKE] Oh, my.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] The poor thing
had fallen in the lake.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
She was freezing,

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd use my body
heat to warm her up.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
Consider where you're
putting her, though!

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center
And you!
Eyes back in your head!

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
First time anyone's wedged me
between their breasts.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
Oh, Zain, it's you.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
I was looking all over.

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Same here!

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
I'd about given you up for dead!

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:22.464 position:50% align:center
How many times did I say

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
not to leave if
we got separated?

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center
So, I forgot.

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
What does it matter,
I survived, didn't I?

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Now look here.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
How great that they found
each other safe and sound.

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
So, what exactly were you guys

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
doing out here
together, anyway, huh??

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Ice skating.

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:37.395 position:50% align:center
Ice skating?

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:41.107 position:50% align:center
[thump]
[ZAIN screams]

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:49.074 position:50% align:center
You'd better not let me go,

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you, Zain, I mean,

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center
I don't get what humans find
so fun about doing this.

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:54.913 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Why don't you
call it quits, then?

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:56.414 position:50% align:center
I'm not a quitter!

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
So stubborn, though.

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center
Cuff, why don't you
follow Alice's example?

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Look how graceful
and ladylike she appears to be.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
Can you even appreciate that?

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50% align:center
I highly doubt it.

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
You and she are total opposites.

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.347 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.183 position:50% align:center
Ow! That's hot!

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
[CUFF] Just be thankful
you've got all this ice

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
to cool off with.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
I'll tan your hide!

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] It must be nice
to be so physically close.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
Those two take it
a bit far, though.

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Your Grace?

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
Do you think
you're ready to skate

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.406 position:50% align:center
without any supports?

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
All you need to do is
imagine throwing yourself

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
into my arms.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I can't do it!

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Why not?

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
You made it all the way here
from the lake shore, didn't you?

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:40.959 position:50% align:center
Ice skating's
all about momentum.

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
You know what, you're right,
I've been acting silly.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
I think I'll try
skating to the shore.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.215 position:50% align:center
Why, that's a wonderful idea.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Right, then, here goes!

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
Your Grace!

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.681 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
And sure enough, I slipped.

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
But I really did skate
there for a little bit,

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
and it was actually fun!

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.271 position:50% align:center
I can't tell you how happy
I am to hear that.

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:04.065 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I owe it to all to you,
though, so thank you.

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
Now, back up.

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] It must be great
to be true to your feelings.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
Those two take it
a bit far, though.

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
What's happening here?

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.788 position:50% align:center
Would you just walk?

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.838 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
It's so much easier this way!

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
Skating is a blast!

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.759 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] I don't think
we can call this "skating."

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
Alice, come join us!

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:33.678 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Certainly.

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
You too, Your Grace.

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Hmm? It's snowing.

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Thank you for today.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we were able to meet.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Yeah, same here.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.085 position:50% align:center
We owe you one.

00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
Listen, I've talked
this over with Zain.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
On the night of
the next blood moon,

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
you're coming with us.

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.803 position:50% align:center
To a gathering called
the witches' sabbath.

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.473 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Since we can't tell
you anything about witches,

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
you need to do some
investigating of your own.

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
We'll be there
if anything goes wrong.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
Wait! You mean,

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.109 position:50% align:center
you think I should plunge
myself into the witches' midst

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
in order to find the
one that cursed me?

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
That's exactly right.

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
We'll come for you
when the moon turns red.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
You'd better be
ready when we do.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
Are they serious?

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
May I come with you when you go?

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
There's something
I'd really like to confirm.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
Please, Your Grace?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
You're bad. You think you can
make me do anything

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
if you say it
all cutesy like that.

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
Please, Your Grace?

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
The Viola Method is ruthless!

00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:10.650 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Yes, one moment.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:14.070 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Why, hello there, Alice--

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
Oh. Wow.

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:16.489 position:50% align:center
Why the heck are you half-naked?

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:19.075 position:50% align:center
Can I help you, Lady Viola?

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
It's just that I really wanted

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
to spend the
night in Rob's room,

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
but of course my stuffy
brother wouldn't let me.

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
So, I decided.

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.293 position:50% align:center
I'd like to spend
the night right here.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I see.

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] I can't believe
what a small room you have.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
Why do you have a dead flower
in a jar on your table?

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:40.305 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Because it's
a precious treasure to me.

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
Huh. You sure are
a strange bird, Alice,

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
but I think that's
actually one of the things

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
I like best about you.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Thank you.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
Isn't this fun?

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.569 position:50% align:center
It feels like
a girls-only party.

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:56.071 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:19:56.154 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
Oh! It's a time to talk about
stuff we can only discuss

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
with other girls.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
For example, I don't think
you're aware of this, Alice,

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
but, um, I've had a crush on
our Rob since I was a child.

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
Oh, I didn't know. My.

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:14.714 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Shhh! It's our secret!

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
You can't breathe
a word of this to anyone!

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] There's no denying
Rob is a worthy gentleman.

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:22.305 position:50% align:center
I think he's the perfect
match for you, Lady Viola.

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
You get it? I knew you would!

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
What a classic
girls-only party moment.

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Glad I'm doing it right.

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
So, Alice, do you have
a crush on anyone?

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do.

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:37.904 position:50% align:center
My very own Prince Charming.

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center
Prince Charming?

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
I knew it!

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
My brother's feelings
are unrequited, poor thing.

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.995 position:50% align:center
He saved me
when I most needed it.

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
He helps make
my life worthwhile.

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
Well, listen.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
If you want to get
this guy to like you,

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to help.

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
I'll coach you
in the Viola Method.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Thank you, that's
reassuring, Lady Viola.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:04.389 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] I've wanted an older
sister for my entire life.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:05.849 position:50% align:center
Ever since I was little,

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center
my mother focused all of
her attention on my brothers.

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
I put a lot of
effort into my lessons,

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:13.481 position:50% align:center
but she has no interest in me.

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
I've always dreamed of somebody

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:17.902 position:50% align:center
pampering me exactly like this.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.575 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Funny, she looks
so much like her big brother

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:25.160 position:50% align:center
when she's asleep.

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:26.369 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Alice?

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
Is Viola in here?

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:31.041 position:50% align:center
Yes, and as you can see,
she's just nodded off.

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
Oh gosh.

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
I find myself
jealous of her again.

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
Your Grace?

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
When Lady Viola
wakes up in the morning,

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
would you please give
her lots of compliments?

00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:41.593 position:50% align:center
Why should I?

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:43.511 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I want her to feel pampered.

00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure.

00:23:19.357 --> 00:23:20.817 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Alice, thanks
for letting me sleep over

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.611 position:50% align:center
last night!

00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:26.656 position:50% align:center
So, what brings you here
this morning, Dearest Brother?

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.993 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, your hair
is looking lovely today!

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:32.787 position:50% align:center
Mine's naturally curly,
so, you know.

00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:35.248 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] I'm sorry, are you
leading some kind of point?

'Cause even if you had a
head full of silky, shiny hair,

00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:39.336 position:50% align:center
it wouldn't make you
a bit more popular

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:40.628 position:50% align:center
with the ladies.

00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:42.505 position:50% align:center
Even after I complimented her.

00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:44.049 position:50% align:center
Dearest Brother,
I hope in the next life

00:23:44.132 --> 00:23:45.967 position:50% align:center
you'll be more
like Prince Charming.

00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:47.761 position:50% align:center
Don't speak of that, Lady Viola.

00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:49.012 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you.

00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:50.221 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Huh? Why not?

00:23:50.305 --> 00:23:51.973 position:50% align:center
It's not like he
gets it, anyway.

00:23:52.057 --> 00:23:53.892 position:50% align:center
What are you two talking about?

00:23:53.975 --> 00:23:55.935 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Something we discussed
at our girls-only party,

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:57.562 position:50% align:center
so it's no concern of yours.

00:23:57.645 --> 00:23:59.689 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Well, then you should
let me join you next time.

00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:01.149 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
No can do!

00:24:01.232 --> 00:24:02.776 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] Why not? There isn't
anything wrong with that,

00:24:02.859 --> 00:24:04.402 position:50% align:center
is there, Alice?

00:24:04.486 --> 00:24:05.987 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Yes, there is.
