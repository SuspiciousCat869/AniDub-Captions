00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:11.917
[NARRATOR]
Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.959
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:18.166
and never once feel
their skin against yours.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.375
He takes the life's breath out
of anything he touches.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:24.834
That was the curse the witch
so cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:28.792
Plants, animals, and people
are no exception, of course.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.917
Regarding her son,
doomed to live his life

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.959
without knowing
the warmth of another,

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.917
his mother only complained.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.166
[DUKE'S MOTHER] That child
is like Death incarnate.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.834
[NARRATOR]
...she said.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.542
[DUKE] I'm actually
going to see Mother.

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:47.625
Oh, there you are, Your Grace.

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:48.625
Good morning.

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:49.834
[DUKE]
Alice.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:54.208
Good morning.

00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.417
Today's the day you go to
the main residence, right?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.333
How are you feeling about it?

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:00.750
Honestly, not great.

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:01.834
I don't know what she'll say

00:01:01.917 --> 00:01:04.333
since I haven't
broken the curse yet.

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:07.166
Everything's going to be fine.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.208
Your Grace?

00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:11.583
I'll do what I can
to cheer you up.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:13.959
While standing a
bit too close, as usual.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.625
[DUKE]
I'm feeling a little anxious.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.667
It's just that this
has never happened.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.583
I've always let Rob handle
any correspondence

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:55.291
with the main residence.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.834
Oh. Did he handle
the visits, as well?

00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:01.208
Yes, it'll be my first time
back since moving here.

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:05.125
I haven't laid eyes on Mother
since I was a little boy.

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:08.625
I'm nervous, but that doesn't
mean I don't want to see her.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.000
[ALICE]
I know what you mean.

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:11.208
Still...

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:17.208
Here's the truth.

00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:20.625
What I wanted was to go to her
after I'd broken the curse.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.083
The thought of her seeing me

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:25.625
and realizing nothing has
changed is hard to stomach.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.458
Oh, Your Grace.

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:39.667
Looks like we're in for
a bit more snow today.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.792
So it seems.

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:45.083
[DUKE] I hope the carriage
Mother's sending

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:46.000
will be all right.

00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:47.333
[ALICE]
May I ask?

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:49.375
When you go, may I come with?

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:51.667
If it's not inconvenient.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.959
[DUKE]
You'd do that? Alice.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.458
Look, sure enough,
it's started snowing.

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:07.542
Yes, it is.

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:08.625
I wish it would snow hard enough

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.750
for me to cancel
this little trip.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.083
[ALICE chuckles]

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:15.000
Well, I'm going to make
you some more tea.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.500
[DUKE]
One thing's certain,

00:04:19.583 --> 00:04:21.834
my love for Alice
hasn't changed.

00:04:21.917 --> 00:04:25.417
I think it's time to tell Mother
about us when I see her.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.834
And maybe, one day.

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:32.917
[CUFF] Wow, so he's gone
over to his family's place?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.375
That surprises me.

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:35.625
[ZAIN]
He sure did.

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:38.291
And unfortunately,
Alice is gone, too.

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:40.375
Why did I even
bother coming here?

00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:42.333
[ROB]
Pardon me for intruding.

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:44.083
But this is a trial.

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:45.417
[ZAIN]
What?!

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.875
[ROB]
And one day His Grace,

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:49.208
or rather the two of them,
I suppose.

00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:53.625
Must try to find some way
to overcome it together.

00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:06.000
What do you remember?

00:05:06.083 --> 00:05:08.000
About your life on the estate?

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:10.375
My only real memories from
there are of playing the piano

00:05:10.458 --> 00:05:13.125
or horsing around
the estate grounds.

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:14.417
What about you?

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.375
Oh, I only remember you,
Your Grace.

00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:34.458
It certainly still is a
beautiful place, isn't it?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.709
[VIOLA]
You finally made it.

00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:42.625
And look, what a surprise,
you brought Alice, too.

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:44.375
Took your sweet time
getting here, didn't you?

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:45.375
[DUKE]
Sorry.

00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:47.291
We had to wait out
the snowstorm.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:49.166
What did Mother say? Anything?

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.959
Nope, nothing really.

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:52.250
She just said you
should come see her

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:53.792
as soon as you get here.

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:55.542
Alone, Dearest Brother.

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.750
By myself?

00:05:57.834 --> 00:05:59.291
Well, if that's the case,

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:01.417
then I think I'll go and say
hello to all of the servants.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.041
Yeah, you should!

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:05.208
I've already mentioned to
the maids that you'd swing by

00:06:05.291 --> 00:06:07.250
and make an
appearance at some point.

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.250
Thank you, Lady Viola.

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:13.166
All right, Your Grace,
I'll see you later.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.041
Best of luck with your mother!

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.208
Oh, you're leaving me?

00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:20.291
Alice, my adorable Alice!

00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:22.208
[VIOLA]
Jeez, you're annoying.

00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:39.792
We're here.

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:42.125
This is Mother's room.

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:46.250
There's something I should
probably tell you first.

00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:47.500
[DUKE]
Oh, okay.

00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:49.041
I am the one who
blabbed to Mother

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:52.166
that Viola had been recently
going to see you at the villa.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.917
That's most likely the reason
she called you here today.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Hey, don't worry about it.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.834
You're quite
a gentleman, Walter.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.917
You've got no business
complimenting me!

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.083
Sorry, my mistake.

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:04.375
And together,
you're double annoying.

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:05.792
Anyway, go and see her.

00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:07.333
Go on.

00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:10.333
We'll be right here waiting
for you whenever you finish up.

00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:13.166
[knock, knock]

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.917
[DUKE'S MOTHER]
Come in.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.291
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:26.625
[DUKE]
Mother.

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:28.583
It's been a long time.

00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:30.875
Yes, it certainly has.

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:36.041
More than ten years have passed
since you were cursed,

00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:38.125
and you still haven't
managed to break it?

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.208
[DUKE]
Uh... Forgive me.

00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:43.208
But it seems it'll
take a little longer.

00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:46.000
[DUKE'S MOTHER] It's already
late, so we'll speak tomorrow.

00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:47.917
You may stay here tonight.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.375
All right. But, um...

00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:52.542
There's, uh...
something I'd like to tell you.

00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:54.125
Didn't you hear what I said?

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:56.709
We'll speak of it tomorrow.

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:58.041
Forgive me.

00:07:58.125 --> 00:07:59.542
Good night, then.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.333
Hey, good job!

00:08:09.417 --> 00:08:12.125
Mother was obviously
feeling kind today.

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:13.959
--For sure.
--That was kind?!

00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:15.500
[VIOLA]
You've gotten too used

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:17.917
to the lovely way Rob and Alice
treat you, Dearest Brother.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.709
That's the trouble with you
being brought up at the villa.

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.750
We'll take you
to your guest room.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.500
[DUKE] So much for
telling Mother how I feel.

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:32.625
I wonder how Alice is doing.

00:08:34.417 --> 00:08:35.417
[ELDERLY MAID]
My word!

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.959
Alice, look at how
much you've grown!

00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:40.375
[VETERAN MAID A]
A true beauty, like Sharon was.

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:42.625
[VETERAN MAID B]
Such nice skin, just like her!

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:44.250
Oh. I appreciate that.

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:45.625
Thank you.

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:48.333
[ELDERLY MAID] I remember how,
after Sharon passed.

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:50.875
You were taken in
by some of your relatives.

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:54.125
And I constantly worried about
how you were getting on there.

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:58.125
I'm so sorry I couldn't do
anything for you then.

00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:00.417
It wasn't that I didn't want to.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.750
[ALICE]
Now I see.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.166
[SHARON]
Oh, my precious Alice.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.333
I will always protect you,
no matter what.

00:09:08.417 --> 00:09:09.625
I love you!

00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:14.333
[ELDERLY MAID] You're
going to be staying the night,

00:09:14.417 --> 00:09:15.834
aren't you?

00:09:15.917 --> 00:09:17.834
We'll put you in the room that
you and your mother used.

00:09:17.917 --> 00:09:20.041
It's been all cleaned up,
nice and proper.

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:21.875
That would be wonderful.

00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:25.500
[gasps]

00:09:25.583 --> 00:09:27.000
Sharon?

00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:29.166
[ELDERLY MAID]
Evening, Madam.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.000
This is Alice,
Sharon's daughter.

00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:33.083
She's come for a visit,
isn't that nice?

00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:34.875
Oh. Right.

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:37.959
So, then... you must be
the maid from the villa.

00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:41.750
Your black dress
looks exactly like hers.

00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:44.000
Please just forget this.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.917
She and Sharon
used to be so close.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.208
They were much alike back then.

00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:51.417
Around the same age,
always cheerful,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.709
a number of common interests.

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:56.542
But unfortunately,
after Sharon passed away,

00:09:56.625 --> 00:10:00.917
the lady of the house started
acting a bit differently.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.542
[ALICE]
I see.

00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:06.291
[SHARON]
Oh, my precious Alice.

00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:07.709
I love you!

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:09.375
[knock, knock]

00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:10.750
Yes?

00:10:12.417 --> 00:10:13.291
Hey there.

00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:14.875
[ALICE]
Oh, Your Grace.

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:17.291
I wanted to come see you.

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:18.875
So how was it?

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:19.875
The other servants
didn't give you

00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:22.250
a hard time or anything,
did they?

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:24.792
[ALICE] No, they actually
treated me rather well.

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:27.083
They're all such warm,
friendly people.

00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:28.625
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:30.000
What about you, Your Grace?

00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:31.667
How did things go?

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.125
We only got
to speak very briefly,

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:36.875
but it was clear to me that
Mother hadn't changed at all.

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:40.000
She said we'd talk tomorrow
since it had gotten so late.

00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:42.667
So, things felt pretty
normal between you two?

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.625
Well, yes, I guess.

00:10:44.709 --> 00:10:46.458
That's wonderful.

00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:49.458
It makes me so happy for you.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.291
I know we've only been
apart for a few hours,

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:53.959
but I missed you.

00:10:54.041 --> 00:10:56.333
I just had to see you.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.583
What would you do
if I told you I did, too?

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:02.625
[DUKE]
Look at her.

00:11:02.709 --> 00:11:04.417
She's so adorable!

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.375
I love her more with
every passing second!

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:09.792
No!

00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:10.792
I can't handle this!

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:12.166
After being apart,
it's too hard!

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.458
She's too cute for my sanity
to hold out much longer!

00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:18.291
Think I'll hit the hay.

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:19.625
Tomorrow,
Viola's going to take me

00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:20.959
back to the place
where I was cursed,

00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:23.250
so that should be a pretty
interesting field trip.

00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:26.291
Oh, really? How exciting!

00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:27.792
[DUKE]
Good night, Alice.

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:29.667
I'm really glad we could talk.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.834
[ALICE]
Me too.

00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:32.500
Good night, Your Grace.

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:47.000
Not enough, though.

00:11:47.083 --> 00:11:48.750
It never is.

00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:02.417
[VIOLA] So, what's it like being
back here after all this time?

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.709
Do you remember
anything from before?

00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:06.291
Only bits and pieces.

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:09.625
I'm not trying to be rude, but
it's smaller than I remember.

00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:11.083
When I was little,

00:12:11.166 --> 00:12:13.709
it just seemed a lot bigger and
more imposing, you know?

00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:15.667
Yeah, well, this place
still looks way nicer

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.625
than the villa does.

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:19.834
I don't know how
Rob and Alice do it.

00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:23.250
Taking care of that enormous
place all by themselves.

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:25.500
I'm really grateful to them.

00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:27.417
[VIOLA]
Okay, we're here.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.917
This is it, right?

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.083
One of the servants
told me about it before.

00:12:34.166 --> 00:12:37.041
That you were cursed right
in front of this grave.

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:41.792
There's no doubt about it.

00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:43.750
This is the place.

00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:45.709
This is where I was.

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:49.750
[DUKE]
It was springtime, and that day,

00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:52.834
I was by myself,
looking for a four-leaf clover.

00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:55.500
I was probably going
to give it to Alice.

00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:57.000
[VIOLA]
Yeah, yeah. Then what?

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:00.333
[DUKE] Suddenly,
there was all this smoke,

00:13:00.417 --> 00:13:02.166
and I couldn't see
anything around me.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.125
Somebody grabbed me from behind.

00:13:04.208 --> 00:13:05.458
And then...

00:13:05.542 --> 00:13:09.375
No one shall love you,
and you shall love no one.

00:13:09.458 --> 00:13:13.250
You shall live a
life full of misery.

00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:16.500
[DUKE] Before I knew it,
I'd been cursed.

00:13:16.583 --> 00:13:18.500
I'd almost forgotten
how it happened.

00:13:18.583 --> 00:13:20.333
Being here brought it all back.

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:21.542
Yeah?

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:23.834
And do you
remember anything else?

00:13:23.917 --> 00:13:26.959
[DUKE] Uh. Also, the
softness of her breasts

00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:30.208
pressed against my back
and stuff. That's all.

00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:31.709
Whatever.

00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:32.917
Know what I heard?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.542
Rob said you didn't
remember who Alice was,

00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:37.083
which seems pretty crazy
if you ask me.

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:40.166
You've liked her since you were
kids, so how's that possible?

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.959
I'm not sure.

00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:44.250
If I had to guess,
after the curse,

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:46.792
when I couldn't see
her anymore, I was lonely,

00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:47.959
and the only way to stop hurting

00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:50.125
was to purge her from my memory.

00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:51.750
[VIOLA] Aw. Well,
it's great she's back

00:13:51.834 --> 00:13:52.792
in your life now, huh?

00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:53.750
[DUKE]
Mm-hmm.

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.166
[VIOLA]
Good grief.

00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:01.375
Oh! Good morning, Mother.

00:14:01.458 --> 00:14:04.542
We were just out for a walk.

00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:07.000
Viola, you're too close.

00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:08.041
He's dangerous.

00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:10.000
Stay away from him.

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:11.959
And back in that same outfit.

00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:13.083
Disgraceful.

00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:15.709
No thought for me at all,
or our family.

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:18.750
You and I can have
our talk during dinner.

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:21.500
Take care not to be late.

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:26.083
Viola.

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:27.375
[VIOLA]
Don't worry about me.

00:14:27.458 --> 00:14:29.166
I'm used to it.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.834
Remember how
I told you that deep down

00:14:30.917 --> 00:14:34.000
I wanted to live at the villa?

00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:36.500
I guess I can never do that.

00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:39.125
Neither can Walter,
for that matter.

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:41.208
I've realized being born
into this family means

00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:44.041
we don't get to
live our own lives.

00:14:44.125 --> 00:14:45.709
What we get
are comfortable lives,

00:14:45.792 --> 00:14:48.792
and our names on a
distinguished family tree.

00:14:48.875 --> 00:14:52.959
Oddly enough, you may be
the one who's better off.

00:14:53.041 --> 00:14:54.041
[WALTER]
Imagine living your entire life

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:56.542
as the family's backup plan.

00:15:14.917 --> 00:15:16.458
[DUKE'S MOTHER]
Why are you just standing there?

00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:18.417
Come and sit down.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.667
What I'd like to talk about
concerns this family.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.000
As you are well aware,

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.625
the present head of
this house, your father,

00:15:53.709 --> 00:15:57.000
has been hospitalized
for quite some time.

00:15:57.083 --> 00:16:01.166
His condition fluctuates,
and his prognosis is poor.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.291
If we do nothing and wait until
the worst happens to him,

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:06.333
it'll be too late, so we must
make a decision ahead of time

00:16:06.417 --> 00:16:09.792
regarding whether you
or Walter shall be his heir.

00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:11.083
Do you understand?

00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:12.542
Yes, ma'am, I do.

00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:14.542
You must break your
curse by the Spring.

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:16.000
If you cannot,

00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:18.250
then I shall make Walter
the heir and be done with it.

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:19.458
Is that clear?

00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:20.542
Perfectly.

00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:23.083
I'll do it by Spring
at the latest.

00:16:23.166 --> 00:16:24.917
[DUKE'S MOTHER]
That's all I have to say.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.166
You may go home when
you're finished eating.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.458
Pardon me, Mother,

00:16:28.542 --> 00:16:30.875
but there's something else
I'd like to discuss.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.875
What could that be?

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:35.709
It's regarding Alice,
the maid at the villa.

00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:37.166
Actually, she's here
with me today

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.375
because she asked
if she could come along.

00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:40.875
I met her last night.

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.125
Sharon's girl.

00:16:42.208 --> 00:16:44.583
She's every bit as lovely
as her mother was.

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:46.875
Right? She's gorgeous!

00:16:47.792 --> 00:16:48.792
[DUKE]
Oh, uh...

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.333
Excuse me.

00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:53.750
I often talked with her mother
when she was employed here.

00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:55.875
She was a truly
wonderful person.

00:16:55.959 --> 00:16:57.875
Never stopped smiling.

00:16:57.959 --> 00:17:00.375
I still miss her to this day.

00:17:00.458 --> 00:17:01.709
But unlike their looks,

00:17:01.792 --> 00:17:04.417
it appears their personalities
aren't so similar.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.875
I admit Alice is
cool and reserved,

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:08.083
but she's a really great
person and very talented!

00:17:08.166 --> 00:17:09.625
And she's got these
cute little mannerisms

00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:12.291
and I can't even--
she's perfect!

00:17:12.375 --> 00:17:13.792
You're creeping me out.

00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:15.709
I see. You like the girl.

00:17:15.792 --> 00:17:18.166
[DUKE] Well, yes, which is
why I'm here before you

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.375
asking for approval, Mother.

00:17:20.458 --> 00:17:22.667
I know it's unconventional,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.083
but one day soon,
I hope she and I--

00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:26.500
[DUKE'S MOTHER]
Is this a joke?

00:17:26.583 --> 00:17:28.583
Or have you forgotten
you're still the possible heir

00:17:28.667 --> 00:17:30.083
to the family's title?

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:32.542
Stop talking such nonsense.

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:35.375
Focus on finding a way
to break your curse.

00:17:35.458 --> 00:17:37.417
You were born into aristocracy.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.083
You know you're not free
to love whoever you wish.

00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:43.250
Particularly not a lowly little
peasant of a house maid.

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:45.458
Even jokes have their limits.

00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:47.542
You think this is a joke?

00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:50.208
No!

00:17:50.291 --> 00:17:51.834
I meant every word.

00:17:51.917 --> 00:17:54.333
Seriously, who could joke about
something as important as

00:17:54.417 --> 00:17:55.959
who they're going
to share their life with?

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:57.458
You locked me away in that villa

00:17:57.542 --> 00:17:59.000
and then you made
no attempt over the years

00:17:59.083 --> 00:18:00.875
to get to know me at all.

00:18:00.959 --> 00:18:03.917
Now you think you have a right
to shackle my emotions?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.500
How can you possibly
disapprove of me

00:18:05.583 --> 00:18:07.709
loving someone
wonderful like Alice?

00:18:07.792 --> 00:18:09.542
You know what, that
sweet soul has always acted

00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:12.500
like she couldn't care less
about my stupid curse!

00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:15.875
She treats me like any
other normal human being!

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:18.250
This obsession
with class and lineage.

00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:20.625
When will you learn
that none of that matters?

00:18:20.709 --> 00:18:23.333
Alice was the one person in
this world who tried to save me

00:18:23.417 --> 00:18:25.792
from the miserable darkness
that engulfed me!

00:18:25.875 --> 00:18:27.208
Believe me when I say,

00:18:27.291 --> 00:18:30.041
if it wasn't for her,
I'd already be dead!

00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:33.291
Stop thinking about our family
in terms of titles and heirs.

00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:37.208
And spend a little more time
about thinking of your children!

00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:39.750
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:42.208
I will be marrying Alice!

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.291
[DUKE] Walter, Viola,
and I are your children.

00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:51.417
We live and breathe.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.834
We're not your things.

00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:58.291
[DUKE]
Now I'll take my leave.

00:18:58.375 --> 00:18:59.500
[VIOLA]
Wait for me, Dearest Brother.

00:18:59.583 --> 00:19:01.542
I'll see you to the door.

00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:03.291
[WALTER]
Me, too.

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:08.917
[BUTLER]
Madam?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.959
You can leave them be.

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:18.166
Well now, where's the boy
who was so gentle and meek?

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.917
He finally found the nerve
to stand up to me.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.500
My, how he's grown.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.875
I wish I could've
delivered it more eloquently.

00:19:33.959 --> 00:19:35.250
It's fine.

00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:38.125
I mean it was quite a shock,
but it was priceless.

00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:41.500
Is something the matter,
Your Grace?

00:19:41.583 --> 00:19:43.792
No! Everything is just fine!

00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:45.041
I simply didn't care much

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:47.375
for the dish they served
at dinner this evening.

00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:48.500
[ALICE]
Oh, I see.

00:19:48.583 --> 00:19:50.959
Shall we go home, then?

00:19:51.041 --> 00:19:52.834
Head back to your house?

00:19:52.917 --> 00:19:56.208
Yes, let's go.
Back to our house, Alice.

00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:57.291
Yes.

00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:16.792
[ROB] So, the reason the lady
of the house summoned you

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:18.542
was to order you
to break your curse

00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:20.667
by spring at the latest, eh?

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.834
Yes, that's right.

00:21:21.917 --> 00:21:24.500
If not, Walter inherits
the family title.

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:26.542
She made that incredibly clear.

00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:28.458
[ROB]
Interesting.

00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:30.917
Now then, since I've
gotten rid of all my cards,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.583
I believe I shall
turn in for the night.

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:33.917
[DUKE]
All right.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.834
Thanks for watching the
house while we were gone.

00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:37.333
Get some well-deserved rest.

00:21:37.417 --> 00:21:39.083
So, what would you like to do?

00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:41.583
Were you thinking of another
round of cards, perhaps?

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:44.333
Well, if just the two
of us play Old Maid,

00:21:44.417 --> 00:21:46.667
then we'll know
where all the cards are.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.834
Then how about a
different kind of game?

00:21:48.917 --> 00:21:49.750
Cards are good!

00:21:49.834 --> 00:21:52.375
I'm happy playing cards!

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.291
Listen, Alice, the truth is,

00:21:57.375 --> 00:22:00.542
I told my mother that
I loved you tonight.

00:22:02.041 --> 00:22:04.417
[ALICE]
And what did she say to that?

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.250
[DUKE]
Nothing.

00:22:05.333 --> 00:22:06.917
It doesn't matter.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.667
But I don't regret it.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:12.208
I mean, I would've had to
tell her at some point.

00:22:12.291 --> 00:22:14.041
You're my love.

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:16.166
And I don't care
what anyone says.

00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:20.000
It's the truth,
and it always has been.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.333
[ALICE]
Go on, pick a card.

00:22:26.417 --> 00:22:29.500
If you pick the king,
you'll win this, Your Grace.

00:22:29.583 --> 00:22:33.250
Come now, Mister Indecisive,
"both" is not an option.

00:22:38.709 --> 00:22:40.834
You did it! You won.

00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:44.500
This is how it should be.

00:22:44.583 --> 00:22:48.959
Oh, no, it's not!

00:22:49.041 --> 00:22:51.583
You've taught me so much.

00:22:51.667 --> 00:22:53.917
The list is endless.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.542
Most of all, you've
taught me how to love.

00:22:57.625 --> 00:23:00.333
So, dear Alice, I pledge:

00:23:00.417 --> 00:23:02.166
You'll have my love now

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.375
and for the rest of
our lives together.

00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:41.000
[ALICE]
I love you. Your Grace.
