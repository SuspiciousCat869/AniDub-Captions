[NARRATOR]
Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love,

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
never once feel
their skin against yours.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
He takes the life of
anything he touches.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
That was the curse the witch
cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
His own mother keeps
him at a distance.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.800 position:50% align:center
His former friends
name him a monster.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center
Even strangers speak of
him as Death incarnate.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
And yet, he doesn't
feel the least bit lonely.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.363 position:50% align:center
[WALTER grunts]
This weighs a ton.

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Thanks for
doing the heavy lifting.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.036 position:50% align:center
I really don't see
the point to any of this.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:42.829 position:50% align:center
You think there's
a clue to breaking his curse

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.372 position:50% align:center
in this storeroom?

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
Couldn't we let the servants
handle it at the very least?

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.918 position:50% align:center
If we did that,
Mother would find out

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.671 position:50% align:center
and there's no telling
what she would say.

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:53.048 position:50% align:center
And we won't know whether or not

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50% align:center
there's a lead here
until we look for it.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.510 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50% align:center
[WALTER] Why go
through all the trouble

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center
of getting dirty and sweaty?

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.475 position:50% align:center
I knew it! You are fond of him!

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:07.103 position:50% align:center
Are you saying I'm not
good enough for you, Viola?

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.813 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
You are such a royal pain.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
First off, Walter, wasn't it you

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:13.193 position:50% align:center
who said you wanted to help
and then followed me here?

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.361 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, sure!

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
If I could find some
clue to his curse,

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:19.157 position:50% align:center
then I'd be one step ahead
of the little weirdo.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
Hah! Actually, scratch that,
not one step, but two!

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.997 position:50% align:center
Not the dreaded number two!

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Huh?

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
[WALTER cries]

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
This looks like an
old servants' logbook.

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
Brother, dear!
Straighten up in here, okay?

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.512 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Viola! Come back!

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
Mother.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER] What on earth
did you do to get so dirty?

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
In that same
old outfit, no less.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
She's a disgrace.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
Get her out of those clothes.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
[knock, knock]

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
Come in.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
Is this better, Mother?

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
It is.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
From now on, you should
always dress like that.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
But... long skirts
and fancy, frilly blouses

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
really aren't my style,
you know?

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
It's a vast improvement
over that childish garb.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
One day, Viola, you will be
married into another family.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
You must not bring shame
to our noble house.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I think that's your
favorite thing to say to me!

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
why I'm not supposed

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
to wear the clothes I like!

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
I mean, don't I get
to live my own life?

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
No, you don't.

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
I can't take this anymore!

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
That sharp-tongued,
flat-chested old hag

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
with her creepy make-up
is always so mean to me!

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
I realize you're upset,

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
but it's also pretty mean
to call her names.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:02.594 position:50% align:center
I do it here so I won't
say it to her face!

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
Oh, this totally sucks,
and I don't think

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:07.057 position:50% align:center
I can stop crying unless
Rob gives me a little hug!

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
C'mon, what're you crying for?

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
I think that dress looks
really good on you.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] Huh?! Would you
quit trying to console me?

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
It was a compliment.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I really don't see
how this is such a big problem.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
Your Grace?

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling
this is a bit more than

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
just a problem
with her clothing.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:25.658 position:50% align:center
Well, if you think so, Alice.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
Then, fine.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.912 position:50% align:center
What's with all
the flip-flopping?

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.082 position:50% align:center
There, it's settled, and
I'm moving in as of today,

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
so it's a good thing I brought
along all of my luggage!

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
Don't unpack
because you're not staying.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
You mustn't make Mother and
everyone else worry like that.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center
I cannot abide living under
the same roof as that woman!

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
If that's how you feel, Dearest
Brother, why don't you go home?

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center
Don't be so ridiculous;
you know I would if I could!

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Okay then, how about I come here

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
to work as one of your servants?

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
I can clean and do the laundry.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
I could even be your
resident court musician!

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center
And I know I could learn
to cook if I studied!

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
I could even come here as
Rob's pet if push came to shove,

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
so what do you think about that?

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
You're trying too hard.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
Alice, whadaya say?

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:07.409 position:50% align:center
Will you help me?

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.285 position:50% align:center
Talk him into it, okay?

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
C'mon, pretty please?

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.955 position:50% align:center
Your Grace.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Viola, stop it! That's not fair!

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
If I lived here,
then I could forget

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
about the family's
standing and do what I like.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center
I'd be under no one's thumb,

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
and I could wear
whatever I want.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:24.843 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Forgive the intrusion.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Kyaaa, Rob!

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
Indeed it is.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
Well, who is this young lady
who has apparently fled here

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
from her castle because it
can't be our own Lady Viola.

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
What a lovely dress
you're wearing.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
Oh! Do you think so?

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid the
credit goes to Mother!

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.900 position:50% align:center
But if you like
the way I look, Rob,

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
then maybe I'll wear this kind
of thing sometimes when I visit.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that is definitely
what I'm going to do!

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Are you really going
to spend the night in my room?

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
It's not the most luxurious.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
I decided not to run away,

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
but I did bring
my luggage and all,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.295 position:50% align:center
so I thought it might be fun to
have another girls-only party.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.714 position:50% align:center
Also, I have something
to give you, Alice.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.258 position:50% align:center
My! What could it be?

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
Hey! I let myself in.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
Cuff! What are you doing here?

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:12.182 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
I could ask you the same thing.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] So, you've been
waiting here on your own

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:16.686 position:50% align:center
without letting anyone
know you were coming?

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
Can't I show up
without an invitation?

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
No, you can't.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:21.649 position:50% align:center
If you're going to come over,

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
you should at least
say so in advance!

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
That's what's called
having good manners!

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.197 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's not a big deal.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.531 position:50% align:center
Since we're all here,

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.742 position:50% align:center
why don't we have ourselves
a girls-only party?

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
Well, if you're fine
with it, so am I.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
Cuff, are those the clothes
you're going to sleep in,

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
or would you like to borrow
an extra pair of pajamas?

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Really? Yeah, bring 'em on!

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:41.586 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Hey! Not so fast!

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
Don't you have any tact at all?

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's that?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
How are they?

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
My pajamas are kind
of on the bigger side,

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.595 position:50% align:center
so I thought they
might be loose on you.

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
Nope! Looking good!

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:55.350 position:50% align:center
Whoa, tight in
the chest, huh? Soft!

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
Lady Viola?

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
When you spent Christmas
with us, what happened?

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
Did the lady of the house
give you any trouble?

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Oh, you mean my mother?

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center
She was pissed off because
both Walter and I went out

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
and left her alone, I guess.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center
Though to be honest, she was
a lot harder on him than on me.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
That's interesting.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:18.123 position:50% align:center
It's good for Walter
to get chewed out sometimes.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.417 position:50% align:center
The same applies to Dearest
Brother, for that matter.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
Whichever of them
becomes the family heir

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
has got to be strong.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
Both of them are hopeless
as they are now.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.717 position:50% align:center
You say that,
but you know it's not true.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.094 position:50% align:center
When I asked you before if
you liked your dearest brother,

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
you made out like you did.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.433 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] No! What I was trying
to say was "I do not like him!"

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.101 position:50% align:center
You! Quit smiling!

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50% align:center
Hey! I've got it!

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
Since this is a girls-only
party, let's talk about love.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.816 position:50% align:center
An obvious attempt
to change the subject.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
Oh, I don't know
if I would say that.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
So, tell us, Cuff,
is there anybody you like?

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
[CUFF splutters]

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.992 position:50% align:center
I'm not a big fan of
talking about my love life.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA]
Aw, it's no big deal.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
Who was your first love?

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
Have you ever been
in a relationship?

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
Have you been kissed?

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center
Quit it!

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50% align:center
I can't take anymore!

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
I give up!

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
I think you're the one who's
bad at changing the subject!

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
You're right.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:15.764 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, Lady Viola?

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
I forgot, didn't you say

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.018 position:50% align:center
before that you had something
you wanted to give me?

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that's right, I did.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.482 position:50% align:center
I thought there might be
a clue to breaking the curse

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.108 position:50% align:center
somewhere in my house,
and finally,

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
after searching
through a lot of stuff,

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
I found this old thing.

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
It's an old servants' logbook

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
from around the same time
Dearest Brother got cursed.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
My!

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
I don't know for sure
whether it'll be of any use,

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50% align:center
but I thought I'd give it
to you anyway, in case.

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
How considerate of you.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50% align:center
I think His Grace will
be very pleased as well.

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center
Mother's handwriting.

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:50.632 position:50% align:center
Hey, Cuff.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.342 position:50% align:center
You've gone and gotten
all quiet out of the blue.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe it wasn't
a good idea to come over

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.556 position:50% align:center
and spend the night
without asking first.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.850 position:50% align:center
What's with this crazy
delayed reaction?

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
It's not like
I was being serious

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
when I was criticizing you!

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
Oh! So soft!

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:08.441 position:50% align:center
[CUFF giggles]
What a relief!

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Bed's too small.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
Then, why don't you go and
sleep in the mansion instead?

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.743 position:50% align:center
No, I'd better stay here.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
You're still a child, Viola.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
And there's safety in numbers.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.040 position:50% align:center
[VIOLA] If anyone's
a child here, it's you.

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
At least in terms of mental age.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.546 position:50% align:center
[ALICE giggles]

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.464 position:50% align:center
Alice, what's going on with you?

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
[CUFF]
Yeah, you're happy.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.607 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Yes, I see.

00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it's time for me to act.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
[DUKE'S MOTHER] It appears
that Viola didn't come home

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
at all last night.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Yes, so it would seem.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
Where exactly
has she been going?

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
I still haven't forgiven you
for what happened at Christmas.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
Answer me, Walter.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
[WALTER]
Well, uh...

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] What did you want
to talk about, Daleth?

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
[DALETH] Don't fret,
I'm not going to make a fuss

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.735 position:50% align:center
about the humans you brought
to the witches' sabbath.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.695 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Oh... So, what then?

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:37.447 position:50% align:center
A confession of love, maybe?

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Of course not.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
I'd like to ask you a favor.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Like, to take
your hand in marriage?

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
[DALETH] I hope you keep
stubbing your toe

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.874 position:50% align:center
against the corner of
a closet until you die.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] What's got
your panties in a knot?

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:51.878 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
My request is simple.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
I'd like for you to deliver
a message to your "pals."

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
My pals?

00:11:58.218 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
[ROB] What's that
you're reading, there?

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Believe it or not,

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
it's actually an old servants'
logbook from the main residence.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
Lady Viola found it

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
and gave it to me thinking it
might have some information

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
that could help us
break the curse.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Hmm?

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
Well, the binding
certainly looks familiar.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Some of the pages
were written by you, Rob.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:18.697 position:50% align:center
See?

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.740 position:50% align:center
Look at that.

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
My word, my cursive
is so shamefully bad

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
that I can't make out
a single thing

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
I wrote here apart
from my own name.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
[ALICE chuckles]
Yes, that's just like you.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
What did the others
write about, I wonder, hm?

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
It's mostly just about
work as far as I can tell.

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
Although, even now, you could
learn a lot from reading it.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
For instance, my mother wrote...

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.221 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
"Two women in white nun's
habits came to the mansion.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
I hadn't seen them before."

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Rob?

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:54.899 position:50% align:center
Back when
my mother was still alive,

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.401 position:50% align:center
do you recall ever
seeing two women

00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
in white nun's habits
visiting the mansion?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.323 position:50% align:center
No, I'm afraid I can't say I do.

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
You know me?

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:07.871 position:50% align:center
You know who I am?

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I suppose my mother
must have been writing

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50% align:center
about Daleth and someone else.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.169 position:50% align:center
Why would witches...?

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Ooh, there's Alice!

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:17.005 position:50% align:center
Don't go bothering them, Zain!

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
Alice and Rob are both
on their breaks right now.

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.510 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] I can at least
pop in to say hi, can't I?

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
Howdy, Rob!

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Zain, welcome!

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:25.764 position:50% align:center
It's good to see you.

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
You came by yourself?

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.141 position:50% align:center
That's unusual.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
I guess.

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
Hey, as long as
I'm here seeing Alice,

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
I've got a message
for you from Daleth.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
Who's Daleth?

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.650 position:50% align:center
Oh! Skeleton-lady who took
roll at the witches' sabbath?

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] I told you she
was our leader, right?

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
Heck of a way to remember her!

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
She's your leader? Sorry.

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Zain? What did Daleth say?

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.746 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] She said,
"Let's be friends." That's all.

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
But what does that mean?

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Our "friends" stay
out of one another's business,

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
so I think the gist is

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
she wants you to have
nothing more to do with us.

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
That's the opposite
of what the word means!

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
Also, I don't have
any other leads,

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.676 position:50% align:center
so, if I have nothing
to do with you guys,

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
then what's to become
of me and my curse?

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN chuckles] Hey, you're
barking up the wrong tree.

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
Look, no matter
what Daleth says,

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
Cuff and I will still help you.

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.396 position:50% align:center
It'd be a shame if you
couldn't break your curse

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.189 position:50% align:center
and remained a virgin for life.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
It's no laughing matter!

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] So, anyway,
what are you reading, Alice?

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:24.072 position:50% align:center
An old logbook
from the main residence.

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
Really? Anything useful in it?

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.243 position:50% align:center
I've only just started
reading through it,

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.120 position:50% align:center
so I really couldn't say yet.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
I plan to read it at my leisure
and learn what I can from it.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
I see.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50% align:center
Let me know
if you find anything.

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:37.836 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.463 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Well, now that
I've had my Alice fix,

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
let's go have some fun.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
Sounds great!

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.262 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'll bring up
tea for you later on.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Alice. Can't wait.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
Me, neither. See you then.

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN, DUKE]
Ooh!

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
You don't have
to do that, you know!

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.313 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Hey! I wanna feel
the excitement, too!

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Come on!

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:05.780 position:50% align:center
You're still noodling
around too much!

00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:07.282 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Oh, quit whining!

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.575 position:50% align:center
There's no harm done.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
Let me play it how I feel it.

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:12.454 position:50% align:center
It don't have to be
pretty to be art, right?

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Yeah, I know, but jeez.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
[ALICE giggles]

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.332 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Perfection!

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
Let's see, if I was
gonna name this song.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
How's "I Dedicate This Love
to You, Alice"? Great, right?

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.882 position:50% align:center
No, forget it!

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Why not?

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.301 position:50% align:center
Well, because, uh...

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:29.971 position:50% align:center
I should be the only one to
tell Alice that he loves her!

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.309 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Oh, man! That was so cringey.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:35.518 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're the one
who can't be true

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
to your feelings
in front of Cuff.

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
How cringey is that?

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
You kidding?

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
I'm always true to my desires!

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.985 position:50% align:center
You know that's not what I mean!

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Anyhoo. Now, for Part Two!

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Would you at least call it

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50% align:center
the Second Movement
or something?

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
You've gotta loosen up a bit!

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.043 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Rob, have you seen Zain?

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Why? Is he missing?

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm. I left him alone for a
bit, and he went off somewhere.

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
Now I can't find him at all.

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:08.593 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Hmm... Come to think of it,

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:11.096 position:50% align:center
when I was making my rounds
on the second floor.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:13.223 position:50% align:center
I did hear someone
climbing the stairs,

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
and I wasn't quite sure
who it was.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.309 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:19.020 position:50% align:center
Wonder if he decided
to explore the mansion.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.860 position:50% align:center
I can't find it anywhere.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center
[DALETH] The message
I want you to deliver is simple.

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
"Let's be friends.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center
Also, that girl Alice has gotten
her hands on an old logbook.

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Logbook?

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
That's right.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.709 position:50% align:center
One from that mansion.

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:43.211 position:50% align:center
I'm concerned there may be
something about me in there,

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:45.797 position:50% align:center
so I'd like you
to quietly get rid of it.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Now hold on.

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center
They really are my pals.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:51.136 position:50% align:center
I can't just get rid of
something that belongs to them.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:55.015 position:50% align:center
[DALETH] Well, I'm afraid
this isn't exactly a request,

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:57.017 position:50% align:center
it's a threat.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:04.524 position:50% align:center
I could take her from you
at any time, you know.

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Zain? Is something wrong?

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
You have the logbook.

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:24.044 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Oh, boy, this is
pretty awkward, isn't it?

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be honest,

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
Daleth asked me
to get rid of it for her.

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] She even used Cuff
as leverage to threaten me.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
She knows I would
do anything for Cuff.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
But not this... This is wrong.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
There's something in there

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:44.981 position:50% align:center
that Daleth is anxious
to keep secret.

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:47.150 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what it is
or what page it's on,

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
but I have a strong
hunch the information

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center
will end up being useful to you.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and burn it.

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Huh?

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
I could never cause you
or Cuff any trouble.

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:05.085 position:50% align:center
I would hate it if anything bad
were to happen to her.

00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
If Alice was used
as leverage to threaten me,

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
I would've done the same thing.

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:11.716 position:50% align:center
We haven't known
each other long,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
but you two are important
to me, so just burn it.

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:20.225 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN sighs]

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:23.019 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Aw, what the hay?

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna strip
and be your sexy helper!

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:26.981 position:50% align:center
Bet you'd like that, perv!

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:29.359 position:50% align:center
What? You're the perv!

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:32.987 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] So, listen, Daleth
is watching you and Alice.

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
Probably watching right now.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
She uses all sorts of
"eyes" in the human realm

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
to conduct surveillance.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
That's right.

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.416 position:50% align:center
But she can't hear what we say.

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:47.544 position:50% align:center
So, what I'm about to tell you
is strictly confidential.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
There is a way
to prevent Cuff from harm

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
without destroying this logbook.

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
Just one, in fact.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.217 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Really?

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Yeah. Observe.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.763 position:50% align:center
I don't much care for my magic,

00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
so don't ask me
to go into details.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
You and Cuff are the
only ones I've shown it to.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
Since Daleth is watching us,

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
she's obviously
seeing this, too.

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center
As long as I've got
this tiny scrap,

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
I can restore what I've
disintegrated at any time.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
In other words, the
logbook still "exists."

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
How 'bout I hang on to this

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
until Daleth stops
her surveillance?

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
That work for you?

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Uh, yeah.

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN] Please don't tell anyone
else about my magic, okay?

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
Now.

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
Since Daleth's watching,

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:38.386 position:50% align:center
we've got to convince her
the logbook's been destroyed!

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
Come on!
Gimme your best sad face!

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Is this good?

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
[ZAIN]
Sure, I guess it'll do.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna make me
play your sick errand boy,

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
I should at least get to
squeeze a boob, Sister Skeleton.

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:56.529 position:50% align:center
You say outrageous stuff when
you know she can't hear you.

00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] So, you took
the logbook, Your Grace?

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
Uh. Mm-hmm. I had kind
of a hankering to read it,

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
so I borrowed it,
but I'll return it soon.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
Great. What a relief!

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.166 position:50% align:center
It wasn't in my room,
so of course,

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.710 position:50% align:center
I was terrified that
I had misplaced it.

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I can't believe
I just lied to Alice.

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:15.507 position:50% align:center
But I promised
to keep Zain's secret.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.426 position:50% align:center
Listen. I want you to know.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
You're safe.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:23.348 position:50% align:center
I'll protect you no matter what.

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
[SHARON] I will always
protect you no matter what.

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
Oh? Why would I need protecting?

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
Well, I'm not sure,

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
but if anybody ever came
along and tried to hurt you...

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
You're such a wonderful
person, Your Grace.

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
You're already in danger!

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
I know, but I like it
when you're close to me.

00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
All I ask is that you
never wander too far away.

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
Of course,
I'll stay by your side.

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center
For now, why don't
we have some tea?

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] I wonder what Daleth's
trying to keep secret.

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
The reason I was cursed?

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
The reason the witch
who cursed me died?

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
Or even,
the secret to breaking it?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
This puzzle's full
of missing pieces.

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
But... I will find
a way to break it.

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
For me and Alice.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center
[DALETH laughs] What is
he trying to do, mock me?

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:40.675 position:50% align:center
Pisses me off.

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:41.593 position:50% align:center
But that's fine.

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:43.845 position:50% align:center
I saw what I wanted to see.

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
So, I'll leave things
the way they are for now.

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
It seems fate and
karma truly are forces

00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.735 position:50% align:center
at work in this world.

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:00.945 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you agree?

00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:06.826 position:50% align:center
[DALETH]
Wouldn't you? Sharon?

00:23:39.294 --> 00:23:41.046 position:50% align:center
[MAILMAN]
Here's your mail!

00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:43.923 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Thank you very much.

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:47.635 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
Hmm...

00:23:47.719 --> 00:23:49.095 position:50% align:center
This is...

00:23:50.096 --> 00:23:51.264 position:50% align:center
[DUKE] This is the first
time I've ever gotten

00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:52.891 position:50% align:center
a letter from Mother.

00:23:52.974 --> 00:23:54.976 position:50% align:center
I wonder what she wants.

00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:58.521 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:58.605 --> 00:23:59.939 position:50% align:center
[ROB]
It can't be that terrible.

00:24:00.023 --> 00:24:01.816 position:50% align:center
[DUKE]
It's a summons.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.068 position:50% align:center
She says we need to talk

00:24:03.151 --> 00:24:05.445 position:50% align:center
