00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:11.917
[NARRATOR]
Try to imagine, if you would,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.959
a life in which you could never
embrace the one you love

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:18.166
and never once feel
their skin against yours.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.375
He takes the life's breath out
of anything he touches.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:24.834
That was the curse the witch
so cruelly inflicted upon him.

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:28.792
Plants, animals, and people
are no exception, of course.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.917
Regarding her son,
doomed to live his life

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.959
without knowing
the warmth of another,

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.917
his mother only complained.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.166
[DUKE'S MOTHER] That child
is like Death incarnate.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.625
[NARRATOR]
...she said.

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:43.166
[yawns]

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.625
Good Morning, Alice.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.166
And a good morning
to you, Your Grace.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.625
It's not necessary to get this
close to return a greeting.

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:57.667
It's completely normal in town.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.792
Didn't you know?

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:00.000
[DUKE]
I highly doubt it!

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.333
Well done! You could go
pro if you had a mind to!

00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:00.250
That was just wonderful,
Your Grace.

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:01.667
Well, I used to play by myself

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.500
whenever I had
some spare time, so...

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.667
You're okay with those terms?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.333
I mean, that the loser has to
do whatever the winner says?

00:03:10.417 --> 00:03:11.417
You're fine with that?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.667
Of course I am.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.917
Those were the terms
I suggested, after all.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.250
So, now, tell me.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:20.542
Is this the right way
to hold the stick?

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:23.125
Yes, but you don't have
to lean over quite so much.

00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:26.417
Oh, I thought this might be
more to your liking, Your Grace.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.709
[DUKE]
I have no opinion on your poses!

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:37.583
Ah, what a shame.

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:39.875
[DUKE]
Looks like this game is mine.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.000
I'm sorry to do
this to you, Alice.

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:44.333
But I'm taking the winning shot.

00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:47.250
Don't put it in there,
Your Grace.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:52.583
Don't put it in there,
in there, in there, in there...

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:54.250
Uh, sorry, but I should
really concentrate,

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.333
so could you not
talk during the game?

00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.125
[ROB]
That's a foul.

00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:02.333
So, Alice, you may place
the ball wherever you wish.

00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:05.333
It should be a safe enough
shot from right here.

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.417
Well, it looks like I won,
Your Grace.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.917
And now, the question is,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.375
will you do whatever I ask,
just like we agreed?

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:17.333
Oh, right. What is it?

00:04:17.417 --> 00:04:18.500
Be calm.

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:19.667
But what am I going to say

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.750
if she asks me to
do something indecent?

00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:24.250
What I would like...

00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:28.542
...is a trip to town.

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:30.333
The two of us, together.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.333
Do I detect disappointment?

00:04:33.417 --> 00:04:35.041
Did you expect
something different?

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:36.959
[DUKE]
Stop, I did not!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.125
Why this sudden desire
to go into town?

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:41.709
There's a festival this weekend

00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:43.125
and all the townspeople
will attend,

00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:44.834
dressed up in costumes.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.250
Here you are.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:48.041
And I've been thinking,
if your costume's thick enough,

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:50.291
I'm sure anyone you bump
into will be fine.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:53.000
But I'm... not accustomed
to being in the company

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:56.166
of large crowds
of people anymore.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.417
When I walked past it last year,

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.375
it didn't appear to be
uncomfortably crowded.

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:03.959
What do you say? Please?

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:06.041
Will you go into town with me?

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:08.125
That look is not fair!

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.959
[DUKE]
So, this is...

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:14.250
...the town?

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:16.583
[ALICE]
That's right.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:18.000
So how's your costume?

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:19.917
I think it came out quite well.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.250
[DUKE]
It's not bad.

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:23.458
Though it's a bit hard
to move around in.

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:25.125
By the way,
if I haven't mentioned it,

00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:26.750
that costume looks lovely.

00:05:26.834 --> 00:05:29.166
And, uh, I don't just
mean the outfit. You.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.917
That's kind of you
to say, Your Grace.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.417
But...

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.250
I feel terrible.

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:35.750
I was wrong about the crowd.

00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:39.291
[DUKE]
Mm-hm. Watch out! Ahh!

00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:40.667
Alice!

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.667
Looks like I did
make the right call.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.667
If you're encased in steel,

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.583
there's nothing to worry about.

00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:46.834
Other than me falling over

00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:48.959
from the sheer volume
of the thing, that is.

00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:51.166
Wait, Is everything all
right in there, Your Grace?

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.000
Shall we head back home now?

00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:54.792
[DUKE]
No. You asked me to do this,

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:58.083
so I'll simply have to
tough it out a little longer.

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:00.083
Thank you so much for
indulging me, Your Grace.

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.375
I can't tell you
how honored I am.

00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:05.709
I can see now that it may
have been somewhat rash of me

00:06:05.792 --> 00:06:08.250
to drag you to a
public place like this.

00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:11.542
With so many people,
something could go very wrong.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:12.834
But the truth is,

00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:14.750
I've dreamed of this.

00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:17.291
Coming into town
on a date with you.

00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:19.709
Exactly like we're doing.

00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:22.083
[ALICE]
Just like any normal couple.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.458
[ALICE]
Your Grace?

00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:30.583
[DUKE]
Down here.

00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:32.375
I may have been trampled.

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.917
Can we go home?

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.458
Oh dear, where on earth is he?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.250
[LADY]
Are you Sharon?

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:50.208
Sharon Lendrott?

00:06:51.583 --> 00:06:55.125
[ALICE]
No. Sharon is my mother's name.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.291
[LADY]
Yes, of course.

00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:00.291
You look so alike
you startled me,

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:02.333
but there's no
way you could be her.

00:07:02.417 --> 00:07:04.333
So, you're her daughter, then.

00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:05.500
Alice, was it?

00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:07.834
May I first ask who you are?

00:07:07.917 --> 00:07:09.458
[LADY]
I'm nobody important.

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:12.125
Just a trifling
acquaintance of Sharon's.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.166
You take care, Alice.

00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:21.208
Now, I must go
look for His Grace.

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:25.834
[DUKE] I've wound up
at a square of some sort.

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:27.750
Great, I'm lost?

00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:30.083
Even better.

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:34.250
I've got a lost little boy
here looking to me for help.

00:07:34.333 --> 00:07:36.250
We're both in trouble.

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:37.875
Where's Mommy?

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.792
Listen, please
don't cry so hard.

00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:43.041
It makes me feel like crying

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:44.750
There's a piano!

00:07:44.834 --> 00:07:47.000
I'll play you something
to cheer you up.

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:48.667
Now dry those tears!

00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:54.041
[DUKE]
I'm so nervous.

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:55.583
To think I would
ever be playing the piano

00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:57.709
with this many people around.

00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:02.959

I'm glad.

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:33.291
Your playing was
really wonderful!

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:34.166
Bye bye!

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.792
[DUKE]
Thanks!

00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:40.250
[DUKE]
Well, now I'd better find Alice.

00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:42.166
I've finally found you,
Your Grace.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.709
Yes, you did!

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.250
[ALICE] Please don't go off
on your own again, all right?

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:48.959
[DUKE]
Back up! You're too close!

00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:51.792
[ALICE]
You must be getting tired.

00:09:51.875 --> 00:09:53.875
Shall we head back soon, then?

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:56.083
[DUKE]
No, let's stay a bit longer.

00:09:56.166 --> 00:09:58.834
We came all this way,
seems a pity to go back

00:09:58.917 --> 00:10:01.750
when I could keep
enjoying this time with you.

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:04.875
Pardon me, but is that
really you, Your Grace?

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:07.834
May I have a look inside
your mouth just to be sure?

00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:10.000
[DUKE]
How does that make any sense?

00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.000
[DUKE]
Alice, look at this!

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:44.500
There's a mask here
that looks like me!

00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:47.417
I suppose it would be
useless to deny it.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.834
[DUKE]
Right?

00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:51.166
Actually, that mask was
inspired by a Death incarnate

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.458
that is said to live in
the forest up north of town.

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:58.083
Though I couldn't say whether
such a creature really exists.

00:10:58.166 --> 00:10:59.458
Shall we be on our way now?

00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:01.083
Come along, Your Grace.

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:05.667
[DUKE] I've had
my suspicions all along,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.208
but it seems there
really have been rumors

00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:09.417
going around about me.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.417
But I'm just a normal guy

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.417
who happens to have a little
curse on him, that's all.

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:17.166
Sublime! What is it?

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.000
It's called ice cream,
Your Grace.

00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:20.375
You must have some, too, Alice!

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:22.208
Go on, I insist.

00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:23.250
Thank you.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Why is everything
so suggestive with you?

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:31.500
No, wait.
We'll lose each other again.

00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:34.959
I know, what would you say
to climbing the clock tower?

00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:37.333
There doesn't appear
to be anyone up there.

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:44.250
Wow.

00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:47.500
It looks as if the town has
been blanketed with stars.

00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:49.333
[ALICE]
Indeed.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.792
And look!
There's that glorious moon!

00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:54.125
[ALICE]
Do be careful rushing about.

00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:55.875
Oh, of course

00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:03.500
There's a local fairy tale.

00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:05.083
You may not be familiar with it,

00:12:05.166 --> 00:12:07.542
but it's about a princess
who marries the moon.

00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:09.166
[DUKE]
That's what we saw earlier?

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.333
[ALICE]
Yes.

00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:13.542
[ALICE]
Once upon a time,

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:15.709
there lived in this land
a brave young prince

00:12:15.792 --> 00:12:18.208
and a beautiful princess.

00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:20.208
The two were deeply in love,

00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:22.875
and were, in fact,
engaged to be married.

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:25.083
But a jealous witch came along.

00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:27.500
She took the prince and
carried him off to the moon.

00:12:27.583 --> 00:12:28.792
[PRINCE]
Help me!

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:30.250
[DUKE] I guess even
in fairy tales all witches

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.000
do is interfere.

00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:33.500
[ALICE]
Every year since,

00:12:33.583 --> 00:12:36.542
on the anniversary of
the night she was to be wed,

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.834
the princess
looks toward the moon,

00:12:38.917 --> 00:12:43.041
and she offers up a kiss
to her faraway prince.

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:45.083
That's how the story goes.

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:47.834
It seems a rather
sad tale, don't you think?

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:49.208
Maybe not!

00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:51.458
I'm sure the prince is
also sending her a kiss back

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:53.333
from where he is,
out there in the universe.

00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:56.625
How wonderful it would be
if that were the case.

00:12:56.709 --> 00:13:00.000
It's strange, but if
you really think about it,

00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:02.500
they're the exact
opposite of us.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.625
How so?

00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:07.625
[DUKE] Because even when
I'm standing this close to you,

00:13:07.709 --> 00:13:10.375
I feel like you're
still so far away.

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:13.333
The truth is, I love you
so much I can't stand it.

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:15.333
Yet here we are on a date,

00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:17.583
and I can't even hold your hand.

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:18.959
A date? What?

00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:22.709
Did you hear me say
that earlier? Oh, dear.

00:13:22.792 --> 00:13:24.083
I've dreamed of this.

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:27.083
Coming into town
on a date with you.

00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:30.625
[DUKE]
Yes, once I heard that.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:32.959
I hoped I could
make today into one,

00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:34.792
if only for a little while.

00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:36.750
But I couldn't do a thing.

00:13:36.834 --> 00:13:39.625
I'm so sorry I wasn't able
to show you a better time.

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:42.125
I had a wonderful time.

00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:45.083
After all, I got to
be by your side all day.

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:47.208
Nothing makes me happier.

00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:49.583
So, that's really how you feel?

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:51.583
[ALICE]
Yes, that's how I feel.

00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:54.166
I hope you'll continue
to keep me near you, always.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.834
Even if I can never touch you,

00:13:56.917 --> 00:13:59.125
I'd like to be as
close to you as I can

00:13:59.208 --> 00:14:01.500
and live gazing into your eyes.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.375
[VIOLA]
I just remembered,

00:14:07.458 --> 00:14:09.208
there's one of those cute
little festival things

00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:10.834
going on in town today.

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:12.375
From what I understand,

00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:14.709
they're going to reenact the
princess and the moon's wedding.

00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:16.875
Sounds like it
could be exciting.

00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:19.375
I honestly couldn't care less.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.166
[DUKE]
"If you cannot sleep, my master,

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.250
you are welcome
to my room. Alice."

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.667
I wonder what she could want.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.583
Huh.

00:14:42.125 --> 00:14:44.583
[DUKE] That's her room,
if I'm not mistaken.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.709
[DUKE]
It's me.

00:14:46.792 --> 00:14:48.083
I got your note.

00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:50.375
[ALICE]
Please, come in.

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:53.000
Welcome to my abode, Your Grace.

00:14:53.083 --> 00:14:54.917
Why on earth are you naked?!

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.959
[ALICE]
When I'm in my room,

00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:57.792
I make it a rule
not to wear clothes.

00:14:57.875 --> 00:15:00.208
I don't care!
Put something on right now!

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.417
Thank you for waiting,
Your Grace.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.667
Do come in.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.000
[DUKE]
That looks nice on you.

00:15:11.083 --> 00:15:13.125
Sorry for intruding.

00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:17.375
What a pleasant
fragrance that is!

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:19.875
[ALICE]
Yes, I lit a scented candle.

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:21.625
They can be quite relaxing,

00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:22.917
and I thought
I'd try some things

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to ease a bit of
your tension tonight.

00:15:25.083 --> 00:15:26.709
Ease? Like how?

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:29.375
Calm down.
I'll make you some tea.

00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:30.959
[DUKE]
Whoa! Take a deep breath!

00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:34.125
Her morals have always been
questionable, but sheesh.

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:37.125
[DUKE]
No, you're overly aware of her

00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:39.083
because now you've
seen her naked.

00:15:39.166 --> 00:15:40.792
Control yourself!

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.041
[DUKE] What's that?
Looks like strings?

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:46.083
An undergarment!

00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:47.792
What's that doing here?

00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:50.542
I made some chamomile tea.

00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:52.750
Go on and drink it
while it's hot.

00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:54.208
Oh! Thank you.

00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:02.542
Surely, she must be
wearing some underwear.

00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:03.667
But knowing her.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.834
[ALICE]
When you're finished with that,

00:16:04.917 --> 00:16:06.792
I think we should
head over to the bed.

00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:12.250
[DUKE] She's planning
something for sure.

00:16:12.333 --> 00:16:13.750
That's never good.

00:16:15.792 --> 00:16:18.417
[ALICE] Now, remove
your clothes, please.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.250
[DUKE]
What is she playing at?

00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:25.083
I mean, we can't touch
each other or anything.

00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:27.458
[ALICE]
Don't worry,
you have nothing to fear.

00:16:27.542 --> 00:16:30.166
Just surrender yourself,
I'll take care of you.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.625
[DUKE]
She means business.

00:16:31.709 --> 00:16:33.125
This is crazy.

00:16:35.083 --> 00:16:36.959
Lie down, if you would.

00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:40.291
Uh, all right.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:41.500
Seriously.

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:43.125
What is happening right now?

00:16:43.208 --> 00:16:44.959
Now I want you
to close your eyes.

00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:47.959
Let your mind and
body relax, completely.

00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:51.333
All right, sweet dreams!

00:16:51.417 --> 00:16:52.166
What?

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.417
Go to sleep?

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.709
Well, yes, didn't you come here

00:16:54.792 --> 00:16:57.458
because you were
having trouble sleeping?

00:16:57.542 --> 00:16:59.959
With that scented candle
and the chamomile tea,

00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:02.041
I thought I'd be able
to relax you somewhat

00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:03.834
and send you off to sleep.

00:17:03.917 --> 00:17:06.458
That's all I tried to do.

00:17:06.542 --> 00:17:07.792
I truly hope you'll forgive me

00:17:07.875 --> 00:17:09.083
if I gave you the
wrong impression,

00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:10.959
it wasn't my intent.

00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:12.375
[DUKE]
Oh, it absolutely was.

00:17:12.458 --> 00:17:13.834
You rest now, Your Grace.

00:17:13.917 --> 00:17:15.375
All right?

00:17:15.458 --> 00:17:18.917
I shall remain here by your
side until you fall asleep.

00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:27.291
Can I ask a favor of you?

00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:28.500
[ALICE]
Yes, Your Grace?

00:17:28.583 --> 00:17:30.458
If it's convenient,
on the night after next,

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:33.542
would you mind going out
with me for a little while?

00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:35.166
It's just that...

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.959
...there's something
important I've got to show you.

00:17:38.041 --> 00:17:40.542
[ALICE]
Something to show me?

00:17:42.542 --> 00:17:44.959
Yes, please do.

00:18:10.458 --> 00:18:12.500
So, that's what
you're going to show me?

00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:16.125
A huge meteor shower that
only happens once every decade?

00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:18.583
Right. Ten years ago,
I happened to see it one night

00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:22.375
when I was sitting at
the edge of this very lake.

00:18:22.458 --> 00:18:24.792
What I saw that night.

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:28.208
I will treasure forever.

00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:31.709
So, I wanted to share it
with you this time around.

00:18:31.792 --> 00:18:33.250
Which means,

00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:36.291
I get to have this wonderful
view and you all to myself.

00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:39.709
It's almost too perfect
for me to believe.

00:18:39.792 --> 00:18:42.250
[DUKE] We did come here
to see the shooting stars,

00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:44.792
but also, so I could
tell you how I really feel,

00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:48.750
sincerely, instead of
by some clumsy accident.

00:18:48.834 --> 00:18:52.417
And I'm determined to do it.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.125
The meteor shower should
begin any time now.

00:18:55.208 --> 00:18:57.250
Alice, look up at the sky.

00:18:57.333 --> 00:18:59.709
[ALICE]
All right.

00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:02.166
[DUKE] I don't understand,
why aren't you doing it?

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.208
Because it's more fun
to look at you, Your Grace.

00:19:05.291 --> 00:19:07.625
[DUKE] Well, but that's
not why we're here.

00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:11.375
[ALICE]
Your hat!

00:19:15.917 --> 00:19:17.083
[DUKE]
Alice!

00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:21.500
[ALICE]
Forgive me.

00:19:21.583 --> 00:19:23.750
I'm afraid it got a little wet.

00:19:23.834 --> 00:19:24.792
[DUKE]
I don't mind.

00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:26.792
Thanks for doing that.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.125
Here! Climb back on board.

00:19:29.208 --> 00:19:33.792
Oh. Sorry I can't
offer you my hand.

00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:35.792
If it weren't for this
ridiculous curse,

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:40.542
I wouldn't cause you and Rob
so much trouble all the time.

00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:42.417
I'm sorry it's like this.

00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:48.667
[ALICE] If you can't touch me,
then give me a kiss.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.041
If you have any feelings
for me, then kiss me now.

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:54.750
I want you to, right here.

00:19:54.834 --> 00:19:57.000
But if I do, then you'll die.

00:19:57.083 --> 00:19:58.417
[ALICE] Think of how
romantic it would be

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.500
for me to die by
your kiss, Your Grace.

00:20:01.583 --> 00:20:03.083
We'd be lucky.

00:20:03.166 --> 00:20:06.583
It's something the prince and
princess were never able to do.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.166
You really want to?

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.041
I want to kiss you, too,

00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:20.542
so if you keep saying things
like that, I'll really do it.

00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:24.417
[ALICE] I really want
you to, Your Grace.

00:20:38.875 --> 00:20:40.792
No. I can't do it.

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:41.709
I'm sorry.

00:20:41.792 --> 00:20:43.875
Yes, I know that.

00:20:43.959 --> 00:20:46.083
It's what I thought you'd say.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:52.125
Alice! You did that on
purpose, didn't you?

00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:54.208
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

00:20:54.291 --> 00:20:56.250
You don't get enough
exercise on the estate,

00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:59.291
so I thought I'd force you
to swim and see how that went.

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:00.709
Mission accomplished, I'd say.

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:03.333
Well, you could've
asked, you know!

00:21:03.417 --> 00:21:05.667
[ALICE] It looks like
the meteor shower is over.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:06.750
This was fun.

00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:07.750
Shall we head back?

00:21:07.834 --> 00:21:09.500
[DUKE graons]

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.291
[DUKE]
What a kick in the teeth!

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:16.542
I had a once-in-a-decade
chance, and now it's gone.

00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:18.667
I couldn't even say what
I wanted to say to you.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.333
[ALICE]
Oh, what did you want to say?

00:21:20.417 --> 00:21:23.500
I was going to tell you
how I really feel about you.

00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:24.834
That I like you and all.

00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:28.041
I went and said it
offhandedly again!

00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:30.291
It never rings true
when I do that.

00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:32.291
I give up! This is the worst!

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.125
Let's go home now, Alice!

00:21:39.041 --> 00:21:40.875
Of course, Your Grace.

00:23:14.875 --> 00:23:16.166
Your Grace?

00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:18.667
In another ten years,

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.709
I think we should try
going back to that same spot

00:23:20.792 --> 00:23:23.083
to watch the
meteor shower again.

00:23:24.625 --> 00:23:27.500
[DUKE] Wait, does that mean
that ten years from now

00:23:27.583 --> 00:23:29.542
she'll still be with me?

00:23:43.792 --> 00:23:47.208
