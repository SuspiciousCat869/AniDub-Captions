00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.466
Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.566
(Yuya)
You ready, Gong?

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.566
Just do it!

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.866
Odd‐Eyes,
attack Steam Train!

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.133
Bring it on!

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.733
<i>(Nico on PA)</i>
<i>Yuya Sakaki wins</i>

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.966
<i>the Junior Arc League</i>
<i>Championship!</i>

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.400
Yuya's bidding
the Junior Division goodbye

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.733
and advancing to
the upper leagues!

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.500
(Declan)
No, he's not.

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.100
With more memories
regained,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.900
you should now
remember that I postponed

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.433
the original tournament

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.800
when Duel Academy
attacked this dimension.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.266
There's still one opponent
remaining

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.033
in this tournament.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:49.233
In fact, this duelist
was one of the Lancers.

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:51.433
You must go to them.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:53.566
Through this
dimensional portal.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.500
The ARC V Reactor has
created wormholes

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.433
to connect our dimension

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.333
with the other
three dimensions.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.640
Yuya, go to
the Xyz Dimension.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.240
(Yuya)
It's showtime!

00:01:05.206 --> 00:01:06.440
Huh?

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.806
I see somebody!

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:10.473

What's shakin'
and quakin', Yuya?

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:17.279
Dennis?

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.379
What're you doing here?

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.546
Why, to duel you,
of course.

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:23.146
Duel me?

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:24.113
But I'm duelin' Shay‐‐

00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:25.480
Well, Shay isn't here.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.846
Huh?

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.146
Isn't that right,
kids?

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:29.446
(Alan)
Yeah!

00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:32.213
Shay took off for
the Fusion Dimension.

00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:34.080
He told us that he didn't
want to waste his time

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.713
standing around
blabbing and gabbing,

00:02:36.713 --> 00:02:38.746
but he, like, almost
said it nice.

00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:40.580
Shay's gone off
to try and find Lulu.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.880
Lulu?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.946
Oh, I get it.

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:46.313
Since Zuzu's missing,
it makes sense that Lulu

00:02:46.313 --> 00:02:47.846
and the other girls
are missing too.

00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:52.246
I bet he could
totally use my help!

00:02:52.246 --> 00:02:54.280
Uh‐uh‐uh!

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.280
Now, now,
don't be rude, Yuya.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.046
I know our crowd is much
tinier than a stadium,

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.646
but... didn't
your father teach you

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:04.520
that a dueltainer must always
entertain his audience?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.220
Well, yeah, but I really
gotta skedaddle, Dennis!

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.153
No, you don't.

00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:10.953
Honestly, Yuya,
what's more important

00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:12.386
than bringing a smile

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:14.153
to the faces of
our adoring fans?

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.186
Yeah, I remember them!

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.320
Let's see which one of us
is the true dueltainer,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.620
but it might bring
a frowny frown to your face!

00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:32.986
<i>(computer voice)</i>
<i>Generating Action Field,</i>
<i>Crossover.</i>

00:03:32.986 --> 00:03:34.086
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.020
I'll make the first move!

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.520
I'll use Scale 2
Performapal Gongato

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.620
and scale 8 Xiangsheng
Magician

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.920
to set
the Pendulum Scale!

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.820
I'm taking control of this
duel starting now!

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.453
I'm allowed to
summon monsters

00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:51.686
from Level 3 through 7
all at the same time!

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:53.186
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:03:53.186 --> 00:03:55.920
Carve the arc of
victory!

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.320
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:03.260
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:04:04.693 --> 00:04:05.493
(gasping)

00:04:05.493 --> 00:04:07.260
Awesome!

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.393
How's that for
an opening act?

00:04:09.393 --> 00:04:11.860
Not too shabby, Yuya.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.526
But not as spectacular as
what moi has planned!

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:18.260
Bring the bubbles,
Performage Bubble Gardna!

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:20.593
Gard.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.893
(both chuckling)

00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:23.260
(woman)
Kids!

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.493
How many times
have I told you,

00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:26.760
stay away from dueling?

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.326
Dueling is
dangerous, honey.

00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:29.493
It's not for you.

00:04:29.493 --> 00:04:31.693
But, Mom,
a duel like this

00:04:31.693 --> 00:04:34.659
only happens like once in
a bazillion years.

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.426
And how can
dueling be bad when

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:38.226
that guy who saved us
plays it?

00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:42.226
Sometimes
the kids are the ones

00:04:42.226 --> 00:04:44.793
who teach the parents
the lessons.

00:04:44.793 --> 00:04:47.893
Anyway, I summon
Performage Filmsy Slimmer!

00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:52.893
C'mon, you gotta
let us watch!

00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:53.993
Well, um...

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.093
(man)
Absolutely not!

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.826
And that is final!

00:04:57.826 --> 00:04:59.060
They're bad guys!

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.960
Now let's go!

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.266
Got it?!

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:03.566
(Dennis laughing)

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:05.633
There's only
one bad guy here.

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:07.066
Polymerization!

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:09.000
Yes.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.433
This proves I'm from
the Fusion Dimension.

00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:13.766
So, if you don't want to be
turned into a card,

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:15.900
I strongly
suggest you stay put.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.266
Wait, what are
you doing, Dennis?

00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:20.000
Just raising
the stakes, Yuya.

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:23.600
And Dennis the Destroyer's
going all in!

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:27.066
I will now use the spell
Polymerization

00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:30.200
to fuse Bubble Gardna
and Filmsy Slimmer together!

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:35.600
I Fusion Summon!

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:38.833
Performage
Trapeze Witch!

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:43.866
And I'll equip her
with this.

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:45.200
Ancient Gear Mask!

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:50.633
(laughing)

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:52.400
Here goes!

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.500
Trapeze Witch, attack
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.700
(laughing)

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:02.573
Don't you know there's
nowhere to hide, Yuya?!

00:06:02.573 --> 00:06:06.073
Trapeze Witch activates
her special ability!

00:06:06.073 --> 00:06:08.106
And zaps away
600 attack points

00:06:08.106 --> 00:06:09.140
from Odd‐Eyes!

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.073
I'm activating my spell‐‐

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:16.273
Oh, no you're not!

00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:19.173
While my Trapeze Witch is
wearing her lovely Mask,

00:06:19.173 --> 00:06:21.306
you can't activate
spell or trap cards

00:06:21.306 --> 00:06:22.206
when she's attacking!

00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:25.840
(grunting)

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.040
And the Mask releases
her inner fury

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.540
to deal you
double the damage

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.206
when she destroys
your Dragon!

00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:39.906
(grunting)

00:06:39.906 --> 00:06:41.206
Looks like
she was the one

00:06:41.206 --> 00:06:43.773
who was really swinging
into action!

00:06:43.773 --> 00:06:46.573
You are gonna
have to face the facts.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:49.140
There's only one dueltainer,
and it's me!

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.206
(grunting)

00:06:54.206 --> 00:06:57.173
Well, with every
life point that you lose,

00:06:57.173 --> 00:06:59.406
your dueltaining career
is one step closer

00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:01.113
to retirement!

00:07:01.113 --> 00:07:02.913
But I...
don't wanna retire!

00:07:02.913 --> 00:07:05.046
(Aster)
Aw, come on now.

00:07:05.046 --> 00:07:05.813
(Yuya)
Aster?

00:07:05.813 --> 00:07:07.580
Hi, Yuya!

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.280
You're not
the only one having it rough.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.946
The dimensional wars
may be over,

00:07:10.946 --> 00:07:13.280
but the scars of
battle don't heal as easily

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.280
and the people here
still find it tough

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.113
to trust anyone
from the Fusion Dimension.

00:07:18.113 --> 00:07:20.180
But you're helping to
restore this city.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.646
That has to count
for something, right?

00:07:21.646 --> 00:07:23.280
(Aster)
Not enough, though.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.880
We can work to rebuild
all the buildings,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.246
fix the schools,
mend everything,

00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:30.913
but like I said, how do we
rebuild the trust

00:07:30.913 --> 00:07:33.546
that's been broken
forever between our people?

00:07:33.546 --> 00:07:35.980
How will these people
smile again

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.880
after witnessing so much
hate and destruction?

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.213
(gasping)

00:07:40.213 --> 00:07:41.213
(Yuya)
I know!

00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:42.980
And so does Dennis.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.013
It won't be easy,
but I gotta try!

00:07:45.946 --> 00:07:48.113
It's my turn!

00:07:48.113 --> 00:07:51.546
I'm gonna Pendulum Summon
once again!

00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:56.713
C'mon back,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.786
And here's Performapal
Miracle Mirrorabbit!

00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:05.186
Odd‐Eyes, attack
Trapeze Witch now!

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.520
(chuckling)

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.653
I just don't understand
why you're making this

00:08:12.653 --> 00:08:14.520
so easy for me, Yuya?

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.886
Trapeze Witch will sap

00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:17.853
Odd‐Eyes's
attack points again!

00:08:20.086 --> 00:08:23.886
Not when I have Performapal
Miracle Mirrorabbit out!

00:08:23.886 --> 00:08:26.553
It reflects your effect
from Odd‐Eyes to itself!

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.153
Since my witch is wearing
the Ancient Gear Mask,

00:08:33.153 --> 00:08:35.486
your Odd‐Eyes can't
destroy her in battle!

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:42.120
But due to Odd‐Eyes'
special ability,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.553
you still
take damage.

00:08:45.086 --> 00:08:46.020
Twice the damage!

00:08:52.553 --> 00:08:53.886
Ha!

00:08:53.886 --> 00:08:56.086
Very scary with that
"twice the damage" thing.

00:08:56.086 --> 00:08:58.386
But that was only a measly
200 points.

00:08:58.386 --> 00:08:59.893
Because that was
only the start!

00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:01.326
Really?

00:09:01.326 --> 00:09:03.060
Better believe it!

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.426
Can I get
a drumroll, please?!

00:09:05.426 --> 00:09:07.193
Oops, forgot to bring
the instruments.

00:09:07.193 --> 00:09:09.060
Well, here goes!

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.926
What the...

00:09:09.926 --> 00:09:11.426
Hey!

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:12.960
That's your cue,
buddy!

00:09:16.093 --> 00:09:18.360
All right, cool!

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.960
My Rabbit's mirror is
one of those special ones.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.693
It lets my Odd‐Eyes attack
for a second time!

00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:26.426
In all my years, I've never seen
a duel like this before!

00:09:26.426 --> 00:09:28.060
That's because
you're old, Dad!

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.726
(laughing)

00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:32.493
Now, Odd‐Eyes,
attack Trapeze Witch

00:09:32.493 --> 00:09:34.726
for a second time and make
this crowd go loud!

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.126
That same ol' trick
again?

00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:41.926
Trapeze Witch!

00:09:41.926 --> 00:09:44.393
Use your special ability to
lower Odd‐Eyes' attack points!

00:09:44.393 --> 00:09:47.026
If the trick works,
why stop using it?

00:09:47.026 --> 00:09:49.226
Mirrorabbit absorbs
her special ability

00:09:49.226 --> 00:09:51.026
in place of Odd‐Eyes!

00:09:51.026 --> 00:09:52.626
Why don't you reflect
on that for awhile?!

00:09:55.993 --> 00:09:57.760
(groaning)

00:10:04.566 --> 00:10:06.133
(groaning)

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.600
That's a few more
life points

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.900
down the drain.

00:10:13.066 --> 00:10:15.500
And even that mask can't
hide your disappointment.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.133
And, hey, what's with that
silly mask anyway?

00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:21.633
I mean, it really
isn't that scary

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:23.700
for such
a big bad destroyer.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.533
Like, I don't see it making
anyone squirm or scream.

00:10:27.533 --> 00:10:29.466
You barely look
like a super villain.

00:10:29.466 --> 00:10:30.866
Henchman at best.

00:10:30.866 --> 00:10:32.500
No offense,
of course.

00:10:35.133 --> 00:10:36.500
None‐‐
well, some taken.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.133
Fine, I don't need this!

00:10:40.566 --> 00:10:41.900
I'll let my moves
do the talking!

00:10:43.233 --> 00:10:45.533
Here I go!

00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:48.566
With my Scale 2 Performage
Reversal Dancer

00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:51.200
and my Scale 6
Performage Fire Dancer,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.333
I set the Pendulum Scale.

00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:54.266
(beeping)

00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:00.473
Now I can summon monsters
from Levels 3 through 5

00:11:00.473 --> 00:11:01.606
at the same time!

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.140
You ready?

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.906
I Pendulum Summon!

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.840
Performage Bubble Gardna!

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.406
And Performage Filmsy Slimmer!

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.840
Next, I overlay
Bubble Gardna

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.040
and Filmsy Slimmer
in order to build

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.906
the Overlay Network!

00:11:24.406 --> 00:11:27.073
Now, my dueling ace is gonna
put you in your place!

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.406
I Xyz Summon!

00:11:37.406 --> 00:11:40.873
Put your hands together
for my aerial wonder‐worker!

00:11:40.873 --> 00:11:43.806
Performage Trapeze
Magician!

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:45.840
Here!

00:11:50.106 --> 00:11:51.306
A flower shower!

00:11:51.306 --> 00:11:52.673
How pretty!

00:11:52.673 --> 00:11:54.140
(all gasping)

00:11:56.073 --> 00:11:58.340
And now with
the snap of a finger

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.006
I'll use one of
Trapeze Magician's

00:12:00.006 --> 00:12:03.380
overlay units to activate
its special ability!

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.880
Now my Trapeze Magician

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.513
can attack twice
in a single turn!

00:12:07.513 --> 00:12:10.146
First on its hit list...
is Mirrorabbit!

00:12:12.446 --> 00:12:15.146
Oh, Tra‐please,
Dennis!

00:12:15.146 --> 00:12:17.613
I activate Evasion
to elude your attack!

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.980
Yeah!

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.713
Yuya!

00:12:24.713 --> 00:12:27.046
You may have dodged
my first attack,

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.813
but you will not
elude my second!

00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:29.746
Yeah?

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:31.213
Then fire away.

00:12:31.213 --> 00:12:32.746
Oh, I will!

00:12:32.746 --> 00:12:34.513
Except I'm attacking
your Odd‐Eyes

00:12:34.513 --> 00:12:36.180
instead of
your Mirrorabbit!

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.180
No way.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.080
Not my Odd‐Eyes.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.980
Their monsters have,
like, equal attack points.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.246
They'll destroy
each other.

00:12:43.213 --> 00:12:45.146
Time for a Miracle!

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.646
This card stops my monster
from being destroyed!

00:12:49.646 --> 00:12:51.580
But I can't say
the same for yours!

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.080
(Dennis)
But I wanted my monster

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.146
to be destroyed, Yuya!

00:12:55.146 --> 00:12:57.913
I activate
Rank‐Up‐Magic Magical Force!

00:12:57.913 --> 00:12:59.713
Ha‐ha!

00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:01.786
It resurrects the monster
you just destroyed,

00:13:01.786 --> 00:13:02.886
but that's
only the beginning!

00:13:04.686 --> 00:13:07.753
For you see, Yuya,
I can use my Trapeze Magician

00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:10.620
to Xyz Summon a Spellcaster
that's one Rank higher!

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.986
No way!

00:13:11.986 --> 00:13:13.320
If you thought
Trapeze Magician

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.686
was a showstopper,

00:13:14.686 --> 00:13:17.020
just wait 'til you meet
his big brother!

00:13:21.353 --> 00:13:24.386
Go, Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:28.720
Here's Performage Trapeze
High Magician!

00:13:29.353 --> 00:13:30.586
Whoa!

00:13:30.586 --> 00:13:32.120
I wish I had his cape!

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.253
Sweet!

00:13:34.253 --> 00:13:37.253
And now, by using one of
his Overlay units...

00:13:37.253 --> 00:13:39.053
Trapeze High Magician

00:13:39.053 --> 00:13:41.220
can attack three times
in a single turn!

00:13:44.653 --> 00:13:45.786
Three times?

00:13:45.786 --> 00:13:47.586
That's epic!

00:13:47.586 --> 00:13:49.786
Yuya is done for.

00:13:49.786 --> 00:13:51.486
Negative much?

00:13:51.486 --> 00:13:54.420
Don't you ever dare
count my Yuya out!

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.720
(boy)
Don't do it!

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.753
Ixnay on
the "ighting‐fay."

00:13:57.753 --> 00:13:59.453
(boy)
B‐B‐but
she's a baddie.

00:13:59.453 --> 00:14:01.760
Tell me something, kid.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.860
Would a baddie save you
front‐row seats to this duel?

00:14:05.526 --> 00:14:06.926
Cool!
Yeah!

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:08.860
For his first attack,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.793
Trapeze High Magician's
swinging straight towards

00:14:10.793 --> 00:14:12.160
your Odd‐Eyes!

00:14:14.693 --> 00:14:15.726
(grunting)

00:14:23.726 --> 00:14:25.460
Miracle Mirrorabbit,
you're next!

00:14:32.093 --> 00:14:33.260
(yelling)

00:14:34.793 --> 00:14:36.426
And for the third
and final attack,

00:14:36.426 --> 00:14:37.893
strike Yuya directly!

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.126
I still have my
Performapal Gongato

00:14:43.126 --> 00:14:44.793
to help save me.

00:14:44.793 --> 00:14:47.493
Pound out a beat that
stops all the damage!

00:14:49.426 --> 00:14:51.526
That's one
bodacious belly!

00:14:53.593 --> 00:14:55.460
It's true you
may have survived,

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.960
but you do realize you only
have 100 life points left.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.500
No sweat, pal!

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.100
I'll keep
rolling on!

00:15:04.233 --> 00:15:05.466
It's my turn!

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.300
You're good, but my
routine's even better.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.333
I'm bringing my
monsters back!

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:13.600
I Pendulum Summon!

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.233
Odd‐Eyes is raring
for revenge!

00:15:19.666 --> 00:15:21.666
Along with my
favorite carrot cruncher,

00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:23.533
Mirrorabbit!

00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:25.366
And making
a surprise appearance

00:15:25.366 --> 00:15:27.933
is my Performapal Sword Fish!

00:15:27.933 --> 00:15:30.466
And my Sword Fish has been
sharpening its blades!

00:15:31.733 --> 00:15:34.366
Its special ability slices
600 attack points

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:35.966
off your
Trapeze High Magician!

00:15:39.166 --> 00:15:41.566
That acrobat's not swinging
so high anymore.

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.266
Yuya turned
this duel around.

00:15:43.266 --> 00:15:45.000
It sure looks like
you have the advantage,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.700
now, doesn't it?

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.633
But that's why you can
never trust your eyes

00:15:48.633 --> 00:15:50.600
when dealing with
a magician's tricks.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.833
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:15:56.833 --> 00:15:59.706
Trapeze High Magician
can't be destroyed in battle

00:15:59.706 --> 00:16:01.673
for up to three times!

00:16:01.673 --> 00:16:04.473
And what you can't destroy
will only do you harm!

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:11.506
If you wanna beat me,

00:16:11.506 --> 00:16:13.406
then you'll have to
climb up here!

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:16.206
Then send down the elevator
and I'm there!

00:16:16.206 --> 00:16:17.240
(all gasping)

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.873
There is no elevator.

00:16:18.873 --> 00:16:20.373
Why didn't you
build one?

00:16:20.373 --> 00:16:22.306
Do I look like
a duel‐chitect?

00:16:22.306 --> 00:16:24.506
I'm just sayin'
that's a bad design.

00:16:24.506 --> 00:16:25.873
No matter.

00:16:25.873 --> 00:16:27.373
I'll still get all
the way to the top

00:16:27.373 --> 00:16:29.073
because if Plan "A"
doesn't work,

00:16:29.073 --> 00:16:31.040
then I just gotta
create my own Plan "B."

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.473
I activate the spell
Challenge Stairs!

00:16:36.473 --> 00:16:38.540
I would've preferred
Challenge Escalators,

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.806
but, hey, you take
what you can get.

00:16:40.806 --> 00:16:43.540
At least now, whenever
I fail to destroy your monster

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.873
with an attack, I can
tribute a card

00:16:45.873 --> 00:16:48.206
to let my
monster attack again!

00:16:48.206 --> 00:16:49.840
And then I activate
another spell,

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.540
Hope Stairs!

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.973
Now, whenever my
monster battles yours,

00:16:53.973 --> 00:16:55.973
it steps up my monster's
strength by giving it

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:58.473
400 extra
attack points!

00:16:58.473 --> 00:17:00.846
With this setup,
Yuya's optimal move

00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:02.546
is to use Xiangsheng Magician

00:17:02.546 --> 00:17:04.646
to summon
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon.

00:17:04.646 --> 00:17:06.513
It should be a no‐brainer,

00:17:06.513 --> 00:17:08.480
however I feel like
Yuya is holding back.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.680
Uh... hmm.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.013
It's time to
attack!

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.080
(gasping)

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.813
Odd‐Eyes, come with me!

00:17:22.546 --> 00:17:25.346
Odd‐Eyes, blast away
at Trapeze High Magician

00:17:25.346 --> 00:17:26.846
with spiral Flame Strike!

00:17:28.713 --> 00:17:30.746
But due to his
special ability,

00:17:30.746 --> 00:17:32.480
he isn't going to
be destroyed!

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.780
That won't save you from
losing life points, though!

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.546
(groaning)

00:17:40.713 --> 00:17:42.680
And my Hope Stairs
takes effect,

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.180
boosting Odd‐Eyes'
attack points by 400!

00:17:46.946 --> 00:17:50.546
I activate Reversal Dancer's
Pendulum ability!

00:17:50.546 --> 00:17:52.646
Spread the love,
Performage Reversal Dancer!

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.780
She gives
Trapeze High Magician

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.480
400 attack points too!

00:17:59.653 --> 00:18:00.986
Oh, yeah?

00:18:00.986 --> 00:18:02.786
Well, I activate
Mirrorabbit's ability!

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.253
My fluffy friend lets
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:08.886
attack for a second time!

00:18:11.286 --> 00:18:13.553
Odd‐Eyes, blast his
Trapeze High Magician again!

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.053
(grunting)

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.886
And my Odd‐Eyes gains
even more attack points!

00:18:24.786 --> 00:18:26.186
With all those
attack points,

00:18:26.186 --> 00:18:28.553
it would be a shame
to let 'em go to waste,

00:18:28.553 --> 00:18:31.453
so I'm gonna tribute
Xiangsheng Magician

00:18:31.453 --> 00:18:33.420
to give Odd‐Eyes a third
chance to attack!

00:18:36.153 --> 00:18:37.386
Oh, man!

00:18:37.386 --> 00:18:39.053
He just doesn't stop!

00:18:39.053 --> 00:18:40.853
All this damage
is adding up, Dennis!

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:42.020
(grunting)

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.920
You'd think Odd‐Eyes
would get tired

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.353
running up this hill,

00:18:46.353 --> 00:18:48.253
but it's only
getting stronger!

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:49.486
So awesome!

00:18:49.486 --> 00:18:51.486
Toast his tail!
Go, Yuya!

00:18:51.486 --> 00:18:54.653
Your Trapeze High Magician's
ability has run out,

00:18:54.653 --> 00:18:56.620
so it can now
be destroyed!

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:00.026
I use Challenge Stairs'
effect to tribute Gongato

00:19:00.026 --> 00:19:02.326
so that Odd‐Eyes can attack
for a fourth time!

00:19:03.093 --> 00:19:04.460
Fourth time, eh?

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.093
But it doesn't
matter!

00:19:06.093 --> 00:19:08.660
You don't have enough
damage to eliminate...

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.093
all my life points!

00:19:11.093 --> 00:19:12.860
Then I'll just play
Miracle.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.860
When did you
pick that up!?

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.860
When you weren't
looking.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.293
Obviously.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.193
That card stops a monster
from being destroyed,

00:19:22.193 --> 00:19:23.860
but your monster's
already stronger than mine.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:24.793
It's useless.

00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:26.060
It won't help you win.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.660
Yeah?

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.093
But who said I was going to
use it on my monster?

00:19:30.093 --> 00:19:31.360
I'm using
it on yours!

00:19:35.693 --> 00:19:37.460
While you keep
racking up damage,

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.360
Odd‐Eyes keeps racking up
attack points!

00:19:40.526 --> 00:19:42.093
And since your
monster survived,

00:19:42.093 --> 00:19:43.626
I'm allowed to activate

00:19:43.626 --> 00:19:45.293
Challenge Stairs'
effect again!

00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:46.960
I tribute Sword Fish

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.360
to gain a fifth
and final attack!

00:19:50.793 --> 00:19:52.893
(gasping)

00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:55.660
(all gasping)

00:19:57.293 --> 00:19:58.593
It's over!

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.500
(screaming)

00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:19.233
What a catch!
Amazing!

00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:21.566
Best duel ever!

00:20:21.566 --> 00:20:22.933
What a show!

00:20:25.033 --> 00:20:26.733
Awesome!
Awesome!

00:20:26.733 --> 00:20:28.166
(laughing)

00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:29.300
(man)
I was wrong, kids.

00:20:30.933 --> 00:20:33.666
I thought dueling was
a tool to hurt people,

00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:36.033
but...

00:20:36.033 --> 00:20:38.766
in the right hands,
it can mend our spirits.

00:20:38.766 --> 00:20:40.166
You're right, dear.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.533
Let's make sure

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:45.600
we become the right
hands too, okay?

00:20:47.433 --> 00:20:48.700
Yes.

00:20:50.733 --> 00:20:52.300
(laughing)

00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:01.040
(girl)
Can you teach us
how to duel, please!?

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.140
(girl)
I wanna learn
how to do spells!

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.340
I've gotta go.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.406
But luckily there's
a great instructor here.

00:21:07.406 --> 00:21:09.140
Professor Dennis

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.540
will teach you all
about dueltaining!

00:21:13.406 --> 00:21:14.573
Isn't that so?

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.140
I mean, it'll be
rude to say no.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.973
And after
the show you put on,

00:21:19.973 --> 00:21:22.406
I'm sure these kids will
be in good hands.

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:23.906
Me, a teacher?

00:21:25.873 --> 00:21:27.006
Okay!

00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:28.540
Let's go!

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.573
(boy)
Show us more Performages!

00:21:30.573 --> 00:21:32.706
(boy)
I'm so psyched!

00:21:40.906 --> 00:21:42.573
(laughing)

00:21:44.206 --> 00:21:45.306
(Dennis)
Thanks, Yuya.

00:21:45.306 --> 00:21:46.906
And good luck.

00:21:46.906 --> 00:21:48.240
I'll make you
and your father proud!
