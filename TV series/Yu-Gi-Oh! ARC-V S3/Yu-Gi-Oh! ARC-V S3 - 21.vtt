00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.933
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.166
Lulu!
Shay!

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.366
Finally, I found you.

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.700
I'm so happy to see you.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.466
We gotta get outta here,
like right now!

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.666
I just saw Kite
and he was acting all crazy!

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.166
There's something
wrong with him.

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.000
There's nothing wrong with me.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.233
It's The Professor, Shay‐‐
he brainwashed your sister.

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:24.600
She's dangerous!

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.966
Now, Lulu, attack.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.066
(chuckling)

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.500
Lulu, what are you...
Let me go!

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:34.733
I hopped through dimensions
to find you.

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.833
And I'm not leaving
empty handed.

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:38.433
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:41.733
Dueling Yuya taught me
what dueling's about.

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.666
It's not about winning,
it's about making friends.

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.300
Like how Saya wanted
to become friends with you

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.033
by giving you her card.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:52.100
So, if there's any card
that can reach your heart,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.400
this'll be it!

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.200
(giggles)

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.533
I Xyz Summon!

00:00:56.533 --> 00:01:00.066
Raidraptor Stranger Falcon!

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.440
I can't move!

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.906
I won't let you!

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.740
(straining)

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:11.240
(screaming)

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.940
There they are.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.806
Easy pickings!

00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:21.106
If you're looking a duel,
you got one.

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:22.373
(all)
Duel!

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:23.706
Here goes‐‐

(Emma and Jacob singing)

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:41.880
Sylvio, did you see who turned
those two into cards?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.913
No, no clue.

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.380
Whoever did this,
come out and face us!

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:49.580
(chuckling)

00:02:50.613 --> 00:02:54.013
Pathetic, absolutely pathetic.

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:57.413
It seems that even my most
highly‐trained students

00:02:57.413 --> 00:02:59.213
are no match
for what's out there.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.753
Hope he doesn't
send me next!

00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:06.386
I hope he does so he doesn't
send me instead!

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:09.420
Wait, could this be the...
Battle Beast?

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.486
Oh, come on, the Battle Beast
is just a rumor.

00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:15.086
(girl)
Yeah, but some rumors are true.

00:03:15.086 --> 00:03:19.120
What if the Beast is real?
And on the prowl?

00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:23.486
I don't know what's out there
in that jungle, Gong,

00:03:23.486 --> 00:03:26.086
but I do know this much‐‐
it's hunting us.

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:28.086
Indeed, all of us.

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:31.353
This thing, it seems,
duels only for itself.

00:03:31.353 --> 00:03:33.153
Hmm.

00:03:33.153 --> 00:03:35.220
We gotta find
Crow and Sylvio.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.453
Together, we're stronger.

00:03:36.453 --> 00:03:39.653
Agreed.
But in this thick jungle field,

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:41.853
finding them is much easier
said then done.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.353
In that case, what do you say
we get a bird's eye view?

00:03:55.786 --> 00:03:58.886
Now, Crow, don't worry
if you mess up this turn.

00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:01.426
'Cause then I'll be up,
and you know how I do.

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:03.326
The great Sylvio
will figure out a way

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:06.193
to turn this predator into prey
just like that!

00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:07.926
(thinking) <i>Sylvio</i>
<i>doesn't have a clue</i>

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:11.560
<i>how dangerous things are</i>
<i>right now.</i>

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.293
<i>The only way</i>
<i>to save him from himself</i>

00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:17.426
<i>is to take him</i>
<i>out of action!</i>

00:04:17.426 --> 00:04:20.993
I now wage...
a direct attack on Sylvio!

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:22.160
On me?!
Aah!

00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:24.260
(roars)

00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:27.160
(grunts)

00:04:30.193 --> 00:04:32.160
Crow!
What was that?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.926
I'm on your side, remember?

00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:37.259
Next, I'll play a face‐down
and then end my turn.

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.060
Hello?!
I'm talking to you here!

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.526
What's your deal?

00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:43.260
(computer)
<i>Duel Disk damaged.</i>

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.526
<i>Duel Disk damaged.</i>
<i>No longer able to duel.</i>

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:47.693
Say what?

00:04:47.693 --> 00:04:50.126
No longer able to duel?

00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:52.726
Did you kick me out
of the duel on purpose?

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:56.060
There's no use in both of us
sticking our necks out.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.160
I'll take things from here.

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:03.200
(roaring)

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.666
Hm?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.833
I activate my trap card!

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:15.400
Blackwing Last Will!

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:19.400
(explosion)

00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:22.666
We may be too late!

00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:28.433
(groaning)

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:30.833
Huh?
(sputtering)

00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:32.000
Where's Crow? Huh?

00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:37.400
I've been beat.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.666
But was I able
to beat him, too?

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:43.500
(sighing)

00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:50.700
Huh, guess that's a no.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.200
Still, I got you
out of the shadows.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.466
And what exactly
is that thing?

00:05:57.466 --> 00:05:59.000
(all gasp)

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.840
No way, it's really him.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.173
The Beast!

00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:05.640
Huh?
He's real?

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.440
(thinking)
<i>A real pain in the neck</i>
<i>is what he is,</i>

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.506
<i>'cause he don't care</i>
<i>if he takes down</i>

00:06:10.506 --> 00:06:13.940
<i>one of my students</i>
<i>or one of them Lancers.</i>

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.006
What are you all
slack‐jawed for?

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:17.740
Yeah, he's real.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.206
I should know,
I trained him myself!

00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:22.540
He's BB, the Battle Beast!

00:06:25.973 --> 00:06:28.240
(Sanders)
He's BB, the Battle Beast!

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.106
This guy is bad news.

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:31.606
Well, that's the understatement
of the day.

00:06:32.906 --> 00:06:34.773
Hey, Crow!
Yuya!

00:06:34.773 --> 00:06:37.340
(roaring)

00:06:38.806 --> 00:06:39.773
(screaming)

00:06:39.773 --> 00:06:41.606
(snarling)

00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:43.473
(straining)

00:06:43.473 --> 00:06:44.073
Crow!
Crow!

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:48.706
This jungle boy's
all yours, Yuya!

00:06:48.706 --> 00:06:50.973
Crow!

00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:53.473
Nooo!

00:06:53.473 --> 00:06:54.606
Crowwww!

00:06:56.873 --> 00:07:01.113
(Crow thinking)
<i>I guess I won't be seeing</i>
<i>those jackals anymore.</i>

00:07:01.113 --> 00:07:03.546
<i>Sorry, kids.</i>

00:07:04.713 --> 00:07:06.946
(snarling)

00:07:06.946 --> 00:07:10.080
Crowww!

00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:18.680
(whimpering)

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.713
He did not deserve that.

00:07:20.713 --> 00:07:22.546
(roaring)

00:07:24.413 --> 00:07:25.280
No!

00:07:29.313 --> 00:07:31.680
It could have easily been me
sealed in this card!

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.313
But you saved me, Crow.

00:07:34.313 --> 00:07:35.446
You saved me.

00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:39.513
(growling)

00:07:39.513 --> 00:07:41.946
Finally, a face
to go with the growl.

00:07:41.946 --> 00:07:44.513
Gong reckons this guy
needs some taming!

00:07:44.513 --> 00:07:46.446
(growling)

00:07:46.446 --> 00:07:47.813
Why'd you do it?!

00:07:50.013 --> 00:07:53.146
Me like to hunt.
And you two up next!

00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:54.580
Bring it on, nature boy!

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.113
That's right!
We're not going nowhere!

00:07:57.113 --> 00:08:01.120
Yeah, we need to K‐O
this BB, A‐S‐A‐P!

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.753
(electricity buzzing)
Huh?

00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:04.953
I forgot my duel disk is kaput!

00:08:04.953 --> 00:08:07.020
No worries, Sylvio,
we got this.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.986
What we do now,
we do for Crow!

00:08:09.986 --> 00:08:12.253
(all)
Let's duel!

00:08:12.253 --> 00:08:16.453
From hand, me now play
Gladiator Beast Laquari, ah!

00:08:16.453 --> 00:08:18.220
(roaring)

00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:25.753
Of all the duelists
I've trained, BB was the best,

00:08:25.753 --> 00:08:27.420
and the most disappointing.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.453
He loved to battle so much,
he'd take on enemies

00:08:29.453 --> 00:08:31.420
and allies alike!

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.053
A true wild child that simply
could not be controlled!

00:08:34.053 --> 00:08:36.286
BB's a savage like no other.

00:08:36.286 --> 00:08:38.420
I disciplined him
over and over.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.986
But with every punishment,
he became more primal!

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:43.286
Now he duels
like a crazed animal,

00:08:43.286 --> 00:08:45.920
with no fear, no mercy!

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.953
At least that's one
good thing about him!

00:08:47.953 --> 00:08:49.853
So, when you bunch
of baby‐faced brats

00:08:49.853 --> 00:08:52.186
face your foes, you better
show no mercy either,

00:08:52.186 --> 00:08:53.920
or you have no place
in my squadron!

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.653
(all)
Right!

00:08:55.653 --> 00:08:59.820
Me now play face‐downs.
BB's turn now over!

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.660
My draw!

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.926
And I won't waste time getting
into the swing of things!

00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:07.726
I'm setting the Pendulum Scale

00:09:07.726 --> 00:09:09.993
with Scale 6
Performapal Shieldrummer

00:09:09.993 --> 00:09:13.160
and Scale 8 Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Unicorn!

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:24.926
Now I can summon as many
Level 7 monsters as I want!

00:09:24.926 --> 00:09:27.326
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:09:27.326 --> 00:09:30.993
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:09:30.993 --> 00:09:34.860
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:09:36.293 --> 00:09:39.160
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.860
(roaring)

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.626
That monster no scare me.

00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:47.093
Is that so?

00:09:47.093 --> 00:09:48.960
Well, let's see
if you still think that

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.926
after you see this attack!

00:09:50.926 --> 00:09:53.293
Go!
Take down Laquari!

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:57.326
Me now play trap,
Gladiator Beast Medallion!

00:09:57.326 --> 00:09:59.900
Gladiator Beasts on field
no can be destroyed.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.800
Not ever!

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.200
But damage me take
become double.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.200
Gladiator Beast swap out

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.900
with another Gladiator Beast
from my deck after battle.

00:10:12.433 --> 00:10:16.366
So come out to play now,
Gladiator Beast Secutor!

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.900
(roaring)

00:10:23.466 --> 00:10:24.666
(thinking)
<i>Man!</i>

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.866
<i>He can swap Gladiator Beasts</i>
<i>in and out.</i>

00:10:26.866 --> 00:10:28.733
<i>That's incredible!</i>

00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:32.600
<i>But still, his new monster</i>
<i>only has 300 defense points.</i>

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.033
<i>It doesn't seem</i>
<i>like it's worth it</i>

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:36.333
<i>taking double the damage</i>
<i>for that.</i>

00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:38.400
<i>If I don't figure out</i>
<i>what he's up to soon,</i>

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.100
<i>then we're in</i>
<i>big trouble.</i>

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.933
Gong, let's do this!

00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:49.766
Gong draws!

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:53.166
Just like Yuya, Gong will
now set the Pendulum Scale,

00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:56.033
with Scale 1
Superheavy Samurai General Jade

00:10:56.033 --> 00:11:00.500
and Scale 8 Superheavy Samurai
General Coral!

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.940
Now, Gong can summon
as many monsters as Gong wants

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.906
between Level 2 and 7!

00:11:05.906 --> 00:11:07.606
And here they come!

00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:10.340
First up,
Gong will play...

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.806
The Tuner Monster
Superheavy Samurai Battleball!

00:11:14.806 --> 00:11:18.573
Then, Superheavy Samurai
Soulfire Suit!

00:11:18.573 --> 00:11:22.306
Next, Superheavy
Samurai Prepped Defense!

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:26.973
(student)
Whoa!

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:28.840
Three monsters
just like that?

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.140
Huh...

00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:34.273
And now, Gong's Battleball
will tune with Soulfire Suit

00:11:34.273 --> 00:11:36.873
and with Prepped Defense

00:11:36.873 --> 00:11:38.773
to make the superheaviest
samurai of 'em all!

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:48.506
Gong Synchro Summons

00:11:48.506 --> 00:11:52.040
Superheavy Samurai
Stealth Ninja!

00:11:57.773 --> 00:11:59.740
Hey Gong, be careful.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.746
I think BB's up
to something bad,

00:12:01.746 --> 00:12:03.513
I just don't know what
that bad is yet.

00:12:03.513 --> 00:12:05.413
Well, Yuya, Gong don't like

00:12:05.413 --> 00:12:08.280
to be kept in the dark,
so Gong's gonna find out,

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.980
because Superheavy Samurai
Stealth Ninja can attack him

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.613
even while it's in
defense mode.

00:12:12.613 --> 00:12:14.180
Me not worried.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.146
Go ahead and attack
Gladiator Beast,

00:12:16.146 --> 00:12:18.913
'cause Gladiator
Beast Medallion prevents you

00:12:18.913 --> 00:12:21.680
from being able to destroy
Gladiator monster.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.946
Who said Gong
was attacking your monster?

00:12:23.946 --> 00:12:26.546
By cutting Gong's
Ninja attack points in half,

00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:28.146
it can attack you directly.

00:12:31.313 --> 00:12:33.046
What a move!

00:12:33.046 --> 00:12:34.980
Way to maneuver around
BB's roadblock, Gong!

00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:38.513
Me now using second trap!

00:12:38.513 --> 00:12:40.946
Gladiator Beast Valor, activate!

00:12:40.946 --> 00:12:44.080
Your Superheavy Samurai
Stealth Ninja now forced

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.613
to attack my Gladiator Beast
instead of me!

00:12:46.613 --> 00:12:48.480
Say what?

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.080
And you still
can't destroy my monster!

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.980
(growls)
Gong's not pleased

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.380
he couldn't deal him
any damage!

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.253
Gong thought he had him.

00:13:01.653 --> 00:13:03.453
How utterly pathetic.

00:13:03.453 --> 00:13:05.420
Those weak moves won't work

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.953
against the battle‐tested
techniques of my Battle Beast.

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:10.020
You thought you were going
to hurt me,

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.153
but with attack, you put
yourself in worse position.

00:13:13.153 --> 00:13:16.086
Since Gladiator Beast
Secutor battled,

00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:19.420
me allowed to summon two more
Gladiator Beasts from deck.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.386
Gladiator Beast Augustus!

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.920
And Gladiator Beast Murmillo!

00:13:27.953 --> 00:13:30.220
One Gladiator Beast
was tough enough,

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.286
but now Beast has three?

00:13:32.853 --> 00:13:35.920
And Augustus' special ability

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.353
lets me summon another
Gladiator Beast from hand.

00:13:41.753 --> 00:13:44.986
Uh oh,
another Gladiator Beast?

00:13:44.986 --> 00:13:47.620
Me now summon second Murmillo
to field!

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.586
(shrieks)

00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:50.453
(snarls)

00:13:51.786 --> 00:13:55.653
And by summoning
Gladiator Beast Murmillo,

00:13:55.653 --> 00:13:58.786
its special ability destroy
one of your monsters.

00:13:58.786 --> 00:14:03.026
Monster me want
to destroy is... Odd‐Eyes!

00:14:05.093 --> 00:14:07.460
Me like when monster
go kaboom,

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.626
but me like this
much, much more!

00:14:09.626 --> 00:14:12.293
Me activates trap card
Thumbs Down!

00:14:12.293 --> 00:14:16.126
Your card go poof,
squish your points down 500.

00:14:16.126 --> 00:14:19.060
(screaming)

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.860
Second Murmillo,
destroy Gong Ninja.

00:14:23.626 --> 00:14:27.460
And just like partner,
your life points squished down!

00:14:31.293 --> 00:14:32.726
(grunting)

00:14:32.726 --> 00:14:35.960
Ah, if only my Duel Disk
wasn't broken.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.993
I'd turn this whole duel
around in a jiffy.

00:14:38.993 --> 00:14:42.860
Hmph, Gong wanted
to find out BB's strategy,

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.260
but now Gong super sorry
he actually found out.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.526
Gong ends his turn.

00:14:47.526 --> 00:14:49.493
But one good thing.

00:14:49.493 --> 00:14:52.993
When a special ability goes
and destroys my Stealth Ninja,

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:56.026
Gong can resummon it
from the graveyard!

00:14:56.026 --> 00:15:00.400
Gladiator Murmillo
go bye‐bye, return to deck.

00:15:02.966 --> 00:15:06.500
You lost your Odd‐Eyes.
Gong'll make it up to you.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.733
No sweat!
We're still in this.

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:12.333
And now,
me turn to draw!

00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:14.733
Me can return three cards
to deck

00:15:14.733 --> 00:15:18.366
to Fusion Summon
with no using Polymerization.

00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:19.066
What?

00:15:20.433 --> 00:15:22.866
Like supreme predator,
me done it again‐‐

00:15:22.866 --> 00:15:25.766
snuck up
and caught you unaware!

00:15:25.766 --> 00:15:28.266
You suffer for it now!

00:15:28.266 --> 00:15:31.700
Me fuse Gladiator Beast
Augustor, Murmillo and Secutor

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.600
to make predator.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.066
Me Fusion Summon
Gladiator Beast Andabata!

00:15:39.933 --> 00:15:41.800
(roars)

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.200
When Andabata is summoned,
me is allowed to summon

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.966
another Fusion Monster.

00:15:48.966 --> 00:15:51.966
Me choose Gladiator Beast
Gyzarus!

00:15:54.833 --> 00:15:57.000
(roars)

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.006
(snarls)
Two cards on field go kaplooey!

00:16:01.006 --> 00:16:05.373
Me like when Gyzarus shoot
laser blasts and destroy.

00:16:06.973 --> 00:16:08.206
(gasps)

00:16:08.206 --> 00:16:09.906
Now, say goodbye

00:16:09.906 --> 00:16:13.773
to Stealth Ninja
and Shieldrummer!

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:15.673
(laughing)

00:16:15.673 --> 00:16:18.740
Thumbs Down now shock
with 500 damage points

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.806
for each monster destroyed.

00:16:24.706 --> 00:16:27.273
Not only do we have a mess
of Gladiator Beasts

00:16:27.273 --> 00:16:28.840
that we have
to deal with, Gong,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.973
his combo is wrecking
our life points too.

00:16:30.973 --> 00:16:34.040
If they don't figure out
a way to break his combo,

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.073
it's game over for good!

00:16:39.206 --> 00:16:42.106
You no stand chance
against me!

00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:45.006
Who will me pick to attack?

00:16:45.006 --> 00:16:47.273
(thinking)
Man, the only way
out of this mess

00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:48.773
<i>is to get an Action Card.</i>

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.640
(gasps)

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.106
<i>But Gong can't get one 'cause</i>
<i>his Heavystrong dueling</i>
<i>style</i>

00:16:54.106 --> 00:16:55.740
<i>won't let him</i>
<i>take a step.</i>

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.673
<i>So, I need BB</i>
<i>to focus on me!</i>

00:16:57.673 --> 00:16:59.740
Hey, Wild Kingdom,

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.713
why'd they let you out
of the zoo, good behavior?

00:17:01.713 --> 00:17:03.446
Chill, Yuya!

00:17:03.446 --> 00:17:05.513
Yeah, don't rattle
this guy's cage!

00:17:05.513 --> 00:17:08.846
I pick Gyzarus attacks you!

00:17:22.046 --> 00:17:23.713
Aaah!

00:17:23.713 --> 00:17:24.680
(grunts)

00:17:27.013 --> 00:17:30.213
Man, that Action Card
might have changed

00:17:30.213 --> 00:17:32.580
this whole duel
had Yuya grabbed it.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.113
And he was so close too,
but now it's too late.

00:17:36.113 --> 00:17:39.946
Oh, no.
Poor Yuya.

00:17:39.946 --> 00:17:41.513
Me not done yet.

00:17:41.513 --> 00:17:44.013
Gyzarus returns
to Extra Deck,

00:17:44.013 --> 00:17:47.013
and Andabata gains
its attack points!

00:17:49.913 --> 00:17:52.513
So, now it has
3,400 attack points?

00:17:52.513 --> 00:17:54.780
Not good.
That's enough attack points

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.646
to defeat either
Yuya or Gong!

00:17:56.646 --> 00:17:58.280
Who do me take down?

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.053
(roars)

00:18:00.053 --> 00:18:01.720
Look out!

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.220
Huh, you make second go
for that Action Card?

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.753
Fine, me finish you first!

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:08.620
Attack!

00:18:11.853 --> 00:18:13.620
(gasping)

00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:17.753
(roars)

00:18:17.753 --> 00:18:19.320
(gasps)

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.153
(roars)

00:18:21.153 --> 00:18:25.020
(grunts)
Gong's got your back, Yuya!

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.020
Gong activates
the Action Spell Benkei Guard

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.653
to summon a Benkei Token.

00:18:29.653 --> 00:18:31.653
And your monster
is forced to attack

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.620
this indestructible Token
instead of Yuya!

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.053
Oh no! Gong!

00:18:41.486 --> 00:18:43.320
I must be dreaming.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.186
Gong actually moved
in a duel!

00:18:45.186 --> 00:18:46.920
I can't believe it.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.853
You gave up your Heavystrong
style of dueling

00:18:48.853 --> 00:18:50.753
to save me.

00:18:50.753 --> 00:18:53.420
And Gong wouldn't have it
any other way, Yuya.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.320
Don't you worry
about Gong, old friend.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.486
Gong owes you for all the times
you've saved Gong's hide.

00:18:59.486 --> 00:19:02.093
Just now you think
you help friend out?

00:19:02.093 --> 00:19:03.426
You only make things badder!

00:19:03.426 --> 00:19:06.426
Andabata return to Deck,

00:19:06.426 --> 00:19:10.260
and two new Gladiator Beasts
show up in place.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.060
These...
Gladiator Beast Murmillo

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.960
and Bestiari!

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.960
Yuya think life points
all safe from the hunt

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.960
because Token can't
be destroyed in battle.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.826
But Token not safe
from special ability.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.726
Special abilities
can't destroy it either!

00:19:27.726 --> 00:19:29.426
Face it, BB,

00:19:29.426 --> 00:19:31.893
Yuya is no longer in season
for you to hunt!

00:19:31.893 --> 00:19:33.960
From here on out,
Gong's your prey!

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.360
You always got my back.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.293
(laughing)
Me like good laugh!

00:19:39.293 --> 00:19:41.493
There are other ways
me get to Yuya!

00:19:41.493 --> 00:19:45.593
Bestiari ability
destroy Odd‐Eyes Unicorn!

00:19:45.593 --> 00:19:47.660
And when your card goes boom,

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.526
Thumbs Down cause life points
to go boom too!

00:19:50.526 --> 00:19:52.260
Things not look good
for you, Yuya!

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.693
Aaah!

00:19:56.693 --> 00:19:59.593
(grunts)

00:19:59.593 --> 00:20:03.566
BB, pick on somebody
your own size, ya mangy mutt!

00:20:03.566 --> 00:20:08.300
(growling)
Me no take order from anyone!

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.333
Me can return Bestiari
and Murmillo to deck

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:12.800
to fuse together!

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.300
Me now bring back
bestest Gladiator Beast!

00:20:19.766 --> 00:20:24.766
Me Fusion Summon
Gladiator Beast Gyzarus!

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.900
Gyzarus, destroy Gong
two Pendulum monsters.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.833
Oh no, Gong!
No, not his monsters!

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:35.300
(gasps)

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.133
Because of Thumbs Down
trap card,

00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:42.266
life points get to go away.

00:20:42.266 --> 00:20:45.766
So, Gong now gonna go
goodbye to duel!

00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:51.300
Aah!

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.133
It can't be!

00:20:55.133 --> 00:20:56.500
Gong! Oh no!

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.540
Yuya, Gong knows
you will win

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.873
and save us all.

00:21:16.873 --> 00:21:18.773
(groaning)

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.040
You will make good card.

00:21:26.773 --> 00:21:27.973
No, don't do it!

00:21:31.673 --> 00:21:32.506
(grunting)
