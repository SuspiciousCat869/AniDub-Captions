WEBVTT

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.066
(Z‐Arc laughing)

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.933
None of you will stop me,
the almighty Z‐Arc,

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.033
from conquering
every dimension!

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:10.266
Every one of you
have failed so far,

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.666
and so shall you two fools!

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.000
(Sylvio)
Hey! You may be right
about Crow,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.466
but how dare you call
the great Sylvio a fool!

00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.433
The Yuya I know
would never say that!

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:22.733
(Z‐Arc chuckles)

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:26.166
You've got spirit, but you can't
win duels with spirit.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.766
You have to win it with cards,
skill, and strength,

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.766
and I have
the best of them all!

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.600
And in case
you don't believe me...

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.333
Here's a taste of my power!

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.700
I use my special ability

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.433
to summon two Supreme King
Dragons from my Extra Deck

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.433
in Defense Mode, strengthening
my grip over this duel

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:45.066
before you even draw
your first card!

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:48.700
Return to me, my Supreme King
Dragon Darkwurms!

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.800
And three more facedown cards

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.900
will further tighten my grip
on this duel!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.700
Why the long faces?

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.340
You're the one
who challenged me.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.840
I wasn't the one
who challenged you.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.973
But truth be told, I would have
dueled you eventually anyway,

00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:09.906
because nothing gives me
as much pleasure

00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:12.340
as watching
you peasants squirm!

00:02:17.046 --> 00:02:19.479
Our father
wants to duel Z‐Arc?

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.446
Are you certain, Riley?

00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:23.780
Yeah, that's what Ray
is telling me,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.213
using the same
four cards

00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:26.580
that she used
to defeat Z‐Arc.

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:33.313
He thinks that since
he got us into this mess,

00:02:33.313 --> 00:02:35.213
he's the one
who has to take us out.

00:02:35.213 --> 00:02:38.980
But it's too dangerous!

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.846
I know you and Dad don't
really see eye‐to‐eye,

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:43.380
but he's still our dad!

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.380
We can't let anything
happen to him!

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.513
In the end,
he's still family,

00:02:49.513 --> 00:02:52.446
and family's supposed to
love and help each other,

00:02:52.446 --> 00:02:54.013
and buy each other
ice cream!

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:55.713
Like Yuya and his dad!

00:02:55.713 --> 00:02:58.213
Dimensions couldn't
keep them apart!

00:02:58.213 --> 00:03:00.180
Like Yuya...

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.753
and his father.

00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:04.686
Help him, Declan.

00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:07.920
And then maybe
we can become
a real family again.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.820
All right, Riley.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.286
I'll handle this,
don't worry.

00:03:12.286 --> 00:03:16.220
Declan!
Ahh! Huh?

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.520
Z‐Arc, you think
you'll rule the world?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.386
Well, the Sylvio 's here to
dethrone you once and for all!

00:03:21.386 --> 00:03:23.053
Yup, I'm gonna
enjoy kickin' his keister!

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:26.820
Huh!
I draw!

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.586
Hey, not fair,
I wanted to go first!

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.520
Ahh!

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.453
Sorry, Sylvio,
but why don't you sit back

00:03:32.453 --> 00:03:34.786
and watch
as I close this show?

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:36.186
Because I'm not just fighting

00:03:36.186 --> 00:03:38.253
to save Yuya
or these dimensions.

00:03:38.253 --> 00:03:41.120
I'm fighting for my family
back in New Domino City!

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.086
To start things off,
I summon the Tuner Monster

00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:47.853
Blackwing Kochi
the Daybreak!

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:49.986
And this bird can invite

00:03:49.986 --> 00:03:53.053
Blackwing Gladius the Midnight
Sun to join its flock!

00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:55.786
(cawing)

00:03:55.786 --> 00:03:58.253
Do you have any idea
how long it took

00:03:58.253 --> 00:04:00.386
for my dimension
to finally get peace?

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.460
For my jackals
to not have to worry about

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.693
when they're gonna get
their next meal?

00:04:04.693 --> 00:04:06.860
And you're just gonna
come here and mess it all up?

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.593
Like some
interdimensional demolisher?

00:04:09.593 --> 00:04:12.160
The Yuya I know
wouldn't want this either,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.260
and if he turned
into a freakazoid like you,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.493
I know he'd want me
to stop him!

00:04:16.493 --> 00:04:19.493
So like Yuya says,
I'm gonna swing into action!

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:21.793
Level 4 Kochi the Daybreak

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:25.193
will tune Level 3 Gladius
the Midnight Sun!

00:04:28.593 --> 00:04:30.126
Get set for a monster

00:04:30.126 --> 00:04:34.293
that's gonna make it
rain with pain!

00:04:34.293 --> 00:04:36.393
I Synchro Summon!

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:37.959
Spread your wings,

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:40.860
Assault Blackwing
Raikiri the Rain Shower!

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.926
(both)
Hurray!

00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:43.826
That's Crow's
best monster!

00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:45.326
That ain't good!

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:46.860
You shouldn't have
Synchro Summoned.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.660
He'll use your own move
against you!

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.593
This is bad, Crow!

00:04:50.593 --> 00:04:52.560
Since you Synchro Summoned,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.660
I can Synchro Summon
a monster of my own!

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.260
So thank you,
oh, so very much!

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.966
I tribute my two Supreme King
Dragon Darkwurms!

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:06.133
Now rise again...
(roars)

00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:09.600
Supreme King Dragon
Clear Wing!

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.033
Never ever forget

00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:13.633
that I'm always
five steps ahead of you!

00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:15.633
By summoning Clear Wing,

00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:18.800
your Raikiri is
automatically destroyed!

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.933
Looks like you swung straight
to the dirt heap!

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:25.300
Raikiri is‐‐
Big deal!

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.700
This isn't over!

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.800
From my hand,
I activate the spell

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.633
Black Feather Illusion!

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:32.766
I have to negate
its special abilities,

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:35.700
but I can bring Raikiri
back from my graveyard!

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.200
(shouting)

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.500
And Raikiri's ready
to attack again!

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.700
(yelling)

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.433
(all)
That's the way to go, Crow!

00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:48.766
Time for take two,
Raikiri!

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:52.033
Attack Clear Wing!

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:54.200
(roars)

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.200
Poor Crow, he doesn't know
that Clear Wing destroys

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.866
any monster it battles
once per turn.

00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:01.406
Go ahead and attack me,
you foolish fool!

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:03.640
(Raikiri and Clear Wing
roaring)

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.873
Go ahead and attack me,
you foolish fool!

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.740
(Raikiri and Clear Wing
roaring)

00:06:19.173 --> 00:06:22.173
You think I wasn't
prepared for this?

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.606
And now from my hand,
I activate the spell

00:06:24.606 --> 00:06:26.206
Black Feather Reversal!

00:06:29.073 --> 00:06:32.073
Instead of taking damage
when you destroyed my monster,

00:06:32.073 --> 00:06:34.640
I get to summon a Blackwing
from my Extra Deck

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.073
whose attack points are equal
to the damage I would've taken!

00:06:38.073 --> 00:06:39.940
C'mon out,
Assault Blackwing...

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.140
Chidori the Rain Sprinkling!

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.540
And Chidori
the Rain Sprinkling

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.606
gains 300 extra attack points

00:06:48.606 --> 00:06:51.506
for every Blackwing
in my graveyard.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.673
Chidori, attack Clear Wing!

00:06:55.673 --> 00:06:57.973
And this time, Z‐Arc,
you can't stop this attack!

00:06:57.973 --> 00:06:59.846
(roaring)

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.580
(roars)

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.580
(all)
He did it!

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.980
You may have destroyed
my monster,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.146
but Supreme King Gate Zero's
Pendulum ability

00:07:11.146 --> 00:07:14.013
prevents you
from dealing me any damage.

00:07:14.013 --> 00:07:16.446
Nice, but not nice enough.

00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:17.980
Oh, yeah?

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.313
Then I should do
something about that!

00:07:20.313 --> 00:07:23.480
I banish Black Feather
Illusion from my graveyard!

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.313
It stops Supreme
King Gate Zero's ability,

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:28.746
which means....
you're still gonna take

00:07:28.746 --> 00:07:30.213
a thousand points
of damage!

00:07:32.946 --> 00:07:34.980
I can't believe
Crow did it.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.880
He actually dealt
damage to Z‐Arc.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.713
That makes Gong
super impressed!

00:07:39.713 --> 00:07:41.913
Congratulations!

00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:45.213
All that work for just
a mere 1,000 points of damage.

00:07:45.213 --> 00:07:46.680
But you're now
about to find out

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.513
that it wasn't worth it!

00:07:48.513 --> 00:07:51.413
By activating the trap
Supreme Faceoff,

00:07:51.413 --> 00:07:53.480
your Chidori
the Rain Sprinkling

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.213
is forced to go
on the attack again!

00:07:56.213 --> 00:07:58.346
And there's nothing
you can do to stop it!

00:07:58.346 --> 00:07:59.946
Attack?

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.486
But there's only one
target left out there.

00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:03.053
And that's Z‐Arc.

00:08:03.053 --> 00:08:04.453
And Z‐Arc is stronger
than Chidori.

00:08:04.453 --> 00:08:05.620
This isn't good.

00:08:13.353 --> 00:08:15.220
(Crow groaning)

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.320
And to make matters
worse for you,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.920
since I destroyed
your monster,

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.586
I now get to summon

00:08:20.586 --> 00:08:23.053
two Supreme King Dragons
from my Extra Deck!

00:08:23.053 --> 00:08:26.320
Return, my Supreme King
Dragon Darkwurms!

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.286
Well, you know what, Z‐Arc?
Two can play at that game!

00:08:29.286 --> 00:08:31.820
When my Chidori is destroyed,

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.986
I can resurrect Raikiri
from my graveyard!

00:08:34.986 --> 00:08:37.553
(shouts)

00:08:37.553 --> 00:08:39.386
And guess what?

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:40.986
Raikiri's special ability

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:43.253
lets me destroy one card
on your field

00:08:43.253 --> 00:08:45.320
for every Blackwing on mine!

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.620
Ha!
What a useful effect,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.586
if my Supreme King Z‐Arc
wasn't immune to it, that is!

00:08:51.586 --> 00:08:54.920
You think you got it
all figured out, don't ya?

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.386
Yeah, you got skills,

00:08:56.386 --> 00:08:58.120
maybe the best
I've ever faced.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.586
But as Yuya taught me,
skills and strategy

00:08:59.586 --> 00:09:01.426
are only half of dueling.

00:09:01.426 --> 00:09:03.760
The other half, it's about
having a good time.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.260
What's the point of dueling

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.926
if all you care
about is winning,

00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:08.526
if you aren't having
any fun?

00:09:08.526 --> 00:09:10.160
Man, I'd hate to
live like that,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.926
and I grew up
in the slums!

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.026
I'd rather be
stuck there forever

00:09:14.026 --> 00:09:15.926
than live the rest of my life
not having any fun.

00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:17.693
Quiet!

00:09:17.693 --> 00:09:19.460
You only say that
because you're no winner!

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.926
Whoa, careful!

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:22.126
Looks like you
struck a nerve

00:09:22.126 --> 00:09:23.893
with poor widdle
Z‐Arcky, Crow.

00:09:23.893 --> 00:09:25.526
Maybe so.

00:09:25.526 --> 00:09:27.926
And, Z‐Arc, even if
I have fun dueling,

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:29.493
I'm still trying to win!

00:09:29.493 --> 00:09:30.993
So get yourself
ready to lose!

00:09:30.993 --> 00:09:32.826
Grr!

00:09:32.826 --> 00:09:35.026
I use Raikiri's
special ability

00:09:35.026 --> 00:09:37.193
to destroy
Supreme Faceoff!

00:09:37.193 --> 00:09:38.960
(shouting)

00:09:41.926 --> 00:09:44.760
But this trap prevents you
from destroying my card.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.193
All your talk and you have
nothing to show for it!

00:09:47.193 --> 00:09:49.493
Yeah, that may be true
for right now,

00:09:49.493 --> 00:09:51.926
but that doesn't mean
I can't change things later,

00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:53.793
so don't think
I'm just gonna sit back

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:56.926
and let you win
this duel, cause I'm not!

00:09:56.926 --> 00:09:59.260
I've done
all I can this turn.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.500
You think you can handle
things from here, Sylvio?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.433
Who do you think
you're talking to?

00:10:04.433 --> 00:10:07.200
When the universe needs saving,
you can depend on Sylvio

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.566
to save the day,
month and year!

00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:13.233
Okay, I'm now I am worried
vee are going to lose.

00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:15.666
(Tate)
Yeah, where's Yuya
when you need him?

00:10:15.666 --> 00:10:18.033
I don't know,
but Sylvio's all we got!

00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:21.000
So please try not to
embarrass yourself!

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I know you got a front row seat
and are watching this, Yuya.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.166
So watch me strut my stuff!

00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:28.900
It's showtime!
Ha!

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:33.533
(Sylvio)
It's showtime!

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:35.400
I set the Pendulum Scale

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.966
with Scale 1
Abyss Actor Evil Heel

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:42.200
and Scale 8
Abyss Actor Funky Comedian!

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.400
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.766
all at the same time!

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:50.466
I Pendulum Summon.

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:53.000
Monsters, emerge!

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.200
Allow me to introduce
Abyss Actor Superstar,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.400
the dangerous Abyss Actor
Wild Hope,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.506
and the wickedly talented
Abyss Actor Leading Lady!

00:11:01.506 --> 00:11:04.273
Remember, no photographs
or pics until later.

00:11:04.273 --> 00:11:06.073
They have a show to
perform first!

00:11:06.073 --> 00:11:06.906
(Z‐Arc laughing)
Huh?

00:11:06.906 --> 00:11:08.206
Why don't I introduce

00:11:08.206 --> 00:11:10.240
a new cast member of my own?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.473
A special Pendulum monster,
in fact!

00:11:12.473 --> 00:11:14.573
No way!
Pendulum?!

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:16.306
It seems while I slumbered,

00:11:16.306 --> 00:11:18.840
the world learned
a new summoning technique.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.073
But I didn't just learn it,
I've mastered it!

00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:25.006
By tributing my two
Supreme King Dragon Darkwurms,

00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:27.140
I can summon
a Pendulum Monster!

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.406
Grr‐argh!

00:11:29.406 --> 00:11:31.606
Turn up the fear,

00:11:31.606 --> 00:11:34.273
Supreme King Dragon Odd‐Eyes!

00:11:34.273 --> 00:11:36.306
(roaring)

00:11:39.306 --> 00:11:40.973
Isn't that
Yuya's Odd‐Eyes?

00:11:40.973 --> 00:11:43.540
How does the baddie
have Yuya's dragon?

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.906
That may look like
Yuya's dragon,

00:11:44.906 --> 00:11:46.573
but it's
definitely not!

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:48.006
Yeah, it's like
he put Odd‐Eyes

00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:49.806
through an evil
copy machine.

00:11:49.806 --> 00:11:53.073
Let's hope Sylvio
has a plan.

00:11:53.073 --> 00:11:55.606
You Pendulum Summoned
just like me?

00:11:55.606 --> 00:11:57.940
It never occurred to me
I was your role model.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.906
But here's something
you can't copy!

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:02.013
I can use Abyss Actor's
special ability

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:04.913
to add Abyss Script Rise
of the Abyss King to my hand!

00:12:04.913 --> 00:12:06.780
Ah‐ha!

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.880
No, you can't!

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.080
I can use my special ability
to destroy that script!

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.280
(thunder)

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.646
Looks like someone's
not a fan of the <i>theater.</i>

00:12:17.646 --> 00:12:19.380
Enough of your silliness!

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.780
Too bad, I'm just
getting started.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.413
Here's another script
for your perusal.

00:12:23.413 --> 00:12:26.080
The spell Abyss Script
Abysstainment!

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.480
By tributing
my Leading Lady,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.080
I can retrieve Rise of
the Abyss King from my graveyard

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.146
and place it facedown
on my field.

00:12:34.146 --> 00:12:36.880
I placed it on my field
and not in my hand

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.813
so you wouldn't be able
to destroy it.

00:12:39.813 --> 00:12:41.580
Grr!

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.846
Next, I activate Abyss Script
Rise of the Abyss King!

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:48.246
Since I have two types
of Abyss Actors on my field,

00:12:48.246 --> 00:12:50.246
I'm allowed to destroy
two of your cards,

00:12:50.246 --> 00:12:52.880
so bon voyage...

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.780
to Supreme King Z‐Arc and
Supreme King Dragon Odd‐Eyes!

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.513
How about not!

00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:01.086
Supreme Faceoff prevents you

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:03.420
from destroying
any of my Dragons!

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.820
Guess again.
Huh?

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.820
The thing is,
actors are really

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.386
protective of their roles.

00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:10.720
It's a tough business.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.286
So when I have a Level 7
Abyss Actor on my field,

00:13:13.286 --> 00:13:16.120
you're not allowed to do
anything to stop my spell!

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.486
It's bye‐byes
for Z‐Arc and Odd‐Eyes.

00:13:18.486 --> 00:13:19.986
No way!
He did it!

00:13:19.986 --> 00:13:24.453
Sylvio beat Z‐Arc!

00:13:24.453 --> 00:13:26.153
Yeah!

00:13:26.153 --> 00:13:27.753
What can I say?

00:13:27.753 --> 00:13:30.186
Except that I'm the best
in the galaxy.

00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:33.553
(Z‐Arc laughing)

00:13:33.553 --> 00:13:36.386
I think there was
a flaw in your plan!

00:13:36.386 --> 00:13:38.586
(continues laughing)

00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:40.353
No way.

00:13:40.353 --> 00:13:42.420
Yes way!

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.520
You see my Odd‐Eyes's
special ability

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.420
stopped us
from being destroyed!

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.286
Well, that can't be
Yuya Odd‐Eyes.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.220
It never had
that special ability.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.320
See? I told ya
something was fishy.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.720
This totally stinks.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.520
Then where's
the real Odd‐Eyes?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.053
And where's Yuya?

00:13:57.053 --> 00:13:58.853
Hmm.

00:13:58.853 --> 00:14:00.626
Well, that sure didn't
go as planned.

00:14:00.626 --> 00:14:02.560
But what show does?

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.626
I mean, there are always kinks
to work out.

00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:08.493
But Sylvio always a plan
for any setbacks.

00:14:08.493 --> 00:14:11.493
By activating the spell
Abyss Script Abysstainment,

00:14:11.493 --> 00:14:13.393
I can tribute
my Abyss Script Wild Hope,

00:14:13.393 --> 00:14:15.926
which I'll do right now.

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:17.593
Then I can retrieve
Rise of the Abyss King

00:14:17.593 --> 00:14:19.360
from my graveyard
and activate it!

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.460
Ah‐ha!

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.260
And it says in this script
that you'll be destroyed, Z‐Arc,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.293
so nice knowin' ya!

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.760
And thanks to Sylvio's
Abyss Actor Superstar,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.693
you can't activate
Supreme Faceoff!

00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:37.493
And Odd‐Eyes already used
its special ability,

00:14:37.493 --> 00:14:40.093
so it can't save
Z‐Arc neither!

00:14:40.093 --> 00:14:42.193
(laughter)

00:14:42.193 --> 00:14:44.693
Do I look
the least bit worried?

00:14:48.193 --> 00:14:51.926
You can never destroy me!

00:14:51.926 --> 00:14:54.626
Not as long as your monsters
that I destroyed

00:14:54.626 --> 00:14:56.226
are protecting me.

00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:57.660
It can't be!

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.693
He's using our monsters
against us!

00:14:59.693 --> 00:15:01.066
Isn't that just great?

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:04.100
As long as Fusion,
Synchro, and Xyz Monsters

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.466
are in your graveyards,
I can't be harmed!

00:15:06.466 --> 00:15:10.466
Everything we've done
has all been for nothing.

00:15:10.466 --> 00:15:12.366
It's worse.

00:15:12.366 --> 00:15:14.766
We actually helped him.

00:15:14.766 --> 00:15:18.233
(Professor)
It looks like you could
use some assistance.

00:15:21.366 --> 00:15:22.600
(both)
Look, it's him!

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.166
No way!
The Professor?!

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.600
What's he doing here?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.266
(both)
Leo Akaba.

00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:42.000
(computer voice)
Intrusion penalty,
2,000 lifepoints.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.166
Leo, it's you!

00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:46.633
(all gasp)
Oh, no!

00:15:46.633 --> 00:15:48.033
What is that?

00:15:48.033 --> 00:15:50.966
Oh, ze bad goosepickles
are back!

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:55.733
Oh!

00:15:55.733 --> 00:15:59.066
Whoa! Is that
a floating city?

00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:04.473
Where did that
come from?

00:16:04.473 --> 00:16:06.940
What's going on?
Where are we?

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.573
Look there!

00:16:08.573 --> 00:16:10.506
(Alan)
Hey, it's our buddies!

00:16:12.473 --> 00:16:14.506
They're not trapped
inside cards anymore!

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:16.106
That is so amazing!

00:16:16.106 --> 00:16:18.540
I want to fly too!

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.306
(Skip)
Way things are now,
you might get your wish!

00:16:22.306 --> 00:16:25.173
Z‐Arc... it's been a while.

00:16:25.173 --> 00:16:27.173
Ah, I remember you...

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:29.673
Yes, yes, of course...

00:16:29.673 --> 00:16:32.273
You're the one
who revolutionized dueling

00:16:32.273 --> 00:16:36.006
by making monsters more
realistic than ever before.

00:16:36.006 --> 00:16:38.073
(crowd cheering)

00:16:38.073 --> 00:16:41.506
My Arc technology may have
created realistic monsters,

00:16:41.506 --> 00:16:43.173
but there has never
been a monster

00:16:43.173 --> 00:16:44.773
as horrifically
real as you!

00:16:44.773 --> 00:16:46.506
(Z‐Arc)
Now, now!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.873
I was a normal duelist
like any other,

00:16:48.873 --> 00:16:52.440
but the crowd demanded more
intense, more brutal duels.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.540
I only gave them
what they wanted.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.373
The people did not want
this destruction!

00:16:58.373 --> 00:17:02.546
(crowd)
Z‐Arc! Z‐Arc!
Z‐Arc! Z‐Arc! Z‐Arc!

00:17:02.546 --> 00:17:04.246
(Z‐Arc)
Yes, they did!

00:17:04.246 --> 00:17:06.713
The more I destroyed,
the more they roared!

00:17:06.713 --> 00:17:09.980
The more I won,
the more they cheered my name!

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.380
Victory is everything!

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.480
Victory is the only thing!

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.013
And I will crush everyone
who stands in my way,

00:17:17.013 --> 00:17:20.313
even if it's the creator
of the monsters I wield today!

00:17:20.313 --> 00:17:22.980
You will all fall
for my ultimate victory!

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.046
Starting now!

00:17:25.046 --> 00:17:27.680
I send Supreme Faceoff
to my graveyard

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.380
to force your monsters
to attack me!

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.446
Superstar, no!
You'll be destroyed!

00:17:37.446 --> 00:17:39.746
Yaah!

00:17:39.746 --> 00:17:41.713
Grr!

00:17:47.146 --> 00:17:50.080
Aah! Unh!

00:17:55.313 --> 00:17:57.580
Nice catch.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.086
But who's going to catch you
when Odd‐Eyes' special ability

00:18:00.086 --> 00:18:02.286
doubles the damage you take?

00:18:02.286 --> 00:18:06.020
(both)
Huh?! Aah!

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:09.653
Huh?!
Ahh!

00:18:09.653 --> 00:18:11.520
(both grunting)

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.920
(Z‐Arc)
I guess no one!

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.786
(laughing)

00:18:16.786 --> 00:18:18.186
Z‐Arc!
What?

00:18:18.186 --> 00:18:19.853
I'm the one
who created you,

00:18:19.853 --> 00:18:22.353
so I will be
the one to finish you!

00:18:22.353 --> 00:18:24.186
Oh, really now?

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.386
Back when
the dimensions were one,

00:18:26.386 --> 00:18:28.853
my fearless daughter Ray
ended your brutally
destructive ways

00:18:28.853 --> 00:18:31.386
by confronting you
with four special cards.

00:18:31.386 --> 00:18:34.620
And I have those
very cards in my deck,

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.820
which I shall use to
defeat you once and for all!

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.153
It's my turn.

00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:42.020
And I'll start things off
by activating

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.386
my spell card,
Spirit Collapse!

00:18:44.386 --> 00:18:48.020
By paying 1,000 life points,
I can send my Fusion Monster,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.386
Master Spirit
Tech Force Pendulum Ruler,

00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:54.420
from my extra deck
to my graveyard.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.953
(roars)

00:18:56.953 --> 00:19:01.026
Why would he send more
monsters to the graveyard?

00:19:01.026 --> 00:19:02.793
Maybe the Professor
would be better off

00:19:02.793 --> 00:19:03.926
studying instead
of teaching.

00:19:05.826 --> 00:19:08.726
I fear it's too late
for me to change the past,

00:19:08.726 --> 00:19:11.060
but I can make up
for my mistakes.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:11.726
(Declan)
That's true, Father.

00:19:12.993 --> 00:19:14.326
But you don't have to
do it alone.

00:19:14.326 --> 00:19:16.426
Declan!

00:19:16.426 --> 00:19:18.693
(computer voice)
Intrusion penalty,
2,000 life points.

00:19:18.693 --> 00:19:20.693
Declan?

00:19:20.693 --> 00:19:22.360
We have much to talk about,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.393
but first, let's
take care of business.

00:19:24.393 --> 00:19:26.926
Yes, let's do
just that, Declan.

00:19:26.926 --> 00:19:29.693
(thinking)
And with three Fusion
Monsters now in my graveyard,

00:19:29.693 --> 00:19:32.326
I can play my special cards!

00:19:32.326 --> 00:19:35.393
Z‐Arc, I activate my‐‐

00:19:35.393 --> 00:19:38.060
Stop right there!
You'll do no such thing!

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.326
I activate
my trap Supreme Disdain!

00:19:41.326 --> 00:19:43.960
For every Supreme King
on my field,

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.460
I get to destroy
one card in your hand

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.226
for a total of four cards!

00:19:49.226 --> 00:19:51.493
I think I see someone
riding that dragon.

00:19:51.493 --> 00:19:56.393
I do not see 'zem!
Ohh!

00:19:56.393 --> 00:19:58.626
You're right!
He looks just like Yuya!

00:19:58.626 --> 00:20:01.233
Why is Yuya
fighting against us?

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:03.333
Because he's not Yuya,
it just can't be!

00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:05.133
Looks like you won't get
a chance

00:20:05.133 --> 00:20:08.066
to play your special cards,
and that's terrible!

00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:15.733
Ohh!

00:20:15.733 --> 00:20:18.366
Because for every card
I destroy,

00:20:18.366 --> 00:20:21.366
you take 300 points
of damage...

00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:24.833
Enough to wipe out the rest
of your life points!

00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:28.133
Aah!

00:20:28.133 --> 00:20:30.766
Father, no!

00:20:30.766 --> 00:20:31.966
Unh!

00:20:31.966 --> 00:20:33.666
(grunting)

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:48.933
Hey, is it really you?

00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.800
Ray, right?
