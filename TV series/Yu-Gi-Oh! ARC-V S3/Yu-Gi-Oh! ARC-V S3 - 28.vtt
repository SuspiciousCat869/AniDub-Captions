00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.500
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.666
I am not the one responsible for
inventing ARC technology either,

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.800
because it was originally
invented

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.433
in a world
that no longer exists.

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:18.200
All four dimensions
used to exist as one,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.900
before they were separated.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.733
The monsters generated by
my ARC system produced

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.433
faint, but detectable
vital signs.

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:28.300
But unknowingly,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.900
I had unleashed a force
I couldn't control.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.533
And the trouble
all began with him.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400
This duelist was more exciting

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.366
and fierce than anyone else.

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.133
Z‐ARC!

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.933
When Z‐ARC unleashed his fury

00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:46.433
on the world,
so did his dragons!

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:47.933
(Z‐ARC)
Let us become one

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.466
and challenge
the whole universe!

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.600
Let us merge!

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.500
Reunite!

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.833
Reunite!

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.233
Reunite!

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:00.006
(all)
Reunite as one!

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.206
Z‐ARC was no longer mortal.

00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:09.273
He became Supreme King Z‐ARC!

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:10.873
The days that followed were

00:01:10.873 --> 00:01:13.140
an endless nightmare
of suffering.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.473
His cruelty knew no bounds.

00:01:15.473 --> 00:01:17.240
(screaming)

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.973
I was willing to pay
with my life to stop Z‐ARC.

00:01:23.973 --> 00:01:27.040
But little did I know
that I and the whole universe

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.806
would have to pay an even
steeper price...

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.680
Leo, you said the world was
split into four dimensions,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.313
but you never said
what caused it to happen.

00:02:41.313 --> 00:02:44.446
Was Supreme King Z‐ARC
responsible?

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:47.913
Yusho... let me explain.

00:02:47.913 --> 00:02:51.280
With the combined power
of his four dragons,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.580
Z‐ARC was unstoppable.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.946
Nothing we did
could defeat him.

00:02:57.946 --> 00:03:01.686
But if we couldn't defeat him,
the least we could do

00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:05.753
was try and stop him,
and stop him we did.

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:08.053
You were able to stop him?
But how?

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:10.953
(computer alert)

00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:13.086
Yes, what is it?

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:15.320
<i>Yuya Sakaki escaped from</i>
<i>the doctor's laboratory.</i>

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.986
We can't find him
anywhere. He's gone?

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:19.786
Yuya?

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.486
Must find Yuya...

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:28.820
He's completely
out of control...

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.420
We don't have a moment
to waste, Doctor!

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.486
Bring Zuzu and the other three
girls here immediately!

00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:36.586
We must get started...

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:39.753
(door opening)
(panting)

00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:42.353
It's Yuya!
(gasping)

00:03:42.353 --> 00:03:44.120
It's really you.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.586
Dad!

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:47.186
(laughing)

00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:49.053
You've gotten so big, Yuya.

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:50.586
My boy...

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:52.620
I can't believe
I finally found you!

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.186
Where were you?

00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:55.986
I thought I'd never
see you again.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:59.720
But deep down I knew,
I would some day...

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.726
But I really could use
your help now, Dad.

00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:04.660
They've kidnapped Zuzu!

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.560
Zuzu?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.126
Let your father handle this.

00:04:10.826 --> 00:04:12.126
Leo...

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:13.860
My dear friend Leo,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.560
I don't know what
your ultimate plan is,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.593
but kidnapping
an innocent girl

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:20.926
never puts you on
the right side of history.

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:24.493
So whatever you're up to,
just put an end to it.

00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:26.960
For my sake.
And for my son's sake.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.793
No, Yusho.

00:04:28.793 --> 00:04:32.093
I'm afraid I cannot,
not even for you.

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.459
And especially not
for your son.

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:40.326
Or shall I say,
your so‐called son.

00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:42.460
Quit it with
your mumbo jumbo

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.493
and give us back Zuzu
right now!

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:46.826
But Yuya, tell me...

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:48.960
How can I give her back

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.326
when she shouldn't even exist
in the first place?

00:04:51.326 --> 00:04:53.026
What exactly do you mean?

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.726
(gears whirring)

00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:03.466
Zuzu!

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.933
Celina!

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:07.433
And I think that's Rin!

00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:08.933
Lulu!

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.200
What have you done with them?

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:20.000
Professor...

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I've neutralized them
as ordered.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.266
You let them go right now!

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:27.000
Or you're gonna have
to deal with me!

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.233
Professor, allow me to
eliminate this distraction.

00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:32.400
I can assure you I will stop

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.466
this troublemaking pest
once and for all.

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:37.300
That worm.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.900
Hearing his voice totally
makes my skin crawl.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.900
Like teeth on a chalkboard.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.600
(Yuya)
What do you say
we zip those lips

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.600
and stop this doc
once and for all?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.333
I'm afraid that
there won't be any zipping

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:50.333
or stopping of anyone,
little boy.

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.333
How can you stop me now
when you've failed to do so

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:54.433
a zillion times already?

00:05:54.433 --> 00:05:56.333
I don't recommend

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:59.666
underestimating Yuya Sakaki,
Doctor.

00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:01.973
But I'm not, Professor.

00:06:01.973 --> 00:06:03.840
I'm only speaking the truth.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.106
Why, he's a mere child

00:06:06.106 --> 00:06:09.173
with a cranium the size
of a mollusk,

00:06:09.173 --> 00:06:12.806
possessing nowhere near
my intellectual capacity!

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:14.740
Who else at Duel Academy

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.606
would have been able
to capture these frauleins?

00:06:16.606 --> 00:06:18.473
No one but me.

00:06:18.473 --> 00:06:21.773
Well, me and my parasites,
that is.

00:06:21.773 --> 00:06:25.206
And I will continue to conduct
my experiments against Yuya

00:06:25.206 --> 00:06:29.240
to create the perfect parasite
to fuel our forces!

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.773
Why Professor,
as a fellow scientist,

00:06:32.773 --> 00:06:35.973
you must understand
this pursuit of knowledge.

00:06:35.973 --> 00:06:38.806
To reach the pinnacle
of perfection!

00:06:38.806 --> 00:06:41.540
(Leo)
Yes, I do understand.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.273
But in my pursuit
of perfection,

00:06:44.273 --> 00:06:46.540
my pursuit of giving life,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.006
in creating these
holographic monsters,

00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:52.306
I was the first step
in the rise of Z‐ARC

00:06:52.306 --> 00:06:54.006
and the end of the world,

00:06:54.006 --> 00:06:57.240
and if you follow my mistakes,
then I must stop you.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.840
(Doctor)
W‐what are you doing?

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.213
No! Stop!

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:03.613
(panicking)

00:07:06.613 --> 00:07:08.280
(gasps)
No!

00:07:09.413 --> 00:07:10.546
Zuzu?

00:07:15.113 --> 00:07:17.513
What is this thing?

00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:20.913
Don't know,
but I don't think it's good.

00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:23.146
Yuya?

00:07:23.146 --> 00:07:25.113
Man, Zuzu!

00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:26.513
You're really Zuzu!

00:07:26.513 --> 00:07:28.546
It's been like forever!

00:07:29.846 --> 00:07:30.880
Stay back.

00:07:32.713 --> 00:07:33.813
Zuzu!

00:07:33.813 --> 00:07:36.113
Yuya! Yuya!

00:07:36.113 --> 00:07:37.913
Let us out of here right now!

00:07:37.913 --> 00:07:40.446
Yeah, what's the deal, Leo?
Let us go!

00:07:40.446 --> 00:07:42.946
Don't worry!
You won't be in there for long!

00:07:42.946 --> 00:07:46.213
You got some nerve locking me up
in here, Professor!

00:07:46.213 --> 00:07:48.780
But you never were one
for manners, were you?

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.946
Now, now, Celina.

00:07:50.946 --> 00:07:54.346
You might not realize this,
but I'm doing it your own good.

00:07:54.346 --> 00:07:57.280
Well, actually,
it's for the good of you all.

00:08:01.886 --> 00:08:04.686
(Leo)
When Z‐ARC
annihilated my city,

00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:09.220
the few remaining survivors
believed all hope was lost...

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.053
but I never lost hope.

00:08:14.053 --> 00:08:16.153
Since I created this problem,

00:08:16.153 --> 00:08:19.386
I knew I had to be
the one to solve it.

00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:23.286
So I worked tirelessly
to find a solution.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.486
My research led to dead end
after dead end,

00:08:28.486 --> 00:08:31.586
so eventually
I traveled the world,

00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:36.453
searching for power that could
topple Z‐ARC and his monsters.

00:08:36.453 --> 00:08:39.786
And I found those energies,
in nature.

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:41.786
(bird calling)

00:08:41.786 --> 00:08:45.520
It was so obvious
when I thought about it.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.586
A flower may wilt,
but it will bloom again.

00:08:49.586 --> 00:08:52.686
A tiny bird can migrate
thousands of miles

00:08:52.686 --> 00:08:55.786
and survive
the harshest of winters.

00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:58.420
The whole world,
each living creature

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.160
and organism combined
has limitless strength,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.426
much greater than Z‐ARC
or his dragons.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.893
And all I needed to do
was tap into it,

00:09:10.893 --> 00:09:14.960
infusing the forces of nature
into four cards.

00:09:16.693 --> 00:09:19.493
Four cards to defeat Z‐ARC.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.926
Four cards to end
this nightmare.

00:09:26.526 --> 00:09:31.660
Four cards that I would wield
to fix the problem I'd created.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.626
However...

00:09:37.026 --> 00:09:38.893
Your cards were stolen?

00:09:38.893 --> 00:09:41.426
But why? By who?

00:09:41.426 --> 00:09:44.826
By someone I care more about
than life itself.

00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:47.326
By Ray, my daughter.

00:09:47.326 --> 00:09:50.126
Daughter?
You have a daughter?

00:09:50.126 --> 00:09:52.926
Yes, and I knew
what she was thinking.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:56.026
And I had to stop her.

00:09:56.026 --> 00:09:59.526
Dad, I'm going to stop Z‐ARC,
not you.

00:09:59.526 --> 00:10:02.066
The people need you
to rebuild this city.

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:04.933
Ray, don't be silly.
I created Z‐ARC,

00:10:04.933 --> 00:10:07.166
so I, not you,
will defeat him!

00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:09.766
Now give those cards back.

00:10:09.766 --> 00:10:12.500
I will not let you
risk your life.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.533
I don't want to lose you, Ray.

00:10:14.533 --> 00:10:17.166
And I don't want to
lose you either, Dad!

00:10:31.233 --> 00:10:32.600
Ray!

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.366
(roaring)

00:11:00.806 --> 00:11:02.873
Ray, no!
Don't do this!

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.073
Ray, no...

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:11.673
Those cards contain all
the forces of nature!

00:11:11.673 --> 00:11:13.973
Your body can't withstand
all that energy!

00:11:15.206 --> 00:11:17.340
Stop it, Ray! Please!

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.106
You aren't going to survive!

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.306
Stop it! Stop it now!

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:37.806
Or you will suffer
the consequences!

00:11:50.906 --> 00:11:54.906
When I came to,
I could not believe my eyes.

00:11:54.906 --> 00:11:57.940
It was like the battle
never happened.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.580
Everyone was
having fun dueling,

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.680
except for one
major difference.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.146
No one had any Xyz, Synchro

00:12:06.146 --> 00:12:09.380
or Fusion monsters
because I was in

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.046
what you now know
as the Standard Dimension.

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:15.280
(child)
Uh, hey, pops.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.313
You might want to
think twice about that?

00:12:17.313 --> 00:12:19.313
It doesn't take too kindly
to strangers.

00:12:19.313 --> 00:12:20.546
(Leo)
Uh, sorry.

00:12:20.546 --> 00:12:22.480
Ha, it's cool.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.780
It's just a hologram,
so your hand's safe and sound.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.913
(Leo)
It was almost like I went
technologically back in time,

00:12:28.913 --> 00:12:31.346
to the earlier days
of dueling.

00:12:31.346 --> 00:12:34.680
But with what I instinctively
remembered of my life before,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.146
I was able to improve
the holographic technology

00:12:38.146 --> 00:12:40.980
so that you could once again
touch and feel your monsters...

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.680
As you very well know, Yusho,

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.546
because that was
when we first met.

00:12:49.546 --> 00:12:51.480
I remember...

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.546
because that day kickstarted
my dueltaining career.

00:12:55.546 --> 00:12:58.513
But to think that technology
was from another life.

00:12:58.513 --> 00:13:00.220
Yes, another life,

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.253
another era,
another time and place.

00:13:03.253 --> 00:13:06.486
It was a life where
the dimensions were
united as one.

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:10.420
But when Ray unleashed the power
of the four nature cards,

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.553
she split my one dimension into
four new separate dimensions.

00:13:14.553 --> 00:13:16.786
What do you mean?

00:13:16.786 --> 00:13:20.820
How do you remember
all this when no one else did?

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.720
(Leo)
I didn't, at first.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.320
But I analyzed my memories
to find the truth

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.086
buried deep
within my consciousness.

00:13:29.086 --> 00:13:31.786
As I watched the past
come to life again,

00:13:31.786 --> 00:13:33.886
I realized something...

00:13:33.886 --> 00:13:36.186
something shocking
and amazing.

00:13:38.686 --> 00:13:40.220
If I was still alive,

00:13:41.553 --> 00:13:44.153
then my daughter
must be alive as well.

00:13:44.153 --> 00:13:45.820
Even if she's been split

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.520
into the four girls
standing behind me.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.520
Yes, you four
are my daughter Ray!

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.086
(Yusho)
Those four girls
used to be Ray?

00:13:58.086 --> 00:13:59.820
Inconceivable!

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.093
It may sound
like science‐fiction,

00:14:02.093 --> 00:14:05.926
but my father was always one to
turn science‐fiction into fact.

00:14:07.726 --> 00:14:09.626
Spending all day in your lab,

00:14:09.626 --> 00:14:12.660
you even forgot
to run your own company.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.360
I can tell you mother
was none too happy about that.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.626
I had to learn
what you were working on,

00:14:18.626 --> 00:14:21.393
what drove your obsession.

00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:24.493
And that's how I found
your teleporter.

00:14:24.493 --> 00:14:27.093
So I decided
to pay you a visit.

00:14:36.726 --> 00:14:39.826
And that's how you found
your way here to Duel Academy.

00:14:39.826 --> 00:14:42.293
That's right.
But that's not all I found.

00:14:42.293 --> 00:14:44.326
I found out that my own father

00:14:44.326 --> 00:14:48.093
had no intention of coming home,
back to his own family.

00:14:48.093 --> 00:14:50.460
It's true that I would be
staying in the Fusion Dimension.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.526
But for good reason, Declan.

00:14:52.526 --> 00:14:54.793
What better reason
is there than family?

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.593
There isn't one.

00:14:56.593 --> 00:14:59.126
I stayed there
to save my family.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.166
As I told you,
I knew that Ray

00:15:04.166 --> 00:15:07.133
was still alive somewhere
in one of these dimensions.

00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:09.933
I searched everywhere until...

00:15:09.933 --> 00:15:13.100
I finally found her here
in the Fusion Dimension.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.033
You mean... Celina?

00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:21.800
Yes. That is correct.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.633
Who, me?

00:15:23.633 --> 00:15:26.633
So Celina is Ray?

00:15:26.633 --> 00:15:27.966
That's right.

00:15:27.966 --> 00:15:29.933
Celina is the spitting image

00:15:29.933 --> 00:15:33.166
of my daughter Ray
when she was younger.

00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:36.466
And when I saw her bracelet,
that sealed the deal.

00:15:36.466 --> 00:15:39.500
I was convinced I finally
found my daughter,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.800
for I saw this bracelet
appear on Ray's wrist

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.000
before she split the dimensions
in her battle against Z‐ARC.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.866
But when I analyzed
Celina's mind,

00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:51.666
I found no traces
of Ray's memories.

00:15:51.666 --> 00:15:53.933
That's when I realized

00:15:53.933 --> 00:15:55.700
that I didn't find Ray,

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.933
I had only found
a piece of Ray.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.973
When Ray fought against Z‐ARC

00:16:01.973 --> 00:16:04.106
and split the dimensions
into four,

00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:06.940
she also split
herself into four.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.006
That's why Celina didn't
have Ray's memories.

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:13.540
Because she was only
one piece of the whole.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.840
Finding Celina in
the Fusion Dimension meant

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.006
the other pieces
of Ray existed

00:16:18.006 --> 00:16:20.706
in each of the other
three dimensions.

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:23.406
So then we're all
a piece of Ray?

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:28.573
That means Zuzu
is also Ray!

00:16:31.373 --> 00:16:33.406
(Leo)
Exactly.

00:16:33.406 --> 00:16:35.706
Zuzu is the piece of Ray

00:16:35.706 --> 00:16:38.306
that exists
in the Standard Dimension.

00:16:38.306 --> 00:16:41.440
Celina, the Fusion Dimension.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.973
Lulu, Xyz.

00:16:43.973 --> 00:16:47.006
And Rin from
the Synchro Dimension.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:51.273
My daughter Ray was reborn
as these four girls,

00:16:51.273 --> 00:16:53.006
one existing in each dimension.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.973
So if I'm to bring
my Ray back,

00:16:56.973 --> 00:16:58.973
then I must reunite
the dimensions

00:16:58.973 --> 00:17:02.013
and these girls back into one!

00:17:02.013 --> 00:17:03.580
Bring her back?

00:17:05.413 --> 00:17:09.346
That is why I launched
my ARC Area Project.

00:17:09.346 --> 00:17:12.380
I dispatched my students to
the other dimensions

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.046
with a single mission:
turn people into cards

00:17:16.046 --> 00:17:18.013
so that I could use them

00:17:18.013 --> 00:17:21.413
to reunite the dimensions
back into one.

00:17:21.413 --> 00:17:24.380
And by doing so,
reunite my Ray

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.013
back into one as well.

00:17:27.013 --> 00:17:28.746
Nonsense.

00:17:28.746 --> 00:17:30.813
How can you possibly
reunite the dimensions

00:17:30.813 --> 00:17:33.246
by capturing people in cards?

00:17:33.246 --> 00:17:36.046
That won't make the world
or Ray one again!

00:17:36.046 --> 00:17:38.780
Yes, it will!
And this is how!

00:17:57.446 --> 00:17:59.913
What's that?

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:03.520
(Leo)
This is my newest invention to
reunite the dimensions!

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.053
The Arc Five Reactor!

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.853
(all)
Arc Five Reactor?

00:18:14.153 --> 00:18:17.386
(Leo)
This is my newest invention to
reunite the dimensions!

00:18:17.386 --> 00:18:20.186
The Arc Five Reactor!

00:18:20.186 --> 00:18:22.353
(all)
Arc Five Reactor?

00:18:22.353 --> 00:18:24.720
Reuniting all four dimensions

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.253
requires an immeasurable
amount of energy,

00:18:27.253 --> 00:18:30.686
energy that this reactor can
extract from the life energies

00:18:30.686 --> 00:18:33.620
of the people I've sealed
inside those cards!

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.886
And with the great convergence,

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:39.820
the Standard, Synchro,
Fusion and Xyz Dimensions

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.653
will cease to exist
as they form

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:44.053
back into their original
dimension!

00:18:44.053 --> 00:18:47.086
But that's not all!
When I send the four girls

00:18:47.086 --> 00:18:49.786
into the reactor,
their existence will be erased

00:18:49.786 --> 00:18:52.286
as they reunite into Ray!

00:18:52.286 --> 00:18:54.353
We shall return
to the beginning!

00:18:54.353 --> 00:18:56.320
Back to the origin!

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.786
This is...

00:18:57.786 --> 00:18:59.826
Revival Zero!

00:19:02.426 --> 00:19:04.426
I'm going to be erased?

00:19:04.426 --> 00:19:06.560
He's out of his
pencilgeek mind!

00:19:08.626 --> 00:19:10.926
Every one of those cards
he's sending into that thing

00:19:10.926 --> 00:19:12.993
is someone from my home.

00:19:12.993 --> 00:19:14.560
You can't do this!

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.826
We're not gonna let you do it!

00:19:18.293 --> 00:19:20.226
(whimpering)

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.593
So then this is
what Revival Zero was.

00:19:25.593 --> 00:19:27.893
But in my father's file,

00:19:27.893 --> 00:19:30.060
Celina wasn't
the only image pictured.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.460
So was Yuri.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.726
So if Celina is Ray
of the Fusion Dimension,

00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:37.693
then who's Yuri?

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.293
And Yuya?

00:19:41.293 --> 00:19:43.593
I don't believe it.

00:19:43.593 --> 00:19:47.426
Declan, you must join my side.

00:19:47.426 --> 00:19:50.093
And together,
we must defeat Yuya!

00:19:50.093 --> 00:19:52.226
Defeat Yuya?

00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:54.060
Yes, my son.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.060
I know you've put
the pieces together.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.226
Similar to how Ray was split

00:19:58.226 --> 00:20:01.833
into four individuals,
so was Z‐ARC!

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:05.666
And the piece of Z‐ARC from
the Standard Dimension is Yuya!

00:20:05.666 --> 00:20:08.300
To make certain that
Z‐ARC can never resurrect again,

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.433
we must eliminate him!

00:20:10.433 --> 00:20:13.600
This is the only
logical solution

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.566
to ensure
the safety of our universe!

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.166
Are we really
pieces of Z‐ARC?

00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:24.766
No way,
Yuya's anything but evil.

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:26.733
This is nothing
but a bunch of lies!

00:20:26.733 --> 00:20:29.233
Is it?
Then how do you explain

00:20:29.233 --> 00:20:31.666
how Yuya was able
to combine with Yuto,

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:34.100
Z‐ARC's piece from
the Xyz Dimension?

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.900
I'm resurrecting now!

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.633
(Leo)
And how Z‐ARC's evil influence
made him rage?

00:20:42.633 --> 00:20:46.500
Ah, it seems this truth
has you tongue‐tied.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.766
Hey! You're wrong!
I'm not evil!

00:20:49.766 --> 00:20:52.566
Because I duel to bring
joy to the world,

00:20:52.566 --> 00:20:54.633
at least that's what I hope.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.340
You do, Yuya.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.940
Because I was there,

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.373
and I've seen it
with my own eyes.

00:21:03.373 --> 00:21:05.806
(gasps)
Yeah?

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:08.573
The smiles you bring
to the crowd's faces,

00:21:08.573 --> 00:21:11.373
the sound of joy
in their voices.

00:21:11.373 --> 00:21:13.140
They don't lie.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.306
(cheering)

00:21:15.306 --> 00:21:17.006
Unlike you, Father!

00:21:17.006 --> 00:21:19.540
Your approach to dueling
hurts people.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.440
You wanted to turn
everyone into cards.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.373
That, Father,
is fear, not joy!

00:21:26.373 --> 00:21:28.573
You talk about uniting
the dimensions?

00:21:28.573 --> 00:21:30.373
How can you unite people

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.506
when you break family
and friends apart?

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.106
So no, I'm not
joining you, Father!

00:21:39.106 --> 00:21:40.706
I'm going to stop you!

00:21:42.773 --> 00:21:45.473
And I'm not going to
do it all by myself.

00:21:45.473 --> 00:21:47.840
Yuya and I will
stop you together!

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.773
So you've made
your choice, Declan.

00:21:50.773 --> 00:21:53.206
Unfortunately,
the decision you have made

00:21:53.206 --> 00:21:54.873
is the wrong one, my boy.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.913
But you always were
the stubborn one.

00:22:02.913 --> 00:22:04.546
Very well, then.

00:22:04.546 --> 00:22:07.646
You have given me
no other choice.

00:22:07.646 --> 00:22:12.446
I will put an end to Yuya,
with or without your help!

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.346
<i>Generating</i>
<i>Action Field Crossover.</i>

00:22:23.746 --> 00:22:26.046
(all)
Let's duel!
