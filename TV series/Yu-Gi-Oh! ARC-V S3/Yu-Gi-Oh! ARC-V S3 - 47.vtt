WEBVTT

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.866
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:07.833
Huh?

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.200
It's Duel Academy!

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.866
(Shay)
Yuya...

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:16.366
Lulu and Yuto are no longer
here because of you.

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.700
Therefore,
I will now get my revenge!

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.266
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.766
Nothing will ease my pain...

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.200
but this sure
will feel good!

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.866
If I'm going down,
I'm taking you with me!

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.533
Due to Cross Damage,

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.700
you take the exact
same damage that I do!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.333
Now they're both toast!

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.300
Yuya won?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.033
Yuya, thanks a lot.

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:52.333
Huh?
For what, Shay?

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.000
For giving me hope.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.033
At the end of the duel...

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.666
I looked into your eyes
and saw Yuto.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.106
He's alive.

00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:04.040
Alive within you,
Yuya.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.840
So if he's still here...

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.906
Lulu must be alive, too?

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:10.340
Lulu must be alive, too!

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.073
If you can find a way
to save Zuzu,

00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:13.373
you'll be saving Lulu as well.

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:17.706
Jack Atlas!

00:01:17.706 --> 00:01:21.106
Your dueltaining is
nothing but a joke!

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:24.140
If that's the best you can do,
all of our worlds are doomed!

(Yusho)
That's Jack Atlas.

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:36.446
The one and only.

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:39.380
He may be Yuya's friend
from the Synchro Dimension.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.346
But he's also
a great adversary

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:43.180
that can push Yuya's skills
to the limit.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.913
Ah, I see.

00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:47.013
Well, aren't you the clever one,
Declan ol' boy.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.080
(Jack)
Your dueltaining couldn't
make a hyena smile, Yuya!

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.880
(Sora)
Just ignore him.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.313
Actually, I thought your
dueltaining was off, too.

00:02:57.413 --> 00:02:59.446
You had everything set up

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.486
to summon Dark Rebellion XYZ
Dragon, but you didn't.

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:02.186
Why?

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.620
Because Yuya's a coward,
that's why!

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.420
The last time he was actually
brave enough to summon

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.820
his four special dragons was
when he transformed into Zarc.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.653
So he's worried that Zarc
will awaken again

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:17.586
if he summons them!

00:03:17.586 --> 00:03:20.520
How dare you be scared
of your own cards?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.753
But, Jack...

00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:23.453
"But, Jack" nothing!

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.053
You're no dueltainer
if you're not willing to play

00:03:25.053 --> 00:03:27.053
all the cards in your deck!

00:03:27.053 --> 00:03:28.686
In fact, you're not
even a duelist!

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:31.186
This isn't just about me!

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:33.153
<i>I'm thinking</i>
<i>about Riley, too.</i>

00:03:33.153 --> 00:03:34.586
<i>If I summon</i>
<i>those dragons,</i>

00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:36.186
<i>Zarc might take over</i>
<i>Riley's body.</i>

00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:40.720
I know I have
to make Riley smile,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.586
but there's gotta be
another way.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:44.620
In fact, I'm surprised
that you'd be willing

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.420
to put Riley at risk.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.520
You dare think that Jack Atlas
doesn't care

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.353
about Riley's wellbeing!
Huh?

00:03:51.353 --> 00:03:53.120
When you're in a race
against time,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.420
you can't afford
to slam on the brakes!

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.586
And the Master of Faster is
going to teach you that lesson

00:03:57.586 --> 00:03:59.620
by challenging you
to a duel!

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.460
Duel Jack?

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.693
<i>The sooner you start</i>
<i>the better.</i>

00:04:02.693 --> 00:04:04.726
Declan?!

00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:06.760
<i>Your dueltaining has been</i>
<i>sorely lacking.</i>

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.560
<i>Riley hasn't even</i>
<i>cracked a hint of a smile.</i>

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.493
<i>Actually, when I think</i>
<i>about it,</i>

00:04:11.493 --> 00:04:13.860
<i>Riley's been frowning</i>
<i>even more than before.</i>

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.793
What is wrong with you?

00:04:15.793 --> 00:04:18.860
Yuya, you're supposed
to improve, not regress.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.860
That's why I had you duel
Dennis and Shay,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.026
but there isn't anything
to show for it now, is there?

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:26.693
<i>And do you know why?</i>

00:04:26.693 --> 00:04:29.026
<i>It's because</i>
<i>you're dueling in fear.</i>

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:31.360
<i>How can you dueltain</i>

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.059
<i>if you are in fact too scared</i>
<i>to truly dueltain?</i>

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:36.626
But you still remain
our only hope.

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:38.793
So that is why
I had this constructed.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.926
(man on PA)
Launching Interdimensional
track system.

00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:44.460
(rumbling)

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.460
Huh?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.466
<i>Track engaged.</i>

00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:07.500
This, Yuya,
is the Multiverse Speedway.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.133
<i>An incredible Duel</i>
<i>Runner track that runs</i>

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:12.233
<i>throughall four</i>
<i>dimensions!</i>

00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:15.600
<i>If this won't inspire you,</i>
<i>then nothing will.</i>

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.500
But I don't have
a Duel Runner.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.766
(Crow)
Don't let that stop you!

00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:21.466
Crow!

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:24.133
Thought you might need a ride,
so I tuned it up for ya.

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:26.266
Even preset
the radio stations.

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:29.400
Don't thank me.
Just suit up!

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.800
I got to admit,
I'm jealous.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.533
There's never been a Turbo Duel
like this in history!

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:39.466
I'll be rootin' for ya,

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:41.066
along with the rest
of the jackals.

00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:43.200
Good luck.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.500
<i>Folks, we're all in for one</i>
<i>dilly of a duel today!</i>

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.566
<i>'Cause it's the rematch of</i>
<i>the Friendship Cup finals</i>

00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:52.466
<i>between two of the most</i>
<i>darin' duel‐wranglers...</i>

00:05:52.466 --> 00:05:55.000
<i>but this time we're gonna be</i>
<i>rarin' across not one,</i>

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.266
but four different dimensions!

00:05:57.266 --> 00:05:59.966
Well, buckaroos,
shall we start this rodeo?

00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:01.206
(cheering)

00:06:06.106 --> 00:06:08.273
(thinking)
It's like Declan knew
that my dueltaining

00:06:08.273 --> 00:06:10.106
wouldn't be good enough yet.

00:06:12.306 --> 00:06:14.306
<i>Lasso up that</i>
<i>Action Field!</i>

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:16.473
<i>Crossover Acceleration!</i>

00:06:16.473 --> 00:06:18.506
(female computer voice)
<i>Duel Mode engaged.</i>

00:06:18.506 --> 00:06:20.540
<i>Autopilot standing by.</i>

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.506
I don't know if I can beat Jack
without my dragons,

00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:25.706
but I can't risk
summoning them either.

00:06:25.706 --> 00:06:27.906
But if I don't defeat Jack,

00:06:27.906 --> 00:06:29.673
there's no way
I'll save the world,

00:06:29.673 --> 00:06:31.406
much less my friends.

00:06:31.406 --> 00:06:34.206
I've always found a way to get
through any challenge,

00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:36.206
and this is no different!

00:06:36.206 --> 00:06:40.006
<i>Giddyap, boys!</i>
<i>It's turbo time!</i>

00:06:44.573 --> 00:06:47.140
<i>It's turbo time!</i>

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.306
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:06:50.206 --> 00:06:52.140
I'll make the first move!

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.173
Let this be
a warning, Yuya!

00:06:54.173 --> 00:06:56.273
I'm coming at you with every
monster in my deck,

00:06:56.273 --> 00:06:58.273
starting with Red Gargoyle!

00:07:00.346 --> 00:07:02.080
(growling)

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.913
And it'll be joined by
the Tuner Monster Red Resonator!

00:07:07.913 --> 00:07:09.980
(giggling)

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.880
Red Gargoyle, turn up the temp
with your special ability!

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.246
Double Red Resonator's
Level to four!

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.346
And now my Level Four
Red Resonator

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:23.246
tunes with
my Level Four Red Gargoyle!

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:29.213
Now, from the ancient chasms
of a lost world

00:07:29.213 --> 00:07:32.480
I awake a great
and terrible power.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.480
I Synchro Summon!

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.280
Come forth,
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.013
<i>Jack's gone straight</i>
<i>for the gut</i>

00:07:45.013 --> 00:07:47.080
<i>with his number‐one</i>
<i>Monster!</i>

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.913
<i>In the wink of an eye, he put</i>
<i>Yuya in a bag of trouble!</i>

00:07:50.913 --> 00:07:53.146
I end my turn
with one facedown.

00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:55.546
It's your move, Yuya.

00:07:55.546 --> 00:07:57.846
And you know that the only
monster that can stand up

00:07:57.846 --> 00:07:59.413
to my Dragon
is one of yours!

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:01.620
My turn! Ha!

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.220
I set the Pendulum Scale with
Scale One Stargazer Magician

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.353
and Scale Eight Timegazer
Magician!

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:10.486
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.853
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level two through seven

00:08:17.853 --> 00:08:19.920
all at the same time!

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.353
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:26.853
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:08:26.853 --> 00:08:28.820
(roaring)

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.086
Kaching and do your thing,
Performapal Coin Dragon.

00:08:33.453 --> 00:08:36.953
Max your muscles, Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Minitaurus!

00:08:36.953 --> 00:08:38.586
<i>Jack wanted a dragon,</i>

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:40.686
<i>and Yuya obliged double</i>
<i>what he was askin' for!</i>

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.553
<i>Can't wait to see what Yuya</i>
<i>has in store next!</i>

00:08:43.553 --> 00:08:46.486
Or maybe
I ain't seen nothin'.

00:08:46.486 --> 00:08:48.386
Don't mock me, Yuya!

00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:49.553
You know those aren't
the dragons

00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:51.253
I was looking for!

00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:53.320
Come on, you have
the cards to summon

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.820
your legendary dragon,
if you've got the grit!

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.286
Oh, I got the grit!

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.253
But still...

00:08:59.253 --> 00:09:02.326
I can use two of my monsters
to summon Dark Rebellion now.

00:09:02.326 --> 00:09:03.926
And then set up Clear Wing

00:09:03.926 --> 00:09:06.293
and Starving Venom Dragon
for later.

00:09:06.293 --> 00:09:10.460
But if I do, I might unleash
Zarc back into this world.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.326
And last go‐around was
a nightmare.

00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:16.760
And no one needs to relive
those bad dreams again.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.493
I have to find a different way
to dueltain my way to victory!

00:09:23.793 --> 00:09:25.226
Look there, it's Yuya!

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.593
Yuya, I'm counting on you
to sprinkle the dazzle

00:09:33.593 --> 00:09:35.593
and pour the razzle!

00:09:35.593 --> 00:09:37.926
My dragons are plenty powerful
on their own, Jack!

00:09:37.926 --> 00:09:41.093
And even more so when
Performapal Coin Dragon

00:09:41.093 --> 00:09:44.026
gives my dragons
an extra 500 attack points.

00:09:44.026 --> 00:09:47.360
Odd‐Eyes, attack Scarlight Red
Dragon Archfiend

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.360
and crispify that turkey!

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.826
But not before my Odd‐Eyes
Minitaurus tenderizes

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:57.226
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend's
attack points by 300!

00:10:02.666 --> 00:10:04.600
Odd‐Eyes, attack!

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.100
I'm dueling with an amateur.

00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:13.033
Red Gem shields my Scarlight
from destruction.

00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:15.100
But it won't shield you
from damage!

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.333
And with
Reaction Force in play,

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:18.833
you'll lose twice
the life points!

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.366
You're toasted!

00:10:23.133 --> 00:10:26.566
Minitaurus, thanks for bulling
your way to an assist, buddy!

00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:28.633
But now that your special
ability's over,

00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:32.066
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend
regains its attack points.

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:36.866
(both)
They're heading
to the next dimension!

00:10:36.866 --> 00:10:39.366
You should've summoned
your Dark Rebellion,

00:10:39.366 --> 00:10:41.466
and now you'll pay
for that mistake!

00:10:41.466 --> 00:10:43.133
It's my turn!

00:10:43.133 --> 00:10:46.433
I activate Scarlight's
special ability!

00:10:46.433 --> 00:10:48.566
It destroys
all of your monsters,

00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:51.433
and you lose 500 life points
for each one!

00:10:57.633 --> 00:10:59.533
I don't think so, Jack!

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:01.806
Because Performapal
Coin Dragon...

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:04.040
protects all my dragons!

00:11:06.406 --> 00:11:08.206
(growling)

00:11:09.373 --> 00:11:10.573
(grunts)

00:11:10.573 --> 00:11:12.440
Very well then.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.073
If Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend's special ability

00:11:15.073 --> 00:11:18.006
won't destroy your dragon,
its attack will!

00:11:18.006 --> 00:11:20.540
Incinerate Performapal
Coin Dragon!

00:11:27.906 --> 00:11:29.973
Without Performapal
Coin Dragon,

00:11:29.973 --> 00:11:31.740
Odd‐Eyes loses
500 attack points.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.606
But it's okay.

00:11:33.606 --> 00:11:35.906
Odd‐Eyes and I've gotten out
of tougher scrapes than this!

00:11:35.906 --> 00:11:38.006
Stop your dribble‐drabble,
Yuya!

00:11:38.006 --> 00:11:41.106
Your weak attempt
at dueltaining has
no chance of winning!

00:11:41.106 --> 00:11:44.273
You need the other three
dimensional dragons!

00:11:44.273 --> 00:11:47.006
And I'm saying
I don't, Jack!

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:50.440
It's too dangerous.
And not just for me.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.040
<i>But for everyone,</i>
<i>in every dimension.</i>

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.873
I'll find another way!
You hear me?!

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.213
It's my turn!

00:12:09.246 --> 00:12:10.780
All right!

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.113
Since the Pendulum Scale
is already set,

00:12:13.113 --> 00:12:15.713
I can Pendulum Summon!

00:12:15.713 --> 00:12:19.846
I'll bring back
Performapal Coin Dragon!

00:12:19.846 --> 00:12:22.180
And Performapal Odd‐Eyes
Minitaurus!

00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:24.946
Yuya...

00:12:30.213 --> 00:12:32.213
<i>This rodeo's</i>
<i>gettin' rascally!</i>

00:12:32.213 --> 00:12:34.613
<i>Jack and Yuya may be friends</i>
<i>off the track,</i>

00:12:34.613 --> 00:12:37.146
<i>but there are</i>
<i>no friends on the track!</i>

00:12:37.146 --> 00:12:40.080
My Coin Dragon's cashing in
by pumping up my dragons

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.980
with 500 attack points each!

00:12:44.046 --> 00:12:46.246
(grunts)
It worked pretty good last time,

00:12:46.246 --> 00:12:47.980
so here's an encore for ya!

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.680
Odd‐Eyes, attack
Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.613
And, Minitaurus, zap away

00:12:52.613 --> 00:12:55.780
300 of Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend's attack points!

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.920
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.953
I activate the Action Spell
Evasion to dodge your attack.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.953
Oh, no, you won't!

00:13:08.953 --> 00:13:11.753
Not as long as I have Stargazer
Magician's Pendulum ability!

00:13:13.453 --> 00:13:15.420
Instead of playing that spell,

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.253
it's placed facedown
on your field.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.786
Did you actually think
I wouldn't plan

00:13:20.786 --> 00:13:22.486
for that C‐minus maneuver?

00:13:22.486 --> 00:13:26.153
By placing my spell facedown,
I can summon Red Giant!

00:13:26.153 --> 00:13:29.320
And this behemoth automatically
ends the battle,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.453
so your attack is worthless!

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.053
<i>(grunts)</i>
<i>I'm ending my turn.</i>

00:13:37.053 --> 00:13:39.853
For a second there, it looked
like Yuya and his monsters

00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:41.653
were finally gettin'
the upper hand,

00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:44.253
but Jack keeps on matchin'
'em move for move.

00:13:44.253 --> 00:13:45.853
And that's why they should've
asked me to duel

00:13:45.853 --> 00:13:47.153
instead of Yuya.

00:13:47.153 --> 00:13:49.720
When will they ever learn?

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.586
I don't know why Yuya isn't
summoning Dark Rebellion.

00:13:52.586 --> 00:13:55.420
Jah, that dragon would really
flip this duel

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.820
more than a stack
of apple strudel flap‐‐

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.186
Hello! Don't you go and drool
during a duel, got it?!

00:14:00.186 --> 00:14:03.360
Yuya really is
off his game.
Oh!

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.293
I'm his teacher,
and a good one too,

00:14:05.293 --> 00:14:06.893
so I oughta know.

00:14:06.893 --> 00:14:08.860
I can tell he's holding back,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.593
as if he's scared to make
even one mistake.

00:14:11.593 --> 00:14:13.793
(Yoko)
Well, he should put on
his big‐boy pants!

00:14:13.793 --> 00:14:15.493
Uh, but he's
wearin' pants.

00:14:17.993 --> 00:14:19.426
Come on, Yuya!

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:20.893
Your mom didn't raise
no coward!

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:22.360
You're supposed
to swing into action,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.893
not bore us with
dissatisfaction!

00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:26.026
Don't make me cut
your allowance!

00:14:26.026 --> 00:14:27.893
Oopsie‐daisy.

00:14:27.893 --> 00:14:29.426
There I go getting
carried away again.

00:14:29.426 --> 00:14:30.926
But I'd never cut
his allowance,

00:14:30.926 --> 00:14:32.826
not that I even give him
one in the first place.

00:14:32.826 --> 00:14:35.026
You can sit down now.

00:14:35.026 --> 00:14:37.026
(Jack)
You disappoint me, Yuya!

00:14:37.026 --> 00:14:40.593
If you're telling me that you
can't gather the four dragons,

00:14:40.593 --> 00:14:42.860
then there is no point
in fighting you!

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.493
I will demolish you this turn!
Just watch me.

00:14:45.493 --> 00:14:47.660
I activate Red Reborn

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.093
to bring Red Giant
back from my graveyard!

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.293
(roaring)

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.460
And that's only the start!

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.560
Next I shall summon
the Tuner Monster...

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.900
Double Resonator!

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.033
And it transforms Red Giant
into another Tuner Monster!

00:15:06.033 --> 00:15:08.200
Now, my Level Five Red Giant

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.533
and Level One Double Resonator
tune my Level Four Red Gargoyle!

00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:14.966
Go, double tuning!

00:15:14.966 --> 00:15:17.766
By failing to summon
your most powerful dragons,

00:15:17.766 --> 00:15:20.966
you left me an opening
to summon mine!

00:15:20.966 --> 00:15:24.500
Together these monsters will
call forth an absolute power

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.333
destined to rule this duel!

00:15:27.866 --> 00:15:30.566
I Synchro Summon!

00:15:30.566 --> 00:15:32.533
Bow down and tremble in terror

00:15:32.533 --> 00:15:35.166
before Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:42.833
Go, Tyrant!

00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:45.766
Attack and destroy
Performapal Coin Dragon!

00:15:45.766 --> 00:15:47.733
Good‐bye!

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.033
Whoa!

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:56.566
Come on, Yuya!
Come on, Yuya!

00:15:56.566 --> 00:16:00.873
You're up, Scarlight!
Destroy his Minitaurus!

00:16:00.873 --> 00:16:04.240
<i>Jack's dragon is gonna shell</i>
<i>out 1,800 points of damage,</i>

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.040
<i>but Yuya only has</i>
<i>1,400 life points left!</i>

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.006
<i>This next attack</i>
<i>will end the duel!</i>

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:11.273
(Jack)
Go, Molten Crimson Flare!

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.506
(Jack)
Go, Molten Crimson Flare!

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.473
(Yuto)
This is how you're gonna lose?

00:16:29.473 --> 00:16:32.706
Wait.
Is that... Yuto?

00:16:32.706 --> 00:16:36.440
(Yuri)
How could you not summon
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon?

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.540
(Yugo)
Or my Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.206
(Yuto)
Not to mention
my Dark Rebellion!

00:16:40.206 --> 00:16:42.040
(all)
What's wrong with you?

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.640
But what if we resurrect Zarc?

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.273
What if we do?

00:16:45.273 --> 00:16:46.406
You know that you can always
make things

00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:48.140
swing your way again.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.106
So don't you worry about
anything all right?

00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:53.440
Exactly.
Try to enjoy the ride.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.406
(all)
It will give you the strength
to keep moving forward!

00:16:58.806 --> 00:17:01.346
I save Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Minitaurus

00:17:01.346 --> 00:17:03.380
from destruction
and take no damage

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.946
by summoning Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Dissolver!

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.413
And Performapal Odd‐Eyes
Dissolver can dissolve away

00:17:12.413 --> 00:17:14.913
one of your monster's
special abilities!

00:17:14.913 --> 00:17:17.580
And I'm choosing your
Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.413
Not so tyrannical
anymore, is it?!

00:17:20.413 --> 00:17:22.846
You'll regret that big‐time!

00:17:22.846 --> 00:17:25.680
You should have chosen
my Scarlight instead of Tyrant!

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.080
Because now I can use
Scarlight's special ability

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.546
to destroy all your monsters

00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:32.446
and deal you 500 points
of damage for each one!

00:17:32.446 --> 00:17:34.746
That's 1,500 points of damage,

00:17:34.746 --> 00:17:36.846
which means you lose
this duel!

00:17:36.846 --> 00:17:38.746
That's where
your math's wrong!

00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:41.380
Odd‐Eyes Dissolver
can't be destroyed this turn,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.513
so I only lose a thousand!

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.046
Yeah, but you're almost
down to zero...

00:17:49.046 --> 00:17:51.680
and not even you can
survive on an empty tank!

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.713
You're right.

00:17:56.713 --> 00:17:59.653
Maybe I can't,
but maybe we can.

00:18:00.753 --> 00:18:05.253
Yuto, Yuri, and Yugo...

00:18:05.253 --> 00:18:06.853
you were right.

00:18:06.853 --> 00:18:09.153
It's a new dimension,
so it's a new me.

00:18:09.153 --> 00:18:10.920
I can't be afraid of who I was

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.820
or I'll always be afraid
of what I'll be.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:14.786
I draw!

00:18:16.686 --> 00:18:19.120
Since I already set
the Pendulum Scale,

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.420
I can use it
again to Pendulum Summon!

00:18:24.653 --> 00:18:28.286
Return from my Extra Deck,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:18:29.453 --> 00:18:32.253
Along with Performapal
Coin Dragon!

00:18:32.253 --> 00:18:34.753
And Performapal Odd‐Eyes
Minitaurus!

00:18:36.886 --> 00:18:39.353
Not this stupid
strategy again.

00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:42.486
Oh, come on, Jack, don't be
a cranky old grumplepuss.

00:18:42.486 --> 00:18:44.520
Sure, our last turn
may have been a flop,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.886
but my monsters are back
with a whole new act!

00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:49.886
Hmm, I only care
about one act.

00:18:49.886 --> 00:18:52.720
And that's to see you summon
your four dimension dragons

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.353
to take on my team
and I in battle!

00:18:55.353 --> 00:18:57.553
Well, then focus those eyes

00:18:57.553 --> 00:19:00.326
'cause you're in
for great surprise.

00:19:00.326 --> 00:19:03.360
All of my monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:19:07.993 --> 00:19:10.426
I overlay Performapal
Coin Dragon

00:19:10.426 --> 00:19:12.060
and my Odd‐Eyes Minitaurus

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.226
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:21.860
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.026
I call upon the most dangerous
of Dragons!

00:19:25.026 --> 00:19:27.260
I Xyz Summon!

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.493
Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon!

00:19:35.593 --> 00:19:36.793
Aww, yeah!

00:19:36.793 --> 00:19:38.126
That's Yuto's dragon!

00:19:38.126 --> 00:19:39.593
All right!

00:19:39.593 --> 00:19:41.360
Fantabulous, Yuya!

00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:43.993
(roaring)

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.293
(cooing)

00:19:48.293 --> 00:19:50.493
Riley?

00:19:50.493 --> 00:19:53.293
Riley's never reacted
to anything before.

00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:55.560
Yuya summoning that dragon
must have triggered Zarc.

00:19:58.026 --> 00:20:00.900
And up next, I'm summoning
a Tuner Monster,

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.500
Performapal Odd‐Eyes Synchron!

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.400
Here we go, Yugo!

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.100
Let's keep things
rolling along!

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.133
I tune Odd‐Eyes Synchron

00:20:13.133 --> 00:20:15.233
with a monster
in my Pendulum Zone,

00:20:15.233 --> 00:20:18.466
and that monster is
Stargazer Magician!

00:20:23.633 --> 00:20:26.866
Beat your wings to whip up
a whirlwind of destruction!

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.200
I Synchro Summon!

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.700
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.500
Huh...
(cooing)

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.200
And last but not least!

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.233
My Performapal Odd‐Eyes
Dissolver can fuse

00:20:48.233 --> 00:20:49.766
with my Timegazer Magician!

00:20:52.466 --> 00:20:54.300
And together they'll bring out

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.833
the most toxic monster
ever seen!

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.373
I Fusion Summon!

00:21:01.373 --> 00:21:03.706
The vicious, voracious,
and venomous

00:21:03.706 --> 00:21:06.406
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:21:10.106 --> 00:21:11.506
(cooing)

00:21:12.706 --> 00:21:15.606
Oh, no.
Zarc's evil is waking up.

00:21:15.606 --> 00:21:18.473
(Yusho)
Now, now.
You're a tough one, aren't you?

00:21:18.473 --> 00:21:22.473
It'll all be over soon enough,
one way or another.

00:21:25.206 --> 00:21:27.340
(roaring)

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.873
(snarling)

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.473
(roaring)

00:21:32.473 --> 00:21:34.440
(roaring)

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.040
(thinking)
Well, here they are.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.973
All four dimension dragons.

00:21:43.973 --> 00:21:46.940
Sorry I kept you cooped up
in my deck for so long.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.273
No going back.

00:21:49.273 --> 00:21:52.673
But at least I'm not scared
of the unknown anymore.

00:21:52.673 --> 00:21:55.606
It's time for me
to swing into action!
