WEBVTT

00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:05.900
The Arc Five Reactor is almost
fully energized.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.133
I will soon reunite the
dimensions back into one!

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.300
As if I don't have enough
problems on my hands...

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.400
(Yuya growling)

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.366
Let me go!

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.366
Let me go!

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.866
(growling)

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.066
You have to let me go!

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.700
(Leo)
Yes...

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.266
Yes!

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.833
The moment is at hand.

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:40.400
By reuniting the dimensions as
one, Zuzu, Celina Lulu, and Rin

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.366
will reunite into one,
back into Ray.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.833
And after all this time...

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:51.566
I will have my daughter back!

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.800
Faster!

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.966
Faster!

(groans)

00:02:13.513 --> 00:02:15.313
(Declan)
Hey, Riley!

00:02:15.313 --> 00:02:17.079
C'mon, wake up!

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.179
Riley!

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.013
(gasps)

00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:21.813
We need to move.

00:02:21.813 --> 00:02:24.346
We have to go shut down
the reactor immediately.

00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:26.480
Wait, Declan.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.580
I think that Ray
just spoke to me.

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:30.580
What's that?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.046
Yeah...

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:33.946
I heard her loud and clear.
Didn't you?

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.413
Now, now Riley.

00:02:35.413 --> 00:02:37.313
You were just dreaming.

00:02:37.313 --> 00:02:39.113
It was more than a dream

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:40.246
(gasps)

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:42.613
Ray says that reactor

00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:44.613
or no reactor,

00:02:44.613 --> 00:02:46.913
Z‐ARC will destroy the world!

00:02:46.913 --> 00:02:49.480
And that's what we're
trying to prevent.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.313
Riley, we don't
have the time for this.

00:02:51.313 --> 00:02:52.580
Let's go.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.813
Listen to me!

00:02:53.813 --> 00:02:55.980
Please!

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.213
We need Ray's help to defeat
Z‐ARC, because she's the only

00:02:58.213 --> 00:03:00.613
one who's done it before.

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:04.486
Ray says when, not if,
when Z‐ARC resurrects,

00:03:04.486 --> 00:03:06.453
you will need
my help to stop him,

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:08.953
or the world as you know it
is doomed!

00:03:08.953 --> 00:03:11.186
And I believe her!

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:13.620
So we shouldn't
shut down the reactor!

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.753
Because that's the only way Ray
can come back to help us!

00:03:16.753 --> 00:03:19.286
(Declan)
Is Riley actually
communicating with Ray?

00:03:19.286 --> 00:03:21.320
Riley always
had a special sense...

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.786
but I still find
this hard to believe.

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:26.420
No matter what
you may think,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.520
the one certainty is that
if our father uses the reactor,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.953
the four dimensions
will be no more.

00:03:31.953 --> 00:03:33.220
But Declan...

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.720
Without Ray to help us...

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.953
Z‐ARC will make
all dimensions no more.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:41.253
(Declan groans)

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:43.253
So then, Riley,

00:03:43.253 --> 00:03:45.020
you're fine
if Zuzu is just gone?

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.920
(gasping)

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.920
If we do not act now,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.886
the reality around us could
be erased from existence,

00:03:50.886 --> 00:03:53.053
along with everyone
that we've ever known!

00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:54.453
(gasping)

00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:01.093
(Riley)
You don't know
that for sure!

00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:03.426
But I do know that we need Ray!

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:05.360
We do, Declan!

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.893
Because without Ray,
we don't stand a chance.

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:09.226
None of us do.

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:11.226
Z‐ARC will destroy us all!

00:04:11.226 --> 00:04:14.626
So if you're going to shut down
the reactor,

00:04:14.626 --> 00:04:16.893
then I have to
shut you down!

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:22.160
(Declan)
Riley...

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.360
So be it!

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.060
If that's what you want!

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.626
(electronic voice)
Generating Action Field:
Crossover.

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:31.993
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.026
I'll take the first turn.

00:04:38.026 --> 00:04:42.493
And with it I'll use my D/D
Brownie... along with my D/D

00:04:42.493 --> 00:04:44.993
Savant Thomas to set
the Pendulum Scale!

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.893
I can now summon as many
monsters between levels three

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:57.826
and five as I want!

00:04:57.826 --> 00:05:01.166
I Pendulum Summon... and call
upon my two monsters to emerge!

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:05.233
D/D Lilith

00:05:05.233 --> 00:05:08.266
and D/D Nighthowl!

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.033
And I'll follow that up
by activating the spell

00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:14.333
Dark Contract
With Summoning Surplus!

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.766
By sending my two monsters
to the graveyard I can summon

00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:19.766
a D/D/D Fusion monster,

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:23.966
without having to rely on using
the spell card Polymerization.

00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:27.833
I now fuse Lilith and Nighthowl
together to form a monster

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:30.266
that will turn up
the heat and rule this duel!

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:32.500
(roaring)

00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:37.566
I Fusion Summon!

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:40.133
D/D/D Flame King Genghis!

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:41.666
(growling)

00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:47.066
Next, D/D Brownie's Pendulum
ability activates!

00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:49.966
Since I summoned a monster
from my Extra Deck,

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:51.800
D/D Brownie moves

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.133
from the Pendulum Zone
on to my field!

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:55.933
(D/D Brownie giggling)

00:05:55.933 --> 00:05:59.433
And as a result, Genghis'
special ability activates!

00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:02.340
(growling)

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.640
When a D/D monster is summoned,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.406
I'm then allowed to summon a D/D
monster from my graveyard!

00:06:09.573 --> 00:06:11.573
(D/D Lilith grunts)

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.240
Next I'll activate D/D Lilith's
special ability!

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.606
I retrieve one D/D Monster
from my graveyard!

00:06:21.973 --> 00:06:26.340
Now I tune D/D Brownie
and D/D Lilith!

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.773
You're a strong duelist, Riley.

00:06:28.773 --> 00:06:32.206
I should know, since I'm the one
who trained you...

00:06:32.206 --> 00:06:34.306
And that is why
I can't hold back.

00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:37.906
Not with so much at stake!

00:06:37.906 --> 00:06:39.173
I Synchro Summon!

00:06:39.173 --> 00:06:42.240
D/D/D Gust King Alexander!

00:06:45.073 --> 00:06:47.473
But I'm not
through yet, Riley.

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.706
I summon D/D Nighthowl!

00:06:52.806 --> 00:06:56.240
And Nighthowl's special ability
lets me resurrect Lilith

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.913
from my graveyard by lowering
its attack points to 0.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.613
But it won't
be around for long.

00:07:05.613 --> 00:07:08.080
You see, my Contract lowers
its Level by 1,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.480
so it makes her Level
‐ the same as Nighthowl's.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.313
And since they have
the same Level,

00:07:13.313 --> 00:07:15.313
I'm now going to build
the Overlay Network

00:07:15.313 --> 00:07:16.813
with her and Nighthowl.

00:07:22.413 --> 00:07:26.680
I've used Pendulum, Fusion,
and Synchro Summoning so far.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.046
And now.

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:31.013
I Xyz Summon!

00:07:31.013 --> 00:07:33.246
D/D/D Stone King Darius!

00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:35.846
(grunts)

00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:40.846
By using one Overlay Unit,
I can destroy this old Contract

00:07:40.846 --> 00:07:43.780
to add a new Contract
in my deck to my hand.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.680
And now, I'll play this card
facedown and end my turn.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.380
(Riley)
Declan's giving it his all
against me.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.113
He already summoned some of his
strongest monsters.

00:07:58.113 --> 00:08:01.786
This is gonna be tough,
but I know I have a chance.

00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:06.353
Especially because I have
the card that he gave me.

00:08:06.353 --> 00:08:08.553
Riley...
that stuffed bear of yours

00:08:08.553 --> 00:08:10.420
won't help you
win a duel.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.020
But I have something
that just might.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.886
Take this...

00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:20.486
you may need it
when things look their darkest.

00:08:20.486 --> 00:08:22.720
I always looked up to you,
Declan...

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.820
Because I always knew
you would be there for me.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.086
Even in the middle of the night
when I just couldn't sleep.

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:31.453
I just wish
you would trust me

00:08:31.453 --> 00:08:34.953
and together we could
help Ray return.

00:08:34.953 --> 00:08:38.586
But since you won't help me,
I'll have to help myself!

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:40.120
Stop this, Riley.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.053
This isn't going to end
the way you want it to.

00:08:43.053 --> 00:08:45.386
Especially when I activate
the spell

00:08:45.386 --> 00:08:48.920
Dark Contract With
the Eternal Darkness!

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.586
Since you don't
have this card,

00:08:50.586 --> 00:08:53.153
you can no longer
activate any spells

00:08:53.153 --> 00:08:55.686
or traps against
my monsters.

00:08:55.686 --> 00:08:59.320
And to make your troubles even
worse, you also can't Fusion,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.160
Synchro, Xyz,
or Tribute Summon!

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.393
I can't see a thing anymore!

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.960
How am I supposed to duel

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.993
when I can't see
what I'm dueling?

00:09:10.993 --> 00:09:14.493
You're a fine duelist Riley,
just not the best...

00:09:14.493 --> 00:09:16.560
(groans)
How can you be?

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.493
After all, I taught you
everything you know

00:09:18.493 --> 00:09:20.693
about dueling.

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:23.926
But I still have a few tricks
I never showed you...

00:09:23.926 --> 00:09:25.693
Until now, that is.

00:09:25.693 --> 00:09:28.260
Well, I got some tricks
you don't know about too!

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.860
I summon Film Magician!

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.326
(Film Magician cackles, grunts)

00:09:35.326 --> 00:09:38.560
I play a facedown
and end my turn!

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.126
It's your move!

00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:41.693
(Declan)
Riley isn't giving up.

00:09:41.693 --> 00:09:44.426
How brave...
and pointless.

00:09:49.426 --> 00:09:51.260
(screaming)

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.526
No!

00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:54.660
I can feel Yugo and Yuri nearby.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.860
I can't merge with them...

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.160
Declan...

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.860
Please hurry!

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.400
(groaning)

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.700
It's my turn!

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.566
I draw!

00:10:06.566 --> 00:10:09.100
The effect of my Dark Contract
will now weaken me

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.233
by one thousand life points.

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:16.800
And now, D/D/D Stone King Darius
strike down Film Magician!

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.466
(roaring)

00:10:18.466 --> 00:10:21.900
Film Magician's
special ability activates!

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.666
So now Film Magician's attack
points become the exact same

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.900
as your monster!

00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:33.233
And Film Magician also can't
be destroyed in battle!

00:10:33.233 --> 00:10:35.966
But I can't say the same
for your monster!

00:10:35.966 --> 00:10:37.866
Come now, Riley....

00:10:37.866 --> 00:10:41.566
I knew exactly what you had
planned this entire time.

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:43.300
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.433
Darius isn't destroyed
in battle,

00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:48.266
but your monster
is destroyed instead.

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:51.866
And you also take 500 points
of damage.

00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:53.466
(groaning)

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.500
Now that you no longer have
anything to protect you,

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.106
Gust King Alexander
can attack you directly.

00:11:00.106 --> 00:11:02.606
(frightened gasp)

00:11:02.606 --> 00:11:04.973
(Riley screams, grunts)

00:11:04.973 --> 00:11:08.506
(Declan)
It's hard to believe that you're
the same child I found

00:11:08.506 --> 00:11:13.006
scared and cowering
in the darkness, an empty shell.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.806
My mother filled that shell
and groomed you into a powerful

00:11:15.806 --> 00:11:18.340
duelist who can defeat anyone,

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.640
but you were still
a shell.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.140
Never dueling for yourself,
never feeling for yourself...

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.406
that is until now.

00:11:26.406 --> 00:11:29.973
I'm proud that you're standing
up for yourself, I truly am...

00:11:29.973 --> 00:11:32.306
but I cannot let you win.

00:11:32.306 --> 00:11:35.106
Flame King Genghis,
end this duel!

00:11:35.106 --> 00:11:36.540
(battle cry)

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.140
(Declan gasps)

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.073
I play the Action Spell,
Damage Banish!

00:11:44.073 --> 00:11:47.206
I take no damage
from your attack.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:50.306
I picked it up earlier
when you weren't looking.

00:11:53.673 --> 00:11:55.240
Why are you surprised?

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.106
You taught me
to never give up!

00:11:58.273 --> 00:12:01.380
I... end my turn.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.080
Reading confirmed...

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.080
The Reactor
is approaching 60%.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.380
Transferring the subject Zuzu

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.513
to begin
unification procedures!

00:12:11.513 --> 00:12:14.413
(beeping)

00:12:14.413 --> 00:12:16.346
Good...

00:12:16.346 --> 00:12:18.980
(Riley)
Declan taught me
to never give up,

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.846
and there's no way I'm gonna
start now.

00:12:21.846 --> 00:12:26.146
Declan's out to win,
and so am I!

00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:28.746
So here goes!

00:12:28.746 --> 00:12:29.980
(Riley)
Yes!

00:12:32.013 --> 00:12:33.913
This is just the card I need!

00:12:33.913 --> 00:12:36.646
But first...

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:40.913
I activate...
my trap Photo Frame!

00:12:40.913 --> 00:12:43.846
This card takes a picture of one
of your spell or trap cards

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:47.046
and copies its effects!

00:12:47.046 --> 00:12:49.213
So I take a snap
of Dark Contract

00:12:49.213 --> 00:12:51.713
with the Eternal Darkness!

00:12:51.713 --> 00:12:52.746
(shutter click)

00:12:54.213 --> 00:12:55.580
What?

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.780
Where did Riley learn that!?

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.920
Next up, I activate...
my spell.. Pure Ray!

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.420
When we both have the same card,
Pure Ray destroys them both!

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.520
And all monsters
lose 100 attack points

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.853
for each monster
on the field.

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:26.086
(Declan)
Was someone standing
next to Riley?

00:13:26.086 --> 00:13:29.520
I summon C/C Critical Eye!

00:13:31.386 --> 00:13:36.953
And now I'm activating the spell
card Montage Fusion!

00:13:36.953 --> 00:13:39.553
I use Montage Fusion
to take a photograph

00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:41.520
of your Gust King Alexander...

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.920
(shutter click)
... and then I fuse this photo

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.320
with C/C Critical Eye!

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.486
I could give you a hint
of what's coming next...

00:13:47.486 --> 00:13:50.186
but I don't want to spoil
the surprise!

00:13:52.053 --> 00:13:54.986
I Fusion Summon!

00:13:54.986 --> 00:13:58.986
C/C/C Sonic Halberd Of Battle!

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.293
(Declan)
I've never seen Riley
play that monster before.

00:14:09.526 --> 00:14:14.060
My C/C/C Sonic Halberd Of Battle
can attack twice in one turn!

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:19.260
(Declan)
Since when did Riley learn new
strategies without my knowledge?

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.026
And since you control
a Wind Monster,

00:14:22.026 --> 00:14:25.393
Sonic Halberd can attack three
times instead of two!

00:14:25.393 --> 00:14:30.026
And I don't think you can
survive all these attacks!

00:14:30.026 --> 00:14:33.960
Halberd, attack Gust King
Alexander right now!

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.126
(groaning)

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.460
(Declan)
I can't believe it...

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.193
Riley isn't just
standing up to me,

00:14:47.193 --> 00:14:50.693
Riley's actually fighting back!

00:14:50.693 --> 00:14:55.093
And next, Sonic Halberd slashes
up Flame King Genghis!

00:14:55.093 --> 00:14:57.126
(Flame King Genghis groaning)

00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:02.633
When Flame King Genghis
is destroyed in battle,

00:15:02.633 --> 00:15:06.000
I can retrieve a Dark Contract
from my graveyard.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
(Declan)
If I don't keep my guard up,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.066
Riley may actually
win this duel!

00:15:11.733 --> 00:15:14.366
And with my third
and final attack,

00:15:14.366 --> 00:15:18.233
Sonic Halberd will destroy
Stone King Darius!

00:15:18.233 --> 00:15:21.633
And I win this duel!

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.100
Now that I've defeated
both Aster and Kite,

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.266
it's time for us
to finish what we started.

00:15:35.266 --> 00:15:38.400
And you may think that you have
the advantage

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.266
since you destroyed
my Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon,

00:15:42.266 --> 00:15:45.700
but by simply banishing
a monster I used to summon it...

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.200
I can bring it back...

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.266
And it's back for revenge!

00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:50.900
(roaring)

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:55.366
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:57.200
(Yugo)
Since your turn's over

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.300
Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon's
attack points

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.940
drop back to 3,000.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.640
Now, it's your turn.
So bring it.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.240
Oh, I will!

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.873
Here I go!

00:16:08.873 --> 00:16:12.740
(Yusho)
Yugo no longer seems
to be controlled by Z‐ARC.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.573
I just hope he can keep it up...

00:16:16.106 --> 00:16:20.240
Yuri... my Crystal Wing's gonna
tip this duel back in my favor

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.806
by blasting your Greedy Venom
Fusion Dragon into bits!

00:16:23.806 --> 00:16:25.940
I enjoy the fact
that you keep trying

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.706
but it's all going to be
for naught.

00:16:27.706 --> 00:16:28.973
(Yugo)
Well, me and my Dragon

00:16:28.973 --> 00:16:30.573
have a different opinion!

00:16:33.273 --> 00:16:35.206
(grunting)

00:16:35.206 --> 00:16:37.040
Nice.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.773
But I think
you forgot what happens

00:16:38.773 --> 00:16:41.106
when Greedy Venom Fusion
Dragon is destroyed.

00:16:41.106 --> 00:16:43.606
I'm not that dumb!

00:16:43.606 --> 00:16:46.173
Its special ability
automatically
destroys my monster,

00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:49.040
and I take damage equal
to its attack points.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.173
(groans)

00:16:54.173 --> 00:16:57.106
And I also know you can
resurrect your lame dragon

00:16:57.106 --> 00:16:59.606
by banishing Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon

00:16:59.606 --> 00:17:00.913
from your graveyard,

00:17:00.913 --> 00:17:02.680
so bring it out already!

00:17:07.446 --> 00:17:08.880
By all means!

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.813
If my pals
taught me anything...

00:17:10.813 --> 00:17:12.946
It's this...

00:17:12.946 --> 00:17:15.913
Sometimes the only way to move
forward is to purposefully

00:17:15.913 --> 00:17:17.946
take one for the team!

00:17:19.446 --> 00:17:21.013
So watch this!

00:17:21.013 --> 00:17:25.013
I activate the trap
Extra Shave Reborn!

00:17:25.013 --> 00:17:27.280
When my Crystal Wing Synchro
Dragon is destroyed,

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.746
I can resurrect a lower Level
monster from my graveyard,

00:17:30.746 --> 00:17:33.646
because a true teammate
won't leave me hanging!

00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:39.813
Welcome back,
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:17:39.813 --> 00:17:42.013
(roaring)

00:17:42.013 --> 00:17:46.180
It looks like I wasn't so dumb
after all, now was I?

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.746
And next up, I'm going to summon
Speedroid Rubberband Plane!

00:17:53.213 --> 00:17:56.946
Speedroid Rubberband Plane's
special ability blasts away 600

00:17:56.946 --> 00:18:01.020
of Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon's
attack points!

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.386
Since Speedroid Rubberband Plane
used its special ability,

00:18:04.386 --> 00:18:07.886
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon
automatically destroys it!

00:18:13.653 --> 00:18:15.586
You destroyed your own monster?

00:18:15.586 --> 00:18:19.153
That's right, because Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon gains the attack

00:18:19.153 --> 00:18:22.886
points of the monster
it destroyed.

00:18:22.886 --> 00:18:24.586
(roaring)

00:18:24.586 --> 00:18:26.586
Now Clear Wing is stronger

00:18:26.586 --> 00:18:28.286
than Yuri's Greedy
Venom Fusion Dragon.

00:18:28.286 --> 00:18:30.186
Hm.

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:32.886
You're down
to a thousand life points,

00:18:32.886 --> 00:18:35.486
so this duel's a done deal!
Here goes!

00:18:35.486 --> 00:18:37.620
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon,

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.520
take out Greedy Venom
with Crystal Cataclysmic Strike!

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.520
(roaring)

00:18:44.586 --> 00:18:48.120
(Yuri)
Heh. It's so cute
when you actually think

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.320
you're going to win.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.620
Say what?

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.086
(Yuri)
My Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra
swaps a Predaplant

00:18:54.086 --> 00:18:57.120
in my graveyard with another
banished monster,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.393
to cut the damage
I take in half!

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.793
Close, but not close enough.

00:19:06.793 --> 00:19:10.526
And guess what I activate
the trap Extra Shave Reborn!

00:19:10.526 --> 00:19:13.126
Wait!
You have the same card I do?

00:19:13.126 --> 00:19:17.160
Yes, and I use it to bring back
the vicious and voracious

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.493
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.060
(groans)

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.293
I end my turn.

00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:26.893
So Clear Wing's attack points
return to normal.

00:19:26.893 --> 00:19:29.693
But we're ready
for anything you send our way!

00:19:29.693 --> 00:19:30.926
(Yuri)
That's what you think!

00:19:30.926 --> 00:19:33.026
I draw! (chuckles)

00:19:33.026 --> 00:19:37.093
Greedy Venom, let's do a little
burglarizing, shall we?

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:40.493
Steal Crystal Wing Synchro
Dragon's special abilities

00:19:40.493 --> 00:19:43.093
so that you
can use them for yourself!

00:19:44.626 --> 00:19:47.326
(maniacal laughter)

00:19:47.326 --> 00:19:49.826
I activate...

00:19:49.826 --> 00:19:53.193
the Equip Spell Card,
Predapruning!

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:56.460
I can summon one Predaplant
from my graveyard and equip

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.860
Predapruning onto it.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.066
And I'll use Predaplant
Drosophyllum Hydra's

00:20:03.066 --> 00:20:07.200
special ability to banish
a Predaplant from my graveyard.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.900
Bye, bye!

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.233
And you know what else
is going bye‐bye?

00:20:11.233 --> 00:20:14.500
Your Dragon's attack points.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.833
It's pretty clear
your Clear Wing's a dud,

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:18.966
unlike my Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon!

00:20:18.966 --> 00:20:20.666
(angered groan)

00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:22.933
Because my Dragon
uses the special ability

00:20:22.933 --> 00:20:25.400
it stole from Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.800
to destroy
my Drosophyllum Hydra!

00:20:30.766 --> 00:20:32.733
(laughing)

00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:36.333
And then Starving Venom Fusion
Dragon gains Hydra's

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:38.266
800 attack points!

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.700
(gasps)

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.000
How does it feel to lose against
your own special ability?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.466
Must be bad...

00:20:47.466 --> 00:20:49.200
(angered groan)

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.733
Go!

00:20:50.733 --> 00:20:52.633
Starving Venom,

00:20:52.633 --> 00:20:56.300
attack Clear Wing Synchro Dragon
and finish Yugo off!

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.206
(screaming)

00:21:00.206 --> 00:21:01.606
(both gasping)
