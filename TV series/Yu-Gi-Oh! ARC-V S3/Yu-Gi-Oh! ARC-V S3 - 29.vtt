WEBVTT

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.266
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.666
(Leo)
This is my newest invention to
reunite the dimensions!

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.400
The Arc Five Reactor!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.366
(all)
Arc Five Reactor?

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:16.200
Reuniting all four dimensions

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.133
requires an immeasurable
amount of energy,

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:22.333
energy that this reactor can
extract from the life energies

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.000
of the people I've sealed
inside those cards!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.533
And with the great convergence,

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:31.000
the Standard, Synchro,
Fusion and Xyz Dimensions

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.166
will cease to exist
as they form

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.100
back into their
original dimension!

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.100
This is...

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.366
Revival Zero!

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:43.333
Declan, you must join my side.

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.833
And together,
we must defeat Yuya!

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:47.766
Defeat Yuya?

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.600
Similar to how Ray was split

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.566
into four individuals,
so was Z‐ARC!

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:57.466
And the piece of Z‐ARC from
the Standard Dimension is Yuya!

00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.033
To make certain that Z‐ARC
can never resurrect again,

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:02.040
we must eliminate him!

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.640
No way,
Yuya's anything but evil.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.506
Unlike you, father!

00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:08.806
Your approach to dueling
hurts people.

00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:11.673
You wanted to turn everyone
into cards.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:13.873
You talk about uniting
the dimensions?

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.773
How can you unite people

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:17.973
when you break family
and friends apart?

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:20.506
So no, I'm not
joining you, Father!

00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:22.606
I'm going to stop you!

00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:25.506
You have given me
no other choice.

00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:29.773
I will put an end to Yuya,
with or without your help.

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:32.340
(all)
Let's duel!

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.306

00:02:34.046 --> 00:02:37.480
It seems the impending danger
is fast approaching,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.180
thus I must accelerate
my timeline

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.113
to unite you all into one.

00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:43.980
(both gasping)
Say what?

00:02:48.446 --> 00:02:51.913
I see that you're all confused,
but it's really quite simple.

00:02:58.913 --> 00:03:02.186
The Arc Five reactor condenses
all the life energies

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:05.120
my students have collected
throughout the Synchro,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.620
Xyz and Fusion dimensions.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.120
And when the Arc Five Reactor
has enough energy,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.486
its power will then be able
to create a new single dimension

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:19.020
by fusing the existing
four dimensions back into one.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.553
You're fusing them all?

00:03:20.553 --> 00:03:23.353
Into one?
That's correct.

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:25.586
And when the dimensions
reunite as one,

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:27.386
so will these four girls,

00:03:27.386 --> 00:03:30.020
and I will have
my daughter Ray back.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.353
Well, you know what?

00:03:33.353 --> 00:03:35.486
You may like
this plan of yours,

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:38.153
but it's not a plan
I can get on board with.

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:40.720
Because no plan can be good

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.486
if you need to trap Zuzu
in some giant test tube.

00:03:43.486 --> 00:03:45.420
So that means...

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.986
We have a problem!
We have a problem!

00:03:46.986 --> 00:03:48.486
Yuya!

00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:49.120
Yuto!

00:03:50.253 --> 00:03:52.453
Declan,
you ready to do this?

00:03:52.453 --> 00:03:53.986
Yeah.

00:03:53.986 --> 00:03:56.753
Zuzu, this'll
be over soon!

00:03:56.753 --> 00:03:58.653
Yuya...

00:03:58.653 --> 00:04:00.753
This is gonna be
the fight of our lives.

00:04:00.753 --> 00:04:04.660
But remember, Z‐ARC's evil
is still inside us.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.860
We have to keep
our emotions in check.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.126
Yeah, I know.

00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:12.193
If we lose it
then he's gonna wake up,

00:04:12.193 --> 00:04:13.726
take control,

00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:15.126
and who knows
what he'll do!

00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:16.960
So let's not find out.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.826
Now let's get to work!

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:20.893
Let's stop Leo!

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.493
I'm setting
the Pendulum Scale

00:04:22.493 --> 00:04:24.760
with Scale 1
Stargazer Magician

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.660
and Scale 8 Timergazer Magician!

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.360
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:04:34.693 --> 00:04:36.493
I'm allowed to summon monsters

00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:39.226
from level 2 through 7
all at the same time!

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.493
Swing far Pendulum!

00:04:42.493 --> 00:04:44.793
Carve the arc of victory!

00:04:44.793 --> 00:04:48.393
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:53.293
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.300
I've seen this before...

00:05:01.733 --> 00:05:03.300
(roaring)

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:11.366
(Yusho)
Yuya is in for the match
of his life now.

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:14.066
I only hope he remembers what
I tried to teach him

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:15.600
so many years ago...

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800
(crying)

00:05:20.233 --> 00:05:22.633
Take your dad's advice,
Yuya.

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:25.300
Try to laugh when
you feel like crying.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.866
And when things get tough,
respond with a smile.

00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:30.833
It will give you the strength
to keep moving forward!

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.366
And smile you did.

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:36.900
You always looked to have fun
in any situation,

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.633
and that was contagious.

00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:44.400
Now, I know it's hard, son,
but try to find that smile.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.366
That smile I loved
since you were a baby.

00:05:48.533 --> 00:05:50.766
A baby...

00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:52.666
Wait a second...

00:05:57.633 --> 00:05:59.266
(crying)

00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:02.006
Break! Diaper change.

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:05.206
Question, Skip.
Fire away.

00:06:05.206 --> 00:06:07.506
You're getting to be
a real pro at that.

00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:09.206
How many months
has it been now?

00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:11.473
Yusho, please.

00:06:11.473 --> 00:06:13.606
You know I can't think
and diaper all at once.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.073
Sorry, it's not like

00:06:15.073 --> 00:06:16.540
I'm asking
what's two plus two.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.573
Ha. She's, uh...

00:06:18.573 --> 00:06:21.140
You know, I never really
thought about it.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.973
I actually don't know
how old Zuzu is.

00:06:23.973 --> 00:06:28.206
In fact, I don't remember her
first goo‐goo or gaga either!

00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:30.640
That's crazy, right?

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.106
But what I do know,
is that I love her!

00:06:33.106 --> 00:06:34.940
(Yusho)
How could Skip not know

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.373
when his own daughter
was born?

00:06:37.373 --> 00:06:39.840
The birth of your child
is an unforgettable moment.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.906
Why, when Yuya was born,

00:06:41.906 --> 00:06:43.573
I was at...

00:06:43.573 --> 00:06:44.940
At...

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.473
I..

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:49.073
I don't remember.

00:06:49.073 --> 00:06:52.973
Wait, is it because...

00:06:52.973 --> 00:06:55.506
Those memories don't exist?

00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:57.440
But how can that be?

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.973
You say you wanna destroy

00:06:58.973 --> 00:07:00.980
our dimensions
and create your own?

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.813
Well, I'm not letting
that happen!

00:07:02.813 --> 00:07:04.946
You hear? No chance!

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.346
We're gonna put a stop to you!

00:07:11.346 --> 00:07:12.480
Got that right!

00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:18.346
First thing's first, I'm going
to be using these two cards...

00:07:18.346 --> 00:07:22.313
Scale 1 D/D Savant Copernicus
and Scale 6 D/D Cerberus

00:07:22.313 --> 00:07:24.846
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.746
I can now simultaneously
summon monsters

00:07:31.746 --> 00:07:35.346
from levels 2 and 5
at the same time!

00:07:35.346 --> 00:07:38.046
And simultaneously
put your plans

00:07:38.046 --> 00:07:40.246
of dimensional domination
in jeopardy!

00:07:42.413 --> 00:07:46.646
I Pendulum Summon and call upon
my two monsters to emerge!

00:07:46.646 --> 00:07:48.780
D/D Berfomet...

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.180
And the Tuner Monster,
D/D Ghost!

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.113
A Tuner Monster?

00:07:56.113 --> 00:07:57.880
Then, from my hand,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.120
I summon D/D Necro Slime!

00:08:02.353 --> 00:08:03.953
All right!

00:08:03.953 --> 00:08:06.353
Declan has set things up
perfectly!

00:08:06.353 --> 00:08:09.220
Next, I tune
my Level 2 D/D Ghost

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.486
with my Level 4 D/D Berformet

00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:14.020
and my Level 1
D/D Necro Slime!

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.920
Now behold
as a new power emerges,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.420
cutting through the darkness
like a blade of lightning

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.620
to begin his reign!

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.453
I Synchro Summon...

00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:27.553
D/D/D Gust King Alexander!

00:08:30.553 --> 00:08:32.420
What a play!

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.386
Yeah, that's impressive.

00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:37.753
But it's certainly not enough
to beat the Professor.

00:08:37.753 --> 00:08:40.120
Don't worry, just watch!

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.853
I activate my D/D Ghost's
special ability

00:08:43.853 --> 00:08:48.420
to send my second D/D Berfomet
in my deck to the graveyard.

00:08:52.753 --> 00:08:55.053
Then I'll activate
D/D Necro Slime's

00:08:55.053 --> 00:08:57.820
special ability
from the graveyard!

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.760
By banishing it and D/D Ghost,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.560
I can Fusion Summon
a D/D/D Monster.

00:09:05.493 --> 00:09:08.393
And the one I'm choosing
is a scorcher!

00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:11.160
Be gone,
Necro Slime and Ghost,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.726
and let rise a monster that
burns bright with blazing power!

00:09:14.726 --> 00:09:16.626
I Fusion Summon...

00:09:16.626 --> 00:09:19.560
D/D/D Flame King Genghis!

00:09:22.026 --> 00:09:25.393
Synchro, Fusion,
what's next?

00:09:25.393 --> 00:09:28.826
I activate Gust King
Alexander's special ability!

00:09:28.826 --> 00:09:31.560
Whenever a D/D monster
is summoned,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.093
my Gust King can command
another D/D monster

00:09:34.093 --> 00:09:37.060
to rise from the graveyard
as it will now!

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.926
Return to me, D/D Berfomet!

00:09:42.826 --> 00:09:45.193
But why stop at one?

00:09:45.193 --> 00:09:48.493
Flame King Genghis can resurrect
my other D/D Berfomet!

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.526
He's got two Level 4's!

00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:57.793
Next, I overlay
my two D/D Berfomets

00:09:57.793 --> 00:10:01.900
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.933
I promise you have never faced
a monster as magnificent

00:10:04.933 --> 00:10:07.066
or commanding as this one!

00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:09.200
I Xyz Summon!

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.066
D/D/D Wave King Caesar!

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.000
Not bad.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.866
(Leo)
Pendulum, Synchro,

00:10:18.866 --> 00:10:21.366
Fusion, even Xyz.

00:10:21.366 --> 00:10:23.500
Not bad, son.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.200
Not bad at all.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.500
Compliments from you
mean nothing.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.566
I now activate from my hand

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:33.100
the spell Dark Contract
with Exclusivity

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.500
Whenever you try to summon
a monster from your Extra Deck,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.433
if I just so happen to have
a monster on my field

00:10:39.433 --> 00:10:41.700
that was summoned using
the same summoning method,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.800
your summoning is negated.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.533
Very clever.

00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:47.100
So you weren't just showing off

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.400
with all those
summoning styles.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.333
No, I'm showing you up
because now,

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:56.166
with Fusion, Synchro and Xyz
monsters out on my field,

00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:59.700
those summoning methods are
no longer available to you!

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.806
Yes! This'll really limit

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:03.106
what the Professor can do!

00:11:03.106 --> 00:11:05.173
So far so good!

00:11:05.173 --> 00:11:07.306
And with that,
I end my turn.

00:11:07.306 --> 00:11:09.706
That means you're up, father.

00:11:09.706 --> 00:11:12.206
So, go right ahead
and do your very worst.

00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:13.540
Because we're ready!

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.173
(scoffs)
No, you're overconfident.

00:11:17.173 --> 00:11:18.740
My turn now!

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.240
Declan!

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.340
You do know the true threat
here...

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.240
It's Yuya.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.140
He and Z‐ARC are one
in the same!

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.673
He's the one you should be
fighting, not me.

00:11:29.673 --> 00:11:31.673
That's why I should join you?

00:11:31.673 --> 00:11:34.506
Yes, you finally understand.

00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:37.273
And you should understand
my answer is still no.

00:11:37.273 --> 00:11:40.606
I will always
remain loyal to Yuya.

00:11:40.606 --> 00:11:43.640
Even if that loyalty
leads to Z‐ARC's revival

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.206
and puts all the dimensions
in harm's way?

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.273
Z‐ARC won't be revived!

00:11:48.273 --> 00:11:50.206
Yuto and I won't allow it.

00:11:50.206 --> 00:11:52.440
He's not coming
to this party.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.340
Yuya isn't the problem,
father, you are!

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.840
Reuniting the dimensions
to the way things used to be?

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.580
You mean when Z‐ARC
was destroying everything?

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.046
You're the one who's going
to resurrect Z‐ARC!

00:12:03.046 --> 00:12:04.613
Keeping the dimensions separate

00:12:04.613 --> 00:12:06.780
is the only way
to guarantee our safety.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.046
And that's
what I plan to do.

00:12:10.046 --> 00:12:11.546
Sounds good!

00:12:14.013 --> 00:12:16.480
So maybe it's you who actually
needs to understand

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.713
instead of me.

00:12:18.713 --> 00:12:21.480
You fool, you don't understand
a thing at all!

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.713
Z‐ARC will do as he pleases.

00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:26.013
He will resurrect!

00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:28.346
Even if the dimensions
are kept apart!

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:30.246
There's proof!

00:12:30.246 --> 00:12:32.646
Yuya has already
combined with Yuto,

00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:35.480
his counterpart from
the Xyz Dimension!

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.646
He's only steps away from
transforming back into Z‐ARC.

00:12:39.646 --> 00:12:42.146
No, you're wrong!
Yuto and I may have

00:12:42.146 --> 00:12:44.580
joined together,
but that only means

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.713
that we're twice as strong

00:12:45.713 --> 00:12:48.446
fighting against
Z‐ARC's control!

00:12:48.446 --> 00:12:51.346
We're dueling to make
the world smile,

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:54.446
not like you or this Z‐ARC
who duels to destroy!

00:12:54.446 --> 00:12:57.580
We're gonna stop you,
and all your schemes!

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.246
That's right!

00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:02.320
You tell him, Yuya!
I believe in you!

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.953
I know that you can beat
the Professor!

00:13:04.953 --> 00:13:08.720
'Cause how can you ever lose
if Yuto's helping you?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.020
(Yuto)
Lulu...

00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:14.720
How disappointing.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.386
Since you refuse to listen,

00:13:16.386 --> 00:13:18.886
I'll just have
to beat you both!

00:13:18.886 --> 00:13:21.786
I set the Pendulum Scale
with this card pair:

00:13:21.786 --> 00:13:23.820
Two Scale 1 Spirit Reactors.

00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:29.886
No way!
He can Pendulum Summon?

00:13:29.886 --> 00:13:31.453
That's unbelievable!

00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:39.920
Now what?

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.753
Since they both have
the same Scale,

00:13:41.753 --> 00:13:43.820
he can't Pendulum Summon
anything.

00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:47.620
I activate the Pendulum ability

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.553
of the Spirit Reactor
on the left.

00:13:49.553 --> 00:13:51.920
Its Pendulum Scale
becomes the same

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.920
as another Pendulum Monster
on the field!

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.653
And I select
Timergazer Magician!

00:13:57.653 --> 00:13:59.720
That would mean...

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.760
Spirit Reactor's Pendulum Scale
rises to... 8.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.793
Yes, I can now summon

00:14:07.793 --> 00:14:11.326
multiple monsters
between levels 2 and 7!

00:14:11.326 --> 00:14:13.693
I told you that
I would defeat you both,

00:14:13.693 --> 00:14:15.860
and now meet the monsters

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.026
that will be assisting me
in that endeavor.

00:14:18.026 --> 00:14:20.560
I Pendulum Summon...

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.926
Spirit Tech Force
Pendulum Governor...

00:14:24.626 --> 00:14:27.760
And Spirit Gem
Salamander Core!

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.793
I'm not sure what
these two do,

00:14:31.793 --> 00:14:33.126
but I bet it's bad!

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.860
I'm not sure what
these two do,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.993
but I bet it's bad!

00:14:42.993 --> 00:14:47.260
I activate Pendulum Governor's
special ability!

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.593
I can tribute Salamander Core to
use its special ability twice!

00:14:51.593 --> 00:14:54.760
And that means
double trouble for you,

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.226
Because not only does
its special ability

00:14:57.226 --> 00:14:59.426
destroy one monster
on your field,

00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:02.400
but it also deals you
800 points of damage.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.333
Now, be gone...

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:07.866
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.666
Yuya!
Oh, no!

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:19.500
Don't think I've forgotten
about you, son.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.700
Flame King Genghis, vanish!

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.333
And by getting rid of
your Fusion Monster, Declan,

00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:31.933
you are no longer able to
prevent me from summoning

00:15:31.933 --> 00:15:34.933
a Fusion Monster of my own.

00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:37.300
It seems your
impenetrable strategy

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.000
has some flaws, now,
doesn't it?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.533
Since I still have
a Synchro and Xyz Monster,

00:15:43.533 --> 00:15:46.800
your summoning options are still
severely limited.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.600
So you can barely do a thing.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.000
Oh, really?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.900
Guess I'll have
to change that.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.666
Pendulum Governor's ability
prevents any monster

00:15:55.666 --> 00:15:58.200
between level 2 and 7
from attacking!

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.640
And I see that your
Synchro Monster is level 7.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.773
That means Alexander
can't attack.

00:16:05.773 --> 00:16:09.806
But my Caesar can still attack
you because it has no Level!

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:12.673
You silly boy,
only Pendulum Monsters

00:16:12.673 --> 00:16:15.406
are allowed to attack
Pendulum Governor.

00:16:15.406 --> 00:16:17.306
Do you now understand?

00:16:17.306 --> 00:16:19.906
There's nothing you two
can do to stop me.

00:16:19.906 --> 00:16:22.806
And nothing you can do
to stop the Reactor!

00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:25.806
The four dimensions will be
united once again!

00:16:27.606 --> 00:16:31.673
I end my turn
with one facedown.

00:16:31.673 --> 00:16:33.406
Face it, children.

00:16:33.406 --> 00:16:36.906
You are woefully unprepared
to challenge me in a duel.

00:16:36.906 --> 00:16:41.506
After all, I've been planning
this for a long time.

00:16:41.506 --> 00:16:45.206
And I knew someday
I'd personally see it through

00:16:45.206 --> 00:16:47.273
to its conclusion.

00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:49.440
So I made quite certain

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.906
to keep my skills sharp
like a sword.

00:16:51.906 --> 00:16:53.773
And soon,
I'll start slicing!

00:16:53.773 --> 00:16:56.740
You awake? You okay?
Mm‐hmm.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.406
What just happened?
Was that really Yuya?

00:16:59.406 --> 00:17:02.180
Yea, Yuya or a tornado...

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.846
He just blew apart this room
and that cage

00:17:04.846 --> 00:17:06.613
like it was nothing.

00:17:06.613 --> 00:17:10.346
Aster, Yuya needs our help
now more than ever.

00:17:10.346 --> 00:17:11.913
Then what are we waiting for?

00:17:11.913 --> 00:17:13.413
Come on!

00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:21.246
Oh, no!
What's happening?

00:17:22.946 --> 00:17:24.680
Yuya!

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.480
Zuzu!
No!

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.946
It's only a matter of time now

00:17:28.946 --> 00:17:32.646
until the Reactor
is fully functional.

00:17:32.646 --> 00:17:35.313
No! Yuya!

00:17:35.313 --> 00:17:37.280
Zuzu!

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.580
And it's only a matter of time

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.780
before I have
my daughter back.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.846
Yuto! Help me!

00:17:43.846 --> 00:17:45.146
Lulu!

00:17:45.146 --> 00:17:46.446
Stop all this!

00:17:46.446 --> 00:17:48.180
Right now!

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.480
My, my,
that's some temper.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.113
Declan, isn't it obvious

00:17:59.113 --> 00:18:01.553
that Yuya cannot
control his anger?

00:18:01.553 --> 00:18:03.686
That he cannot hold
Z‐ARC back? Help me!

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.220
(distorted voice)
How dare you turn on me.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.620
You'll pay.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.386
Yuya's losing control!

00:18:10.386 --> 00:18:11.720
Oh no!

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.286
Yuya! Fight it!

00:18:16.286 --> 00:18:18.786
Fight? Yes, yes.

00:18:18.786 --> 00:18:20.420
You all wanted me to fight!

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.453
You wanted more brutality!

00:18:22.453 --> 00:18:24.386
And that's exactly
what I gave you!

00:18:24.386 --> 00:18:25.753
(screams)

00:18:27.386 --> 00:18:29.686
No! Yuya!

00:18:29.686 --> 00:18:31.520
You gotta calm down!

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.353
(struggling)

00:18:33.353 --> 00:18:35.386
Now do you believe me?

00:18:35.386 --> 00:18:38.453
Declan, we have to join forces
and stop Z‐ARC together!

00:18:38.453 --> 00:18:40.620
Yuya! Please!

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.553
Please calm down!

00:18:43.553 --> 00:18:46.886
Son, if you don't want
to listen to me, fine!

00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:49.920
But don't ignore what
you see with your own eyes!

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.220
Yuya can no longer stop Z‐ARC!
We must defeat him!

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.486
So quit wasting precious time,
Declan, you must join me!

00:18:56.486 --> 00:18:58.786
Or we all might perish!

00:18:58.786 --> 00:18:59.960
(struggling)

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.726
Tell me it isn't so.

00:19:01.726 --> 00:19:03.426
That you are not Z‐ARC.

00:19:03.426 --> 00:19:04.660
That you're Yuya!

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.093
I... Will not...

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.193
I will not let Z‐ARC...

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:14.326
(voice normalizing)
Take control of me!

00:19:14.326 --> 00:19:17.026
I... must fight it!

00:19:17.026 --> 00:19:20.126
(both struggling)

00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:21.926
I... don't...

00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:23.360
know how much longer...

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.660
I can...

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.393
hold on, Yuya.

00:19:26.393 --> 00:19:29.993
All this pain, this hate...

00:19:29.993 --> 00:19:31.226
But we...

00:19:31.226 --> 00:19:32.793
can't give up Yuto...

00:19:32.793 --> 00:19:34.160
No, not now...

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.093
Not ever...

00:19:36.093 --> 00:19:37.826
Just keep fighting...

00:19:37.826 --> 00:19:40.226
My... draw!

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:42.193
(Yusho)
Stay strong, Yuya.

00:19:42.193 --> 00:19:44.126
If anyone can, it's you.

00:19:44.126 --> 00:19:45.793
I believe in you,

00:19:45.793 --> 00:19:48.260
that you won't
let Z‐ARC resurrect.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.460
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:19:52.926 --> 00:19:55.393
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:19:55.393 --> 00:19:56.526
(roaring)

00:19:59.093 --> 00:20:02.400
I summon
Performapal U Go Golem.

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:08.666
Leo! Shut down the reactor

00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:11.066
and let all of my friends go!

00:20:11.066 --> 00:20:13.433
(Yusho)
Why, after all this time,

00:20:13.433 --> 00:20:16.966
is Z‐ARC trying
to resurrect now?

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:19.133
But if you're
not gonna cooperate,

00:20:19.133 --> 00:20:20.666
then I'm going to
have to do it for you!

00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:26.333
I send U Go Golem to
the graveyard to Fusion Summon!

00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:29.033
And, Leo,
this Fusion Summoning

00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:30.766
will be your undoing!

00:20:32.466 --> 00:20:34.800
Behold, as two monsters
trigger in each other

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.333
their most destructive traits
and then become one!

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:42.933
I give to you...

00:20:42.933 --> 00:20:45.533
Performapal Gatlinghoul!

00:20:47.733 --> 00:20:50.466
(Yusho)
Z‐ARC could've
resurrected anytime...

00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:52.466
Why now?
What's different?

00:20:52.466 --> 00:20:54.133
Now, because Gatling Ghoul

00:20:54.133 --> 00:20:56.166
has been successfully Summoned,

00:20:56.166 --> 00:20:58.100
You are in the bull's eye!

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.940
For each card on the field,

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.573
you lose 200 life points!
You dare!

00:21:02.573 --> 00:21:04.740
(Yusho)
Z‐ARC wanted to rule all,

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.406
but he was broken apart
into four, including my son,

00:21:08.406 --> 00:21:10.673
because Z‐ARC
wasn't strong enough.

00:21:10.673 --> 00:21:13.973
(Yuya)
There are currently
12 cards on the field.

00:21:13.973 --> 00:21:16.206
So that means...

00:21:16.206 --> 00:21:19.840
you now take
2,400 points of damage!

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.540
(Yusho)
So he craves more power,

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.840
but what power could he want?

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.240
Yuya!

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.806
(Yusho)
He could already Fusion,
Synchro, and Xyz Summon...

00:21:35.806 --> 00:21:39.306
(screaming)

00:21:39.306 --> 00:21:41.006
(Yusho)
But he couldn't Pendulum!

00:21:41.006 --> 00:21:43.106
Because it's a whole new power!

00:21:43.106 --> 00:21:45.040
And that's why
he's resurrecting now!

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.106
(distorted laughing)

00:21:47.106 --> 00:21:49.006
Yuya!

00:21:49.006 --> 00:21:51.340
No... No!

00:21:52.806 --> 00:21:54.606
Riley!

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:56.840
(Yuya)
Gatlinghoul
has another ability!

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.213
It automatically destroys
your Pendulum Governor

00:22:00.213 --> 00:22:02.946
and deals you damage equal
to its attack points!

00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:06.146
And that is terrible news
for you.

00:22:06.146 --> 00:22:08.580
But from the look on your face,
you already knew that.

00:22:09.946 --> 00:22:12.313
Its attack points are 2,800!

00:22:12.313 --> 00:22:14.146
So then if this hits...

00:22:14.146 --> 00:22:16.080
Yuya wins!

00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:21.546
(Yusho)
If Z‐ARC takes Yuya's essence,

00:22:21.546 --> 00:22:23.980
he'll be able
to Pendulum Summon too!

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.880
And then he'll truly
be unstoppable!

00:22:28.413 --> 00:22:30.446
And now... Goodbye!
