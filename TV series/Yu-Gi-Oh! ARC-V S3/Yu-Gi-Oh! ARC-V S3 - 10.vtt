(Yuya)
Previously

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:02.966
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.833
(Shay)
So Grace and Gloria
Tyler are back,

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:09.466
and I'm guessing
it's not because

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.433
you're sorry
for trashing my city.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:13.033
Look, Grace.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.133
The Resistance really
are like cockroaches.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.966
Just when you think
you got rid of 'em all,

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.533
a couple more
scurry out of hiding.

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.400
The only scurrying
that's gonna happen

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.300
is you two
scurrying back home.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.966
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.200
Sit back...

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.700
and look up!

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.866
'Cause our two dragons are about
to blast off and attack!

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.600
Three...

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.866
two...

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.400
one...

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.500
blastoff!

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.133
(laughs)
How cool!

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.833
And we take no damage.

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:51.266
True, but what's a rocket show
without a rocking finale?

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.466
Miracle Rocket Show deals you

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.200
all the damage
you would've taken!

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.000
A whopping 10,225 points!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.840
No way!
Amazing!

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.006
I hope you all
enjoyed the show.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.173
Gotta say I think I did
the Sakaki name proud

00:01:07.173 --> 00:01:08.573
on this one.

00:01:08.573 --> 00:01:11.006
I won't let you
escape again, Yuya!

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:13.140
Assemble the team!

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.040
I can't believe you lost!

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.273
What did I pay you for?!

00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:19.240
Well, I didn't pay you,
but you get the idea!

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.040
Go after the Lancers again

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.240
and beat them
this time!

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.640
No. They had
their chance.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.840
It's our turn.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.873
Because we always
get the job done right.

00:01:26.873 --> 00:01:28.040

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:38.313
When we get back to HQ,

00:02:38.313 --> 00:02:40.346
you deserve two servings
of cabbage.

00:02:40.346 --> 00:02:42.813
Yeah, well,
thanks for stepping in

00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:44.813
to help me and all, Yuya,

00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:47.380
but it'’’s not like I really
needed your help or anything.

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:50.813
Get off your high horse.

00:02:50.813 --> 00:02:52.313
We're all in this together

00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:54.146

Uh...

So it'’’s just you two, then?

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:05.193

Against you guys,
that'’’s more than enough.

00:04:05.193 --> 00:04:07.093
Ha, we'’’ll just see.

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:09.126
Talking tough
is one thing...

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:11.660
Dueling tough is
something very different.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.860
So you called in Obelisk Force
to take this crew down as well?

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.260
Guess Noro over there

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.326
didn'’’t, like, trust us
to get the job done.

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:21.393
Look, it wasn'’’t me
that called them!

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:24.426
My best guess
is that the Professor himself

00:04:24.426 --> 00:04:26.226
ordered them to be
on standby.

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:28.593
You know, as a backup plan
in case you two failed...

00:04:28.593 --> 00:04:30.393
which you did!

00:04:30.393 --> 00:04:33.093
You always say one sentence
too much, don'’’t you?

00:04:33.093 --> 00:04:35.093
Still, it was
a fun duel.

00:04:35.093 --> 00:04:36.393
Fun duel?

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:38.093
You think it'’’s fun
to lose?

00:04:38.093 --> 00:04:39.860
Chillax,
I'’’m just saying...

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.593
That Yuya kid knows

00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:43.760
how to put on
a pretty good show.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.893
Question is...

00:04:44.893 --> 00:04:46.726
Can he keep it up now?

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:48.226
Or is he simply gonna
turn out to be

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:50.960
one of those pathetic
one‐hit wonders?

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:55.993
(Shay)
This duel will be tough...

00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:57.793
so we don't have the luxury

00:04:57.793 --> 00:04:59.760
of you playing around
with your dueltaining.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.266
Listen, Shay, just
because I'm dueltaining

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:05.966
doesn'’’t mean
I'’’m messing around.

00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:08.300
Then what are we waiting for?

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.666
Let'’’s give these Obelisks
a pounding.

00:05:12.533 --> 00:05:15.300

Generating Action Field‐‐
Crossover.

<i>Action Cards dispersed.</i>

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:21.900
(all) Let'’’s duel!

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.366
I'’’ll start things off.

00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:26.833
First I activate the spell card
Polymerization...

00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:30.700
And with it, I'’’ll fuse my two
Ancient Gear Hunting Hounds!

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.400
Now check it,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.200
as these two mongrels
mix into a crazed canine!

00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:41.166
I Fusion Summon!

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:44.200
Double Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound!

00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:49.566
With that, I end my turn.

00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:51.466
It'’’s my move!

00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:55.166
And to start things off I summon
Raidraptor ‐ Vanishing Lanius!

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.266
And unfortunately for you,

00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:01.340
when this card
is successfully summoned,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.206
I can take another
Vanishing Lanius from my hand

00:06:04.206 --> 00:06:05.240
and put it in play.

00:06:07.806 --> 00:06:09.640
But I'’’m not done.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.106
Because since I successfully
summoned a second Lanius,

00:06:12.106 --> 00:06:14.706
I'’’m now allowed
to summon a third!

00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:19.906
And now I'’’ll overlay
my three Vanishing Laniuses...

00:06:19.906 --> 00:06:23.373
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:06:23.373 --> 00:06:25.306
I Xyz Summon!

00:06:25.306 --> 00:06:26.873
Hah!

00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:30.040
Take flight,
Raidraptor Rise Falcon!

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.673
(roaring)

00:06:32.673 --> 00:06:34.406
Excellent!

00:06:34.406 --> 00:06:37.840
I activate Double Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound'’’s ability!

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.406
And it really bites for you,
because once per turn,

00:06:41.406 --> 00:06:46.040
I can attach a Gear Counter
to your monster.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.473
You think that tiny gear
is gonna gum up my strategy?

00:06:49.473 --> 00:06:51.040
Well, you thought wrong!

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.206
I activate Rise Falcon'’’s
special ability!

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:55.106
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:06:55.106 --> 00:06:57.073
it gains your Hunting Hound'’’s
attack points!

00:06:57.073 --> 00:07:00.340
Now go!
Take out that Hunting Hound!

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.380
Maybe you shoulda been more
worried about that gear,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.046
because it automatically
destroys your monster.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.913
In that case, I activate
Rank‐Up‐Magic Raptor'’’s Force!

00:07:10.913 --> 00:07:14.113
It lets my Rise Falcon
rise up once again!

00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:19.380
And I use it

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.780
to Xyz Summon a Raid Raptor

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.780
that'’’s one Rank higher.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.213
Go Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:30.546
Take to the skies,
Raidraptor ‐ Blaze Falcon!

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.780
Your pooch might've stopped
my first attack,

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.513
but can it stop a second?

00:07:35.513 --> 00:07:39.613
Oh, wait, it can'’’t because Blaze
Falcon can attack you directly!

00:07:39.613 --> 00:07:42.046
Aah...!

00:07:42.046 --> 00:07:43.713
And one more thing.

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.313
When you take damage,

00:07:45.313 --> 00:07:47.013
Blaze Falcon
automatically destroys

00:07:47.013 --> 00:07:49.913
that mangy mutt you call
a monster. Fire!

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.046
Now I'’’ll place one card
face down and end my turn.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.520
What a play!

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.820
Shay just schooled that Obelisk
hardcore.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.220
Yeah. These guys
aren't so tough.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.386
If I was out there,
this duel would be over by now!

00:08:09.386 --> 00:08:12.653
On average Obelisk Force takes
five minutes 22 seconds to win,

00:08:12.653 --> 00:08:15.453
but it'’’s already been
five minutes 23 seconds!

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.786
It'’’s clear that only we are
strong enough to defeat them.

00:08:17.786 --> 00:08:19.253
Come on, Glo.

00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:20.820
We already, like,
lost to them.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.053
Give '’’em,
like, a chance.

00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:24.186
You don'’’t seriously mean that,
do you?

00:08:24.186 --> 00:08:26.053
I'’’m, like, for reals.

00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:28.186
(thinking)
'Cause why would I wanna
duel again

00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:29.786
<i>when I've got</i>
<i>the best seat in the house</i>

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:32.486
<i>to watch Yuya dueltain?</i>

00:08:32.486 --> 00:08:34.053
My turn now!

00:08:34.053 --> 00:08:36.386
And I'm bringing the bite
straight to you

00:08:36.386 --> 00:08:37.486
with the help of this!

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.220
Thanks to Polymerization,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.220
I can fuse my
Ancient Gear Hunting Hounds.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.220
Your dog days will never be over

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.386
with Triple Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound on your tail.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.086
And now to add to my pack,

00:08:52.086 --> 00:08:54.986
I activate
Ancient Gear Double Imitation.

00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:57.320
So if I negate
their special abilities,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.920
I can bring back two
Ancient Gear Hunting Hounds

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.893
from the graveyard.

00:09:01.893 --> 00:09:03.926
So coming back
to hunt you down...

00:09:03.926 --> 00:09:05.926
...are Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound

00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:07.993
and Double Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.793
And we're setting
our pack of pooches loose

00:09:16.793 --> 00:09:18.793
on Goggles over there.

00:09:18.793 --> 00:09:19.960
That'’’s not fair!

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.126
He's attacking Yuya

00:09:22.126 --> 00:09:24.093
before he'’’s even
had a turn yet!

00:09:24.093 --> 00:09:25.426
He'’’s gonna lose!

00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:26.860
4200 attack points

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.326
are gonna blast him
into next week!

00:09:29.326 --> 00:09:33.293
The poor guy never even had
a chance to put up a defense!

00:09:33.293 --> 00:09:37.426
Ancient Gear Hunting Hound,
attack! Go!

00:09:39.793 --> 00:09:41.760
Whoa!

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.960
(all gasp)

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.793
No! Yuya!

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:55.860
Phew! That was close!

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.826
Nice one!

00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:58.293
(all gasping)

00:09:58.293 --> 00:09:59.826
Thanks, but I can't take
all the credit

00:09:59.826 --> 00:10:01.500
for dodging that blast.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.900
Most of it goes
to the Action Card Big Escape.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.433
Amazing!
Amazing!

00:10:05.433 --> 00:10:07.800
Yup! That's exactly
what I would have done,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.500
but with more style
and grace.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.933
Wow, this is, like,

00:10:10.933 --> 00:10:12.666
even better than I
thought it would be.

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:14.366
So why don'’’t you join
his fan club?

00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:16.433
Aah... on, no,
time keeps on ticking,

00:10:16.433 --> 00:10:19.633
but it's Yuya and Shay who are
doling out the licking!

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:22.266
Guess I have to end my turn.

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:24.433
Great!

00:10:24.433 --> 00:10:26.333
Now I'’’m up!

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:28.333
Yuya...

00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:30.800
You had me sweating there
for a while...

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.066
But deep down, I knew
you would figure out a way

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:34.333
to keep the show going on.

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:36.466
Huh?

00:10:38.266 --> 00:10:42.233
And I knew your dueltaining
would put a smile on my face.

00:10:42.233 --> 00:10:44.066
Well, that's my goal,

00:10:44.066 --> 00:10:47.833
to try and make the whole world
smile, even them.

00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:49.800
First I'll set
the Pendulum Scale

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.066
with Scale 1 Stargazer Magician
and Scale 8 Timegazer Magician.

00:10:54.066 --> 00:10:57.900
I'’’m taking control of this duel,
starting now!

00:11:02.073 --> 00:11:04.473
I can summon monsters
from Level 2 through Level 7

00:11:04.473 --> 00:11:06.440
all at the same time!

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.073
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:11:08.073 --> 00:11:12.006
Carve the arc of victory!

00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:16.540
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:11:18.773 --> 00:11:21.906
Get to giddying,
Performapal Friendonkey!

00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:24.440
Scratch your way to victory,
Silver Claw!

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.840
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.340
(roaring)

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.440
Here we go...!

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.840
It'’’s showtime!

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.906
Here we go...!

00:11:42.906 --> 00:11:45.106
It'’’s showtime!

00:11:45.106 --> 00:11:48.106
O.M.G.‐‐ I've been
waiting for this.

00:11:48.106 --> 00:11:49.906
Okay, then.

00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:51.840
It'’’s time to send your Hound
back to the pound.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.740
All right,
Performapal Silver Claw...

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.840
attack and strike down Triple
Ancient Gear Hunting Hound.

00:11:59.273 --> 00:12:01.746
And Silver Claw's
special ability

00:12:01.746 --> 00:12:06.780
gives all my Performapals
300 extra attack points.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.380
It'’’s Performapal
Friendonkey'’’s turn.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.013
So saddle up, pal...

00:12:17.013 --> 00:12:19.346
And take it
to that Hunting Hound!

00:12:25.213 --> 00:12:27.480
(groaning)

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.013
And now the moment
you'’’ve all been waiting for.

00:12:30.013 --> 00:12:32.946
It'’’s time for the star
of our show to shine.

00:12:32.946 --> 00:12:34.846
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon,

00:12:34.846 --> 00:12:37.546
attack Double Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound!

00:12:37.546 --> 00:12:39.580
And while you'’’re at it...

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.146
let'’’s double their trouble.

00:12:41.146 --> 00:12:43.013
Since Double Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.780
is a Level 5 monster,
you take double the damage.

00:12:47.313 --> 00:12:49.246
Aah...!

00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:51.413
Bravo!

00:12:51.413 --> 00:12:52.613
Toasted!

00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:03.986
Wow...

00:13:03.986 --> 00:13:06.720
And with that,
I end my turn.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.153
What?
Like, is that it?

00:13:09.153 --> 00:13:11.086
That'’’s what he calls
dueltainment?

00:13:11.086 --> 00:13:12.620
I'’’ll tell you
what I call it.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.486
I call it a pathetic
waste of a turn.

00:13:15.486 --> 00:13:16.353
So you were able
to take down

00:13:16.353 --> 00:13:18.186
three of our monsters.

00:13:18.186 --> 00:13:20.420
You could'’’ve done
so much more.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.020
So much more?

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.820
Yeah, if all three
of your monsters

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.586
attacked me instead
of my pals' monsters,

00:13:25.586 --> 00:13:27.420
you could've
eliminated me,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.720
and you'’’d have one less
opponent to deal with.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.553
Oh, yeah,
I guess you'’’re right.

00:13:31.553 --> 00:13:33.520
But where'’’s the fun
in that?

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.186
Because it's not
dueltaining

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:37.653
unless I make my opponents
enjoy the duel too.

00:13:37.653 --> 00:13:39.220
Enjoy the duel?

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.620
Come on,
are you telling me

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.486
that you'’’re not having
a good time?

00:13:42.486 --> 00:13:44.886
That you'’’re not having
just a little bit of fun?

00:13:44.886 --> 00:13:47.786
We'’’re not here
to have fun, understand?

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:50.453
We'’’re here to
take you Lancers down!

00:13:50.453 --> 00:13:52.186
Then take them down already!

00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:55.486
We'’’re three minutes and
13 seconds behind schedule!

00:13:55.486 --> 00:13:57.453
This is no time to dillydally!

00:13:57.453 --> 00:13:59.420
So, what do you got for me?

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.726
A whole lot of pain.

00:14:01.726 --> 00:14:03.693
You're gonna regret
not finishing me off

00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:06.160
when you had the chance,
because here I go!

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.126
I summon
Ancient Gear Hunting Hound!

00:14:09.126 --> 00:14:11.326
And whenever you have a monster
out on your field,

00:14:11.326 --> 00:14:16.360
my Hunting Hound is able to deal
you 600 points of damage!

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.093
Light up their life points!

00:14:18.093 --> 00:14:19.560
Hold it right there!

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.993
I play the trap
Raidraptor ‐ Silent Roar!

00:14:21.993 --> 00:14:24.826
And since I have a Raidraptor
on my field...

00:14:24.826 --> 00:14:27.860
The damage from your Hound
is reduced to zero!

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.626
I owe ya one, Shay!

00:14:32.626 --> 00:14:33.926

00:14:33.926 --> 00:14:35.760
No matter,
I'll just play this:

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.026
The spell card
Ancient Gear Scrap Fusion!

00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:42.760
This lets me fuse together
any Ancient Gear monsters

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.693
that three of us have
in our graveyards!

00:14:45.693 --> 00:14:47.760
And the monsters I select...

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.626
Are the Triple Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound

00:14:49.626 --> 00:14:51.360
that's in my graveyard...

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.593

00:16:36.006 --> 00:16:37.273
Are you okay?

00:16:37.273 --> 00:16:39.006
(chuckling)

00:16:42.273 --> 00:16:44.073
(chuckling)

00:16:45.906 --> 00:16:47.106
Shay!

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:50.506
♪♪♪

00:16:51.906 --> 00:16:53.073
Phew!

00:16:53.073 --> 00:16:54.140
You'’’re okay!

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.873
Saya... you're safe.

00:16:57.873 --> 00:16:59.780
Thanks.

00:17:02.946 --> 00:17:04.446
(Shay groaning)

00:17:09.713 --> 00:17:11.946
(Yuya and Yuto)
Shay!

00:17:11.946 --> 00:17:13.846
Shay! Shay!

00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:15.913
Oh...

00:17:15.913 --> 00:17:18.546
(groaning)

00:17:18.546 --> 00:17:21.480
He'’’s hurt bad!

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.780
Hold it!
Huh?

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.180
You should worry more about
yourself than your friend.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.680
Chaos Ancient Gear Giant,

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.013
annihilate
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:17:34.813 --> 00:17:37.380
Aah...!

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.146
Oh, did you think
that was it?

00:17:39.146 --> 00:17:40.680
Well, you'’’re wrong!

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.846
Chaos Ancient Gear Giant
can attack all your monsters

00:17:43.846 --> 00:17:45.846
in a single turn!

00:17:45.846 --> 00:17:49.380
Next on its hit list,
Performapal Silver Claw!

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.546
I send Performapal
Inflater Tapir to the graveyard!

00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:55.946
By doing so, it creates
a barrier to protect us!

00:17:59.886 --> 00:18:00.953
(all gasp)

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.486
That changes nothing.

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:10.220
Since you only have
2,000 life points left,

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.686
when Chaos Ancient Gear Giant
destroys your Friendonkey,

00:18:13.686 --> 00:18:15.486
you'’’ll run
out of life points!

00:18:15.486 --> 00:18:17.320
And you will have lost!

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.853
Chaos Giant,
crush Friendonkey!

00:18:21.853 --> 00:18:24.153
Attack...!

00:18:34.986 --> 00:18:36.220
Thanks for that.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.353
I play Quick Guard!

00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:42.420
It switches Friendonkey
to defense mode.

00:18:45.253 --> 00:18:47.886
So Yuya doesn'’’t take
any damage.

00:18:47.886 --> 00:18:49.453
(Computer voice)
<i>Intrusion penalty.</i>

00:18:49.453 --> 00:18:51.386
<i>2,000 life points.</i>

00:18:51.386 --> 00:18:53.653
No way! Kite?

00:18:53.653 --> 00:18:56.353
So that'’’s the Kite
I heard so much about.

00:18:56.353 --> 00:18:58.320
He'’’s teaming up
with the Lancers?

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.086
Kite, huh?

00:19:00.086 --> 00:19:02.526
You'’’ll make a great prize
for the Professor.

00:19:02.526 --> 00:19:05.993
Sorry, but you'’’ll be
leaving... emptyhanded!

00:19:05.993 --> 00:19:07.560
I summon Cipher Wing!

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.426
You'’’re actually
gonna help me?

00:19:12.426 --> 00:19:14.626
You got a problem
with that?

00:19:14.626 --> 00:19:16.360
Just go see if Shay'’’s okay.

00:19:17.893 --> 00:19:20.560
Now when Cipher Wing
is out on my field,

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.360
I can summon two more
Cipher Wings from my hand!

00:19:27.826 --> 00:19:29.926
I tribute
one of these Cipher Wings

00:19:29.926 --> 00:19:33.560
so the levels of the other two
rise to Level 8!

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.926
Next, I'll Overlay
my two Level 8 Cipher Wings

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:40.360
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:19:41.793 --> 00:19:44.160
Now, by way
of the cosmic energies

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.426
that make up our galaxy,

00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:49.126
I'’’ll make
something just as mighty.

00:19:49.126 --> 00:19:50.593
I Xyz Summon!

00:19:50.593 --> 00:19:54.060
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:54.626
(roaring)

00:19:58.193 --> 00:20:00.066
And now I'll use

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:03.033
one of Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon's Overlay Units

00:20:03.033 --> 00:20:05.900
to activate its special ability!

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.300
Go, Cipher Subjection!

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:08.766
(roaring)

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.433
I gain control
of Chaos Ancient Gear Giant

00:20:13.433 --> 00:20:17.766
and transform it into another
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:20:17.766 --> 00:20:20.300
(C)
No! Chaos Giant!

00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:24.100
(Kite)
Next I play two spells.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.033
The first one
is Cipher Interference,

00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:28.933
the other Cipher Diffusion.

00:20:28.933 --> 00:20:30.633
With Cipher Diffusion,

00:20:30.633 --> 00:20:34.433
by lowering my Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon's attack points

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:36.733
from 3,000 to zero,

00:20:36.733 --> 00:20:38.433
my other Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon

00:20:38.433 --> 00:20:40.400
is allowed to attack
three times.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.933
So as this one dragon
powers all the way down,

00:20:43.933 --> 00:20:45.066
the other can attack

00:20:45.066 --> 00:20:48.000
each and every one
of you.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.133
Yeah? Even
with three attacks,

00:20:50.133 --> 00:20:52.300
it won't be
enough to win!

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.033
I have enough
life points to survive!

00:20:55.033 --> 00:20:57.466
Ah, but that'’’s what
Cipher Interference is for.

00:20:57.466 --> 00:20:59.506
When I have two Cipher
monsters on the field

00:20:59.506 --> 00:21:01.606
with the exact same name,

00:21:01.606 --> 00:21:05.173
I can then double one of their
attack points during battle.

00:21:05.173 --> 00:21:07.306
What?! That can't be!

00:21:07.306 --> 00:21:09.973
But it is,
so you'’’re all through!

00:21:09.973 --> 00:21:11.306
(all gasp)

00:21:11.306 --> 00:21:15.406
Now, Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon,
finish them off!

00:21:15.406 --> 00:21:18.140
Show Obelisk Force
what true force looks like!

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.006
Go, Cipher Stream
of Destruction!

00:21:21.006 --> 00:21:24.606
(all screaming)

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.540
(Obelisk Force groaning)

00:21:40.673 --> 00:21:43.706
(groaning)

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:46.006
No... please...

00:21:46.006 --> 00:21:48.240
Don'’’t turn me into a card.

00:21:50.906 --> 00:21:54.106
(Noro)
Great! Now I'm
really behind schedule!

00:21:54.106 --> 00:21:55.240
Aah!

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.080
I guess that he'’’s the strong
but silent type.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.613
(Grace)
Yuya sure did put on show,

00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:06.546
but this guy came along
and pretty much stole it.

00:22:09.046 --> 00:22:10.180
Huh?

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.113
My... what's going on here?

00:22:16.113 --> 00:22:18.313
(Aster Phoenix)
The time for fun and games
is over!

00:22:18.313 --> 00:22:21.380
Now, Yuya Sakaki...

00:22:22.746 --> 00:22:25.180
You and I have a date
with destiny!
