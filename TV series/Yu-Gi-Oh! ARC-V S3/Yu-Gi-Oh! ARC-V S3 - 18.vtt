WEBVTT

00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.033
(Yugo)
I'm so glad
you're okay, Rin.

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:04.633
It must have been terrible
being locked up in here.

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:06.366
I mean,
not as terrible

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.966
as not getting
to be around me,

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.033
not that you really
missed me or anything,

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:13.233
or wished I was here,
right?

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.066
(Rin)
Aw, you think too much.
Of course I wished

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.866
you were here, y' dope.

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.200
(laughing)
So I could do this!

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.966
Aah!

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.066
Uhh!

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.500
(Kite)
Shay! Aster!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.400
Hey, I guess you're
feeling better, Shay.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.800
You bet, and it's
all thanks to this guy.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.800
As soon as I was
given the all clear,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.333
I was ready to come
to Duel Academy

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.933
and rescue Lulu.

00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.000
Eh, Shay said
he didn't need any help,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.266
but I promised to
tag along just in case.

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.833
Aster says
they're holding Lulu

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:54.766
on top of that tower,
the one you just

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.466
fell from
without a parachute.

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:56.866
What happened up there?

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:01.606
It was Lulu, Shay.
She pushed me.

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:03.340
That can't be!

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.006
(Kite)
But it is.
Your sister's changed.

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:08.573
(sinister laughter)

00:01:08.573 --> 00:01:10.273
I don'’’t believe you!

00:01:10.273 --> 00:01:11.140
Lulu!

00:01:11.973 --> 00:01:13.906
No, Shay, wait up!

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:16.406
It sounds like
the Doctor got to her!

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:18.406
Who is this Doctor?

00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:21.506
He'’’s the Professor'’’s
right hand man,

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:23.773
an expert on
mind manipulation.

00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:27.873
So the Prof's
controlling Lulu's mind?

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:31.206
That means Rin could be
under his spell too!

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:35.140
You gotta move!
Head over to the East Tower.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.906
Find a guy named Yugo and
warn him before it's too late!

00:02:40.913 --> 00:02:44.346
Falling from a 10‐story
window isn't so bad,

00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:45.646
but the landing is.

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:48.080
Luckily,
something broke my fall.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.846
Huh?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.280
Aah!

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.713
It broke my fall, but I may
have broken my Duel Runner!

00:02:55.713 --> 00:02:58.980
No, no, no!
C'’’mon, work! Uhh!

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.486
If I had known, I would'’’ve
aimed for the pavement!

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:03.453
I hope there aren't
any dents or dings

00:03:03.453 --> 00:03:05.786
or I'll never forgive myself!

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:07.420
(Rin)
Forget about
that piece of scrap metal.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.153
You've got bigger problems!

00:03:10.153 --> 00:03:11.786
Scrap metal?

00:03:11.786 --> 00:03:13.853
RinRin, I can't believe

00:03:13.853 --> 00:03:16.653
you would say this
about our Duel Runner.

00:03:16.653 --> 00:03:18.953
Sure, I was
the brains behind it,

00:03:18.953 --> 00:03:21.086
but I never could'’’ve built it
without your help.

00:03:21.086 --> 00:03:23.853
C'mon, think back on how much
fun we had pouring over plans

00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:26.820
and how I was able to find
every bargain out there!

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.753
Together,
we made our dream come true.

00:03:28.753 --> 00:03:30.886
Yeah, it was
a nightmare sometimes,

00:03:30.886 --> 00:03:33.553
but in the end, we built
the ultimate dueling machine

00:03:33.553 --> 00:03:37.120
that we hoped could take us all
the way to the Friendship Cup!

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.586
Don't you remember?

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.586
Sound like
a pretty lame dream.

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:44.686
But you know
what isn't lame?

00:03:44.686 --> 00:03:46.453
Crushing you!

00:03:46.453 --> 00:03:49.720
(groaning)
You're so mean!

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.886
I guess some
things never change,

00:03:51.886 --> 00:03:58.120
so let'’’s settle this
the old fashioned way!

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.153
(both)
Let's duel!

00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:01.860
I'll make the first move.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.793
I'm activating the spell card
Chime of the Windwitch!

00:04:06.793 --> 00:04:10.626
Call my Windwitch Ice Bell
from the Northern Lands!

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:18.993
And then, I'll summon
a second Ice Bell!

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.326
My Ice Bell's
special ability

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:25.726
will put a chill
on your life points.

00:04:25.726 --> 00:04:27.560
With a wave
of her Winterwand,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.460
she'll send
a blast of frigid air

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.126
that weakens you
by 500 points!

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:35.626
(groaning)

00:04:35.626 --> 00:04:38.259
And what one can do,
so can the other.

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.060
(groaning)
So cold!

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.726
(groaning)

00:04:42.726 --> 00:04:45.026
She's used Ice Bell
1,000 times against me

00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:46.593
since we were kids,

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:48.560
and she also beat me
1,000 times with them!

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.560
Then you know
that when I have

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.460
at least two Windwitches
on my field,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.626
I can summon my Tuner Monster,
Windwitch Snow Bell!

00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:06.600
Level 1 Snow Bell tunes
my two level 3 Ice Bells!

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.600
I'm summoning a monster
that will hit you

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.933
with all the power of
a wicked wintertime blizzard!

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:16.200
I Synchro Summon!

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.666
Windwitch Winter Bell!

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.200
Unleash your frosty powers,
Winter Bell!

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.600
I can choose one Windwitch
in my graveyard

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.933
and activate
her special ability,

00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:32.233
and I choose Ice Bell,

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:36.566
letting me deal you
500 more points of damage!

00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:42.566
I place one face down
and end my turn.

00:05:42.566 --> 00:05:46.766
All right.
Yugo, it's your turn now.

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:49.200
Let's see if you're
still as bad a driver

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.566
as you are a duelist.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.266
Ah!

00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:55.666
Catch me if you can!

00:05:57.466 --> 00:06:00.700
If? There's
no doubt about it!

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.006
(thinking)
I don't what's gotten into Rin,

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:05.606
but whatever it is,
I gotta set her straight!

00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:07.806
Sure, she's gotten
mad at me before,

00:06:07.806 --> 00:06:10.406
but tossing me out a window
and dissing our runner,

00:06:10.406 --> 00:06:12.473
that's a whole new level
of mad.

00:06:12.473 --> 00:06:15.440
I know being locked up
wasn't any fun,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.373
but why are you
taking it out on me?

00:06:17.373 --> 00:06:18.640
(thinking)
Uhh! Whatever.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.440
At least I know she
hasn't totally changed.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.706
She's still playing
her usual cards,

00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:25.973
and that means the real Rin
is still inside her,

00:06:25.973 --> 00:06:28.440
and there's only one way
to get her back

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.440
and that's to defeat her
in this duel

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.940
and remind her
who she once was!

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.906
I draw!

00:06:34.906 --> 00:06:38.206
And I'’’ll start by trotting out
Speedroid Horse Stilts!

00:06:38.206 --> 00:06:39.606
Go!

00:06:43.573 --> 00:06:45.306
And my Horse Stilts
lets me summon

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:47.440
a Tuner Monster
from my stable,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.306
so roll on out,
Speedroid Tri‐Eyed Dice!

00:06:53.673 --> 00:06:56.506
Then I'll give my
level 3 Tri‐Eyed Dice

00:06:56.506 --> 00:06:58.973
and my level 4
Speedroid Horse Stilts

00:06:58.973 --> 00:07:00.546
a quick tune up!

00:07:02.913 --> 00:07:06.113
If this monster won't
bring Rin to her senses,

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:08.013
I don'’’t know what will!

00:07:08.013 --> 00:07:09.913
I Synchro Summon!

00:07:09.913 --> 00:07:13.446
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:07:17.046 --> 00:07:18.613
Remember, Rin?

00:07:18.613 --> 00:07:21.046
You loved Clear Wing
just as much as me.

00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:22.380
If it's not good enough

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.580
to bring you
back to your senses,

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.446
then maybe nothing is.

00:07:28.513 --> 00:07:30.146
You loved Clear Wing
just as much as me.

00:07:30.146 --> 00:07:31.446
If it's not good enough

00:07:31.446 --> 00:07:33.080
to bring you back
to your senses,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.580
then maybe nothing is.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.480
C'mon, Rin, think back!

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.380
Back to when you'd
cheer for us to win!

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.146
RinRin!

00:07:41.346 --> 00:07:44.680
I activate
my trap, Lost Wind!

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.613
It blows away Clear Wing's
special abilities

00:07:47.613 --> 00:07:50.446
and then slashes its
attack points in half!

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.146
My dragon! Not cool, Rin.
Not cool at all!

00:07:58.146 --> 00:07:59.780
(Doctor chuckling evilly)

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.420
(Doctor)
My Parasite is a greater
success than I imagined!

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.920
Once my Fusion Parasite worms
its way to the brain,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.586
it attaches
and thoroughly dissects

00:08:08.586 --> 00:08:10.186
every memory of its host.

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:12.020
By manipulating
this knowledge,

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.520
it takes complete control
of you, both body and mind.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.186
(sinister laughter)

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:20.853
And the best part of all,

00:08:20.853 --> 00:08:23.420
I programmed the Parasite
so that she would pledge

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.553
her eternal loyalty
to you, Professor.

00:08:26.553 --> 00:08:30.420
I applaud your efforts,
but I do have one concern.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.420
It's this‐‐ those girls
must be kept safe

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.086
for my Arc Area Project
to succeed.

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:38.153
No harm can come to them.

00:08:38.153 --> 00:08:40.486
I'm aware of
their importance, sir.

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:43.420
No harm will come to
the girls, I promise.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.986
My Parasite Monsters
will see to that!

00:08:45.986 --> 00:08:47.553
As for the other guests,

00:08:47.553 --> 00:08:50.386
they may not be
as fortunate.

00:08:52.753 --> 00:08:55.553
My dad should've reached
Duel Academy by now.

00:08:55.553 --> 00:08:57.320
I hope he's okay.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.686
So, like,
what's your dad's beef

00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:00.453
with the professor,
anyway?

00:09:00.453 --> 00:09:02.126
(Declan)
It all started with a promise

00:09:02.126 --> 00:09:04.526
Yusho made to me
three years ago,

00:09:04.526 --> 00:09:06.660
a promise that even
you don't know about, Yuya.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.160
To you?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.726
What kind o' promise?

00:09:09.726 --> 00:09:13.593
It all stems from my first trip
to the Fusion dimension.

00:09:13.593 --> 00:09:16.226
Yes, I've been here before.

00:09:16.226 --> 00:09:19.360
That's when I learned that
my father planned to invade,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.360
conquer, and unify
every existing dimension

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.493
in some misguided plan
for peace.

00:09:24.493 --> 00:09:27.293
I knew of only one
duelist skilled enough

00:09:27.293 --> 00:09:29.393
to conquer him, Yuya‐‐
your father.

00:09:29.393 --> 00:09:32.293
Your father promised
to stop mine,

00:09:32.293 --> 00:09:33.926
but he said he'd do it
his own way,

00:09:33.926 --> 00:09:35.260
whatever that meant,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.960
and I haven't
seen him since.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.393
I know what he meant.

00:09:39.393 --> 00:09:42.360
My dad wants to stop Leo
without having to fight,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.393
because that's
what my dad does.

00:09:45.393 --> 00:09:48.493
Yuya, your dad may be
overly optimistic

00:09:48.493 --> 00:09:50.493
if he thinks he can stop
Leo Akaba without a fight.

00:09:50.493 --> 00:09:52.426
How so?

00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:55.360
I didn't think much of
meeting Celina here years ago,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.326
but after meeting
you and Zuzu,

00:09:57.326 --> 00:09:59.860
one minor detail
from my past

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.066
suddenly became
more important.

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:04.266
What was it?
Yeah, spill it.

00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:06.300
(Declan)
I hacked my father's
computer to investigate

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.400
his experiments
in the Arc Area Project

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.733
and found a folder
labeled "Revival Zero."

00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:14.666
Revival... Zero?

00:10:14.666 --> 00:10:16.200
What's that
s'posed t' mean?

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.800
Reviving zero?
Sounds like hooey!

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.066
I'm afraid I don't have
any more insight

00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:23.500
than you do
on its meaning.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.466
What I do know
is that the folder

00:10:25.466 --> 00:10:28.700
contained two files.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.433
Bet one of 'em was Celina.

00:10:30.433 --> 00:10:32.133
(Declan)
That is correct.

00:10:32.133 --> 00:10:33.833
And as for
the other file...

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.466
Who was it, Declan?

00:10:35.466 --> 00:10:39.066
The other file was on a boy
by the name of Yuri,

00:10:39.066 --> 00:10:40.900
the boy
from this dimension

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.833
who looks
just like you, Yuya,

00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:44.866
and the one who tried
to kidnap Zuzu.

00:10:46.066 --> 00:10:48.100
He's bad news.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.200
(Declan)
I can only conclude
that Revival Zero

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.600
is at the heart
of the Arc Area Project,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.466
but how is unclear.

00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:58.033
What is clear is that
if he has a file on Yuri,

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.433
then, Yuya,
Revival Zero

00:10:59.433 --> 00:11:01.540
must have something
to do with you too.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.640
In fact, all versions
of you, Yuya,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.506
and all versions of Zuzu.

00:11:06.506 --> 00:11:10.140
Just great. This keeps
sounding worse and worse.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.006
Stay focused.
You have to!

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.973
Listen,
all of these details

00:11:15.973 --> 00:11:18.473
are actually
complicating matters,

00:11:18.473 --> 00:11:21.940
so let's keep this simple
and get back to basics.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.006
Leo has captured all four‐‐

00:11:24.006 --> 00:11:26.973
Zuzu, Lulu,
Rin and Celina‐‐

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:29.206
to execute
his Arc Area Project.

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:32.173
He needs them
or his plan will fail.

00:11:32.173 --> 00:11:34.106
I don't know why
and I don't care.

00:11:34.106 --> 00:11:36.340
All I care about
is stopping him,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.506
so Lancers, let's rescue
those four girls.

00:11:43.273 --> 00:11:45.073
If your mind's
been boggled,

00:11:45.073 --> 00:11:47.373
then I'll un‐boggle it
by winning this duel,

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.540
and not just by winning,
but by winning it my way!

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.240
No matter what it takes,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.073
I'll find a way to
bring the old Rin back!

00:11:55.073 --> 00:11:56.806
You will remember,

00:11:56.806 --> 00:12:00.146
and that's one promise
that I'll never forget!

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.746
(Doctor)
You can't save her...

00:12:04.746 --> 00:12:08.246
but watching you fail
should be quite amusing.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.146
You're going down!

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.580
(laughing)

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.580
Time to ice that dragon,
Winter Bell!

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.946
Attack!

00:12:29.646 --> 00:12:32.946
(groaning)
By banishing Tri‐Eyed
Dice from my graveyard,

00:12:32.946 --> 00:12:35.146
I'll save you, Clear Wing!

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.313
You're just delaying
the inevitable.

00:12:40.313 --> 00:12:43.580
I activate the spell card
Chime of the Windwitch!

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.213
It lets me summon
a monster from my hand

00:12:46.213 --> 00:12:48.880
whose level is lower
than my Winter Bell!

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.980
So I summon Fusion Parasite!

00:12:56.146 --> 00:12:58.213
Ew, gross!
Where'd that come from?

00:12:58.213 --> 00:13:01.886
That's not one
of your cards, Rin!

00:13:01.886 --> 00:13:03.786
You couldn't be
more wrong.

00:13:03.786 --> 00:13:05.053
This is the most
precious card I have.

00:13:05.053 --> 00:13:07.120
It's invaluable.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.653
I can use it to Fusion Summon
without Polymerization!

00:13:10.653 --> 00:13:12.253
You Fusion Summon?

00:13:12.253 --> 00:13:14.053
I do now!

00:13:14.053 --> 00:13:15.886
Watch as I fuse
Windwitch Winter Bell

00:13:15.886 --> 00:13:18.253
with my Fusion Parasite!

00:13:18.253 --> 00:13:21.120
These two are gonna
merge to form a monster

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.286
that'll send shivers
down your spine!

00:13:26.286 --> 00:13:29.020
I Fusion Summon!

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.086
Windwitch Crystal Bell!

00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:41.853
When did you start
using Fusion Monsters?

00:13:41.853 --> 00:13:43.986
Since I started wising up!

00:13:43.986 --> 00:13:46.520
When I use my Parasite
to Fusion Summon,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.553
it equips itself
onto Crystal Bell.

00:13:48.553 --> 00:13:50.353
What's wrong with you,
Rin? You're dueling

00:13:50.353 --> 00:13:52.653
like you're an honor
student at Duel Academy.

00:13:52.653 --> 00:13:56.020
(Doctor)
Ah, you're more right
than you realize.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.020
Rin is now fighting
on our side, dear boy,

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.726
so I'm afraid the girl
you once knew so well

00:14:01.726 --> 00:14:03.893
is never to return.

00:14:03.893 --> 00:14:05.460
Crystal Bell!

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.026
Attack Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.026
Aah!

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.326
(groaning)

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.493
Huh?

00:14:25.226 --> 00:14:26.626
(groaning)

00:14:26.626 --> 00:14:30.493
No! Our Duel Runner!

00:14:30.493 --> 00:14:32.826
You totaled it.

00:14:32.826 --> 00:14:35.993
It's not even
under warranty!

00:14:35.993 --> 00:14:38.926
Really, Yugo?
Tears for a bicycle?

00:14:38.926 --> 00:14:41.526
Who cares about
that hunk of junk?

00:14:41.526 --> 00:14:43.993
Hunk of junk?

00:14:43.993 --> 00:14:45.926
We spent weeks, months

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:47.793
building this hunk
of junk together

00:14:47.793 --> 00:14:49.660
because this was
gonna be our ticket

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.626
to having a real life!

00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:52.960
Riding this Duel Runner

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.693
was the only time
we felt free!

00:14:55.693 --> 00:14:56.993
You couldn't have
forgotten that!

00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:59.026
I know you haven'’’t!

00:14:59.026 --> 00:15:01.533
I really don't care, Yugo.

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:04.800
Crystal Bell lets me
use the special ability

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.900
of one monster
in my graveyard,

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.300
and I choose Ice Bell

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.633
to send a blast
of biting air

00:15:09.633 --> 00:15:11.933
directly at you,

00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:15.100
blasting away 500
more life points!

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.966
Aah!

00:15:19.366 --> 00:15:21.766
You're as bashed up
as that Duel Runner,

00:15:21.766 --> 00:15:25.000
while I
am in perfect shape.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.400
Your life points are
running on fumes.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.966
Face it.
You're through.

00:15:29.966 --> 00:15:32.900
So, I'll accept
your surrender now.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.566
Me, surrender?
I don't think so.

00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:37.866
If there's one thing

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:39.433
you should remember
about me,

00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:40.933
it's the fact

00:15:40.933 --> 00:15:44.366
that I don't give up,
no matter what!

00:15:44.366 --> 00:15:46.933
I traveled through
dimensions just for you,

00:15:46.933 --> 00:15:49.133
and you think
I'm gonna turn back

00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:52.500
when I'm this close
to the finish line?

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.800
(groaning)

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.700
If I did that,
the real Rin

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.066
would call me a loser!

00:16:02.606 --> 00:16:04.806
And I'm not a loser!

00:16:04.806 --> 00:16:08.273
But you will be
soon enough, Yugo.

00:16:08.273 --> 00:16:11.740
The poor boy still
thinks he can save Rin.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.873
I would admire his persistence
if it wasn't so pathetic.

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:16.240
I draw!

00:16:18.673 --> 00:16:19.906
Hmm!

00:16:19.906 --> 00:16:21.606
I'm summoning
the Tuner Monster

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:23.906
Speedroid Red‐Eyed Dice!

00:16:24.873 --> 00:16:26.506
Next, I activate

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:28.173
the spell card
Shadow Stepper

00:16:28.173 --> 00:16:30.373
and use your Windwitch
Crystal Bell

00:16:30.373 --> 00:16:31.973
to my advantage!

00:16:31.973 --> 00:16:34.306
You see, it lets me
bring back a monster

00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:36.273
from my graveyard
whose level is lower

00:16:36.273 --> 00:16:37.740
than your Crystal Bell!

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.673
So, Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon,

00:16:39.673 --> 00:16:41.340
you'’’re making a comeback!

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.340
(roaring)

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.740
I tune Red‐Eyed Dice

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.473
with Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon

00:16:47.473 --> 00:16:49.206
to pave the way

00:16:49.206 --> 00:16:51.506
for an even
mightier dragon!

00:16:51.506 --> 00:16:52.706
Watch as the essence

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:54.906
of that monster
takes shape.

00:16:54.906 --> 00:16:58.240
Watch as it is forged
by raw power!

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.646
I Synchro Summon!

00:17:00.646 --> 00:17:04.380
Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:04.946
(roaring)

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:12.746
(roaring)

00:17:15.713 --> 00:17:17.280
Now, let's do this!

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.846
Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon, attack!

00:17:21.846 --> 00:17:23.780
And due to
its special ability,

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.780
Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.846
gains your monster's
attack points!

00:17:30.946 --> 00:17:33.913
Fusion Monsters
aren'’’t your style,

00:17:33.913 --> 00:17:36.646
so my dragon's gonna 86 it!

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:38.880
So, watch out!

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.546
Swoop on in, Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:17:42.546 --> 00:17:44.480
You think
that's gonna work?

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.213
Guess you already forgot

00:17:46.213 --> 00:17:48.446
about Crystal Bell'’’s
special ability.

00:17:48.446 --> 00:17:50.780
I get to use
the special ability

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.413
of any monster
in our graveyards,

00:17:52.413 --> 00:17:54.246
and I choose

00:17:54.246 --> 00:17:57.613
your very own
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:17:57.613 --> 00:17:59.380
What?

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.353
I'm using your own monster's
ability against you

00:18:02.353 --> 00:18:03.686
to automatically destroy

00:18:03.686 --> 00:18:05.953
your Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:18:05.953 --> 00:18:07.953
Two can play
at that game!

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:10.953
Crystal Wing Synchro
Dragon's special ability

00:18:10.953 --> 00:18:13.286
destroys your monster
as well!

00:18:16.153 --> 00:18:18.720
I'’’m still
one step ahead of you.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.720
My Fusion Parasite
takes the fall

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.753
instead of my Crystal Bell!

00:18:23.753 --> 00:18:25.786
But my attack
still gets through!

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.586
Aah!

00:18:32.586 --> 00:18:33.786
(groaning)

00:18:36.886 --> 00:18:40.086
Rin, you okay?

00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:43.053
Listen, you're
gonna be all right!

00:18:43.053 --> 00:18:45.953
Just open your eyes
for me, okay?

00:18:45.953 --> 00:18:49.553
C'mon! Please, Rin!
Wake up!

00:18:49.553 --> 00:18:53.586
Yu... go.

00:18:54.453 --> 00:18:56.720
Thank goodness!

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.460
You had me worried,
like, for real.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.426
(relieved crying)

00:19:07.426 --> 00:19:09.393
Now we don't
have to fight anymore!

00:19:09.393 --> 00:19:10.626
(relieved crying)

00:19:10.626 --> 00:19:12.526
But why?
You and I are still

00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:13.726
in the middle of a duel.

00:19:13.726 --> 00:19:15.060
Huh?

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.626
When Crystal Bell
is destroyed,

00:19:16.626 --> 00:19:18.526
I can bring back
Winter Bell

00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:20.593
and Fusion Parasite
from my graveyard.

00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:22.160
RinRin?

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.226
(groaning)

00:19:25.193 --> 00:19:26.726
Fusion Parasite

00:19:26.726 --> 00:19:28.793
allows me to fuse
these two monsters

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:33.726
and summon Windwitch
Crystal Bell once again.

00:19:33.726 --> 00:19:36.660
Then, Fusion Parasite
equips itself

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.760
onto Crystal Bell.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.726
Aw, man, I thought
this was over!

00:19:41.726 --> 00:19:44.960
My Parasite has taken
complete control of her now!

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.160
There isn't anything that
Yugo can do to free her.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.226
Huh?

00:19:50.226 --> 00:19:51.626
You know what?

00:19:51.626 --> 00:19:52.993
I bet it's
that Fusion Parasite

00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:54.893
that's doing
a whack job on her!

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:58.193
The old Rin would never
use that slippery slug.

00:19:58.193 --> 00:19:59.793
She hates bugs!

00:19:59.793 --> 00:20:02.466
Crystal Bell's special
ability activates.

00:20:02.466 --> 00:20:04.833
I activate Ice Bell's
special ability

00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:08.100
from the graveyard to deal
you 500 points of damage

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.866
which will wipe out
all of your life points!

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:12.033
No, wait!

00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:14.100
Whoa!

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.766
(thudding)

00:20:23.466 --> 00:20:26.033
(groaning)

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:36.966
(panting)

00:20:36.966 --> 00:20:38.366
Celina!

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:40.666
What's gotten into you?

00:20:40.666 --> 00:20:42.833
You're supposed
to be on my side!

00:20:42.833 --> 00:20:45.633
On your side?
Get real!

00:20:45.633 --> 00:20:48.733
I'’’m working for
the Professor now.

00:20:52.466 --> 00:20:55.666
C'mon! Let me out!
Wait!

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.506
(Sylvio)
Really? No elevators? Really?

00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:07.306
Mm‐hmm. We could take the long
way 'round to Duel Academy,

00:21:07.306 --> 00:21:08.806
but it would take forever.

00:21:08.806 --> 00:21:10.606
Forever will
take too long,

00:21:10.606 --> 00:21:12.206
so what do ya say
we get some sweatin' in

00:21:12.206 --> 00:21:13.540
and go climb that cliff?

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.073
C'mon,
we're wasting time.

00:21:16.073 --> 00:21:17.940
The cliff it is.

00:21:19.206 --> 00:21:21.106
It's time to strike!

00:21:21.106 --> 00:21:22.606
(battle cries)
