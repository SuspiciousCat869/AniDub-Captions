WEBVTT

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.566
Previously
on <i>Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V...</i>

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.233
(Dragons roaring)

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:09.900
Grr!

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.166
(Yuri)
Let's cut to the chase
and reunite as one!

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.966
No way!

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:17.333
Deploy the Isolation Dome.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.733
(Yuya screaming,
Yuri laughing)

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.466
(Leo)
As I reunite the dimensions
and revive my daughter,

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.633
I cannot allow Yuya
to reunite into Z‐ARC.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:30.000
My Isolation Dome shields him
from the Reactor's energies.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.966
If you believe
in yourself,

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.033
your cards will
believe in you!

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.333
Now win this duel!

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.233
Concentrate on winning.

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:39.233
Yuri, this is it!

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.000
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.100
destroy Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon!

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.866
I lose.
(maniacal laughter)

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:56.533
All that's left to do
is stop the reactor.

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.266
I won, Declan.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.733
(deep voice)
Just like you wanted!

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.140
(all gasp)

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.573
You wanted a more brutal duel,
so I gave it to you!

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.540
Astrograph Sorcerer,
I call on you

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.840
to use your mystical powers
to reshape us

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.606
into a single
unstoppable force!

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:25.440
(Declan)
Those are
the other dimensions!

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.640
Look there!

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.440

(people gasping)

(boy)
What's that?!

00:02:45.713 --> 00:02:47.413
Don't panic.

00:02:47.413 --> 00:02:50.246
We'll be just fine
as long as we stay calm!

00:02:52.413 --> 00:02:55.780
That's a tear in the fabric
between dimensions

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.913
but which dimension
am I looking at?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.320
(Dragon roaring)

00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:09.086
(Z‐ARC laughing)

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:11.953
I'm back! Finally free!

00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:14.286
Hey!
Where's Yuya?

00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:16.786
Or should I say Z‐ARC?

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:18.186
He has to be
around here somewhere!

00:03:18.186 --> 00:03:21.420
(Z‐ARC)
Why the long faces?

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.820
It is I, Z‐ARC!

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.653
Didn't you wish
for my return?

00:03:27.653 --> 00:03:29.386
I didn't wish for nothin'!

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:30.753
The only thing
I wished for

00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:32.720
is that I'm still
in bed dreaming.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.453
Silence!
(all gasp)

00:03:34.453 --> 00:03:37.086
I'm back to give you
what you want.

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:40.253
A duel‐‐ a brutal duel‐‐
like no other!

00:03:41.786 --> 00:03:43.820
(all screaming)

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.820
This is nuts.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.420
Its power is
off the charts.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.020
Oh!

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.420
Come on!

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.853
No, wait!
I just heard from Ray!

00:03:55.853 --> 00:03:59.386
Riley, this isn't
the right time for that.

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:02.360
Getting to safety is
our number one priority.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.860
No, I really did!

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.793
She says that
she needs our help!

00:04:06.793 --> 00:04:08.193
What?

00:04:08.193 --> 00:04:09.660
She says that
she's the only one

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.026
who can stop Z‐ARC.

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:12.526
But there's no way
she can stop him

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:15.360
unless she revives,
like, right now!

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.393
Wait! Riley!

00:04:18.393 --> 00:04:21.026
Let's go find Z‐ARC
and stop him!

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:24.193
Right!

00:04:24.193 --> 00:04:26.926
I don't understand this!

00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:29.593
Why hasn't Ray revived?

00:04:29.593 --> 00:04:32.160
No!

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.893
I didn't provide the Arc Five
Reactor with enough energy!

00:04:35.893 --> 00:04:38.393
I can't believe this.

00:04:38.393 --> 00:04:41.193
She's gone... forever.

00:04:41.193 --> 00:04:43.126
(Z‐ARC)
Duel me!

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:45.193
Ha ha!
Come on, duel me!

00:04:45.193 --> 00:04:48.260
(maniacal laughter)

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.793
Who has the courage
to challenge the mighty Z‐ARC?

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.826
The dorms needed
a renovation,

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:57.326
but not like this.

00:04:57.326 --> 00:05:00.626
This is horrible.
And it's our fault.

00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:03.400
The Professor sold us
on the grand idea

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.266
of reuniting the dimensions
into a peaceful new world,

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:09.100
and we bought it hook,
line, and sinker.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.533
But everything we did
has led to this,

00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:13.300
the end of everything.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.366
But you wanna know
something else, Sora?

00:05:15.366 --> 00:05:18.666
It's not too late to
make up for our mistakes.

00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:21.566
I know we can stop Z‐ARC,

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:24.033
but only if we
work together.

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:26.500
You are gonna help me,
right, Sora?

00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:31.766
Not a chance!

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:34.666
But if you wanna help me
take down Z‐ARC,

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:36.866
then I'm all in.

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:40.366
(people shouting)

00:05:40.366 --> 00:05:41.733
(man)
Let's get out of here!

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:44.100
(Z‐ARC)
Where do you think
you're going?

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.833
There's nowhere to run!
(laughing)

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:51.400
Duel or be destroyed!

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.200
(roaring)

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:57.233
(all screaming)

00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:03.573
(Z‐ARC)
Duel or be destroyed!

00:06:03.573 --> 00:06:06.106
(laughing)

00:06:06.106 --> 00:06:07.573
(all screaming)

00:06:07.573 --> 00:06:09.140
(Aster)
I don't think so!

00:06:11.373 --> 00:06:13.140
(groaning)

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.206
Z‐ARC, your dragon's
breath won't get past us!

00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:21.373
Yeah, but it still sure
could use a breath mint.

00:06:21.373 --> 00:06:23.506
(laughing)
Finally!

00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:25.073
An adversary!

00:06:25.073 --> 00:06:28.673
(maniacal laughter)

00:06:28.673 --> 00:06:31.473
(people screaming)

00:06:34.573 --> 00:06:38.440
Ohh... was that supposed
to impress us?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.973
(Aster)
Don't know, but Yuya
sure looks different.

00:06:42.973 --> 00:06:45.373
Don't mistake me
for that fool.

00:06:45.373 --> 00:06:47.306
There is no Yuya.

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:50.773
He's gone forever
and now there is only I, Z‐ARC!

00:06:50.773 --> 00:06:52.740
Yuya's gone for good?

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.306
Well, I guess
he smacked you hard

00:06:54.306 --> 00:06:56.473
with the ugly stick
on the way out.

00:06:56.473 --> 00:06:58.073
That's right!

00:06:58.073 --> 00:06:59.840
It's like he's half‐man,
half‐monster,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.680
but 100% hideous.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.113
You talk a lot of trash,

00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:06.480
but let's see if your skills
are trash.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.580
I'm looking forward
to a challenge,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.613
so I'll give you a handicap.

00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:12.746
I'll let you duel me
two‐on‐one.

00:07:12.746 --> 00:07:14.613
(both)
Say what?!

00:07:14.613 --> 00:07:17.613
After all these years,
I can duel again.

00:07:17.613 --> 00:07:19.846
And you two will be
my first victims...

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:22.913
but you will not be the last.

00:07:22.913 --> 00:07:26.813
(computer voice)
Generating
Action Field Crossover.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.846
(all)
Time to duel!

00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:30.646
I will go first!

00:07:30.646 --> 00:07:33.346
Now you'll see
why I stand alone

00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:37.046
as the ultimate duelist
in the universe!

00:07:37.046 --> 00:07:40.313
I use Scale Zero
Supreme King Gate Zero

00:07:40.313 --> 00:07:43.546
and Scale 13
Supreme King Gate Infinity

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.613
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:50.246
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now.

00:07:50.246 --> 00:07:53.213
Now I can summon
as many monsters as I want

00:07:53.213 --> 00:07:55.480
between Levels 1 and 12.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.113
Levels 1 through 12?

00:07:57.113 --> 00:07:59.646
That means he can
summon any monster!

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.720
I Pendulum Summon...

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.420
a pair of monsters worthy
of the Supreme Ruler!

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.753
A pair of Supreme King
Dragon Darkwurms!

00:08:10.753 --> 00:08:13.386
With that, I'll end my turn.

00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:15.386
He's knows how
to Pendulum Summon.

00:08:15.386 --> 00:08:17.453
Like Yuya.

00:08:17.453 --> 00:08:19.986
Z‐ARC must've
gotten those skills
when he absorbed him.

00:08:19.986 --> 00:08:22.920
Yeah, but that
must mean that Yuya

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.253
is still alive
somewhere inside Z‐ARC.

00:08:25.253 --> 00:08:27.220
We gotta find a way
to bring him out!

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.853
If we weaken Z‐ARC,
that might

00:08:28.853 --> 00:08:31.086
break his spirit enough
to set Yuya free!

00:08:31.086 --> 00:08:34.086
There's only one way
to find out!

00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:38.186
I'm activating the spell
card Polymerization!

00:08:38.186 --> 00:08:41.486
So now I can fuse
my Destiny Hero Decider

00:08:41.486 --> 00:08:45.020
and my Destiny Hero
Drilldark together!

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.753
With the help
of this next monster,

00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:48.120
your fate's about to take

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.020
a terrifying turn
for the worse!

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.286
I Fusion Summon

00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:57.086
Destiny Hero Dystopia!

00:08:59.793 --> 00:09:03.160
(roars)

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.726
Dystopia's special ability
blasts you with damage

00:09:06.726 --> 00:09:09.793
equal to Destiny Hero
Decider's attack points!

00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:12.693
(roars)

00:09:12.693 --> 00:09:15.993
It's charming how you think
that would work against me.

00:09:15.993 --> 00:09:18.560
When I have a Supreme King
on my field,

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.693
Gate Zero stops you
from dealing any damage to me.

00:09:21.693 --> 00:09:24.093
I don't know how we're
gonna win this duel,

00:09:24.093 --> 00:09:26.426
if we can't deal
any damage to him.

00:09:26.426 --> 00:09:28.026
Oh, that's not all.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:30.126
Due to Gate Infinity's
Pendulum ability,

00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:32.993
I gain life points equal to
the damage I would have taken.

00:09:32.993 --> 00:09:34.726
So thanks for the assist.

00:09:34.726 --> 00:09:36.793
Yeah, yeah, lucky move.

00:09:36.793 --> 00:09:38.593
And you think
you're all that!

00:09:38.593 --> 00:09:40.426
But you're nothing
but just all talk!

00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:42.293
Here's why.

00:09:42.293 --> 00:09:44.193
You might have stopped
Dystopia's ability,

00:09:44.193 --> 00:09:45.993
but you can't
stop his attack!

00:09:45.993 --> 00:09:48.060
Go Dystopia!
Destroy his Darkwurm!

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.993
(roars)

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:53.493
I'm afraid
that won't work either.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:55.926
When I have a Supreme King
on my field,

00:09:55.926 --> 00:09:58.293
Darkwurm can sidestep
your attack.

00:09:58.293 --> 00:10:01.466
(roars)

00:10:01.466 --> 00:10:03.066
Then how about this?

00:10:03.066 --> 00:10:06.266
I'm gonna activate
the spell card D‐Soul Burst!

00:10:06.266 --> 00:10:08.833
By cutting Dystopia's
attack in half,

00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:13.700
we both take
1400 points of damage!

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.533
Not today.

00:10:15.533 --> 00:10:18.800
You foolishly thought
that my Gate Zero's ability

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.900
protects me from damage
only once,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.600
but it lasts forever!

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.300
So you only hurt yourself!

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.600
Unh!

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.666
Maybe, but you know what?

00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:31.900
With every move you make,
I'm learning more

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.766
and more about
your strategies

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:36.300
and it's only
a matter of time
until I figure it out.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.133
Well, then here's
another lesson.

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:41.000
I can use Gate Infinity's
Pendulum ability

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.100
over and over
to increase my life points.

00:10:47.966 --> 00:10:53.033
Okay, this duel isn't going
exactly as I planned...

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:56.333
but I still got time
to turn this around.

00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:59.200
Whenever my Dystopia's
attack points change,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.473
its special
ability automatically

00:11:01.473 --> 00:11:03.173
destroys your monster!

00:11:03.173 --> 00:11:05.040
(roars)

00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:11.340
(chuckling)

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.840
Well, that's all I can do.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.173
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:11:17.173 --> 00:11:20.140
Sora, I hope you have
better luck than me.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.506
Don't you worry a hair.
I got this.

00:11:23.506 --> 00:11:25.373
If anyone
can set Yuya free,

00:11:25.373 --> 00:11:26.973
it's yours truly!

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:28.840
Here I go!

00:11:34.173 --> 00:11:36.206
(Z‐ARC laughing)

00:11:36.206 --> 00:11:39.540
(Sora's voice)
I know Yuya's
trapped inside Z‐ARC.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.373
I just gotta wake him up!
I just gotta.

00:11:43.373 --> 00:11:46.140
I activate
Frightfur Sanctuary.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.040
In order for
this spell to work,

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.740
I have to send three
Frightfurs to the Graveyard,

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.206
one from my hand
and two from my Extra Deck.

00:11:53.206 --> 00:11:56.673
So I'm tossing
Edge Imp Frightfuloid,

00:11:56.673 --> 00:12:01.846
Frightfur bear, and Frightfur
Tiger into the Graveyard.

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.946
But it's not a total loss,

00:12:03.946 --> 00:12:06.280
'cause I have a spell
that lets me fuse monsters

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.913
that are in my Graveyard.

00:12:07.913 --> 00:12:10.280
So now I'll activate the spell
card Frightfur Fusion!

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.313
Fury of bear, king of the
jungle, stuffing of pain,

00:12:14.313 --> 00:12:17.013
when the three come together,
victory is attained!

00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:22.413
Make way
for my mighty mash‐up!

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.746
I Fusion Summon!

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:31.313
Here comes the hairy,
scary, bear‐y

00:12:31.313 --> 00:12:32.680
Frightfur Chimera!

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.380
(Chimera laughing)

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.946
My Chimera took down

00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:39.846
a bunch of your
monsters before, Yuya,

00:12:39.846 --> 00:12:41.946
and this time, it's
gonna have the pleasure

00:12:41.946 --> 00:12:44.780
of blasting
away your Darkwurm!

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.280
(Z‐ARC)
Ha! But my Gate Zero

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.113
still soaks up
all your damage.

00:12:53.113 --> 00:12:56.646
In fact, I regain
more life points instead,

00:12:56.646 --> 00:12:58.780
becoming even
more powerful!

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.553
Wasn't exactly
your best move, Sora.

00:13:03.686 --> 00:13:05.653
You think?

00:13:05.653 --> 00:13:08.753
But Z‐ARC‐y boy over there
totally knows what's up next!

00:13:08.753 --> 00:13:11.953
When Frightfur Chimera
destroys a monster

00:13:11.953 --> 00:13:13.786
and sends it
to the Graveyard,

00:13:13.786 --> 00:13:16.420
it's summoned
onto my field!

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.386
Darkwurm is
a Pendulum Monster,

00:13:19.386 --> 00:13:21.486
so it doesn't go
to the Graveyard.

00:13:21.486 --> 00:13:23.120
It goes
to the Extra Deck.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.586
So you don't get
to have it.

00:13:24.586 --> 00:13:26.253
Yeah, I know!

00:13:26.253 --> 00:13:28.753
Because you did the same
move to me before, Yuya.

00:13:28.753 --> 00:13:30.353
Remember?

00:13:30.353 --> 00:13:31.986
When ODD‐EYES
was destroyed,

00:13:31.986 --> 00:13:34.086
it didn't end up
in the Graveyard.

00:13:34.086 --> 00:13:37.720
It's with me...
here in my Extra Deck!

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.020
By the way...
you dropped something.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.220
(Yuya yelling)

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.686
It's your pendant!

00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:53.786
The Yuya I know
would never let it
out of his hands.

00:13:53.786 --> 00:13:56.253
You gotta remember
who you really are!

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.660
Huh?

00:14:05.393 --> 00:14:07.460
I'm not giving up
on you, Yuya.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.426
I end my turn.

00:14:11.426 --> 00:14:16.226
Finally!
Ah!

00:14:16.226 --> 00:14:17.993
You went
through all the trouble

00:14:17.993 --> 00:14:19.993
of destroying
my Darkwurms,

00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:21.993
but I'm bringing them back!

00:14:27.493 --> 00:14:30.960
You've gone and triggered
my trap‐‐ D‐Hyper Nova!

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.893
If you Pendulum Summon

00:14:32.893 --> 00:14:34.726
while I have
a Destiny Hero
on my field,

00:14:34.726 --> 00:14:37.226
all of your monsters
are instantly destroyed!

00:14:37.226 --> 00:14:40.026
So your Darkwurms can go
and wiggle around

00:14:40.026 --> 00:14:42.593
with the earthworms
in your Graveyard!

00:14:42.593 --> 00:14:44.826
Since I have
a Frightfur on my field,

00:14:44.826 --> 00:14:46.993
not only are your
Darkwurms destroyed,

00:14:46.993 --> 00:14:49.893
but all the cards
on your field!

00:14:49.893 --> 00:14:52.860
And you take 500 points
of damage for each one!

00:14:55.593 --> 00:14:57.460
That means you can't
use your Gates

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.960
to save you anymore!

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.133
Yes!
That's teamwork!

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.666
Now without those Gates
to protect him,

00:15:12.666 --> 00:15:14.200
we can damage him again.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.400
And if weaken Z‐ARC,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.166
we might free Yuya
from his clutches!

00:15:18.166 --> 00:15:19.533
(chuckling softly)

00:15:19.533 --> 00:15:21.900
I thought you were amateurs,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.466
and you've only
proven me correct.

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:27.500
You actually thought
you were stifling me

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.533
when all you did
was stifle yourself!

00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:32.066
How's that?
You're wide open now.

00:15:32.066 --> 00:15:33.833
But I won't be for long,

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:35.966
because by destroying
my cards,

00:15:35.966 --> 00:15:37.833
you've actually allowed me
to summon

00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:40.000
this monster from my hand!

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.133
My most skillful servant,

00:15:42.133 --> 00:15:45.166
a sorcerer that has unlocked
all the secrets

00:15:45.166 --> 00:15:46.900
of space and time...

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.566
Now he'll use
that knowledge...

00:15:48.566 --> 00:15:51.133
in order to carry out
my bidding!

00:15:51.133 --> 00:15:53.633
Astrograph Sorcerer appear!

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.240
I have seen that before.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.840
(Sora)
It showed up
when Yuya went bonkers!

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.840
(Z‐ARC yelling)

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.240
My Astrograph Sorcerer can
manipulate time and space...

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.606
and restore all the cards
that you destroyed!

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.373
Oh man, all that work
for nothing.

00:16:25.373 --> 00:16:29.440
(laughing)

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.173
Watch out.

00:16:31.173 --> 00:16:33.273
My gut's telling me
this is bad news!

00:16:33.273 --> 00:16:35.373
(lollipop crunches)

00:16:35.373 --> 00:16:38.206
It is time to unleash
my full power

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.340
and wish you
a frightful farewell.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.740
I banish
Astrograph Sorcerer,

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.806
along with my four legendary
dragons in my deck,

00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:48.273
to unlock
their full potential!

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:52.373
Fulfill my destiny,
Astrograph Sorcerer!

00:16:52.373 --> 00:16:54.406
Channel the energies

00:16:54.406 --> 00:16:56.973
of my Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon,

00:16:56.973 --> 00:16:59.773
my Clear Wing Synchro Dragon,

00:16:59.773 --> 00:17:02.280
my Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon,

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.413
and my Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:17:05.413 --> 00:17:07.980
Let the reunion begin!

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.813
(Z‐ARC laughing maniacally)

00:17:23.613 --> 00:17:25.546
What's Z‐ARC doing?

00:17:25.546 --> 00:17:27.480
I don't think
I wanna find out.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.146
I'm not one
to run and hide,

00:17:32.146 --> 00:17:35.246
but I'm thinking
we better move it
before we lose it!

00:17:40.513 --> 00:17:43.813
One thing I know‐‐
a red sky is never good.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.080
Look!
Over there!

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.713
It's Aster and Sora!

00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:51.046
(Shay)
And... Yuya?

00:17:51.046 --> 00:17:52.313
At least
I think that's Yuya.

00:17:52.313 --> 00:17:54.780
No, that's gotta be Z‐ARC

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.180
And if he's back,
that's bad news!

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.086
Hey, Shay,
you up for a fight?

00:18:00.086 --> 00:18:02.720
(Z‐ARC)
One merciless dragon

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.386
to rule over all others.

00:18:05.386 --> 00:18:09.886
Merge with me and we will
dominate every dimension!

00:18:09.886 --> 00:18:13.086
Let us reunite!

00:18:13.086 --> 00:18:15.786
Reunite as one!

00:18:35.453 --> 00:18:38.386
The ultimate union
of man and monster!

00:18:38.386 --> 00:18:41.886
Pendulum, Xyz,
Synchro, Fusion!

00:18:41.886 --> 00:18:44.020
All these powers are mine!

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.620
With the mightiest power

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.720
of each of the four dimensions
combined into one!

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.686
(roaring)

00:18:50.686 --> 00:18:53.753
Together, we are
Supreme King Z‐ARC!

00:18:53.753 --> 00:18:55.420
Unreal!

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.886
He fused together
with his monster!

00:18:58.886 --> 00:19:01.960
(Aster)
I don't think any of us
were prepared for this!

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.226
With one last attack,
you're finished!

00:19:06.226 --> 00:19:09.560
(computer voice)
Action cards dispersed.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.993
Ah!

00:19:13.426 --> 00:19:17.093
Intrusion penalty:
2000 life points.

00:19:17.093 --> 00:19:19.193
It's Kite!
And Shay!

00:19:19.193 --> 00:19:20.993
My my!

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.393
A couple more pests
have crashed the party.

00:19:23.393 --> 00:19:25.960
I'll deal with you next...

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.960
which won't be long now!

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.926
Because with my arrival,

00:19:30.926 --> 00:19:33.060
all your monsters
are destroyed!

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.826
All of 'em?!
Oh no!

00:19:34.826 --> 00:19:36.360
This is bad.

00:19:39.026 --> 00:19:42.726
And you take damage equal
to their attack points!

00:19:42.726 --> 00:19:46.060
And that's terrible news for
the both of you, now isn't it?

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.493
(both gasp)

00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:50.860
Dystopia has
1400 attack points...

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.026
while Frightfur Chimera
has 2800!

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:57.593
Together, that's
4200 points of damage!

00:19:57.593 --> 00:19:59.966
Which adds up
to your downfall!

00:20:02.766 --> 00:20:06.166
Aah!

00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:09.600
Aah!

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.900
Unh!

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.500
Unh! Ahh!

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.800
(both gasp)
Sora!

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.133
Unh...

00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:24.533
Aster, you take a break.

00:20:24.533 --> 00:20:25.933
You deserve one.

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:27.766
Leave the rest to me.

00:20:27.766 --> 00:20:30.400
Just be careful.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.933
Z‐ARC's power is unlike
anything I've ever faced

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:37.066
in this or any dimension.

00:20:37.066 --> 00:20:39.900
Shay, I know Yuya's
still alive.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.300
You gotta save him.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.566
Please, Shay.

00:20:48.566 --> 00:20:51.000
You have... to...

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.766
bring him... back.

00:20:55.866 --> 00:20:58.906
Sora, don't worry
about a thing.

00:21:04.773 --> 00:21:07.273
So you're my next victims.

00:21:08.206 --> 00:21:10.206
No chance.

00:21:10.206 --> 00:21:12.340
Kite and I are
taking you down, Z‐ARC.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.440
And saving... our friends!
