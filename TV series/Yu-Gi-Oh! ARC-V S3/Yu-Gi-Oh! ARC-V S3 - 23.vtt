00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.333
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:05.966
(Yuya)
Is that...

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.700
Jack Atlas!

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.533
I Synchro Summon!

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.966
Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:14.866
Go time!

(groaning)

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.166
(Sanders)
Don't you realize that
everything you do

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.066
reflects on me?!

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.366
Sanders shouldn'’’t be
riding BB so hard.

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.533
Do what you'’’ve been told
and crush those Lancers!

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.200
Especially...

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.233
that no‐good lily‐livered,
Dueltainer Yuya Sakaki!

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.433
He needs to be captured

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.400
so Revival Zero
can succeed!

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.366
(gasping)

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.200
I am losing patience!

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.700
If you don't
do as I say,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.233
then, BB... you're going
two‐dimensional!

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.666
Me destroy Gladiator
Beast Tamer Editor itself!

(gasping)

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.833
So Sergeant now be the one
taking the damage

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:56.566
from crack of
Editor's whip!

00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.233

Shay!

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:18.979
What'’’s wrong?

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:20.113
Please wake up!

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480
(groaning)

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:26.646
Whoa!

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:27.913
He'’’s toast!

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.846
(groaning)

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.346
Why, you...

00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:38.013
Have you gone rabid?!

00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:39.246
Why did you
attack me?

00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:41.013
(breathing heavily)

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.080
BB!

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.780
He'’’s lost it!

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.380
Sanders pushed him
too far.

00:02:51.513 --> 00:02:53.646
Whoa, did you
all see that?

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:56.046
I don'’’t think that
was in the lesson plan!

00:02:56.046 --> 00:02:58.513
I knew that
BB wasn'’’t tame

00:02:58.513 --> 00:03:00.253
but to suddenly go and turn on
your own teammate like that?

00:03:00.253 --> 00:03:02.053
Oh man,

00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:03.953
that takes a special
kind of savagery!

00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:08.720
The kind Sanders
is always telling us to use!

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.886
Although I'’’m not exactly sure
that he meant against him.

00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:12.420
I dunno.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.053
He always
told us that in a duel,

00:03:14.053 --> 00:03:15.420
only the strongest
should prevail.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.053
It looks like the sarge

00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:18.520
finally met
his match with BB!

00:03:20.453 --> 00:03:22.020
(shouting)

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.953
(gasping)

00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:28.520
Wait, BB, no!

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.586
Ahh!

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:30.853
Yuya!

00:03:30.853 --> 00:03:31.886
(grunting)

00:03:33.353 --> 00:03:34.420
Listen.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.186
I know you'’’re mad.

00:03:36.186 --> 00:03:37.586
But you can'’’t
let it control you!

00:03:38.553 --> 00:03:38.953
What?

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.686
(Yuya)
You can'’’t let your
wild side overwhelm you.

00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:44.753
I know that deep
in your heart,

00:03:44.753 --> 00:03:46.486
you really
don'’’t want to fight.

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:47.786
You wrong!

00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:49.120
You know me not!

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.886
Yeah, I do!

00:03:50.886 --> 00:03:53.420
Because I used to be
a lot like you!

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.086
So then Yuya used to
not bathe for months?

00:03:56.086 --> 00:03:57.886
Maybe not
exactly like you

00:03:57.886 --> 00:03:59.686
but I know why you
built this fort.

00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:01.326
See, I know because
it's the exact same reason

00:04:01.326 --> 00:04:02.726
that I have my goggles.

00:04:05.293 --> 00:04:06.793
It's a way for both of us

00:04:06.793 --> 00:04:09.060
to shield ourselves from
the outside world...

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.326
a world that doesn'’’t
always understand who we are.

00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:14.926
Like how Sanders doesn't
understand you,

00:04:14.926 --> 00:04:16.726
so you lash out
because you're sick of him

00:04:16.726 --> 00:04:17.960
barking orders!

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.526
So then...

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.526
BB's wild side is
a result of always

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:24.260
being shouted at
by Sanders?

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.626
Makes sense.

00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:26.893
And now it
looks like he's finally

00:04:26.893 --> 00:04:28.093
taking a major stand!

00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:32.293
And Sanders is gonna
get a major beat down!

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:33.259
This could get ugly!

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.259
(BB grunting)

00:04:43.726 --> 00:04:46.060
Yuya, you right.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.793
You do know BB.

00:04:47.793 --> 00:04:50.160
But just because
me and you have stuff in common

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.293
do not mean Sanders
walk away!

00:04:52.293 --> 00:04:53.726
Me have taken
all me can take!

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:54.793
Now Sergeant pay!

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:55.760
Don'’’t do it!

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.426
Do not interfere!

00:04:57.426 --> 00:04:57.726
(gasping)

00:04:59.526 --> 00:05:02.133
(student)
Yeah, this is between
the sarge and BB!

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:03.766
And only the strongest
one of them

00:05:03.766 --> 00:05:05.733
deserves to
fight another day!

00:05:05.733 --> 00:05:07.233
That'’’s what we were taught
and that's what we believe!

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:08.233
That'’’s right!

00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:09.400
That'’’s right!

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.833
Only the strongest

No, listen...

You got it
all wrong!

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:23.033
Well, those guys...
sound like they need a hug.

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:25.266

would solve anything.

waiting for?

so go ahead and turn
me into a card already!

You want me to?

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.266
But not before I give
you one final order.

Order?

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:47.233
That'’’s right, so you better
listen up, soldier.

00:05:47.233 --> 00:05:50.300
I locked you in
a cage to toughen you up.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.666
My job was to turn a scared
little mouse of a man

into a lion.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.866

The time for action
is now, soldier!

The only way
you'll truly be free

00:06:22.106 --> 00:06:24.240
is if you defeat your
enemy, Yuya!

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.613
How about a trap?!

00:07:31.613 --> 00:07:33.146
A trap?

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:34.680
(grunting)

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.980
By giving up
half my life points...

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:40.080
... Red Gazer allows
Yuya to keep all of his!

00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:44.080
Plus, I can summon
a Red Token in defense mode!

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.380
Thanks!

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.146
I owe ya!

00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:49.146
Atlas with the save!

00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:50.513
(sighing)

00:07:50.513 --> 00:07:53.213
Just like how Crow...
saved all of us.

00:07:57.513 --> 00:07:58.713
No!

00:07:58.713 --> 00:08:00.086
Not fair!

00:08:00.086 --> 00:08:01.453
Not fair!

00:08:01.453 --> 00:08:03.020
(groaning)

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.120
I can't believe
that Neanderthal

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.286
messed things up again‐‐
just pathetic.

00:08:08.953 --> 00:08:10.886
You may have
survived this turn,

00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:12.020
but you won'’’t
next turn!

00:08:13.753 --> 00:08:16.986
When no monsters
in me forts, me can assign

00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:19.286
new Gladiator Beast
to man forts.

00:08:21.686 --> 00:08:24.286
Augustus,
go right fort!

00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:26.686
Laquari, go left fort!

00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:28.486
Me end turn!

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:31.953
What happened to turning
Sarge into a card?

00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:33.020
Yeah, turn him
into a card!

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.953
A card!

00:08:33.953 --> 00:08:35.853
A card!

00:08:35.853 --> 00:08:39.420
(all)
A card, a card,
a card, a card...

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.353
That'’’s not what
dueling'’’s about!

00:08:41.353 --> 00:08:43.053
They don'’’t
hear you, Yuya.

00:08:43.053 --> 00:08:44.786
Their bloods boiling,

00:08:44.786 --> 00:08:47.586
and snapping them out of
their fever won't be easy.

00:08:47.586 --> 00:08:49.453
They've been barked at for
who knows how long

00:08:49.453 --> 00:08:50.453
so words
aren'’’t gonna work.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.720
So sad.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.186
Yeah.

00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:55.553
Time to bring them
to their senses.

00:08:57.053 --> 00:08:57.786
My turn!

00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:00.860
Perfect.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.393
The Tuner Monster
Double Resonator

00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:03.626
is just what I need

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.160
to kick this duel
back into overdrive!

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.660
Double Resonator
transforms my Red Token

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.960
into a Tuner Monster too!

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.226
Now Jack has
two Tuner Monsters.

00:09:14.226 --> 00:09:15.726
I know what's up next!

00:09:15.726 --> 00:09:18.060
I'’’m about to put the pedal
to the metal!

00:09:24.193 --> 00:09:27.660
Now my Level 1 Red Token
and Double Resonator tunes my

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.526
Level 8 Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:32.093
Go double tuning!

00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:33.426
Double tuning?

00:09:35.293 --> 00:09:38.660
Together these monsters will
call forth an absolute power

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.593
destined to
rule this duel!

00:09:43.793 --> 00:09:45.426
I Synchro Summon!

00:09:45.426 --> 00:09:47.693
Bow down and tremble
in terror before

00:09:47.693 --> 00:09:49.426
Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:03.900
Your chances of beating me
were zero percent before...

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.100
but they'’’re even worse now!

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.933
Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend's
special ability activates!

00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:12.366
All other cards on
the field are destroyed!

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.966
(grumbling)

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:16.900
Go, Absolute
Power Inferno!

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.600
Ahh!

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.166
(student)
Look at that fire power!

00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:30.900
(all)
Whoa...

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.966
(student)
Look at it,
it's incredible!

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.000
(grunting)

00:10:36.066 --> 00:10:37.566
He got rid of everything!

00:10:37.566 --> 00:10:39.500
I'm not sure if Yuya
appreciated that.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.666
Well, Yuya's
a team player, Sylvio.

00:10:41.666 --> 00:10:43.900
He'll understand that Jack
had to do what he had to do.

00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:47.733
BB is completely
defenseless!

00:10:47.733 --> 00:10:49.366
(rumbling)
(gasping)

00:11:03.906 --> 00:11:04.840
Now what?

00:11:09.806 --> 00:11:11.273
(Sylvio)
Whoa, looks like BB's

00:11:11.273 --> 00:11:13.073
hut got an upgrade!

00:11:13.073 --> 00:11:15.506
(BB)
When me Gladiator Beast's
Assault Fort blow up,

00:11:15.506 --> 00:11:18.206
me can destroy
all my cards to activate

00:11:18.206 --> 00:11:20.306
Gladiator Beast's
Great Fortress!

00:11:20.306 --> 00:11:22.006
Great Fortress?

00:11:22.006 --> 00:11:23.273
Huh.

00:11:23.273 --> 00:11:25.406
Doesn'’’t look all
that great to me.

00:11:25.406 --> 00:11:27.273
Hey, where is BB?

00:11:27.273 --> 00:11:28.706
Not sure.

00:11:28.706 --> 00:11:30.340
(BB)
When Great Fortress activate,

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.540
me can place all
Gladiator Beasts

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.773
from me graveyard inside!

00:11:34.773 --> 00:11:37.240
And your
Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.273
lose its special abilities!

00:11:39.273 --> 00:11:40.473
(snarling)

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.106
Okay, I take it back.

00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:44.906
That Fortress
is pretty great.

00:11:44.906 --> 00:11:46.506
But still beatable.

00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:49.773
I'’’m glad you think so,
Jack, because to me...

00:11:49.773 --> 00:11:51.840
that thing looks
pretty unbreakable!

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.940
Well, looks
can be deceiving.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.840
Tyrant, go!

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.106
(BB)
Me don't think so!

00:11:59.106 --> 00:12:01.646
With power of me
Gladiator Fort,

00:12:01.646 --> 00:12:03.246
your monster forced to battle

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:06.313
one of me
Gladiator Beasts instead!

00:12:06.313 --> 00:12:09.180
Go, Gladiator Beast
Andabata!

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.380
Andabata's attack points
now be 1,000

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.913
but grow 1,000 for each
monster me have in fort!

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.613
4,000 points?!

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.413
(Sylvio)
It'’’s stronger than
Jack'’’s Dragon!

00:12:22.213 --> 00:12:24.446
(BB)
And when your
monster go bye‐bye,

00:12:24.446 --> 00:12:28.780
Gladiator Fort blast you
for 500 points more damage.

00:12:30.046 --> 00:12:31.646
So that mean you lose!

00:12:33.046 --> 00:12:34.846
I don'’’t think so!

00:12:34.846 --> 00:12:37.446
By banishing Red Armor
from my graveyard,

00:12:37.446 --> 00:12:39.913
Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend isn'’’t destroyed!

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.680
(snarling)

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.113
(grunting)

00:12:46.113 --> 00:12:48.880
Me Gladiator Beast
returns to me Fortress now.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.246
Jack... you lucky
you no lose.

00:12:58.613 --> 00:13:00.220
I end my turn.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.786
Jack, are you okay?

00:13:01.786 --> 00:13:03.686
Don't worry
about me, Yuya.

00:13:03.686 --> 00:13:05.620
You just handle your
own business.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.153
You got it, Jack.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.053
(Yuya)
I've faced bigger
obstacles than this.

00:13:11.053 --> 00:13:13.120
Well, maybe not this big.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.353
But you know what?

00:13:14.353 --> 00:13:15.920
The bigger the better.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.586
'Cause that'’’s what makes
duels so much fun!

00:13:20.686 --> 00:13:22.053
Here goes!

00:13:22.053 --> 00:13:23.353
I draw!

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.086
Just what I was
hoping for!

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:29.986
Okay, Jack!

00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:32.220
Hope you'’’re all buckled up!

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.720
'Cause I'’’m about to
bring the wow!

00:13:36.686 --> 00:13:37.420
(all gasping)

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:42.520
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.686
I hope that you're enjoying
the show already in progress

00:13:45.686 --> 00:13:47.986
but now get ready to
enjoy it even more!

00:13:47.986 --> 00:13:49.320
What'’’s all this?

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.553
It'’’s a duel,
not a show!

00:13:51.753 --> 00:13:54.286
Since there are
no monsters on my field...

00:13:54.286 --> 00:13:56.653
I'm now allowed to activate
the spell card

00:13:56.653 --> 00:13:58.720
Performapal
Pendulum Art and Clean!

00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:01.160
And as you can see,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.560
I've now got a lot of
white

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.660
that's about to
go out of sight!

00:14:05.926 --> 00:14:07.693
Now, by negating their
abilities,

00:14:07.693 --> 00:14:10.293
I can summon some
Level 1 Performapals

00:14:10.293 --> 00:14:12.626
to help add some color
to this duel!

00:14:12.626 --> 00:14:16.593
All these Performapals are
allowed to attack you directly!

00:14:16.593 --> 00:14:19.126
This is what I call
the art of the duel!

00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:27.993
Looks more like vandalism
if you ask me!

00:14:27.993 --> 00:14:29.793
Mm‐hmm!

00:14:29.793 --> 00:14:31.793
You're just green with
envy, Sylvio.

00:14:31.793 --> 00:14:33.593
(all gasping)

00:14:33.593 --> 00:14:36.326
Okay, everybody,
that'’’s enough!

00:14:36.326 --> 00:14:37.993
Let'’’s all huddle up now!

00:14:40.693 --> 00:14:42.093
Huh?
Yeah?

00:14:42.093 --> 00:14:44.126
You wanna join us?

00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:45.926
Okay then...

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:47.126
then get on out here!

00:14:48.193 --> 00:14:51.726
I summon
Performapal Hid Hippo!

00:14:51.726 --> 00:14:53.626
And now, Hid Hippo,

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:55.993
show us one of your
hippest moves!

00:14:55.993 --> 00:14:57.760
Attack BB directly!

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.326
Is he nuts?

00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:00.833
BB's gonna shoot out
another Gladiator Beast

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.633
to intercept the attack!

00:15:02.633 --> 00:15:04.866
A Gladiator Beast that's much
stronger than Hid Hippo!

00:15:11.033 --> 00:15:13.333
(BB)
Go, Gladiator Beast Andabata!

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:16.033
And Andabata gains
1,000 attack points

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:17.633
for each monster in fort

00:15:17.633 --> 00:15:20.233
for total of
4,000 attack points!

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.533
Whoa there, Andabata!

00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:26.333
There's no fighting
at this dance party!

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:28.933
Why fight when you can
sashay your bootay instead?

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.433
(snarling)

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.766
Talk about some
movin'’’ and groovin'’’!

00:15:37.766 --> 00:15:38.966
Awesome!

00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:40.066
But hold on!

00:15:40.066 --> 00:15:41.533
I'’’m not done yet!

00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:43.533
Next, due to
Art and Clean's effect,

00:15:43.533 --> 00:15:45.100
Shieldrummer can
attack directly!

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.166
Go!

00:15:48.533 --> 00:15:51.233
(BB)
You still no learn you
can'’’t attack me directly?

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.600
Stop that Drummer,
Gyzarus!

00:15:58.533 --> 00:16:00.706
Only 3,000 attack points
this time?!

00:16:00.706 --> 00:16:02.240
That's right,

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.106
because there'’’s one
less monster in the fort.

00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:06.473
Oh, I didn't attack
to hurt you.

00:16:06.473 --> 00:16:09.140
I just wanted more
guests at my jubilee!

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.840
So instead of
busting my monster,

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.406
they'll bust a move...
instead!

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:15.440
Odd‐Eyes Unicorn,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.806
why don't you find yourself
a dance partner too?

00:16:17.806 --> 00:16:19.206
Go, Laquari!

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.406
Don't think so!

00:16:22.406 --> 00:16:24.306
Guard Dance's
effect is still tapped

00:16:24.306 --> 00:16:26.706
which means these guys
get to tap dance!

00:16:26.706 --> 00:16:28.973
Next, Gongato
wages a direct attack!

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.173
Go, Augustus!

00:16:36.006 --> 00:16:38.373
Its attack points
didn'’’t grow!

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:40.373
'Cause there'’’s no more
monsters in his Fort!

00:16:40.373 --> 00:16:41.940
(Yuya)
You know what I say,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.873
why duke it out when you
can dance it out?

00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:47.140
(Gong)
Yuya still has
one monster left‐‐

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.206
Pararhino!

00:16:49.206 --> 00:16:51.606
(Sylvio)
And BB doesn'’’t have
any left in his fort!

00:16:51.606 --> 00:16:54.540
So Pararhino can
attack him directly!

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.973
And Yuya will win!

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:57.940
These silly
moves of his...

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.406
They'’’re working!

00:16:59.406 --> 00:17:02.113
Now do your thing,
Pararhino!

00:17:02.113 --> 00:17:03.680
Attack BB to win this!

00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:05.980
Yeah!

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:06.613
This is all over!

00:17:07.646 --> 00:17:08.313
(BB)
Yes.

00:17:08.313 --> 00:17:09.813
Over for Yuya.

00:17:13.546 --> 00:17:15.580
(BB)
You thought me had
no monsters left,

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.013
but me still do!

00:17:17.013 --> 00:17:19.013
Because when you attack me
directly,

00:17:19.013 --> 00:17:21.913
me allowed to summon
Gladiator Beast Noxious!

00:17:21.913 --> 00:17:23.213
Aww!

00:17:23.213 --> 00:17:24.980
I thought that this
dance was over?

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.280
What a bummer!

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.613
(Yuya)
It's not a bummer.

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:28.613
It'’’s a boogie!

00:17:30.013 --> 00:17:32.413
Me stopped all five of your
monster attacks.

00:17:32.413 --> 00:17:34.380
Now you can't
attack me no more.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.046
(laughing maniacally)

00:17:36.046 --> 00:17:37.380
Really now?!

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.380
Just wait!

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.180
(gasping)

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.980
What go on?

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.513
Battle over.

00:17:44.513 --> 00:17:46.846
So my monsters should
return to Fort!

00:17:46.846 --> 00:17:48.913
But me no see my
monsters anywhere!

00:17:48.913 --> 00:17:50.380
(groaning)

00:17:51.046 --> 00:17:52.546
What the deal?

00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:53.413
(gasping)

00:17:54.446 --> 00:17:56.280
Why all this crazy?

00:17:58.546 --> 00:17:59.186
Hey!

00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:01.520
Quit playing '’’round!

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.753
Come home!

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.086
Me seen everything now.

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:07.786
Sorry, BB,

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.720
not everything
I'’’m afraid!

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.886
I activated Guard Dance
from my graveyard!

00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:13.686
By banishing this card,

00:18:13.686 --> 00:18:15.986
control of my monsters
switches with yours!

00:18:15.986 --> 00:18:17.520
Not can be.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.053
Stop!
What doing?!

00:18:19.053 --> 00:18:20.853
Hey,unhand me!

00:18:20.853 --> 00:18:22.186
Me take that back!

00:18:22.186 --> 00:18:23.353
(groaning)

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:25.520
Me no like blue!

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.720
No laughing!

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.886
Paint not funny.

00:18:27.886 --> 00:18:28.953
C'mon.

00:18:28.953 --> 00:18:30.620
Chill out.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.853
Life'’’s too short to be
grumpy all the time.

00:18:32.853 --> 00:18:36.020
Duels are supposed to
be about having fun, BB.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.753
You can crack a smile every
once in awhile.

00:18:38.753 --> 00:18:40.786
Take a lesson
from my monsters.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.653
They'’’re having a blast!

00:18:42.653 --> 00:18:44.120
Dueling isn'’’t about
winning or losing.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.420
It'’’s about having
the most fun you can have!

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.886
Have fun...

00:18:49.886 --> 00:18:51.686
So we've been
dueling all wrong?

00:18:51.686 --> 00:18:53.820
Like I told you
earlier, BB,

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.520
you and I
are a lot alike!

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.353
So I know if I can enjoy
dueling, you can too!

00:18:58.353 --> 00:18:59.620
(grumbling)

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.026
There's a whole world
of fun outside your fort,

00:19:02.026 --> 00:19:04.626
and your monsters are waiting
for you to join the party!

00:19:04.626 --> 00:19:06.093
Performapal Hid Hippo

00:19:06.093 --> 00:19:07.560
bids you adieu
to activate

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.260
Performapal Pendulum
Art and Clean's effect!

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.193
♪♪♪

00:19:24.893 --> 00:19:27.926
Wow!
Amazing!

00:19:27.926 --> 00:19:30.360
What a spectacle!

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.993
Colors make me no want to
hurt people anymore.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.893
(Yuya)
Now all our monsters
bid a fond farewell!

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.726
You fool!

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.226
By destroying
your own monsters,

00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:48.126
Great Fortress's effect
will wipe out

00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:49.826
the rest of your life points!

00:19:49.826 --> 00:19:51.326
I think it's time
to make a student

00:19:51.326 --> 00:19:53.293
out of the instructor.

00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:54.826
Great Fortress
only deals damage

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:56.593
when a monster goes to
the graveyard.

00:19:56.593 --> 00:19:59.093
But Yuya's monsters
are Pendulum Monsters,

00:19:59.093 --> 00:20:00.900
so they'll go to his
Deck instead!

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.300
Ugh...

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.766
All right, Yuya, time to
bring this duel to an end.

00:20:06.766 --> 00:20:08.400
The finish line
is dead ahead,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400
so wrap this up.

00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:14.166
Even the best of
shows must end...

00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:15.933
so, BB...

00:20:15.933 --> 00:20:17.366
Me know.

00:20:17.366 --> 00:20:20.033
Due to
Great Fortress effect...

00:20:20.033 --> 00:20:23.400
me now take 500 points damage
for each monster

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.833
that was destroyed
and go to graveyard!

00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:26.833
Me lose!

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.733
Yuya... me sorry.

00:20:36.733 --> 00:20:38.900
Sorry for pain me
cause.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.733
I know you are, BB.

00:20:40.733 --> 00:20:42.366
But now...

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:44.733
you can show the world
your true nature.

00:20:44.733 --> 00:20:47.466
My true... nature?

00:20:47.466 --> 00:20:49.233
Yeah.

00:20:49.233 --> 00:20:51.366
By helping people
that you meet in life...

00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:53.300
and not...

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.433
turn them into
a card.

00:20:55.533 --> 00:20:58.400
Still... for them,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.106
I believe that
there still is hope!

00:21:01.173 --> 00:21:03.306
I'’’m sorry!

00:21:03.306 --> 00:21:05.706
It was the beast in me!

00:21:05.706 --> 00:21:07.606
Curse you, Yuya!

00:21:07.606 --> 00:21:09.206
You've
tamed my beast

00:21:09.206 --> 00:21:10.873
and turned my students
into a bunch of

00:21:10.873 --> 00:21:12.273
starry‐eyed turncoats!

00:21:12.273 --> 00:21:13.840
But mark my words,

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.973
Duel Academy
will get its revenge.

00:21:15.973 --> 00:21:17.440
The Professor will
see to that!

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.640
No, let me go!

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.640
Unhand me!
That's an order!

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.273
The Professor will send
reinforcements.

00:21:23.273 --> 00:21:25.006
Yeah.

00:21:25.006 --> 00:21:26.940
Which means we'’’d
better get a move on.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.506
There'’’s no time
to waste.

00:21:28.506 --> 00:21:29.906
Go do your thing,
Yuya!

00:21:29.906 --> 00:21:32.240
Yeah, go save
our friends!

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.506
Once this lughead mends,
we'’’ll find you!

00:21:34.506 --> 00:21:37.340
Okay then... I'm off!

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.673
C'’’mon, I'’’ll show you
the way out!

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.640
Sis...

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.706
You just stay here, Shay.

00:21:45.706 --> 00:21:47.340
I'’’ll go find Kite‐‐
I know he'’’ll help!

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:48.873
(Doctor)
Hmm...

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.006
These fools think they're
disrupting our plans

00:21:53.006 --> 00:21:56.073
but little do they know
they're playing right into them,

00:21:56.073 --> 00:21:57.940
and with every student
under my control...

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.546
they'’’ll wish
they never dared cross us!

00:22:01.546 --> 00:22:02.780
(laughing maniacally)

00:22:04.013 --> 00:22:05.780
(Declan)
We meet again, Yusho.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.046
I hope you've had time
to realize

00:22:08.046 --> 00:22:09.813
that there's only one way
to get through to my father

00:22:09.813 --> 00:22:11.580
and that's with force.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.246
Well, I still believe
I can get through

00:22:13.246 --> 00:22:16.313
to your father
with words and not war.

00:22:16.313 --> 00:22:19.446
You greatly underestimate
my father, Yusho.

00:22:19.446 --> 00:22:20.746
If we are to stop him,

00:22:20.746 --> 00:22:22.480
we must bring
the fight to him.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.213
(Yuri)
Or to me!

00:22:24.213 --> 00:22:27.446
Unless you'’’re too scared
to have some fun!

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:28.846
(laughing maniacally)
