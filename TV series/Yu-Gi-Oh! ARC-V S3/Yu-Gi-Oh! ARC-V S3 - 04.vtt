00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:04.866
Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh Arc‐V"!

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.000
You must be
from Duel Academy!

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.233
No, I'm swear I'm not!

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.266
I only unleashed my wrath
on Duel Academy

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.900
because of what
happened to my friends.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.333
You turned them all
into cards!

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.866
You're going
to pay most dearly.

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.366
Let's duel!

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:23.900
<i>Yuya, Kite is so angry that</i>
<i>he's not fighting for peace.</i>

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.400
<i>He's fighting</i>
<i>for revenge.</i>

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.633
<i>So it's impossible for you</i>
<i>to get through to him.</i>

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:29.866
No!

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.666
There's always
a way!

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.400
I Xyz Summon...

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.966
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion
Dragon!

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.666
He's able to Xyz Summon?

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.533
And now...

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:45.333
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon attack
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.066
<i>Maybe with the two of us</i>
<i>working together,</i>

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.466
<i>we can make Kite</i>
<i>change his ways.</i>

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.733
Let's go!

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.066
I Xyz Summon!

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.173
Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:01:02.173 --> 00:01:04.606
Isn't that Yuto's?

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:06.606
Why do you have
that monster?

00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:08.473
Why do I sense Yuto's here?

00:01:08.473 --> 00:01:10.373
Stop the duel!

00:01:10.373 --> 00:01:12.206
Yuya's
our friend.

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:13.673
How are you sure?

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:16.673
Because Yuya Sakaki
saved my skin

00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:18.506
more times
than I can count.

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:20.273
Sakaki?

00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:22.540
I'm much better being off
on my own!

(breathing heavily)
You know, I thought
by counting these stairs

00:02:47.413 --> 00:02:49.213
it would take my mind off
climbing 'em...

00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:50.746
(exhausted grunt)

00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:53.380
But who knew they haven't
invented a number that high yet?

00:02:57.746 --> 00:02:59.113
Oh...

00:02:59.113 --> 00:03:01.120
Don't stop,
we're almost there.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.886
You see?

00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:05.320
This is our base!

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.020
Now c'mon,
let's head inside!

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:09.953
I think intros
are in order.

00:03:09.953 --> 00:03:11.420
I'll start first.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.286
My name
is Alan.

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:16.820
And over there,
on soup duty is Saya.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.853
She's also part
of the Resistance.

00:03:18.853 --> 00:03:19.853
Here...

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:22.086
Hey, Saya!

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:24.286
You've worked like
three doubles in a row.

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:25.886
Take some time
for yourself and chill.

00:03:25.886 --> 00:03:27.020
No...

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.353
I'm fine,
thanks.

00:03:29.353 --> 00:03:30.986
All right,
but I'm starting to feel bad

00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:32.953
that you're covering
all my shifts.

00:03:32.953 --> 00:03:34.520
I really do feel awful

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.086
but I know how good it makes
her feel helping others.

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:40.353
How about I cover my breakfast
shift unless I sleep in?

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.786
Mm‐hmm.
See you at lunch.

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:44.120
Here you go.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.953
(sighs)
She knows me too well.

00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:50.620
I gotta say I'm pretty lucky
to have someone as my best bud

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.286
who loves helping people
more than I do.

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:54.786
She loves
helping people, does she?

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:55.920
Super!

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.386
I love being helped!

00:03:57.386 --> 00:03:58.753
Would you be a dear
and let your friend know

00:03:58.753 --> 00:04:00.393
I'd love a refill
on my tea?

00:04:00.393 --> 00:04:01.626
(Gong)
Quiet!

00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:02.493
(Gong)
Thank you.

00:04:02.493 --> 00:04:04.393
Hey,
it's them...

00:04:04.393 --> 00:04:08.660
That's the family that helped us
track the three of you down.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.860
You must have put on
quite the performance.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.393
The little guy said

00:04:12.393 --> 00:04:14.160
it was the most amazing thing
he'd ever seen

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.393
and the mom
was talking about

00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:18.293
how you were able
to make dueling fun again.

00:04:18.293 --> 00:04:20.326
<i>If only I'd been able</i>
<i>to get through to Kite</i>

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.060
<i>like I did</i>
<i>to them.</i>

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.126
<i>I wish he didn't run off.</i>

00:04:24.126 --> 00:04:25.760
<i>We need him</i>
<i>on our side.</i>

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.226
<i>Do you think we'll ever get</i>
<i>through to him, Yuto?</i>

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:32.260
It isn't going
to be easy...

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.126
But we cannot give up.

00:04:35.126 --> 00:04:38.226
The resemblance
really is uncanny.

00:04:38.226 --> 00:04:41.360
You know, I mean
between you and Yuto.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.993
When I first saw you,
I thought you were him!

00:04:45.993 --> 00:04:47.560
Uhh,
who's Yuto?

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.226
Some guy who supposedly
looks like Yuya,

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:51.693
but Gong can't even tell
the difference

00:04:51.693 --> 00:04:54.060
between a yam
and a sweet potato.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.926
You guys related
or something?

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:57.960
Not exactly,
no.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.760
Uh‐huh...

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.066
I know you're in disguise,
Yuto.

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:03.866
That hair
is an obvious wig.

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:06.133
No!
I'm not him!

00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:08.466
Come on,
you can tell me!

00:05:08.466 --> 00:05:11.333
Stop this.

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:13.800
This is
Yuya Sakaki.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.066
He's not Yuto,
all right?

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.866
Sakaki?

00:05:17.866 --> 00:05:19.866
Then where's Yuto?

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:23.166
Shay, you and he went to
the Standard Dimension together.

00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:24.766
He make a wrong turn
or something?

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:25.933
No.

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:27.900
The truth is...
Quiet.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.600
If you tell 'em that my spirit
is inside your body,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.566
they'll only think
you're crazy.

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:34.133
But...

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:38.533
The truth is
that Yuto is M. I. A.

00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:41.266
When he was
in Yuya's Dimension,
he vanished.

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:42.100
Oh!

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.500
Oh!

00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:48.333
I thought it was Yuya's fault,
but who can blame me?

00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:51.033
He had Yuto's most cherished
possession.

00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:54.266
What did you do
with my best friend?

00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:55.566
Where is he,
Yuya?

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:57.600
I'm not sure!
Don't play dumb!

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.366
I know you were involved
in his disappearance!

00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:01.173
That much is clear!

00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:03.306
Otherwise, try to explain
how you ended up

00:06:03.306 --> 00:06:06.906
with Yuto's Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon in your deck!

00:06:06.906 --> 00:06:09.206
You have it
all wrong!

00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:11.940
I didn't steal
that card from him.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.006
He handed it over
to me.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.973
Yuto gave it to me!

00:06:15.973 --> 00:06:19.306
Yuto must have
trusted you.

00:06:19.306 --> 00:06:21.873
I can't believe he's gone
without a trace.

00:06:22.606 --> 00:06:24.073
Still...

00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:28.106
I feel like Yuto
is somehow with us.

00:06:28.106 --> 00:06:31.640
(Shay)
He is here,
in spirit.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.540
And since Yuto believed in Yuya,
I'm gonna trust him too,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.106
to bring peace
to our dimension.

00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:40.473
Thanks, Shay.

00:06:40.473 --> 00:06:42.006
Shay...

00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:43.806
Okay.

00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:47.073
Well, I, for one, am glad
we got all that sorted out,

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.540
even though
we really didn't...

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.006
And I'm still as confused as
ever and maybe even more so.

00:06:53.006 --> 00:06:55.940
Then let's talk
about something you do know.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.240
Right...

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.506
How about
I tell you all about

00:06:58.506 --> 00:07:00.980
those evil jerks
from Duel Academy?

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.813
And why we've been forced
to hide out like this here.

00:07:04.646 --> 00:07:07.213
Yeah,
tell us!

00:07:07.213 --> 00:07:08.680
(sighs)

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.480
<i>It was awful.</i>

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.946
<i>They came out of nowhere</i>
<i>and destroyed everything.</i>

00:07:13.946 --> 00:07:16.846
No, please,
don't!

00:07:16.846 --> 00:07:19.080
<i>They turned everyone</i>
<i>into cards.</i>

00:07:23.713 --> 00:07:25.313
<i>I wanted</i>
<i>to fight back,</i>

00:07:25.313 --> 00:07:28.146
<i>but the best I could do</i>
<i>was hide from them,</i>

00:07:28.146 --> 00:07:30.380
<i>and hope they wouldn't</i>
<i>find me.</i>

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.080
<i>I felt so helpless,</i>
<i>so scared, so worthless.</i>

00:07:40.846 --> 00:07:43.346
<i>The few of us that are left</i>
<i>are hiding out here,</i>

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:45.580
<i>barely enough to mount</i>
<i>a resistance,</i>

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.913
<i>but you know what?</i>

00:07:46.913 --> 00:07:48.746
<i>I'm gonna take the fight back</i>
<i>to them, someday.</i>

00:07:48.746 --> 00:07:50.080
<i>That's a promise!</i>

00:07:51.246 --> 00:07:53.213
So that's
what happened.

00:07:53.213 --> 00:07:55.780
If Yuto and I
had stayed,

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.113
maybe things
would've been different.

00:07:58.113 --> 00:08:01.053
And that's why
Kite's so angry.

00:08:01.053 --> 00:08:05.253
I can't blame him, after what
happened to his family.

00:08:05.253 --> 00:08:07.086
Family?

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:10.120
Kite did his very best
to protect them...

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.653
But unfortunately,
he wasn't able to.

00:08:14.653 --> 00:08:16.053
They were turned
into cards?

00:08:16.586 --> 00:08:17.986
Yes.

00:08:17.986 --> 00:08:20.586
(both)
So sad.

00:08:20.586 --> 00:08:24.553
<i>So that's why I can't get</i>
<i>through to him like Jack.</i>

00:08:24.553 --> 00:08:27.686
<i>When I dueled Jack, it was</i>
<i>like we were on the same</i>
<i>side</i>

00:08:27.686 --> 00:08:29.620
<i>working</i>
<i>for a common cause,</i>

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.186
<i>but that wasn't the case</i>
<i>for Kite.</i>

00:08:32.186 --> 00:08:33.920
You dare oppose me?

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.020
You must be
from Duel Academy!

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.520
And unless you beg
for forgiveness,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.986
you're going
to pay most dearly.

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:42.286
(Yuya)
<i>And he sure meant it.</i>

00:08:42.286 --> 00:08:44.453
<i>He was so angry.</i>

00:08:44.453 --> 00:08:46.720
But anger doesn't solve
anything.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.086
If he doesn't learn

00:08:48.086 --> 00:08:50.653
that dueling's only
to have a good time,

00:08:50.653 --> 00:08:53.420
well, there may never
be peace.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.153
Man, my dad would know how to
get through to him in a snap.

00:08:57.153 --> 00:08:58.253
I wish I did, too.

00:08:58.253 --> 00:08:59.886
Say, uh...

00:08:59.886 --> 00:09:02.293
You said your name
is Sakaki?

00:09:02.293 --> 00:09:03.793
Yeah...

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:04.926
How come?

00:09:04.926 --> 00:09:06.393
Wait, so...

00:09:06.393 --> 00:09:09.160
Then are you related
to Yusho Sakaki?

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.226
You know
Yusho Sakaki?

00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:12.293
You know my dad?

00:09:13.093 --> 00:09:14.660
He's your dad?

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.326
No, that can't be...

00:09:17.326 --> 00:09:20.393
He wore a top hat
and all you've got is goggles!

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.960
So you do know him!

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.426
You're my first lead
in like forever!

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:26.160
That's incredible.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.960
How do people round these parts
know about Yuya's dad?

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.493
Who knows?

00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:31.660
Unless...

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.560
He's been here!

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.226
Been here?
But of course.

00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:38.793
After all,
Yusho Sakaki was our teacher.

00:09:38.793 --> 00:09:40.793
Your teacher?
Yeah.

00:09:40.793 --> 00:09:42.060
<i>About three years ago,</i>

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.360
<i>he suddenly appeared</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.826
<i>He taught us all sorts of</i>
<i>dueling tricks and tactics,</i>

00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:50.060
<i>but the one</i>
<i>he stressed the most was</i>

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.060
<i>to always duel</i>
<i>with showmanship,</i>

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.660
<i>because when you put on</i>
<i>a good show,</i>

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.060
<i>you're showing</i>

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.893
<i>you're the best duelist</i>
<i>you can be!</i>

00:09:56.893 --> 00:09:58.193
Three years ago?

00:09:58.193 --> 00:09:59.560
That's when...

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.000
He vanished
from my dimension

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.366
before the most important duel
in his life!

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:04.766
That proves it.

00:10:04.766 --> 00:10:06.300
My dad wasn't
a coward!

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.200
He just went
to another dimension

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.066
to help you face
Duel Academy!

00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:12.500
(Alan)
He is a coward!

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.966
'Cause when
it mattered most,

00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:17.433
Yusho ran away
and left us here to rot!

00:10:22.733 --> 00:10:25.733
♪♪♪

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:34.366
Oh, man...

00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:35.900
Where am I?

00:10:40.066 --> 00:10:41.533
Am I back home?

00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:42.800
No,
guess not.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.633
But then...
Where am I?

00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:47.600
The last thing I remember...

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.266
(screaming)
Zuzu!

00:10:49.266 --> 00:10:50.900
Yuya!

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.366
Zuzu!

00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:57.900
Yuya...
(boat whistle blows)

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.200
Bye!
Work hard!
I'll miss you!

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.840
I'll study hard!
Bye, Mom!
I'll miss you, Dad!

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.940
(woman)
I know you will,
sweetheart!

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.706
Make sure you listen
to all your teachers!

00:11:07.706 --> 00:11:10.006
You're gonna be
a great duelist!

00:11:10.006 --> 00:11:12.040
(man)
We believe in you!
Make us proud!

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.306
Guess all these kids
are heading off to Duel School.

00:11:15.306 --> 00:11:16.773
But why by boat?

00:11:16.773 --> 00:11:17.940
I'll tell ya!

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.873
'Cause they're going
to Duel Academy.

00:11:19.873 --> 00:11:21.073
Say what?

00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:22.506
Yeah!

00:11:22.506 --> 00:11:24.306
Duel Academy
is located on an island

00:11:24.306 --> 00:11:26.073
out in the middle
of the ocean.

00:11:26.073 --> 00:11:28.973
And the only way to get there
is by taking a boat,

00:11:28.973 --> 00:11:30.640
but you know that.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.273
Everyone out here
does.

00:11:32.273 --> 00:11:35.606
Everyone here
knows Duel Academy?

00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:38.473
Then that
must mean...

00:11:38.473 --> 00:11:40.840
I'm in
the Fusion Dimension!

00:11:43.873 --> 00:11:48.306
Boy, those kids are so lucky
to be going to Duel Academy.

00:11:48.306 --> 00:11:50.873
I can't wait until I finish
elementary school

00:11:50.873 --> 00:11:52.473
and am old enough
to go there myself.

00:11:52.473 --> 00:11:53.873
It'll be so cool!

00:11:53.873 --> 00:11:56.006
So cool?

00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:58.406
Don't you know
what Duel Academy is doing?

00:11:58.406 --> 00:11:59.673
What do you mean?

00:11:59.673 --> 00:12:00.980
They're training kids
to duel

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.313
so that they can go and invade
other dimensions.

00:12:03.313 --> 00:12:04.680
It's horrible‐‐

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.313
(woman)
Time to go now,
honey.

00:12:06.313 --> 00:12:07.546
But wasn't
that fun?

00:12:07.546 --> 00:12:09.280
Now let's hurry on home
and study.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.913
If you don't get straight "A+"s,
you'll be in Ra Yellow,

00:12:11.913 --> 00:12:13.580
instead
of Obelisk Blue!

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.213
Sure,
sounds good, Mom.

00:12:16.213 --> 00:12:19.480
Nice talking to you,
see you later!

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.413
How old are you,
missy?

00:12:21.413 --> 00:12:22.680
Uh...

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.280
Well, I'm 14.
Something wrong?

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.013
Why aren't you in class
at Duel Academy right now?

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:30.546
And that's no school uniform
I've ever seen.

00:12:30.546 --> 00:12:31.746
What's going on
here?

00:12:31.746 --> 00:12:33.713
Uh,
long story.

00:12:33.713 --> 00:12:36.113
Maybe this girl's
a dropout!

00:12:36.113 --> 00:12:37.480
Totally.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.113
I bet she snuck out
of Duel Academy on that ferry!

00:12:40.113 --> 00:12:41.380
Hey!

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.113
Someone get
the duel guards!

00:12:43.113 --> 00:12:44.713
Tell 'em we have
a traitor here!

00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:46.213
Traitor?

00:12:46.213 --> 00:12:48.146
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

00:12:48.146 --> 00:12:49.380
Whoa...

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.580
Hold on,
it's not like that!

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.013
Hey!
She's right here!

00:12:53.013 --> 00:12:55.146
Don't worry,
she's not going anywhere.

00:12:55.146 --> 00:12:56.546
We'll make sure
of that!

00:12:56.546 --> 00:12:58.446
Come here,
young lady.

00:12:58.446 --> 00:13:00.253
Hey!
Come back here!

00:13:00.253 --> 00:13:01.853
(guards)
Halt!

00:13:01.853 --> 00:13:05.186
<i>Of all the places to end up,</i>
<i>I end up in the lion's den!</i>

00:13:11.486 --> 00:13:14.253
There she is!
This way!
Hurry!

00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:18.620
(panting)

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.220
(guard)
You can't run forever!

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.586
<i>If they catch me, they'll</i>
<i>send me to Duel Academy</i>

00:13:23.586 --> 00:13:26.720
<i>and right into the</i>
<i>Professor's hands.</i>

00:13:28.453 --> 00:13:30.086
(guard)
There she is!

00:13:30.086 --> 00:13:31.453
Stop!

00:13:37.453 --> 00:13:40.186
There's
no escape!

00:13:56.186 --> 00:13:58.586
Come on,
open, open!

00:13:58.586 --> 00:14:01.026
Give it up.
This is over!

00:14:01.026 --> 00:14:03.193
Now just come along
with us...

00:14:03.193 --> 00:14:05.326
We're sending you back
to Duel Academy.

00:14:05.326 --> 00:14:06.726
And if you don't
resist,

00:14:06.726 --> 00:14:07.926
I'm sure
they'll let you off

00:14:07.926 --> 00:14:10.460
with only three months
of detention.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.026
But if
you fight back...

00:14:12.026 --> 00:14:15.660
Well, I don't want to know
what'll happen to you.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.193
Fine
with me.

00:14:18.193 --> 00:14:19.693
Let's do this!

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:20.660
(woman)
Stop!

00:14:24.393 --> 00:14:25.393
If you want
to duel...

00:14:25.393 --> 00:14:27.393
You'll duel me!

00:14:31.293 --> 00:14:32.660
If you want to duel...

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.126
You'll duel me!

00:14:40.026 --> 00:14:41.660
You...
Who?

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.193
Just leave this to me.

00:14:43.193 --> 00:14:44.360
You're safe now.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.460
I can't believe
it's her!

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.260
The Scourge
of Duel Academy!

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.160
The girl on the Professor's
Ten Most Wanted List!

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.193
We better
be careful!

00:14:52.193 --> 00:14:54.226
But we have her
outnumbered!

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.226
Yeah,
still...

00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:58.193
I like my chances!

00:14:58.193 --> 00:15:00.400
<i>Who is</i>
<i>this girl?</i>

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.600
Let's duel!

00:15:02.933 --> 00:15:04.600
Ladies first!

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.533
And I think I'll begin
with this...

00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:08.966
Etoile Cyber,
come on out!

00:15:08.966 --> 00:15:10.600
♪♪♪

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.166
Next I'll play a facedown...

00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:16.066
And that's it!

00:15:16.066 --> 00:15:18.200
Now
it's my draw!

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.800
And for my first move...

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.833
I summon...

00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:23.033
a pooch...

00:15:23.033 --> 00:15:24.100
with some power!

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.333
Armor Canine
Cannonboxer!

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.333
And now...

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:28.800
Due to its special ability,

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.133
I can summon another Armor
Canine from my hand...

00:15:32.133 --> 00:15:34.833
And I'll choose one
that flies high!

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:39.433
You're clear for takeoff,
Armor Canine Bullcopter!

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.800
And since Bullcopter has been
successfully summoned,

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.166
I can now add...

00:15:48.166 --> 00:15:49.800
Polymerization
to my hand!

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.400
This could be bad...

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.100
Could be bad?

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.633
Trust me,
there's no doubt about it...

00:15:55.633 --> 00:15:58.866
I fuse Cannonboxer
and Bullcopter...

00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:01.006
Into
a single mighty mongrel!

00:16:01.006 --> 00:16:03.873
I'm putting a whole new spin
on the term...

00:16:03.873 --> 00:16:06.673
Top dog!

00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:08.340
Now watch as I...

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.606
Fusion Summon!

00:16:09.606 --> 00:16:11.373
Here it is!

00:16:11.373 --> 00:16:14.540
Man's best friend
but your worst enemy!

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.973
Full Armor Canine ‐
Bullfortress!

00:16:17.973 --> 00:16:21.273
I think I'll give my pal here
a little more bark and bite!

00:16:21.273 --> 00:16:24.073
By sending Polymerization
to my graveyard,

00:16:24.073 --> 00:16:27.340
it gains
1,000 attack points!

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.240
3,000 attack points
already?

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.640
I'd love
to attack now,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.906
but since this is technically
a battle royal,

00:16:33.906 --> 00:16:36.940
I'll have to wait
one turn...

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:41.406
But after that, your life points
are Bullfortress's chew toy!

00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:43.706
And now you'll deal
with me!

00:16:43.706 --> 00:16:47.973
First I'll summon out
a Cannonboxer, too!

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:51.040
(howling)

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.540
Yeah, it's a dog, but I'm way
more of a copycat myself.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.406
So I'm summoning
Bullcopter!

00:16:58.406 --> 00:17:03.080
And now I'll use Bullcopter
to fetch me Polymerization!

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.213
And with Polymerization
I'll keep on copying...

00:17:06.213 --> 00:17:09.913
And fuse my two Armor dogs
together...

00:17:09.913 --> 00:17:11.713
I Fusion Summon!

00:17:11.713 --> 00:17:15.580
Full Armor Canine
Bullfortress!

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.813
Where's a dogcatcher
when you need one?

00:17:17.813 --> 00:17:21.546
This guy just summoned the exact
same ankle‐biter as his pal.

00:17:21.546 --> 00:17:23.046
And just like him...

00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:25.913
For every Fusion card
I send to the graveyard,

00:17:25.913 --> 00:17:29.813
I can raise Bullfortress'
attack points by 1,000!

00:17:29.813 --> 00:17:33.413
So, since I have two cards
that meet those requirements,

00:17:33.413 --> 00:17:35.513
his new attack point total
is...

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.546
4,000.

00:17:37.546 --> 00:17:40.046
Yes, and with that,
I end my turn.

00:17:40.046 --> 00:17:42.580
My draw now!

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.513
They say that dogs like
to travel in packs...

00:17:45.513 --> 00:17:47.946
So let's keep
the canines coming!

00:17:47.946 --> 00:17:49.413
Go Cannonboxer!

00:17:49.413 --> 00:17:51.246
And next up...

00:17:51.246 --> 00:17:54.180
I'm calling on his floatin'
friend Bullcopter!

00:17:56.246 --> 00:18:00.786
Then I'll use Bullcopter
to bring out Polymerization!

00:18:00.786 --> 00:18:04.820
And with it I'll combine these
pugnacious pups to Fusion Summon

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.153
Full Armor Canine
Bullfortress!

00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:08.520
You're kidding...

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.320
There's three
of them now?

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.620
Yep,
and I'm not done yet!

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.353
Power up time!

00:18:13.353 --> 00:18:15.886
'Cause by sending these four
cards to the graveyard,

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:21.220
I can raise Bullfortress'
attack points by 4,000!

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.420
Whoa...
Talk about attack dogs!

00:18:23.886 --> 00:18:26.420
(Zuzu)
And each one is stronger
than the last!

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.386
Okay, tough girl,
your move now.

00:18:30.386 --> 00:18:32.386
But there's only one
smart move to make!

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:34.720
Yeah, and that's
to put your deck down

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.420
and beg us
for mercy!

00:18:40.353 --> 00:18:42.553
Okay, tough girl,
your move now.

00:18:42.553 --> 00:18:45.120
But there's only one
smart move to make!

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.153
Yeah, and that's
to put your deck down

00:18:47.153 --> 00:18:48.720
and beg us
for mercy!

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.320
Beg for mercy?
(chuckling)

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.753
You guys really
don't know me.

00:18:53.753 --> 00:18:56.220
I draw!

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.153
Now, first things first...

00:18:58.153 --> 00:19:01.360
I'm playing the spell card
Machine Angel Ritual!

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.726
I tribute Etoile Cyber
that's on my field,

00:19:08.726 --> 00:19:12.560
and Cyber Prima that's
in my hand, to Ritual Summon!

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.460
You may have
let the dogs out,

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.926
but I have unleashed something
truly ethereal.

00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:23.826
Cyber Angel Vrash!

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.226
<i>This girl</i>
<i>has some skills!</i>

00:19:33.226 --> 00:19:36.526
Wow, a level 10 monster
just like that, huh?

00:19:36.526 --> 00:19:38.526
I've gotta admit,
that's impressive.

00:19:38.526 --> 00:19:41.160
But you know what's not?
(scoffing)

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.426
The fact that she only has
a measly 3,000 attack points!

00:19:45.426 --> 00:19:46.860
She's way
outmatched,

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.960
not to mention
way outnumbered as well!

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.293
Are you sure
about that?

00:19:51.293 --> 00:19:51.693
Huh?

00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:56.726
You see, when Cyber Angel Vrash
is successfully summoned,

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:59.526
all Fusion Monsters on your
field are instantly destroyed!

00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:02.333
And then each of you take
1,000 points of damage!

00:20:04.966 --> 00:20:06.233
Oh, no!

00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:08.133
No fair!
Can she do that?

00:20:08.133 --> 00:20:09.200
Yeah,
she can!

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.766
Attack with Angelic Fury!

00:20:23.866 --> 00:20:27.100
Now Vrash is allowed
to wage one attack...

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.133
For each monster
that was destroyed...

00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:31.433
And that makes three,
fellas!

00:20:31.433 --> 00:20:35.300
So if I were you,
I'd brace for impact!

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.300
Let 'em have it,
Cyber Angel Vrash!

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.100
(all screaming)

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:54.500
Amazing.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.300
Quick,
come with me.

00:20:58.766 --> 00:21:00.440
All aboard!

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.973
This is
our ride.

00:21:04.106 --> 00:21:06.106
Say, what's your
name anyway?

00:21:06.106 --> 00:21:08.973
My name's Zuzu.
Zuzu Boyle.

00:21:08.973 --> 00:21:09.973
And you are?

00:21:09.973 --> 00:21:11.773
Call me Alexis.

00:21:11.773 --> 00:21:14.540
Nice to meet you,
Alexis.
Same here!

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.706
Now what do you say,
Zuzu?

00:21:15.706 --> 00:21:16.606
Are you coming?

00:21:16.606 --> 00:21:19.240
You bet!

00:21:19.873 --> 00:21:24.706
♪♪♪

00:21:29.406 --> 00:21:31.206
It's okay.
Don't be afraid.

00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:32.540
This is
a safe place.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.640
A place for kids
like you.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.173
Kids who escaped
from Duel Academy...

00:21:37.173 --> 00:21:40.006
But I didn't
escape from...

00:21:40.006 --> 00:21:42.740
I'm in to win!
Ha!

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.040
Where are we?

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.040
Welcome
to our duel school.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.906
The You Show
Duel School.

00:21:48.906 --> 00:21:50.306
You Show
Duel School?

00:21:50.306 --> 00:21:51.440
And here's our dean.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.406
(gasps)

00:21:59.306 --> 00:22:01.646
What?
Mr. Sakaki?
