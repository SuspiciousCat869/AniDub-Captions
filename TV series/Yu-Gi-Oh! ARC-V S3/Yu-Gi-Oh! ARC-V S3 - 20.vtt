(Yuya)
Previously on Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V...

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.700
(Sanders)
<i>Sir, I have news!</i>

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.333
<i>We located</i>
<i>the enemy forces.</i>

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.333
<i>Yuya and his squad</i>
<i>of scrubs are beachside.</i>

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.833
Make sure
you bring Yuya Sakaki
to me in one piece.

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.233
Stay back!
I am sensing a trap!

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:18.833
(student)
Too late!

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.533
(student)
Gotcha!

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.966
Just great!

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.733
You five Lancer losers

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.633
will face off against
five of my elite

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:31.266
in a no‐holds‐barred
Survival Duel

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.100
until only one of you
is left standing!

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.800
I activate the field spell
Predaprimal Jungle!

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.466
(breathing heavily)

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.433
(Yuya)
I can't believe it!

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:46.133
Moon Shadow!

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:49.200
The other card is one of
the cadets we're battlin'.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.000
Do you really think they could
be turning against each other

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.233
this early in the duel?

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.700
(sniffles)

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.233
Nah, I think
it's someone else.

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:01.206
Because Moon Shadow
left us a clue.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:02.940
Your name's Yugo, right?

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.973
Did you have any luck
finding that girl named‐‐

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:06.173
What was it?

00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:07.806
Rin. Yeah, I found her.

00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:10.840
Except, it wasn't
really her.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.906
Rin had totally changed.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:16.340
That's because she's
being... mind‐controlled.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.173
Shay's sister Lulu too.

00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:20.706
I heard the Professor's
right‐hand man
is behind this.

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:22.673
I know how
he's doing it!

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:24.573
He's using some kind
of bug parasite

00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:25.906
to control their minds!

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:28.206
We have to
destroy that thing,

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:32.106
or Rin will never
be free.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.746
Finally. I found you.

00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:50.413
I'm... so happy to see you.

we gotta get outta here,
like, right now.

00:02:55.746 --> 00:02:57.913
I just saw Kite
and he was acting all crazy.

00:02:57.913 --> 00:02:59.480
There's something wrong
with him.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.220
(Kite)
There's nothing
wrong with me.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.220
As for you, Lulu...

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.953
some screw seemed loose.

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:09.286
Watch it. That's my sister
you're talking about.

00:03:09.286 --> 00:03:11.453
Just hold on a sec.

00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:13.053
It's the Professor,
Shay.

00:03:13.053 --> 00:03:14.420
He brainwashed
your sister.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.020
She's dangerous!

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.486
Step away from her

00:03:17.486 --> 00:03:19.253
or there's
gonna be trouble.

00:03:19.253 --> 00:03:21.520
Trouble? Oh, no!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.420
I told you
he was acting crazy.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.020
Save me, Shay!

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.553
You'd be wise
to watch your mouth.

00:03:26.553 --> 00:03:28.786
Now you had better
back off.

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:31.053
'Cause if you don't,
you're gonna find yourself

00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:33.720
in some serious trouble
you can't handle.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.686
So why don't you take a breath
and ask yourself

00:03:36.686 --> 00:03:40.086
if trouble is something
you really do want?

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.753
(snickering)

00:03:41.753 --> 00:03:43.853
I just love seeing
friends squabble.

00:03:43.853 --> 00:03:47.086
It fills me
with such delight.

00:03:47.086 --> 00:03:48.620
But not as much

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.920
as seeing all my hard work
in action.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.353
Manipulating her mind like I'm
manipulating these cards

00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:55.586
brings me such satisfaction.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.253
Now, Lulu, attack.

00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:01.326

This is how she was
with me.

She was fine
one second

00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:19.893
and then
a switch flipped.

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:22.660
Well, I gotta unflip
that switch.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.893
I hopped through dimensions
to find you...

00:04:24.893 --> 00:04:27.326
and I'm not leaving emptyhanded!

00:04:27.326 --> 00:04:29.026
We'll see about that.

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:32.326
Shay, looks like this is
a family problem...

00:04:32.326 --> 00:04:34.026
and I don't do family.

00:04:34.026 --> 00:04:34.926

I'll take down the Professor.

Hmm...

(thinking)
<i>But first...</i>

Looks like another
student bit the dust.

Gong's gut's got
a bad feeling about this.

And I'll start this off

00:05:56.566 --> 00:05:59.500
by summoning
Raidraptor Vanishing Lanius!

00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:04.973
But it won't be flying solo.

00:06:04.973 --> 00:06:08.006
When it's summoned,
it can bring along a friend,

00:06:08.006 --> 00:06:10.506
and I know the perfect one.

00:06:10.506 --> 00:06:14.206
So I summon
Raidraptor Retrofit Lanius!

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:16.706
And Raidraptor Retrofit Lanius

00:06:16.706 --> 00:06:19.440
is treated
as a Vanishing Lanius too.

00:06:24.173 --> 00:06:27.006
And now, when I Xyz Summon,

00:06:27.006 --> 00:06:29.606
Retrofit Lanius counts
as two monsters.

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:33.473
I overlay Vanishing Lanius
and Retrofit Lanius

00:06:33.473 --> 00:06:35.440
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:45.040

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.440
Raidraptor Rise Falcon!

Come on, snap out of it.

You know what
this monster can do.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.313
Lulu, please, I really
don't wanna hurt you.

Don't underestimate me.

00:07:16.013 --> 00:07:17.446
You summoned a monster

00:07:17.446 --> 00:07:19.546
with only 100 attack points
in attack mode?

00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:21.346
It's obvious
that you want me to attack

00:07:21.346 --> 00:07:23.080
and even more obvious
it's a trap!

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.780
You must think I'm a fool.

Oh, boy.

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:32.546
From my hand I summon
Lyrilusc Cobalt Sparrow!

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:38.280
And that lets me summon
Sapphire Swallow

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.546
and another Cobalt Swallow!

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.480
And this new Cobalt Swallow's
ability kicks in,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.980
allowing me to summon
two more Lyriluscs!

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.680
So swooping on into my field

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.380
is Sapphire Swallow
and Cobalt Swallow!

00:08:04.253 --> 00:08:07.386
And now I'm going to overlay
my three Cobalt Swallows

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:11.986
along with my two Sapphire
Swallows in order to build...

00:08:11.986 --> 00:08:16.020
the Overlay Network!

00:08:21.353 --> 00:08:26.320
I Xyz Summon
Lyrilusc Assembled Nightingale!

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.320
Lyrilusc Assembled Nightingale

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.320
now gains an extra
100 attack points

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.320
for every one
of her Overlay Units.

00:08:37.853 --> 00:08:41.053
And it also has the power to
launch a direct attack on you

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:43.686
for every Overlay Unit as well.

00:08:43.686 --> 00:08:46.320
So, tell me, is this little
maneuver supposed to scare me?

00:08:48.086 --> 00:08:50.486
Lulu, you've tried the same
strategy on me a hundred times,

00:08:51.986 --> 00:08:53.720
and do you know
how many times it failed?

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.486
A hundred.

00:08:55.753 --> 00:08:58.820
Well, things are
about to change. Attack!

What's the matter, Shay?

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:12.426
Is your little baby sister
too tough to take down?

00:09:14.693 --> 00:09:16.060
(groaning)

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.260
Nightingale, one last time!

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:22.493
(groaning)

00:09:22.493 --> 00:09:26.126
Oh, I thought you said
that my strategy was trash.

00:09:26.126 --> 00:09:28.493
But who's the one
taking the knee?

00:09:28.493 --> 00:09:30.860
Grr...

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.860
(snickers)

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.360
Your turn, brother.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.993
Heartless gloating,
cruel and unfeeling...

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.493
(snickers)

00:09:38.493 --> 00:09:40.960
My Parasite Monster
can tear apart

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.293
even the bonds
between brother and sister!

00:09:43.293 --> 00:09:46.693
Hmm...
Success!
(laughing)

00:09:46.693 --> 00:09:48.693
(groaning)

00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:50.260
Lulu... listen...

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.760
I don't care if I
win this duel or lose it.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.126
The only reason I'm dueling
is to bring you home.

00:09:57.126 --> 00:09:59.893
Back to your friends,
back to your family...

00:09:59.893 --> 00:10:01.533
Back to me!

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:03.200
Hah!

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.066
Such a noble cause, brother,

00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:08.433
but I honestly can't wait
to watch you fail.

00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:12.200
♪♪♪

00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:31.800
♪♪♪

00:10:39.566 --> 00:10:43.466
I took dropping out of sight
to a whole new level!

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:48.633
I activate the spell card
Rank‐Up‐Magic Raid Force!

00:10:48.633 --> 00:10:50.900
I use Raidraptor Rise Falcon

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.366
to Xyz Summon another Raidraptor
that's one rank higher.

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:02.140
Terror of the skies,
predator of blazing force,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.840
with wings that slash
and talons that tear!

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.006
Go, Rank‐Up Xyz Evolution!

00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:12.140
Rise up,
Raidraptor Blaze Falcon!

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.340
I activate its special ability.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.240
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.140
Blaze Falcon destroys
your monster

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:28.306
and deals you
500 points of damage!

00:11:30.906 --> 00:11:33.073
That's not going to work, bro.

00:11:33.073 --> 00:11:36.306
I also use one of Assembled
Nightingale's Overlay Units,

00:11:36.306 --> 00:11:41.440
creating a barrier to save her
from destruction!

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.106
But you're not getting
out of this unscathed.

00:11:44.106 --> 00:11:47.606
Since Assembled Nightingale
used one of her Overlay Units,

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:50.473
she loses 100 attack points.

00:11:50.473 --> 00:11:53.206
Things are gonna go
from bad to worse for you,

00:11:53.206 --> 00:11:56.306
because Blaze Falcon
can attack you directly!

00:11:57.373 --> 00:11:59.173
Attack!

00:11:59.173 --> 00:12:02.480
Nothing you do will work
against me, dear brother.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.546
I activate Assembled
Nightingale's special ability.

00:12:05.546 --> 00:12:09.446
By using one of its
Overlay Units, I take no damage!

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.446
But you'll pay.

00:12:12.446 --> 00:12:14.813
One less Overlay Unit means
Assembled Nightingale

00:12:14.813 --> 00:12:17.946
loses another 100 attack points.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.946
I end my turn.
You're up.

00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:21.446
I know the rules.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.146
(chuckles)

00:12:25.146 --> 00:12:27.080
You might have gotten rid of two

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.280
of Assembled Nightingale's
Overlay Units,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.246
but it can still attack you
three times in a row.

00:12:33.413 --> 00:12:35.280
(groans)

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.646
(gasps)

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:38.880
(groans)

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.046
(echoing)
Huh? Brother?

00:12:43.746 --> 00:12:45.880
(groaning)

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.280
Brother!
Is that really you?

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.413
(groans)

00:12:51.413 --> 00:12:54.113
(chuckling)
Even if you're mind‐controlled,

00:12:54.113 --> 00:12:55.913
you're still using
the same old strategies,

00:12:55.913 --> 00:12:57.213
ones I've mastered.

00:12:57.213 --> 00:12:59.180
And now, like then,

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.720
those strategies still aren't
good enough to defeat me.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.420
Ha! Well, then, here's a
strategy that you've never seen.

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:09.353
I activate the spell card
Lyrilusc Bird Song!

00:13:10.853 --> 00:13:12.920
With the power of this spell,

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.853
I can summon a Level One monster
from my hand in defense mode.

00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:19.020
Come on out, Fusion Parasite!

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.486
What? What's that thing?

00:13:25.486 --> 00:13:27.620
You've never had that card
in your deck.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.520
Well, I do now, brother,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.520
and I can use Fusion Parasite
to Fusion Summon

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.920
without having to use the power
of the spell Polymerization!

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.320
Since when did you start
Fusion Summoning?

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.353
I fuse Lyrilusc Assembled
Nightingale and Fusion Parasite.

00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:49.753
I'm afraid this is the end
of the road for you, brother.

00:13:49.753 --> 00:13:51.786
It's been fun catching up...

00:13:51.786 --> 00:13:53.586
but it's time to say good‐bye!

00:13:53.586 --> 00:13:58.253
I Fusion Summon Lyrilusc
Independent Nightingale!

00:14:05.126 --> 00:14:09.060
And Fusion Parasite equips
onto my Nightingale.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.426
But I'm not done yet, brother,
not even close.

00:14:12.426 --> 00:14:14.426
(whimpering)

00:14:14.426 --> 00:14:17.693
When Independent Nightingale
is successfully summoned,

00:14:17.693 --> 00:14:19.360
she gains a level for every one

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.160
of Assembled Nightingale's
Overlay Units.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.593
Plus she gets 500
extra attack points per level,

00:14:25.593 --> 00:14:27.926
raising her to 3,000.

00:14:27.926 --> 00:14:30.793
(thinking)
I can't believe
she Fusion Summoned.

00:14:30.793 --> 00:14:33.193
<i>The real Lulu</i>
<i>would never do that.</i>

00:14:33.193 --> 00:14:35.060
<i>It's like Duel Academy's</i>
<i>control over her</i>

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.626
<i>is getting</i>
<i>stronger and stronger.</i>

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:38.826
Lyrilusc
Independent Nightingale,

00:14:38.826 --> 00:14:41.126
attack Blaze Falcon!

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.393
I activate
Raidraptor Evasion!

00:14:45.393 --> 00:14:47.393
By returning one
of Blaze Falcon's

00:14:47.393 --> 00:14:49.826
Overlay Units to my hand,

00:14:49.826 --> 00:14:51.893
Blaze Falcon's safe.

00:14:51.893 --> 00:14:54.293
When will you learn
that you can't beat me?

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:57.393
Mm, you underestimate me
again, Shay.

00:14:57.393 --> 00:15:00.966
Independent Nightingale's
special ability activates!

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:04.500
You take 500 points of damage
for each of her levels!

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.900
(grunting)

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.766
I activate Acceleration!

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.500
You gotta be quicker
than that, sis.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.700
You know, for someone who said
"I don't care if I win or lose,"

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.833
you sure hate losing.

00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:23.000
It's probably
your greatest weakness, Shay...

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.400
second to how you duel.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.200
From my hand I activate the
spell card Lyrilusc Bird Strike!

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.066
It negates Blaze Falcon's
special abilities.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.600
So, it can no longer
use an Overlay Unit

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.633
to destroy my Nightingale.

00:15:41.633 --> 00:15:43.500
Let's see if you can
win this duel now.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.733
It's not about winning.

00:15:45.733 --> 00:15:46.900
Huh.

00:15:48.966 --> 00:15:50.766
I'm not the only one
who misses you.

00:15:50.766 --> 00:15:52.119
Huh?

00:15:52.526 --> 00:15:54.900
Everyone back home
misses you as well.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.833
Don't you remember
all your friends?

00:15:56.833 --> 00:16:00.600
Saya misses you
just as much as me.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.440
(man on p. a.) <i>The winner:</i>
<i>Clover School's Saya</i>
<i>Sasayama!</i>

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.840
(cheering and applause)

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.440
(Saya)
That was so much fun!

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.173
Here, have my card.

00:16:11.173 --> 00:16:14.340
Huh?

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.840
Little Fairy?

00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:22.173
I... can really have it?

00:16:22.173 --> 00:16:23.940
Uh‐huh.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.073
But, Saya, isn't this, like,
the most special card you have?

00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:30.140
And that's the reason I
want you to have it, Lulu.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.540
I think it'll be
a perfect fit for your deck.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.806
Thank you.

00:16:33.806 --> 00:16:35.406
Lulu, give that back.

00:16:35.406 --> 00:16:36.606
Huh? Why?

00:16:36.606 --> 00:16:38.373
Grr...

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:39.640
(Lulu)
Oh!

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.840
Oh! Oh...

00:16:42.673 --> 00:16:46.206
A duelist should never hand over
her cards to her opponent.

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:47.540
Never!

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.873
I didn't know why Saya

00:16:49.873 --> 00:16:52.006
would give her favorite
card to an opponent.

00:16:52.006 --> 00:16:54.073
It just felt so wrong.

00:16:54.073 --> 00:16:57.506
It didn't make any sense to me
at all back then, Lulu.

00:16:57.506 --> 00:16:59.573
You know what doesn't
make sense to me?

00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:02.080
Why you think I care
about this story.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.013
Dueling Yuya taught me
what dueling's about.

00:17:05.013 --> 00:17:07.980
It's not about winning,
it's about making friends.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.380
Like how Saya wanted to become
friends with you.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.946
By giving you her card.

00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:17.880
So if there's any card
that can reach your heart,

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.213
this'll be it.

00:17:19.213 --> 00:17:21.513
(laughing)

00:17:21.513 --> 00:17:23.713
How did you get that card?!

00:17:23.713 --> 00:17:26.213
I got it from a friend.

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:27.746
(panting)

00:17:30.146 --> 00:17:32.313
Hmm...

00:17:35.246 --> 00:17:38.746
Shay! Take this!

00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:40.946
This'll bring you
to your senses!

00:17:40.946 --> 00:17:43.680
By sending one card from my hand
to the graveyard,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.913
Little Fairy gains one level.

00:17:45.913 --> 00:17:49.213
I discard another card
to level her up again.

00:17:49.213 --> 00:17:50.980
(giggling)

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.446
And there's more.

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:55.780
Next I activate
the spell Cross Xyz!

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.313
It lets me Xyz Summon

00:17:59.313 --> 00:18:01.653
using a monster that has a level
instead of a rank.

00:18:01.653 --> 00:18:05.053
No way!
You can actually Xyz Summon now?

00:18:05.053 --> 00:18:10.720
I overlay Rank 5 Blaze Falcon
and Level 5 Little Fairy!

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.620
I Xyz Summon!

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.886
Raidraptor Stranger Falcon!

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.220
(gasping)

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.320
Lulu, listen.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.753
I need you to fight.

00:18:36.753 --> 00:18:38.186
You gotta
snap out of it.

00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:40.620
This isn't you
and you know it yourself.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.820
Or maybe you don't know me
at all!

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.420
So save your breath and duel!

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.653
But I do know you, Lulu...

00:18:46.653 --> 00:18:48.520
and I'm never
giving up on you.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.053
I never did,
I never will.

00:18:51.053 --> 00:18:54.853
Tell me, Shay, was that actually
supposed to touch my heart?

00:18:54.853 --> 00:18:57.720
Well, you failed,
like the failure you are!

00:19:02.293 --> 00:19:04.360
I use one Overlay Unit

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.926
to activate Stranger Falcon's
special ability!

00:19:07.926 --> 00:19:11.093
It'll destroy
your Independent Nightingale

00:19:11.093 --> 00:19:14.393
and you take damage equal
to her... attack points!

00:19:17.293 --> 00:19:18.860
That won't work.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.526
I can send Fusion Parasite
to the graveyard

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:21.693
to stop her destruction.

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:22.560
(gasps)

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.860
I can't move!

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.226
I won't let you.

00:19:26.226 --> 00:19:28.060
(gasps)

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.626
(grunting)

00:19:36.993 --> 00:19:39.993
Aah...!

00:19:39.993 --> 00:19:42.093
(groans)

00:19:42.093 --> 00:19:43.260
Brother...

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.793
Lulu, are you okay?

00:19:44.793 --> 00:19:47.160
You must... keep attacking.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.326
Mm.

00:19:49.326 --> 00:19:53.060
Raidraptor Stranger Falcon,
attack!

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:04.133
(groaning)

00:20:04.133 --> 00:20:05.466
Lulu!

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.900
Lulu, wake up.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.933
Everything's going to be
all right.

00:20:10.933 --> 00:20:13.633
Oh, my, how incredibly touching.

00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:16.366
They think they're
one happy family again,

00:20:16.366 --> 00:20:18.066
but they don't know anything.

00:20:18.066 --> 00:20:19.533
Never underestimate

00:20:19.533 --> 00:20:21.933
my parasite.
(snickers)

00:20:21.933 --> 00:20:23.533
Hmm...

00:20:23.533 --> 00:20:24.933
(grunting)

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.200
Huh? Aah...!

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.366
Huh?

00:20:30.366 --> 00:20:32.733
What are you doing down there?

00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:35.900
I was just, uh...
hanging out.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.266
(rustling)
You see, what happened was‐‐

00:20:37.266 --> 00:20:39.666
Shh! Someone's here.

00:20:39.666 --> 00:20:40.766
Huh?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.600
I don't see anyone.
Shh!

00:20:51.933 --> 00:20:53.200
Huh?

00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:00.706
Hmm...

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.740
(breathing heavily)

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:10.473
Hah!

00:21:11.973 --> 00:21:14.040
Huh! There they are.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.773
Easy pickings.

00:21:15.773 --> 00:21:16.873
You're the knuckleheads

00:21:16.873 --> 00:21:18.273
who've been
groaning and groveling at me

00:21:18.273 --> 00:21:19.806
this whole time?!

00:21:19.806 --> 00:21:22.973
If you're looking for a duel,
you got one!

00:21:22.973 --> 00:21:24.573
(all)
Duel!

00:21:24.573 --> 00:21:26.006
For your dueling pleasure,

00:21:26.006 --> 00:21:27.740
the universally renowned,
hyper‐skilled,

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.840
ultra‐talented Sylvio Sawatari
will go first.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.573
Here goes!
(computer voice)
<i>Intrusion penalty.</i>

00:21:32.573 --> 00:21:34.073
Huh?
<i>2,000 life points.</i>

00:21:34.073 --> 00:21:34.473
Huh?
Huh?

00:21:35.473 --> 00:21:37.440
All right!

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.073
Who's the wiseguy
who dares to interrupt

00:21:39.073 --> 00:21:41.206
the duelsational stylings
of <i>moi?</i>

00:21:41.206 --> 00:21:45.473
Anyone? Hello?

00:21:45.473 --> 00:21:47.606
Hmm, must be
some sort of glitch.

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:48.806
You think?

00:21:48.806 --> 00:21:50.140
That's ridiculous!

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.606
Come out!

00:21:51.606 --> 00:21:53.540
Show yourself
or I'm comin' in after ya!

00:21:54.373 --> 00:21:55.706
(breathing heavily)
