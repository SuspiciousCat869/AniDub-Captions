WEBVTT

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.466
(Dragon roars)

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.933
Unh!

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.833
If I can't defeat Z‐Arc,
then it's hopeless.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.933
(Declan)
You're wrong.

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.333
That's just what Z‐Arc
would have you believe.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.566
We wouldn't all
be here fighting

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.333
if we didn't know
we can stop Z‐Arc.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.800
To stop Z‐Arc, you have
to free Yuya first!

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.733
But maybe you can get him
to wake up a bit faster

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.966
and fight a tad harder!

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.900
Yes, that's precisely
what I plan to do.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.633
And to do that...

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.566
it's time for me
to swing into action!

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.500

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.073
Z‐Arc, I know Yuya is
still alive inside you!

00:01:44.073 --> 00:01:47.073
Ha! Are you sure?

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:49.673
It was Yuya who discovered
Pendulum Summoning,

00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:51.906
so the fact that
you can Pendulum Summon

00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:55.206
means that... Yuya is
still alive inside you

00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:56.573
fighting to be free.

00:01:56.573 --> 00:01:58.440
I draw!

00:02:00.206 --> 00:02:02.180
And while you're
piggybacking and leeching

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.980
off of Yuya's
Pendulum skills,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.013
I've mastered them!

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.346
I set the Pendulum Scale

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:11.680
with Scale 2
DD Savant Schrödinger

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.813
and my Scale 8
DD Savant Dirac.

00:02:14.813 --> 00:02:16.246
(grunting)

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.446
Now I can summon monsters

00:02:23.446 --> 00:02:26.946
between Level 3 and 7
at the same time!

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.980
I Pendulum Summon!

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.346
And call upon
my four monsters to emerge!

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:35.580
DD Nighthowl!
(roaring)

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.180
Followed by two
DD Savant Nikolas!

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.580
And lastly,
DD Vice Typhon!

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.480
I would never have learned
how to Pendulum Summon

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.146
if it wasn't for Yuya.

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:51.113
And I will finally be able
to repay the favor

00:02:51.113 --> 00:02:54.513
by using those skills to free
you from Z‐Arc's clutches!

00:02:54.513 --> 00:02:58.513
Then the two of you can take
down Z‐Arc once and for all!

00:02:58.513 --> 00:03:00.413
Hear me, Yuya!

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.386
Or better yet,
watch me!

00:03:02.386 --> 00:03:04.853
I overlay
my two Savant Nikolas

00:03:04.853 --> 00:03:08.686
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:10.620
I Xyz Summon!

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.353
DDD Wave High King Caesar!

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:18.953
(roars)

00:03:18.953 --> 00:03:20.853
But I'm not through.

00:03:20.853 --> 00:03:23.653
Next, I tune
Level 3 DD Nighthowl

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:27.353
with my Level 7
DD Vice Typhon!

00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:29.120
I Synchro Summon!

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.653
DDD Gust
High King Alexander!

00:03:36.353 --> 00:03:40.286
Finally, I activate
Vice Typhon's special ability!

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.020
By banishing Nighthowl
and Vice Typhon

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.220
from my graveyard,
I can now Fusion Summon!

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.953
DDD Flame
High King Genghis!

00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:51.953
(roars)

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:59.320
Let's move!
We gotta go stop Z‐Arc!

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.793
Before it's too late!

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.326
So you've mastered all
four summoning methods.

00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:11.393
How impressive.

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:13.760
Not that you'll win,
but still impressive.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.626
I guess.

00:04:15.626 --> 00:04:18.226
Summoning these monsters
is only the start.

00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:20.626
It's what I do with them
that counts!

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:24.360
When there are at least two
other DD monsters on my field,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.560
Gust High King Alexander's
attack points double to 6,000!

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.193
(growls)

00:04:30.193 --> 00:04:32.193
(Allie and Tate)
Wow, that's amazing!

00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:34.326
Now make zat
big bully go kaput!

00:04:34.326 --> 00:04:37.493
Declan... no matter
how strong his monster gets,

00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:39.826
Supreme King Z‐Arc
can't be destroyed.

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:41.893
But maybe Declan
can, like, destroy

00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:44.226
that creepy creep's
other dragons instead!

00:04:44.226 --> 00:04:46.093
That won't work either.

00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:48.226
The other guys tried
the same thing,

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:50.326
but all it did
was make Z‐Arc stronger.

00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:52.426
I don't know
what'll work anymore!

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:55.260
Next, I activate Genghis'
special ability!

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.593
For every other DD Monster
I have on my field,

00:04:58.593 --> 00:05:01.600
Flame High King Genghis
cancels out the effects

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.266
of one spell or trap card
that you control!

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:07.466
And the two cards
in your Pendulum Zone

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:08.833
count as spells!

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:11.000
Supreme King Gate Zero

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.033
and Supreme King Gate Infinity
are out of commission!

00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:15.966
Yes, they're
all bound up!

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.400
That means scaly face
can't gain
life points anymore!

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.966
You sure know everything!

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:24.333
But I know this, Amanda.
Declan's free to attack now!

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.133
Z‐Arc'll probably
crumble under pressure

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:27.666
like a stack o' crackers!

00:05:27.666 --> 00:05:29.300
Heh‐heh!

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.900
Oh, you got me in a bit
of a pickle now, don't you?

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.433
I better return
Supreme King Dragon Odd‐Eyes

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:37.033
to my Extra Deck,

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:38.900
so I can replace it
with two Darkwurms.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.433
(all)
Oh, no!

00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:42.400
That's what you think, Z‐Arc!

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.600
But you'll replace them
with nothing!

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.266
Because by using one of High
King Caesar's Overlay Units,

00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:50.300
it stops you from summoning
your Darkwurms!

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.500
In fact, High King Caesar
gains the attack points

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.400
of one of your
Darkwurms instead!

00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:01.140
And I'll use
another Overlay Unit

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.640
to give those
exact same attack points

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.140
to High King Genghis
as well!

00:06:09.606 --> 00:06:11.840
And now,
Flame High King Genghis,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.473
attack Supreme King Z‐Arc!

00:06:14.473 --> 00:06:16.840
(growls)

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.140
(roars)

00:06:24.206 --> 00:06:26.206
Great!
Oh, yeah!

00:06:26.206 --> 00:06:29.973
At long last, Z‐Arc's
life points finally took a hit!

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.640
Nice!
Yeah! Don't let up!

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.806
Stomp a cloghole in him
till the taters are fried!

00:06:35.806 --> 00:06:37.440
Caesar, follow Genghis' lead

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.473
and attack
Supreme King Z‐Arc!

00:06:39.473 --> 00:06:41.206
(roars)

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.306
(monsters roaring)

00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:51.906
Great!
Nice work!

00:06:51.906 --> 00:06:53.506
Take that dragon down!

00:06:53.506 --> 00:06:56.940
(kids)
Go, Declan, go!
Go, Declan, go!

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.606
He's kicking butt!

00:06:58.606 --> 00:07:00.046
Wow, amazing!

00:07:00.046 --> 00:07:02.980
Now...

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.080
You're up,
High King Alexander!

00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:10.846
(roaring)

00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:13.880
(bellowing)

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:27.713
You don't seem
so mighty now, Z‐Arc.

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.513
Now that my turn's done,

00:07:29.513 --> 00:07:32.513
my monsters' attack points
return to normal.

00:07:32.513 --> 00:07:34.113
But you and I both know

00:07:34.113 --> 00:07:36.880
that I now clearly
have the advantage.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.313
Your time will be up
soon enough.

00:07:39.313 --> 00:07:42.780
(Z‐Arc chuckling)

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.280
(laughing maniacally)

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.546
Must be nice...

00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:52.113
to be so courageous
yet so naive!

00:07:52.113 --> 00:07:55.413
You said that Yuya Sakaki
inspired you

00:07:55.413 --> 00:07:57.746
when he discovered
Pendulum Summoning,

00:07:57.746 --> 00:07:59.546
but you are so wrong!

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:00.986
How's that?

00:08:00.986 --> 00:08:03.686
Yuya Sakaki
discovered nothing.

00:08:03.686 --> 00:08:05.886
For your information,

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:08.986
it was I who gave birth
to Pendulum Summoning!

00:08:08.986 --> 00:08:10.886
You did?

00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:13.486
That smells like
a big fat lie to me!

00:08:13.486 --> 00:08:16.386
If he invented
Pendulum Summoning,
I invented ice cream!

00:08:16.386 --> 00:08:20.053
That can't... be true!
Unh!

00:08:20.053 --> 00:08:23.653
Come now, why would I
ever need to lie?

00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:27.320
When Ray defeated me,
I knew I needed to discover

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.520
a more powerful technique
in order to win our rematch.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.953
And discover it I did!

00:08:34.953 --> 00:08:37.020
No, this can't be.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.686
(Riley thinking)
Hey, Ray, how could you
stop Z‐Arc

00:08:41.686 --> 00:08:44.320
with just four cards?

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.653
(Ray)
Because those four cards

00:08:46.653 --> 00:08:49.453
contained all the energies
of the universe.

00:08:49.453 --> 00:08:52.520
En Moon harnessed
the powers of the cosmos,

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.086
while En Winds
held the forces

00:08:54.086 --> 00:08:56.886
of the storms and gales.

00:08:56.886 --> 00:08:58.720
En Birds contained
the life force

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.193
of every living creature.

00:09:01.193 --> 00:09:03.660
And En Flowers
was the very power

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.693
of Mother Nature herself.

00:09:05.693 --> 00:09:07.960
With these four spell cards,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.660
I stopped Z‐Arc, splitting him
across dimensions.

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:21.726
But stopping Z‐Arc isn't
the same as ending him.

00:09:21.726 --> 00:09:25.460
I knew Z‐Arc would resurrect
one day stronger than before.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.760
And he has...

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.293
with the power of Pendulum.

00:09:34.993 --> 00:09:36.526
Aah!

00:09:36.526 --> 00:09:38.293
Unh, almost there...

00:09:38.293 --> 00:09:40.560
Must keep going!

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.426
It appears
you could use a hand.

00:09:42.426 --> 00:09:46.160
Moon Shadow?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.193
Did you actually think
that you were capable
of hurting me?

00:09:50.193 --> 00:09:53.060
I wanted you to damage
my life points

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.960
so that I can
activate this‐‐ Hyah!

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.093
The trap Supreme Rage!
Ahh!

00:09:59.093 --> 00:10:02.766
Since you dealt me more
than 2,000 points of damage,

00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:05.733
this trap card resurrects
my four mighty Dragons!

00:10:05.733 --> 00:10:09.066
(laughing)

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.800
Return, Supreme King
Dragon Odd‐Eyes!

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.733
Supreme King
Dragon Clear Wing!

00:10:19.733 --> 00:10:23.733
Supreme King
Dragon Dark Rebellion!

00:10:23.733 --> 00:10:27.600
And Supreme King
Dragon Starving Venom

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.700
This is... the end!

00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:46.000
Grr!

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.666
And now... Supreme King
Dragon Clear Wing

00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:52.366
will attack
High King Alexander!

00:10:52.366 --> 00:10:53.966
Why does he do that?

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:56.533
Alexander is stronger
than his dragon.

00:10:56.533 --> 00:10:59.233
(Z‐Arc)
Clear Wing's
ability activates!

00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:03.006
Your High King Alexander
is automatically destroyed,

00:11:03.006 --> 00:11:05.406
and you take damage
equal to its attack points!

00:11:05.406 --> 00:11:08.106
All 6,000 of 'em!

00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:11.540
I activate DD Savant Dirac's
Pendulum ability!

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.140
Not only can I summon it
in Defense Mode,

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.673
but it also shields me
from taking any damage.

00:11:16.673 --> 00:11:18.506
That was a close call!

00:11:18.506 --> 00:11:20.306
I'm just getting started.

00:11:20.306 --> 00:11:22.373
Supreme King Dragon
Dark Rebellion,

00:11:22.373 --> 00:11:24.273
attack High King Caesar!

00:11:24.273 --> 00:11:26.073
He's attacking nonstop!

00:11:26.073 --> 00:11:29.573
By using one of Dark
Rebellion's Overlay Units,

00:11:29.573 --> 00:11:32.373
Dark Rebellion steals
all of High King Caesar's

00:11:32.373 --> 00:11:34.840
attack points
and powers itself up!

00:11:37.006 --> 00:11:38.940
Dark Rebellion...
Oh, no!

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.940
Eviscerate
Wave High King Caesar

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.806
and wipe out the last
of Declan's life points!

00:11:44.806 --> 00:11:48.573
I activate DD
Savant Schrödinger's
Pendulum ability!

00:11:48.573 --> 00:11:51.073
I also summon Schrödinger
in Defense Mode

00:11:51.073 --> 00:11:53.473
to shield me
from any battle damage!

00:11:53.473 --> 00:11:55.173
But you're running out
of options!

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:59.340
All right, Starving Venom,
use your special ability!

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.913
Leech High King Alexander's
special abilities!

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.780
No way!
Since there are at least

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.213
two DD monsters
on the field,

00:12:09.213 --> 00:12:12.513
Supreme King Dragon
Starving Venom's
attack points double!

00:12:12.513 --> 00:12:14.946
Attack now,
Starving Venom!

00:12:14.946 --> 00:12:17.913
Incinerate High King Genghis
and win this duel!

00:12:22.513 --> 00:12:26.013
You aren't going to be taking
me down that easily, Z‐Arc!

00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:28.713
Schrödinger's special
ability protects me

00:12:28.713 --> 00:12:32.480
from taking any damage
once per turn.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.813
(roars)

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.713
(Professor thinking)
That was close.

00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:38.780
But since Declan's monsters
are in Defense Mode,

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.080
he'll survive
Z‐Arc's final attacks.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.113
It's time!

00:12:43.113 --> 00:12:46.780
Supreme King Dragon Odd‐Eyes,
attack DD Savant Dirac!

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.680
(roars)

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.146
And don't think you're safe

00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:52.313
because your monster's
in defense!

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:53.846
Starving Venom
allows Odd‐Eyes

00:12:53.846 --> 00:12:56.046
to deal piercing damage!

00:12:56.046 --> 00:13:00.013
Plus, Odd‐Eyes' special ability
doubles the damage you take!

00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:01.753
Unh!
(both)
Declan!

00:13:01.753 --> 00:13:04.720
Unh!

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.153
Oh, no, he's done for.

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:09.686
Gong can't believe
this is it.

00:13:09.686 --> 00:13:12.653
That was fun, but all
good times come to an end.

00:13:12.653 --> 00:13:14.886
I destroy Schrödinger

00:13:14.886 --> 00:13:17.720
and finish you
once and for all!

00:13:20.686 --> 00:13:24.720
Declan, nooo!

00:13:31.053 --> 00:13:32.153
Huh!

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:36.653
Moon Shadow!

00:13:36.653 --> 00:13:38.120
He's back
from being paper thin!

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.086
Look, you guys!
It's Riley!

00:13:42.086 --> 00:13:44.386
Riley! What do you
think you're doing?

00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:46.220
Riley?

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.853
I'm not Riley.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.053
It's me... Ray!

00:13:54.053 --> 00:13:55.653
Ray?
What?

00:13:55.653 --> 00:13:57.486
No!

00:13:57.486 --> 00:13:59.353
Sorry to crash this party,

00:13:59.353 --> 00:14:01.126
but I didn't want to
miss the fun!

00:14:01.126 --> 00:14:03.560
I've stopped you before,
and guess what, Z‐Arc?

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.893
(Riley and Ray)
I'm gonna stop you again!

00:14:05.893 --> 00:14:08.660
I... draw!

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.426
To start things off,

00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:13.326
I activate the spell
Life Transformation!

00:14:13.326 --> 00:14:15.660
By discarding all the cards
in my hand,

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.293
I get back En Flowers,
En Birds,

00:14:18.293 --> 00:14:20.493
En Winds, and En Moon

00:14:20.493 --> 00:14:22.393
and place them facedown.

00:14:22.393 --> 00:14:24.326
Those are
the four special cards

00:14:24.326 --> 00:14:26.126
I created to defeat Z‐Arc!

00:14:26.126 --> 00:14:27.460
No, not again!

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.826
First off is En Flowers!

00:14:29.826 --> 00:14:31.693
Go!

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.626
(Allie)
It's so pretty!

00:14:39.626 --> 00:14:40.526
Wow!

00:14:43.493 --> 00:14:46.193
(Riley as Ray)
Since I have at least three
Xyz Monsters in my graveyard,

00:14:46.193 --> 00:14:48.260
En Flowers
also lets me activate

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.826
the spell card En Birds!

00:14:50.826 --> 00:14:54.626
This flock changes all Xyz
Monsters into normal monsters

00:14:54.626 --> 00:14:56.826
and takes away
their special abilities!

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.933
That's bad news for Z‐Arc.

00:15:02.933 --> 00:15:04.566
But great news for us!

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:06.600
And to keep this going,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.000
since I have at least
three Synchro Monsters

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.066
in my graveyard,

00:15:10.066 --> 00:15:12.933
En Birds lets me activate
the spell card En Winds!

00:15:12.933 --> 00:15:15.900
This time, your
Synchro Monsters are the ones

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.533
stripped of their
special abilities

00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:22.600
and turned
into normal monsters!

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.900
Riley's turning those
Dragons into lizards!

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.066
Way to show some grit!

00:15:27.066 --> 00:15:29.533
(Riley as Ray)
And last but not least,

00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:32.433
since I have at least three
Fusion Monsters in my graveyard,

00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:34.366
En Birds and En Winds
lets me play

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:36.733
my special card, En Moon!

00:15:36.733 --> 00:15:38.800
And like your other dragons,

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.966
your Fusion Monsters aren't
so special anymore, too!

00:15:40.966 --> 00:15:42.433
(roars)

00:15:45.066 --> 00:15:49.066
Z‐Arc is about to
shed his dragon skin
once and for all.

00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:50.800
How dare you!

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.300
(Riley and Ray)
Oh, I do dare, Z‐Arc!

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.033
Due to En Flowers' effect,

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:57.300
all monsters on the field
are destroyed,

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.566
and you take 600 points
of damage

00:15:59.566 --> 00:16:02.406
for each monster that goes
to the graveyard!

00:16:06.706 --> 00:16:08.306
Nicely done.

00:16:24.506 --> 00:16:26.406
Argh! No!

00:16:26.406 --> 00:16:29.406
(Z‐Arc screaming)

00:16:36.973 --> 00:16:38.273
Oh, yeah!

00:16:38.273 --> 00:16:40.240
This is nothing...

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.340
more than a minor setback!

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.306
Then I guess, Z‐Arc,

00:16:44.306 --> 00:16:46.640
you don't know
the definition
of minor.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.906
And now that you have
been weakened, Z‐Arc...

00:16:49.906 --> 00:16:52.040
Yuya, set yourself free!

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.473
Silence, you!

00:16:54.473 --> 00:16:58.173
Like both edges
of a swinging pendulum,

00:16:58.173 --> 00:17:00.580
if evil is to exist,
then so must good.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.613
So if there is Z‐Arc,
there must be Yuya!

00:17:03.613 --> 00:17:05.446
Yuya, set yourself free!

00:17:05.446 --> 00:17:09.180
Break free of Z‐Arc!
Return to us!

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.713
And end all this suffering

00:17:11.713 --> 00:17:13.546
by restoring peace
to the dimensions

00:17:13.546 --> 00:17:15.213
and making everyone
smile again!

00:17:15.213 --> 00:17:16.580
Silence!

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.146
There is no Yuya!

00:17:18.146 --> 00:17:19.480
Yuya, snap to it!

00:17:21.613 --> 00:17:24.180
(moaning)
Zuzu?

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.180
You've been sleeping
on the sidelines!

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.080
Time to wake up and help us!

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.280
Like only you can!

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.913
That's enough!

00:17:31.913 --> 00:17:33.713
I've had enough
of your prattling!

00:17:33.713 --> 00:17:35.780
No, don't!
Don't hurt her!

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.613
I will not lose again!

00:17:37.613 --> 00:17:39.613
Not ever!

00:17:39.613 --> 00:17:41.513
I've been waiting for years
to get my revenge,

00:17:41.513 --> 00:17:43.480
and nothing will stop me...

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.946
from achieving
my ultimate victory!

00:17:45.946 --> 00:17:48.146
No, Z‐Arc!
I won't let you!

00:17:48.146 --> 00:17:49.946
No one will smile again!

00:17:49.946 --> 00:17:52.413
I believe in you, Yuya.

00:17:52.413 --> 00:17:55.813
I always have,
and I always will.

00:17:55.813 --> 00:17:58.780
You've never given up
ever in your life...

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.453
and you're not
going to start now.

00:18:01.453 --> 00:18:04.686
'Cause through good times
and bad times...

00:18:04.686 --> 00:18:08.020
you always fought through
with a smile on your face.

00:18:11.253 --> 00:18:13.420
You heard the lady!

00:18:18.886 --> 00:18:21.353
Take your dad's advice, Yuya.

00:18:21.353 --> 00:18:24.620
When things get tough,
respond with a smile.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.820
It will give you the strength
to keep moving forward!

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.886
(Yuya's voice)
That's right!

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:33.586
It's my... turn!

00:18:35.953 --> 00:18:39.120
It's time for me to swing
into action!

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.053
I activate Smile Universe

00:18:43.053 --> 00:18:45.153
to summon as many
Pendulum Monsters

00:18:45.153 --> 00:18:47.053
as I can from my Extra Deck

00:18:47.053 --> 00:18:49.486
by negating
their special abilities!

00:18:56.653 --> 00:18:59.393
(Monsters roaring)

00:19:08.126 --> 00:19:10.626
Z‐Arc's makin' a comeback!

00:19:10.626 --> 00:19:14.360
(Z‐Arc's voice)
Thanks for summoning
these monsters, Yuya.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.026
They're absolutely perfect
to crush your friends with.

00:19:17.026 --> 00:19:18.260
(Yuya's voice)
No, you won't!

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.760
You won't be
crushing anything,

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.260
not if I can help it!

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.993
Oh, but you can't help!
Not at all!

00:19:23.993 --> 00:19:26.326
Oh, but I already did!

00:19:26.326 --> 00:19:28.360
Because, since I used
Smile Universe

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.626
to summon
those monsters,

00:19:30.626 --> 00:19:34.060
Riley gains
life points equal to
their attack points!

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.060
No!

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.560
Now's your chance, Riley!

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.493
(groaning)
End this duel!

00:19:44.493 --> 00:19:48.260
Time for En Flowers' effect
to fully blossom!

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.460
I destroy
both of your monsters,

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.326
and you take 600 points
of damage for each one...

00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:55.760
Enough to erase
all your life points

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.826
and win this duel!

00:19:57.826 --> 00:19:59.900
(roars)

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.366
You win... for now...

00:20:02.366 --> 00:20:04.466
But I'll return!

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.433
The universe is splitting

00:20:09.433 --> 00:20:12.166
into four separate
dimensions again.

00:20:12.166 --> 00:20:14.566
Z‐Arc will be reborn
in each dimension,

00:20:14.566 --> 00:20:15.766
restarting the cycle!

00:20:15.766 --> 00:20:17.333
Not on my watch!

00:20:17.333 --> 00:20:19.866
I'm going to seal
Z‐Arc away for good!

00:20:19.866 --> 00:20:23.833
(Z‐Arc screaming)

00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:26.633
(Riley screaming)

00:20:28.933 --> 00:20:31.366
Ohh... Huh?

00:20:31.366 --> 00:20:34.300
What happened?
Anyone?!
