(Yuya)
Previously on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh Arc V."

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.766
I send Destiny Hero Dynatag

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.700
from my hand
to the graveyard

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.333
to activate
its special ability!

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.066
(Phoenix)
Since I have fewer
life points than you,

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.100
I don't take damage
from your attack.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.600
Instead, we both take
1,000 points of damage.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.966
(Yuto)
No!

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.366
Aah!

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.966
(gasping)

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.633
(tires screeching)

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:37.100
(man)
This way!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.200
(man 2)
Commander Phoenix,
are you okay?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.466
(man)
Do you need help,
Commander Phoenix?

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.466

He's gone.
Where'd he go?

00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:55.440
If I'm gonna find my dad,
I gotta find this Phoenix guy.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.340
We're in luck.
Kite's right there.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.546
And making
more friends, I see.

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:03.913
As usual.

00:02:03.913 --> 00:02:05.380
Let's move out.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.946
What's the deal?

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:11.013
You forget how to walk
or something?

00:02:11.013 --> 00:02:12.380
Oh.

00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:16.013
And now feel the fury

00:02:16.013 --> 00:02:18.813
of my Cipher Dragons
as they finish you off.

00:02:18.813 --> 00:02:21.080
(roaring)

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.013
Hey, Kite.

00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:25.413
We found you at last.

00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:27.080
I didn't know I was lost.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.680
Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.413
I have unfinished business
to take care of.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.846
I want the old Kite back.

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:37.580
Ugh... no, stop.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.380
Please, let us go.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.780
Begging for mercy isn't
going to help you.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.646
(whimpering)
Please, no‐‐ no!

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.380
Good riddance.

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:52.846
Wait, don't go.

00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:54.980
Please, Kite,
come back home with us.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.313
Listen, Saya misses you.

00:02:57.313 --> 00:02:59.113
I miss you.

00:02:59.113 --> 00:03:01.186
(growling)

00:03:01.186 --> 00:03:02.686
Wait.
(gasping)

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.320
(Alan)
Shay?

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:11.786
If I were you, pal,
I wouldn't get in my way.

00:03:11.786 --> 00:03:13.553
And if I do?

00:03:13.553 --> 00:03:15.820
Are you gonna
turn me into a card?

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.420
That's an interesting
proposition.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.320
(voice)
Generating Action Field
Crossover.

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:25.520
<i>Action Cards dispersed.</i>

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.153
Cool off,
you guys.

00:03:27.153 --> 00:03:28.253
Kid's right,
you should be

00:03:28.253 --> 00:03:30.586
KO‐ing Duel Academy,
not each other.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.320
Then again, nothing wrong
with a little warm‐up.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.686
(both)
Let's duel.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:41.586
I'm going first, Kite,

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:43.353
and for starters,

00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:46.586
I summon Raid Raptor
Vanishing Lanius.

00:03:47.753 --> 00:03:49.786
(roaring)

00:03:49.786 --> 00:03:53.220
And when I successfully
summoned Vanishing Lanius,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.053
I can also summon
Retrofit Lanius.

00:03:57.586 --> 00:03:59.053
(roaring)

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.693
And it's perfect,
because when I XYZ Summon,

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:06.860
Retrofit Lanius counts
as two monsters.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.060
Therefore,
it allows me to overlay

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.393
my Vanishing Lanius
and Retrofit Lanius

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:14.160
in order to build
the overlay network!

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.560
From the shadows,
the falcon soars

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.260
on wings of courage,
talons ready for the rebellion.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.660
I XYZ Summon...

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.860
Fly forth!

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.960
Raid Raptor Rise Falcon!

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.293
(roaring)

00:04:31.293 --> 00:04:34.026
You've grown rusty
since the last time

00:04:34.026 --> 00:04:35.393
we saw each other,
Shay.

00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:37.693
Rise Falcon's
only useful

00:04:37.693 --> 00:04:39.760
when I have a monster
on my field.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.593
No one summons it
on the very first turn.

00:04:43.593 --> 00:04:45.160
Shay,
what happened to you?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.660
You're dueling
like an amateur.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.060
You've gotten soft.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.860
You don't even have
the guts to turn people

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.393
into cards anymore.

00:04:51.393 --> 00:04:53.726
No, I've just learned
right from wrong.

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:55.393
And I'm no amateur.

00:04:55.393 --> 00:04:57.860
I activate Raptor's
Intercept Formation.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.760
By attacking my monster,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.166
my raid raptor's attack
and defense points

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:04.000
switch places.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.466
So you'll have to deal
with 2,000 attack points

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:08.333
instead of 100.

00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:10.500
And that's a math problem
you can't handle,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.233
so if you still insist
on attacking, be my guest.

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:18.500
Oh, I will.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.166
'Cause no matter
what you try,

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:22.866
I'm always
two steps ahead of you.

00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:25.000
Since you have
an XYZ Monster,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.033
I'm automatically
allowed to summon

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:29.200
this monster
from my hand.

00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:31.833
Check out...

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:34.200
my Cipher‐Twin Raptor!

00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:37.366
(growling)

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:38.933
And I'm not stopping there.

00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:41.033
Next, I summon Cipher‐Wing!

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:43.800
And by tributing
my Cipher‐Wing,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.766
its special ability
activates.

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:47.366
And the levels
of all Cipher monsters

00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:49.666
on my field
increase by four.

00:05:52.733 --> 00:05:54.533
Whenever I'm XYZ Summoning,

00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:57.833
Cipher Twin Raptor
counts as two monsters.

00:05:57.833 --> 00:06:01.573
With Twin Raptor, I build
the Overlay Network!

00:06:01.573 --> 00:06:03.340
And now I call forth

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.606
a monster that will
scorch your precious Rise Falcon

00:06:06.606 --> 00:06:09.340
and send it plummeting
into oblivion.

00:06:11.606 --> 00:06:13.040
I XYZ Summon

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.040
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.173
(roaring)

00:06:23.873 --> 00:06:28.240
(Kite)
I XYZ Summon
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:33.140
I wish that thing would go
on the endangered dragons list.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.973
It's giving
good dragons a bad rap.

00:06:34.973 --> 00:06:37.040
Right, Gong?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.340
That thing's got catastrophe
written all over it,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.006
and poor old Shay doesn't have
anything to erase it with.

00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:44.073
My Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon

00:06:44.073 --> 00:06:46.206
will now unleash
its special ability.

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:48.206
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:06:48.206 --> 00:06:50.073
I gain complete control

00:06:50.073 --> 00:06:52.940
of your precious
Raid Raptor Rise Falcon.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.673
And once it's mine,
I will end you!

00:06:56.673 --> 00:06:58.306
(roaring)

00:06:58.306 --> 00:07:00.040
(screeching)

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.080
It's not going anywhere.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.946
Raptors
Intercept Formation!

00:07:03.946 --> 00:07:07.013
Negate
that special ability!

00:07:07.013 --> 00:07:09.546
(screeching)

00:07:11.513 --> 00:07:13.046
It makes no difference.

00:07:13.046 --> 00:07:15.246
Your Rise Falcon
will fall.

00:07:15.246 --> 00:07:16.913
Cipher Dragon,
attack!

00:07:16.913 --> 00:07:21.246
Cipher Stream
of Destruction!

00:07:21.246 --> 00:07:23.113
Due to my spell's effect,

00:07:23.113 --> 00:07:25.113
Rise Falcon's attack
and defense points

00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:27.046
switch places
when it's attacked.

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:29.446
It's not enough,

00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:31.080
it's still going
to be destroyed.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.080
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.680
I activate
the action spell Miracle.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.113
which protects my falcon

00:07:39.113 --> 00:07:41.546
and cuts the damage
I take in half.

00:07:43.413 --> 00:07:44.946
Seems like
none of your plans

00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:46.446
worked out, Kite.

00:07:49.246 --> 00:07:50.980
An Action Spell?

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.546
Yeah,
that's how we duel.

00:07:52.546 --> 00:07:54.913
And if you want
to learn more,
you're in luck,

00:07:54.913 --> 00:07:57.013
'cause I've got the skills
that give the thrills.

00:07:57.013 --> 00:07:59.713
You've picked up
some interesting habits

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:01.086
from your new friends.

00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:04.286
The Shay I remember
never had to resort

00:08:04.286 --> 00:08:06.153
to cheap gimmicks
to survive.

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:07.453
Your move.

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:08.920
Cheap gimmicks, huh?

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.053
You've become
a pathetic joke.

00:08:11.053 --> 00:08:14.720
But I still plan
on getting the last laugh.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.020
I draw!

00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:19.853
It's Rank Up Magic.

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:21.653
Raid Force!

00:08:21.653 --> 00:08:23.986
I use Raid Raptor
Rise Falcon

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:26.220
to XYZ summon
another Raid Raptor

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.320
that's one rank higher!

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.120
Go, Rank Up
XYZ Evolution!

00:08:32.453 --> 00:08:35.720
Rise up, Raid Raptor
Blaze Falcon.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.820
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.486
Blaze Falcon's special ability
destroys your monster

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:43.020
and deals you
500 points of damage.

00:08:44.453 --> 00:08:46.020
(screeching)

00:08:47.653 --> 00:08:48.753
I don't think so.

00:08:48.753 --> 00:08:50.953
Go, Cipher Bit!

00:08:50.953 --> 00:08:53.420
Not only does it protect
my Galaxy‐Eyes,

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.020
but it also becomes
an Overlay Unit.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.626
(roaring)

00:09:00.626 --> 00:09:01.926
Well, that's different.

00:09:01.926 --> 00:09:04.293
That Galaxy‐Eyes
must be seeing 20/20,

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:06.560
'cause it's finding
more ways to save itself

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.760
than Gong can count.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.593
Your Galaxy‐Eyes
might be safe,

00:09:09.593 --> 00:09:11.960
but I can't say the same
for your life points.

00:09:17.526 --> 00:09:18.760
What's going on?

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.360
This was
a Resistance stronghold.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.393
Duel Academy
could be attacking.

00:09:23.393 --> 00:09:25.426
(wincing)

00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:27.393
When Blaze Falcon
deals you damage,

00:09:27.393 --> 00:09:29.326
it also gets to destroy
your monster.

00:09:29.326 --> 00:09:31.960
So, say goodbye
to Galaxy‐Eyes!

00:09:34.393 --> 00:09:36.793
(roaring)

00:09:36.793 --> 00:09:39.293
Listen, Kite,
no matter what you do,

00:09:39.293 --> 00:09:41.593
no matter
what you've done,

00:09:41.593 --> 00:09:42.860
you're still
our friend,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.793
and we never leave
a friend behind.

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.793
Never.

00:09:46.793 --> 00:09:48.860
If you really won't
stay away from me,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.593
I'm gonna have
to make you.

00:09:50.593 --> 00:09:52.360
I'm activating...

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.460
the trap
Cipher Spectrum!

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.760
Since Galaxy‐Eyes
still had an Overlay Unit

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.960
when it was destroyed,
I can resurrect

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.933
my faithful dragon
from my graveyard

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.266
and bring another
out from my extra deck!

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:05.900
Things just went
from bad to worse.

00:10:07.033 --> 00:10:10.900
(roaring)

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.300
Either I'm seeing double,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.500
or Kite just pulled off
a fast one.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.600
I want to win this war,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.500
as badly as you do, Kite,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.066
but there's a right
and wrong way to do it.

00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:24.266
And if you keep doing
what you're doing,

00:10:24.266 --> 00:10:26.200
by turning people
into cards,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.633
then you're no better
than the Fusion Dimension.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:36.500
Guys, you're safe!

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.366
I saw an explosion.

00:10:38.366 --> 00:10:40.300
And Shay? Kite?

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.500
Why are you guys
dueling each other?

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.266
Oh, great‐‐ you again.

00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:46.200
Alan.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.933
We're dueling
'cause Shay won't listen.

00:10:48.933 --> 00:10:51.600
And since actions speak
louder than words,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.966
beating him is the only way
to get through to him.

00:10:54.966 --> 00:10:58.166
Now, get out of the way
before I blast you too.

00:10:58.166 --> 00:10:59.933
It's my turn.

00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:01.873
I've got this.

00:11:01.873 --> 00:11:03.640
Shay is right.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.773
You should let him
handle this alone.

00:11:05.773 --> 00:11:08.940
Galaxy‐Eyes,
strike down Blaze Falcon

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.273
with Cipher Stream
of Destruction!

00:11:11.273 --> 00:11:12.806
(roaring)

00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:15.673
Raptor Intercept Form
activates again!

00:11:15.673 --> 00:11:19.140
So Blaze Falcon's attack
and defense points are reversed.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.640
I'll further protect
Blaze Falcon

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.573
with the Overlay Armor.

00:11:25.573 --> 00:11:28.706
By using one
of Blaze Falcon's
Overlay Units,

00:11:28.706 --> 00:11:31.306
my monster isn't
destroyed.

00:11:33.273 --> 00:11:35.306
(groaning)

00:11:36.606 --> 00:11:38.406
You're a great duelist, Kite,

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:41.873
but taking down Duel Academy
your way is the wrong way.

00:11:44.873 --> 00:11:47.006
And the only reason
I know is because

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:48.473
I learned that
the hard way.

00:11:48.473 --> 00:11:51.173
When I left our home,

00:11:51.173 --> 00:11:55.106
I swore I would do anything
to get Lulu back, including

00:11:55.106 --> 00:11:57.473
turning my foes
into cards.

00:11:57.473 --> 00:11:58.940
But I was wrong, Kite.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.146
All that did was create
more pain and misery.

00:12:02.146 --> 00:12:04.146
Shay.

00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:07.880
Well, you're sure creating
a lot of pain and misery for me.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.846
Galaxy‐Eyes and I have
no respect for cowards.

00:12:11.846 --> 00:12:14.246
And we'll have
no mercy on them either.

00:12:14.246 --> 00:12:16.513
Attack, Blaze Falcon!

00:12:16.513 --> 00:12:18.913
I use Blaze Falcon's
final Overlay Unit

00:12:18.913 --> 00:12:21.146
so that it won't
be destroyed!

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.613
It won't
protect you, though.

00:12:29.213 --> 00:12:30.780
Shay! No!

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.246
I end my turn
with a facedown.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.680
You're almost
out of life points.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.446
And your Blaze Falcon is
in no shape to save you.

00:12:48.446 --> 00:12:51.513
It's a whole lot weaker
than Kite's Galaxy‐Eyes.

00:12:51.513 --> 00:12:54.180
And all its Overlay Units
are used up.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.746
Not good.

00:12:55.746 --> 00:12:57.613
Shay's falcon is
a sittin' duck!

00:12:57.613 --> 00:12:59.246
Its goose is
totally cooked!

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.420
You and your Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon may have

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.886
pushed me to the edge
of defeat, Kite,

00:13:07.886 --> 00:13:09.653
but I'm not giving up.

00:13:09.653 --> 00:13:11.286
Not for me,

00:13:11.286 --> 00:13:13.953
and definitely
not for you.

00:13:13.953 --> 00:13:16.020
Why don't you just
leave me alone?

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.753
I will take down
Duel Academy my way!

00:13:18.753 --> 00:13:21.420
And I'm saying
that way is wrong, Kite!

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.853
We're going
to take them down
the right way.

00:13:23.853 --> 00:13:26.420
And we're going
to take them down together.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.720
You really made
an impression on Shay.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.920
Before he met you,
Shay wouldn't even

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.753
blink an eye before
turning our foes into cards.

00:13:34.753 --> 00:13:37.886
I'm gonna duel
some sense into you.

00:13:37.886 --> 00:13:41.186
Into that thick, stubborn
brick you call a brain.

00:13:42.753 --> 00:13:44.120
It's my turn!

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.420
Running for
another Action Card.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.786
When will you realize that
relying on Action Cards

00:13:49.786 --> 00:13:52.386
has done nothing
but make you soft and weak?

00:13:52.386 --> 00:13:54.053
No, Kite, you're wrong.

00:13:54.053 --> 00:13:57.720
These new friends have
made me stronger than ever!

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.626
Blaze Falcon,

00:14:00.626 --> 00:14:04.293
attack Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon!

00:14:04.293 --> 00:14:05.893
What are you thinking?

00:14:05.893 --> 00:14:08.660
Galaxy‐Eyes is totally
stronger than Blaze Falcon!

00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:12.060
I know!

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.260
But if my friends have
taught me one thing,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.726
it's that even when
things look the darkest,

00:14:15.726 --> 00:14:18.126
a single card can
provide a ray of hope.

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:22.460
I activate the spell
Attack Force!

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.926
That's a sweet move.

00:14:23.926 --> 00:14:25.893
Since Rise Falcon is
the weakest monster

00:14:25.893 --> 00:14:27.460
on the field,
its attack points

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.660
soar all the way
up to 1,600!

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.160
Kite, I was determined
to do things my way,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.293
but my friends
helped change me.

00:14:38.293 --> 00:14:40.626
I activate High Dive!

00:14:40.626 --> 00:14:44.626
So Blaze Falcon gets
even stronger!

00:14:44.626 --> 00:14:47.193
That falcon's
attack points took off!

00:14:47.193 --> 00:14:48.393
Keep 'em coming.

00:14:48.393 --> 00:14:50.060
When I left this dimension,

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.826
I was a loner
like you, Kite,

00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:53.793
but my travels taught me
that the greatest strength

00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:55.660
you can have is
true friends.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.660
True friends...

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.300
(sobbing)

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.300
Hey, what's up, Saya?

00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:09.533
Nice moves!

00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:10.600
What's this?

00:15:16.466 --> 00:15:19.166
Heh, looks like
that card couldn't help you.

00:15:22.766 --> 00:15:25.466
What gives? His monster
should've gotten stronger.

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:27.633
Negatory‐‐
that action spell

00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:30.233
can only be activated
when your opponent attacks!

00:15:30.233 --> 00:15:32.733
Too little, too late.

00:15:32.733 --> 00:15:35.433
Your Action Cards have
finally let you down.

00:15:35.433 --> 00:15:37.600
How appropriate.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.300
Exactly like your
so‐called friends,

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.100
who also
let you down.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.400
That's why I duel
on my own.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.233
So my friends won't
let me down in my fight

00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:47.633
against Duel Academy,

00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:49.533
and I won't
let them down either.

00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:52.733
I've had enough of people I know
just vanishing into nothing.

00:15:52.733 --> 00:15:55.166
I'm never joining you,
Shay, never.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.573
I'm never joining you,
Shay, never.

00:16:01.573 --> 00:16:04.206
You actually think
that if you don't care,

00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:06.140
you won't get hurt.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.740
Well, the reality is

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.873
you should care,
and you always do.

00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:11.640
My move!

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.740
By activating Rank Up
Magic Doom Double Force,

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.540
it lets me bring back
my Raid Raptor Blaze Falcon!

00:16:20.273 --> 00:16:22.140
Now, I'll Overlay it

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.740
and summon a Raid Raptor

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.540
with double its rank!

00:16:29.606 --> 00:16:33.140
I call upon my most brazen
bird of prey.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.373
With its alloy wings,

00:16:34.373 --> 00:16:37.373
it can swoop down
and wipe away any target!

00:16:37.373 --> 00:16:40.006
Go, Rank Up
XYZ Evolution!

00:16:40.006 --> 00:16:42.306
Soar forth,

00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:45.606
Raid Raptor
Ultimate Falcon!

00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:49.106
It's more powerful
than my Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon.

00:16:49.106 --> 00:16:50.506
Next, I'm gonna activate

00:16:50.506 --> 00:16:53.306
the trap card
Ultimate Full Burst!

00:16:53.306 --> 00:16:56.606
Not only can Ultimate Falcon
use its special abilities,

00:16:56.606 --> 00:16:59.406
but it can also
attack all of your monsters.

00:16:59.406 --> 00:17:01.313
And I'm afraid that, Kite,

00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:03.580
is very bad news for you
and your dragons.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.446
By using up one
of Ultimate Falcon's

00:17:07.446 --> 00:17:08.980
Overlay Units,

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.513
your dragons lose
their special abilities.

00:17:11.513 --> 00:17:14.280
And they also lose
1,000 attack points.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.280
Raid Raptor
Ultimate Falcon,

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.946
attack the first
Galaxy‐Eyes!

00:17:26.913 --> 00:17:28.480
Perfect strike!

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.213
Give him one more
to seal the deal!

00:17:30.213 --> 00:17:33.380
My new friends have helped me
to grow as a duelist,

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.080
just like you used
to challenge me

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.013
to be my best, Kite.

00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:40.213
Remember when we were
still in training?

00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:44.046
Back in those days,
we weren't dueling for survival

00:17:44.046 --> 00:17:45.713
or to get revenge

00:17:45.713 --> 00:17:47.713
but for the pure
fun of it.

00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:50.546
Shay's right,
that's exactly how it was.

00:17:50.546 --> 00:17:52.846
Whenever Kite and Shay
dueled each other,

00:17:52.846 --> 00:17:55.980
huge crowds of students would
gather around to cheer them on.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.346
(all gasping)

00:17:57.346 --> 00:17:59.380
All the other kids
at school

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.086
looked at Kite and Shay
as heroes.

00:18:01.086 --> 00:18:02.786
(whimpering)

00:18:02.786 --> 00:18:04.420
How...

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.653
How could you know
what it was like?

00:18:06.653 --> 00:18:09.086
I know because
Yuto's spirit is a part of me.

00:18:09.086 --> 00:18:10.553
Part of you?

00:18:10.553 --> 00:18:12.486
(Gong)
Wait, say that again.

00:18:12.486 --> 00:18:16.253
(Sylvio)
Well, that sounds
nice and creepy.

00:18:16.253 --> 00:18:17.920
I knew you were
still around.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.886
I just knew it.

00:18:25.886 --> 00:18:27.086
Now, this is it.

00:18:27.086 --> 00:18:28.553
Finish this!

00:18:28.553 --> 00:18:29.453
Ultimate Falcon,
attack!

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.653
(cheering)
Do it!
Go, Kite!

00:18:35.653 --> 00:18:38.020
(booming)

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.020
Now, I'm activating
the special ability

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.020
of Cipher Mirror Knight!

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.553
By sending my Knight

00:18:44.553 --> 00:18:46.553
and one of my other cards
to the graveyard,

00:18:46.553 --> 00:18:51.420
I get to resurrect
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.686
That's not all.

00:18:54.686 --> 00:18:56.353
The card I sent
to the graveyard

00:18:56.353 --> 00:18:58.586
was the trap
Cipher Clone Magic.

00:18:58.586 --> 00:19:01.193
By sending a spell
in my deck to the graveyard,

00:19:01.193 --> 00:19:02.960
I can activate
its effects.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.226
Go, Cipher Interference!

00:19:05.226 --> 00:19:09.393
Since I have two Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragons on my field,

00:19:09.393 --> 00:19:11.926
one of them has
their attack points doubled.

00:19:11.926 --> 00:19:13.060
Making it stronger

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.460
than your little birdie.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.326
With Ultimate Full Burst
in effect, that means

00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:22.726
your Ultimate Falcon must
attack all of my monsters.

00:19:22.726 --> 00:19:27.360
Which means it has to attack
my more powerful Galaxy‐Eyes!

00:19:34.693 --> 00:19:36.360
Aah!

00:19:39.193 --> 00:19:40.793
(gasping)
Oh, no! Shay!

00:19:40.793 --> 00:19:43.460
(grunting)

00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:47.660
I warned you
to leave me alone, Shay.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.560
But you wouldn't listen,
and that's too bad for you.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.360
Kite, stop! Don't!
Leave him alone!

00:19:56.293 --> 00:19:59.593
Please, Kite,
please let him go!

00:19:59.593 --> 00:20:01.866
We've already
lost Lulu!

00:20:01.866 --> 00:20:03.933
And it was my fault.

00:20:03.933 --> 00:20:05.600
That's not true, Saya.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.766
You can't keep
blaming yourself.

00:20:07.766 --> 00:20:08.966
I should have...

00:20:08.966 --> 00:20:11.566
jumped in to help her.

00:20:11.566 --> 00:20:13.633
(Yuri)
I do admit,
I enjoyed our little game

00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:16.133
of hide‐and‐seek,
but I have you now,

00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:17.666
and you're coming
with me.

00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:20.766
I promise where we're going
isn't too horrifying.

00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:26.266
(Saya)
I was too scared,

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:28.566
too much of a coward
to help Lulu.

00:20:28.566 --> 00:20:31.266
She was captured
because I did nothing.

00:20:31.266 --> 00:20:34.300
(sobbing)

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.300
I'm out of here.

00:20:51.733 --> 00:20:54.266
And don't bother
looking for me.

00:20:54.266 --> 00:20:56.100
Don't go!
