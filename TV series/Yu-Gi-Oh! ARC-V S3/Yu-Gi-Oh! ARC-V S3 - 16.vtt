WEBVTT

00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.833
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:06.800
(Yuya)
My dad is really
on that ship?

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.233
Yeah.
I'm so sorry, Yuya.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.466
We can't give up that easy!

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.833
Where are you going?

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.533
(Yuya)
To find another boat!

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.833
(horn blowing)

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.700
If it's a duel
that you want,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.833
it's a duel that
you'll get, Dennis!

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:23.100
Oh I do want a duel‐‐
just not with you.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.966
So, teach, tell me.

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:28.166
You up for putting your razzle
against my dazzle?

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.666
Zip it, red.
Huh?

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.733
Kite!
What a surprise!

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.600
The Professor is
holding Lulu hostage.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.466
You're gonna tell me
where he's keeping her.

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.833
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:41.600
(Kite)
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:44.933
I don't like
where this is going.

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:48.233
Go, Cipher Stream
of Devastation!

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.000
(cries out)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.466
(screaming)

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.900
All the things I've done
and friends I've betrayed.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.933
There's no coming back
from that.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.800
Dennis.
Stay back!

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.773
There are two huge
towers at Duel Academy.

00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:06.173
Rin's in the east tower,
Lulu's in the west.

00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:07.906
Until next time!

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.273
Anyone have any luck?

00:01:15.273 --> 00:01:17.006
Gong sure didn't.

00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:18.706
Same with me‐‐ nothing.

00:01:18.706 --> 00:01:20.440
There's not
a captain in sight!

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.073
We're completely landlocked.

00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:23.006
(Celina)
Don't be so sure.

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:24.240
(Gong)
Is that...?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.706
Celina!

00:01:25.706 --> 00:01:27.206
Heard ya need a boat!

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:29.306
Well, I'm lookin'
for a crew!

(Sylvio)
No lap pool?
No first‐class cabins?

00:02:39.446 --> 00:02:41.480
I'm already seasick.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.513
We'll never make it
to Duel Academy

00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:45.113
in this leaky piece
of driftwood.

00:02:45.113 --> 00:02:46.446
(Cutter)
Arrrr!

00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:48.680
Who's that insultin'
me vessel?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.546
(Sylvio)
It's a pirate!

00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:53.380
(Celina)
Meet Captain Cutter,
the skipper of this boat.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.180
The Sea Weasel
be a stout ship.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.313
Take me word for it,
laddie!

00:02:58.313 --> 00:02:59.646
(anxious chuckle)
Aye‐aye, sir!

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.420
I'm so relieved, Celina.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.186
I was scared
I'd never see you again!

00:03:05.186 --> 00:03:06.953
You can't imagine
how worried I was

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:07.886
when you disappeared!

00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:13.186
(Gong)
So like, what happened to ya?

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:15.886
(Celina)
I got hauled back to Duel
Academy and got locked up.

00:03:15.886 --> 00:03:17.486
I thought about giving up,

00:03:17.486 --> 00:03:19.453
but that's when I heard
through the grapevine

00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:22.086
that the Lancers were
wreaking havoc with their plans.

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:23.620
That news gave me hope‐‐

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.653
enough hope to find
a way to break out

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:28.486
and escape
from the Professor

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:30.886
and go looking for you.

00:03:30.886 --> 00:03:32.553
And here you are!

00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:35.386
And I brought
good news with me.

00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:38.553
I also found out where Rin
and Lulu are being held,

00:03:38.553 --> 00:03:40.753
so we can rescue them
from the Professor.

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:43.020
(Zuzu)
That's the best news
I've heard in like forever!

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.053
Uh‐huh.
We owe you big time!

00:03:45.053 --> 00:03:47.753
There's no need to thank me.

00:03:47.753 --> 00:03:50.920
Friends should
look out for each other.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.453
Yeah! All for one!

00:03:53.453 --> 00:03:55.486
And one for all!
We all stick together.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.220
Huh?
Huh?

00:04:00.786 --> 00:04:03.426
(Yuya)
Hey, that helicopter's
from Duel Academy!

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:05.993
(Sylvio)
Can't the Professor
just leave us alone,

00:04:05.993 --> 00:04:07.660
even for a second?

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.460
(Gong)
Not when he's
afterCelina and Zuzu!

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.193
You gals should take cover!

00:04:11.193 --> 00:04:13.793
Let's move!

00:04:13.793 --> 00:04:16.426
There's plenty
hidin' spaces down below.

00:04:17.993 --> 00:04:20.826
And just where do you two
think you're going?!

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.726
Hope you two gents
know the doggy paddle.

00:04:23.726 --> 00:04:26.893
'Cause Gong here is about
to send you deep sea divin'!

00:04:26.893 --> 00:04:27.893
(Zuzu gasps)

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.360
Wha‐‐? Zuzu?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.426
(groaning)

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.293
What are you doing?
You're hurting me.

00:04:36.293 --> 00:04:39.660
Let me go! Celina!
(groaning)

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.360
Stop it!

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.126
Hold it, laddie!
This here's my ship,

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:44.660
and I'm the only one

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.193
who'll be givin'
orders around here.

00:04:47.193 --> 00:04:49.060
Haul 'em in!

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.926
(groaning)

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:55.193
Make 'em walk
the plank!

00:04:55.193 --> 00:04:56.960
But Gong don't float!

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.060
Oh, no!
What's going on?

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.433
We've been shanghaied!

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:04.233
Hey, Celina!
Hope you brought a snorkel,

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:06.800
'cause when I get outta here,
you're goin' for a swim!

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.133
Save your breath.
You're going to need it.

00:05:09.133 --> 00:05:10.133
Why, you...!

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:12.200
Avast!

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.366
Ye will have to get past me
to save yer friend.

00:05:17.933 --> 00:05:21.300
Yuya!

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.200
Celina!
How could you do this?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.433
Duel Academy, reporting
mission accomplished.

00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:43.300
And by mission, you mean
lying to us, right?

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.066
I don't know
how could you throw away

00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:46.800
our friendship like that.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.100
I would never have done
that to you. Not ever.

00:05:56.433 --> 00:05:58.600
Gong's so upset that
he climbed on board

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.266
and fell for
this dastardly trap

00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:02.540
hook, line, and sinker!

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.906
I knew we shoulda
hitched a ride

00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:05.373
on a luxury cruise ship.

00:06:05.373 --> 00:06:07.106
Why'd we have to settle
for this rickety wreck?

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:08.640
You tricked us!

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.073
You're actually working
for Duel Academy!

00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:13.206
(chuckles)
Ye may be right.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.940
Change the heading
of this ship

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.806
and follow the copter!

00:06:16.806 --> 00:06:18.973
Sure thing, but you
won't be settin' foot

00:06:18.973 --> 00:06:21.706
on Duel Academy Island
ever again.
Why?

00:06:21.706 --> 00:06:24.973
Because after I'm done
gettin' through with ya,

00:06:24.973 --> 00:06:28.773
you'll be catchin' Zs
in Davy Jones' locker!

00:06:28.773 --> 00:06:30.306
Oh, yeah? We'll see!

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.306
(computer voice)
Generating Action Field:
Crossover.

00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:37.306
(both)
Let's duel!

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.506
I be seizin' the first turn!

00:06:41.506 --> 00:06:45.240
To start, I'll be activatin'
me spell Polymerization

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.040
so that I can fuse
Skull Mariner

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.506
and Skull Knight #2
together!

00:06:50.506 --> 00:06:53.406
By combinin' the fearsomest
ship in pirate lore

00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:55.840
with the ghastliest
of medieval marauders,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.173
I can summon the most
notorious buccaneer in history!

00:06:59.173 --> 00:07:01.080
I Fusion Summon!

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.246
Welcome aboard,
Captain Lock!

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.580
(growling)

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.013
(gasps)
Huh!

00:07:12.013 --> 00:07:14.446
Huh!
With zero attack points,

00:07:14.446 --> 00:07:16.446
he couldn't even
captain a dinghy.

00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:19.513
Gong's thinkin' maybe
Cutter's tricorn
is too tight.

00:07:19.513 --> 00:07:22.846
(chuckles)
Captain Lock's
a treacherous opponent.

00:07:22.846 --> 00:07:24.446
With him onboard,

00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:27.080
neither of us can summon
any monsters from our hands!

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.680
What!?
(sinister laughter)

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.346
(groaning)

00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:35.046
I snagged meself
an Action Spell!

00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:39.246
Power Gem will hoist up
Lock by 800 attack points!

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.680
(gasps)

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.880
(growling)

00:07:48.246 --> 00:07:50.213
But the Captain's
got one drawback.

00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:52.613
Y'see, if thar's
a monster on the field

00:07:52.613 --> 00:07:54.613
with at least
1,000 attack points,

00:07:54.613 --> 00:07:56.780
me poor ole' Captain
Lock will be destroyed.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.446
But Yuya can't
summon a monster

00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.520
to the field anymore,
so Lock's safe and sound!

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.320
No, not totally.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.686
Yuya still has a
way
outta this mess.Huh?

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.253
Yeah, all I have to do

00:08:08.253 --> 00:08:10.420
is raise Lock's points
to at least 1,000

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.120
and he'll be taken out
by his own special ability!

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.553
That'll be harder
than ye think!

00:08:15.553 --> 00:08:18.953
But it's yer turn, lad,
so give it yer best shot!

00:08:18.953 --> 00:08:21.486
Oh, I will! Hmm!

00:08:23.153 --> 00:08:25.286
(thinking)
I don't have
anything in my hand

00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:28.186
that will raise
Captain Lock's attack points.

00:08:29.953 --> 00:08:33.053
(thinking)
But an Action Card might!
Time to roll!

00:08:38.453 --> 00:08:40.386
Oh, yeah!
(growls)

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:42.586
Heave to, y' rogue!
(grunting)

00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:44.920
Huh?

00:08:46.386 --> 00:08:48.220
Nice!

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.586
I'll activate
the Action Spell Fire Gem

00:08:50.586 --> 00:08:54.186
to launch a broadside
that'll trim yer sails!

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.826
(groaning)

00:09:01.126 --> 00:09:02.560
(sinister laughter)

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.126
(grunting)

00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:07.626
(grunts)

00:09:07.626 --> 00:09:09.126
Hit the deck!

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.260
(groaning)

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.960
Wha‐‐?
Don't ye dare!

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.660
Aw, yeah!

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.493
(growls)
What?!?

00:09:19.493 --> 00:09:22.093
This Action Card deals
damage to myself!?

00:09:22.093 --> 00:09:24.493
It seems that
instead of treasure,

00:09:24.493 --> 00:09:27.026
your card turned out
to be fool's gold!

00:09:27.026 --> 00:09:28.326
(sinister laughter)

00:09:28.326 --> 00:09:29.993
(thinking)
What should I do?

00:09:29.993 --> 00:09:32.560
I'm only allowed to have
one Action Card at a time,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.260
so if I want another one,
I have to play this one first.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.826
You know what they say,
no pain, no gain!

00:09:38.826 --> 00:09:41.860
I activate Crystal Gem
and lose 600 life points.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.893
(groaning)

00:09:42.893 --> 00:09:45.226
(screaming)

00:09:49.726 --> 00:09:52.726
(sinister laughter)

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:54.926
Ah! I salute y', laddie!

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:58.460
Now let this old pirate
show ye how to win a duel!

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.193
(sinister laughter)

00:10:00.193 --> 00:10:02.433
I'll be takin' a shot
across the bow at ye

00:10:02.433 --> 00:10:05.400
with another Fire Gem
Action Spell card!

00:10:08.533 --> 00:10:11.200
(screaming)

00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:16.666
(groaning)
Yuya's life points
keep goin' down in flames!

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:18.400
C'mon, little buddy!

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.366
Knock the barnacles
off this buffoon!

00:10:20.366 --> 00:10:23.233
(thinking)
I want to, Gong,
but so far,

00:10:23.233 --> 00:10:25.866
this ship has been
nothing but a wreck for me.

00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:27.666
There's gotta be
an action card somewhere

00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:29.400
that'll help me out.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.066
Yer pooped out,
but I'm spry as a dolphin!

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:34.966
(thinking)
It'll be hard to shake him,

00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:37.833
because if I can't find
a way to summon my monsters,

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:39.833
he'll always
have a leg up on me.

00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:43.066
Huh? A leg up. Ah!

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.033
Maybe I do have
a chance! Hmm!

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:53.033
Admit that yer
out of yer league, lad.

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:55.400
Take me advice
and strike yer colors.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.366
Huh?

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:03.206
What's this!?

00:11:06.373 --> 00:11:08.073
He's layin' it
all on the line!

00:11:08.073 --> 00:11:10.240
That move is almost
as daring and brilliant

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.273
as something I would
have dreamed up!

00:11:12.273 --> 00:11:15.006
(thinking)
C'mon, Action Cards,
where are you?

00:11:18.373 --> 00:11:19.906
Bingo!

00:11:19.906 --> 00:11:22.840
Oh, no, y' don't!
Hard rudder!

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.006
Hard rudder!
Aye, Captain!

00:11:29.173 --> 00:11:31.340
Huh? Whoa!

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.673
(screaming)

00:11:32.673 --> 00:11:34.606
Yuya!
Y u y a !

00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:36.306
(sinister laughter)

00:11:36.306 --> 00:11:39.006
(screaming)

00:11:42.973 --> 00:11:46.006
(screaming)

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:49.573
Yuya!
Y u y a !

00:11:49.573 --> 00:11:52.006
(Crow)
Step on it, Declan!

00:11:56.906 --> 00:11:59.306
We only got
one shot at this!

00:11:59.306 --> 00:12:02.246
Raikiri, grab Yuya!

00:12:08.413 --> 00:12:10.513
Uh, Raikiri?

00:12:10.513 --> 00:12:13.346
(Riley)
Yuya!

00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:16.313
(Yuya)
Riley and Crow!

00:12:16.313 --> 00:12:18.946
I saw that coming
from a dimension away.

00:12:20.613 --> 00:12:22.246
Hmm?
Well, hello.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.146
You guys need a lift?

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.713
Arrr!
Vilesome dogs!

00:12:33.713 --> 00:12:35.546
Huh? A card!

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:38.013
(sinister laughter)

00:12:38.013 --> 00:12:40.846
Next time, don't hitch
a ride from pirates!

00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:42.646
Thanks for
the save back there!

00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:44.580
How did you track us down?

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.746
(Sora)
Who cares?
We saved your butt!

00:12:46.746 --> 00:12:48.546
(Yuya) Sora?

00:12:48.546 --> 00:12:50.180
But it still needs
a little savin'.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.846
(Cutter)
Arr! You can't be
abandonin' ship

00:12:52.846 --> 00:12:54.013
in the middle of a duel!

00:12:54.013 --> 00:12:56.146
You see?

00:12:56.146 --> 00:12:59.886
Fine. I place one card
facedown and end my turn!

00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:05.220
It's me turn again!
I draw!

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.053
I'll be activatin'
the spell Battle At Sea!

00:13:09.053 --> 00:13:11.886
Now, whenever one o' me
Water Attribute monsters

00:13:11.886 --> 00:13:13.886
attacks ye rascally rats,

00:13:13.886 --> 00:13:15.886
ye'll be sufferin'
double the damage!

00:13:19.853 --> 00:13:21.486
(all gasp)

00:13:21.486 --> 00:13:22.986
(sinister laughter)

00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:25.253
Ye had best be
battenin' down the hatches,

00:13:25.253 --> 00:13:28.653
'cause Captain Lock will be
bombardin' yer boat directly!

00:13:28.653 --> 00:13:31.086
(growling)

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.886
Huh?
Huh?

00:13:40.353 --> 00:13:43.253
(all screaming)

00:13:43.253 --> 00:13:45.620
(thud)

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.586
(groaning)

00:13:49.553 --> 00:13:51.053
Yuya!

00:13:51.053 --> 00:13:53.053
With that,
I'll end me turn!

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.120
I have this!

00:13:57.853 --> 00:14:00.560
(computer voice)
Intrusion penalty:
2,000 life points.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.793
(groaning)

00:14:04.326 --> 00:14:06.126
What?

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.526
Ha! If it isn't that renegade
rapscallion, Sora Perse!

00:14:12.526 --> 00:14:14.660
Nice to see you, too, Cap.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.426
I see y' still
like dressing up
in Halloween costumes!

00:14:17.426 --> 00:14:20.460
And I see you're still
running off at the mouth!

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.293
(dismissive chuckle)
I mean, uh,

00:14:22.293 --> 00:14:23.826
yer runnin' with
the enemy, ye traitor!

00:14:25.893 --> 00:14:28.793
Surrender now and
I'll ask the Professor

00:14:28.793 --> 00:14:31.893
to have mercy
on yer treacherous soul.

00:14:31.893 --> 00:14:35.126
His pirate act is
getting on my nerves.

00:14:35.126 --> 00:14:36.793
(groaning)

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.993
But I'll play along
for now, Cap.

00:14:38.993 --> 00:14:41.426
I'll be more than happy
to sink you and your ship!

00:14:41.426 --> 00:14:43.693
Sora, a word, if I may.

00:14:43.693 --> 00:14:45.026
It behooves me
to inform you

00:14:45.026 --> 00:14:47.160
of Captain Lock's
special ability.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.626
You mean the part
about how I can't summon

00:14:49.626 --> 00:14:50.926
a single monster
from my hand

00:14:50.926 --> 00:14:53.126
as long as Captain Lock
remains on the field,

00:14:53.126 --> 00:14:55.260
so my opponent
has all the advantage?

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.593
So even though you knew you
couldn't summon a monster,

00:14:58.593 --> 00:15:00.700
you still decided to butt in?

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.466
Not exactly the smartest
move ever, bub.

00:15:03.466 --> 00:15:05.800
Maybe if I had
your limited skills.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.366
Whatnow?

00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:09.933
It doesn't say I can't
summon any monsters.

00:15:09.933 --> 00:15:13.366
I just can't summon
any monsters from my hand.

00:15:13.366 --> 00:15:15.700
But with Polymerization,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.866
I can Fusion Summon
a monster from my extra deck,

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:22.800
so that's exactly what
I'm about to do, Sylvio.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.866
Gong's gotta admit,
it's a good thing

00:15:24.866 --> 00:15:26.400
the only person
around here

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.566
with your set o' skills,
Sylvio, is you.

00:15:28.566 --> 00:15:31.100
Come now, Gong,
I knew that.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.833
I was just testing Sora to
see if he could figure it out.

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:36.700
It's time to make some
waves, cause I'm fusing

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.700
my Edge Imp Tomahawk and
my Fluffal Octopus! Hah!

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.400
Blades of steel
and monster of the deep,

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.533
when the two come together,
your heart will skip a beat!

00:15:45.533 --> 00:15:47.633
I Fusion Summon!

00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:50.366
Hold on to your pirate hat,
'cause you're about to face

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:55.200
a seafarer's worst nightmare!
It's Frightfur Kraken!

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.900
(growling)

00:15:58.533 --> 00:16:02.040
Y' see, my Kraken has more
than 1,000 attack points,

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.206
so Captain Lock
will have to pay the price

00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:07.440
of his special ability
and cash in his doubloons!

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.706
(growling)

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.973
Arrr! Big deal!
You haven't won yet!

00:16:14.973 --> 00:16:19.106
I activate the trap card
Perished Pirate!

00:16:21.006 --> 00:16:23.773
Now, by negating
its special abilities,

00:16:23.773 --> 00:16:27.706
it revives Captain Lock
from Davey Jones locker!

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.540
What's more, ye filthy
worms, once per turn,

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.806
by equipping a monster in my
graveyard onto Captain Lock,

00:16:39.806 --> 00:16:43.073
me Captain gains
that monster's attack points.

00:16:43.073 --> 00:16:46.606
Me choice be Skull Mariner!

00:16:46.606 --> 00:16:48.140
(sinister laughter)

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.206
(growling)

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.573
Then I'll use me Action Card!
Thanks to Power Gem,

00:16:57.573 --> 00:16:59.673
Captain Lock will be
as hail an' hearty

00:16:59.673 --> 00:17:01.880
as any scoundrel
that sailed the seas!

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.380
Watch as them thar
attack points go sky high.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.346
(growling)

00:17:09.346 --> 00:17:12.480
(sinister laughter)

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.646
Yer puny octeepus
can't do a lick o' damage

00:17:15.646 --> 00:17:17.513
to me pirate monster now!

00:17:17.513 --> 00:17:20.346
Attack us,
an' ye'll be shark grub!

00:17:20.346 --> 00:17:22.646
(sinister laughter)

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.646
(sinister laughter)

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:29.546
We'll have the last laugh!

00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:31.646
(sinister laughter)
Err?

00:17:31.646 --> 00:17:34.380
I play a trap!
Performapal teamwork!

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.646
Now I can equip
a Performapal

00:17:38.646 --> 00:17:40.646
that has 1,000
attack points or less

00:17:40.646 --> 00:17:42.380
to Sora's Fusion Monster!

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.846
(growling)

00:17:43.846 --> 00:17:46.280
So I'm equipping my
Performapal Swordfish

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.946
onto Frightfur Kraken!

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.613
Err!

00:17:54.613 --> 00:17:56.980
Now that Kraken
can swing this blade,

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.320
it gains double
Swordfish's attack points!

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.753
(growling)

00:18:03.753 --> 00:18:07.920
His monster is as powerful
as a battle frigate now!

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.253
Thanks for the help, Yuya.

00:18:10.253 --> 00:18:12.053
Yeah!

00:18:12.053 --> 00:18:15.220
Frightfur Kraken, put the
squeeze on Captain Lock!

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.120
All right now. Attack!

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.320
(growling)

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.986
(groaning)

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.120
(groaning)

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.486
(laughing)
Oh, and it's not over yet!

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:35.286
Thanks to its special
ability, Frightfur Kraken

00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.786
can attack twice during
each and ev'ry turn!

00:18:37.786 --> 00:18:39.286
Shiver me timbers!

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:41.486
Now get crackin', Kraken.

00:18:41.486 --> 00:18:43.153
Slash and squeeze
the Captain

00:18:43.153 --> 00:18:44.653
and end this duel!

00:18:44.653 --> 00:18:46.586
(growling)

00:18:48.053 --> 00:18:49.353
(screaming)

00:18:49.353 --> 00:18:52.586
(whimpering)

00:18:55.153 --> 00:18:57.553
(screaming)

00:19:04.526 --> 00:19:07.593
(Sora)
All ahead full!

00:19:07.593 --> 00:19:13.193
After 'em, mateys!
Starboard, ho!

00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:15.126
What's that, Moon Shadow?

00:19:15.126 --> 00:19:17.826
Did you take a souvenir
from the pirate ship?

00:19:20.193 --> 00:19:21.526
(whimpering)
Aah!

00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:24.960
(groaning)

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.760
(Cutter)
Yer makin' me dizzy,
y' dolts!

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.360
Curse them loathsome Lancers!
I'll get me revenge!

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.560
(Sora)
Happy sailing, Captain!

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.793
(Yuya)
I thought you were still
in the Synchro Dimension.

00:19:38.793 --> 00:19:41.826
We were, but now
that we restored peace

00:19:41.826 --> 00:19:43.326
between Topsiders
and Commons,

00:19:43.326 --> 00:19:44.960
we're here to put an end

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.360
to my father's
interdimensional war.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.426
At last!
That's great!

00:19:51.426 --> 00:19:53.160
It is.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.926
We helped with
the heavy lifting,

00:19:54.926 --> 00:19:57.260
but once things were cool,
we decided it was time

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.560
to go look for you lot.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.666
Figured you could
probably use my help.

00:20:02.666 --> 00:20:06.933
And‐‐ and I can help
you guys out as well.

00:20:06.933 --> 00:20:08.366
That's a tall order.

00:20:08.366 --> 00:20:10.166
Don't spoil the moment!

00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:15.800
Then let's go rescue Zuzu!
And save Celina, too.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.033
Celina?

00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:19.566
The Celina I know

00:20:19.566 --> 00:20:22.733
would never in a million years
double‐cross us!

00:20:22.733 --> 00:20:25.200
There's gotta be a reason
why she did what she did,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.833
and I'm gonna find out why!

00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:31.833
(Sora)
Well, I might
know why, maybe.

00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:34.166
I heard this crazy rumor
that there's someone

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.633
working for the Professor

00:20:35.633 --> 00:20:39.000
who can take total control
of other people's minds.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.800
If that's true,
that'd explain it!

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.066
(thinking)
And I bet they're gonna
brainwash Zuzu next.

00:20:45.066 --> 00:20:48.266
Lancers, it's finally time!

00:20:48.266 --> 00:20:50.466
We are going
to Duel Academy

00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:52.933
to take down my father
and put an end

00:20:52.933 --> 00:20:54.666
to this
interdimensional war,

00:20:54.666 --> 00:20:56.800
and we can only
do this as a team.
