WEBVTT

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.633
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:06.366
This duel will be tough.

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.933
Let's give these Obelisks
a pounding!

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.233
(all)
Let's duel!

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.666
Stand in awe
of the ground shaking

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.966
Chaos Ancient Gear Giant!

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.066
It's that monster...
Oh, no!

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:25.500
Saya, no!

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.233
You're okay!

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.800
(Yuya)
He's hurt bad.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.233
You should worry more about
yourself than your friend!

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:41.633
Chaos Giant, crush Friendonkey!

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:42.966
Attack!

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:51.433
Thanks for that.
I play Quick Guard!

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:54.700
It switches Friendonkey
to defense mode,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.000
so Yuya doesn't take any damage.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.666
(computer)
<i>Intrusion penalty.</i>

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.100
<i>2,000 points.</i>

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.306
No way!
Kite?

00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:04.206
He's teaming up
with the Lancers?

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:05.606
I Xyz Summon!

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:09.539
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.473
Go Cipher Subjection!

00:01:12.473 --> 00:01:15.773
I gain control of
Chaos Ancient Gear Giant

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:20.206
and transform it into another
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:22.073
(Obelisk)
No! Chaos Giant!

00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:24.873
Go Cipher
Stream of Destruction!

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:26.440
(screaming)

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.906
Now, Yuya Sakaki...

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:37.640
You and I have a date
with destiny!

Well, well, if it isn't
Commander Frowny McFrowny face.

00:02:46.413 --> 00:02:48.680
Settle down, Grace.
A little respect.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.980
Commander Phoenix, The Professor
sent us to your dimension

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.580
to wipe out the Lancers.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.146
Looks like you failed!

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:57.180
Like you could do any better!

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.446
Oh, wait.
You couldn't.

00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:00.320
The grapevine says
Yuya kicked your butt.

00:03:01.653 --> 00:03:03.520
Yuya...

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.120
That's a mistake I intend
to remedy personally.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.920
So you two can skulk on home
to the Professor if you'd like.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.120
What I'd like to do is zip
that lip of yours!

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.853
Silence!

00:03:14.853 --> 00:03:17.186
Show a little respect
to your superior!

00:03:17.186 --> 00:03:20.286
Besides, if anyone is going to
crush those dastardly Lancers

00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:22.020
in a duel, it will be me!

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.320
Isn't that so, sir?

00:03:24.753 --> 00:03:26.520
I... mean...

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.520
there's no need for you to soil
your immaculate uniform

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.886
in a messy brawl, is there?

00:03:31.886 --> 00:03:34.120
With your permission,
I'll bring a battle

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.386
that will belt those interlopers
back from whence they came!

00:03:37.386 --> 00:03:41.053
You've done enough already,
haven't you?

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:42.920
You and I will talk later.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.520
I've got work to do.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.053
He knows... he knows that
I went behind his back

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:50.986
to bring the Tyler sisters here.

00:03:50.986 --> 00:03:53.553
He'll be so mad he'll assign me
to toilet patrol!

00:03:53.553 --> 00:03:55.953
Unless Yuya takes him down...

00:03:55.953 --> 00:03:58.153
Come on, Shay...
Wake up!

00:03:58.953 --> 00:04:00.986
Guys, we got company!

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:04.093
You get Shay outta here and I'll
hold off these buffoons.

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:05.826
No, Alan.
I will.

00:04:05.826 --> 00:04:07.660
You'll do no such thing!

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.960
(computer)
Generating Action Field:
Crossover.

00:04:11.693 --> 00:04:13.726
(grunting)

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.460
What're you up to!?

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.360
(rumbling)
Huh?

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.260
I'm not up to anything,
but these fences are.

00:04:31.093 --> 00:04:32.826
What's this?

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:36.493
A little extra insurance
in case you try to run off.

00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:41.026
It's perfect to keep outsiders
out and us insiders in.

00:04:41.026 --> 00:04:45.160
Yuya, you were fortunate
to escape our last meeting,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.493
but not this time...
You're mine now.

00:04:47.493 --> 00:04:50.226
So prepare to duel
your last duel ever!

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:53.426
I'm always up for a duel,
but my buddy needs help.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.093
(Yuto)
Save your breath.

00:04:55.093 --> 00:04:56.393
Yuto?

00:04:56.393 --> 00:04:58.426
We don't have a choice.

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:00.426
There's only one way to get
out of this cage,

00:05:00.426 --> 00:05:04.066
and it's to go
right through him, Yuya.

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:06.166
And we got no time
to mess around.

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:08.666
If we want to help Shay,
we gotta duel.

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:15.600
Are you in position?

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.300
<i>Yessir!</i>

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.666
<i>I'll have the squad</i>
<i>move in ASAP!</i>

00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:23.566
There must be some way we can
bust Yuya out of that cage.

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:34.133
If I take these Lancers down,

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.666
Aster can't be
mad at me anymore.

00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:37.533
Guys, run!

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:40.666
Well, that certainly
escalated quickly.

00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:42.200
It sure did.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.500
Kite?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.566
Guess I got here
just in time.

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:48.933
Yuya!

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:51.000
Don't worry about your friends.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.666
I'm on it.
Thanks, Kite.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.633
Hope you're ready
to be blown away...

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:59.166
'Cause it's show time!

00:06:02.506 --> 00:06:03.840
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.073
I'll make the first move!

00:06:06.073 --> 00:06:07.740
And choosing
which monster to summon

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.506
was an easy decision to make!

00:06:09.506 --> 00:06:12.140
Come out,
Destiny Hero ‐ Decider!

00:06:14.873 --> 00:06:18.106
Yuya Sakaki, I'm bringing
the curtain down

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:21.173
on you and your dad's
dueltaining.

00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:24.340
You two think dueling's all
about making people smile.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.006
Well, after I get through
with you,

00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:28.206
you'll never be smiling again.

00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:31.340
This is my second chance
to show him he's wrong.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.340
I gotta do it this time cause
I don't think I'll get a third.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.206
Now show me what you've got.

00:06:36.206 --> 00:06:39.373
All right!
You asked for it.

00:06:39.373 --> 00:06:41.173
It's my move!

00:06:41.173 --> 00:06:43.173
I set the Pendulum Scale with my

00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:46.540
Performapal Handstandaccoon
and my Timegazer Magician!

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.606
I'm taking control of this duel
starting now!

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:54.506
Now I can summon monsters
from levels four through seven

00:06:54.506 --> 00:06:56.740
all at the same time!

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.573
Swing far, pendulum!

00:06:58.573 --> 00:07:01.446
Carve the arc of victory!

00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:05.546
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:07:08.046 --> 00:07:10.580
Take aim Performapal
Dag Daggerman!

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.046
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:07:16.513 --> 00:07:18.413
(growling)

00:07:18.413 --> 00:07:20.013
Whoa...

00:07:20.013 --> 00:07:22.146
So glad I got
a front row seat!

00:07:22.146 --> 00:07:24.180
All right, showtime!

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.213
Dag Daggerman, attack!

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:28.880
Sling your blades
at Destiny Hero ‐ Decider!

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.780
And next,
my Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.280
will attack you directly!

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.080
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.946
I send Destiny Hero ‐ Dynatag
to the graveyard

00:07:45.946 --> 00:07:48.146
so I can activate
its special ability.

00:07:48.146 --> 00:07:50.780
Since I have fewer
life points than you,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.546
I don't take damage
from Odd‐Eyes.

00:07:52.546 --> 00:07:56.780
But instead, we both take
1,000 points of damage!

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.280
Well not "we" actually...
just you!

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.186
By returning Destiny Hero ‐
Decider to my hand,

00:08:03.186 --> 00:08:07.320
it stops me
from losing any life points.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:07.853
(screaming)

00:08:11.953 --> 00:08:13.186
Cool!

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:15.053
Aster brought his A‐game!

00:08:15.053 --> 00:08:17.453
So Yuya's gonna have to go
A‐plus on him!

00:08:17.453 --> 00:08:19.453
We're not here
to spectate, Grace.

00:08:19.453 --> 00:08:21.986
While Commander Phoenix
handles Yuya,

00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:25.220
let's go clean up
the rest of the riffraff.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.253
Can't you take care
of those losers?

00:08:27.253 --> 00:08:29.486
I want to watch
the bam, slam, and kabam!

00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:34.020
Heh, you think you have
enough monsters?

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.986
No, Kite!
He'll be fine.

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:42.620
Yuya, keep your eyes
on the prize.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.020
Yeah, you're right.

00:08:45.253 --> 00:08:46.686
I end my turn.

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:47.853
Then it's my move!

00:08:47.853 --> 00:08:49.420
I draw!

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.553
I activate a spell‐‐
Polymerization!

00:08:52.553 --> 00:08:55.753
And with it I fuse
Destiny Hero ‐ Decider

00:08:55.753 --> 00:08:59.286
and Destiny Hero Drilldark!

00:08:59.286 --> 00:09:01.260
With the help
of this next monster,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.926
your fate's about to take
a terrifying turn for the worse!

00:09:08.226 --> 00:09:10.560
I Fusion Summon!

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.660
Destiny Hero ‐ Dystopia!

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.026
And I'm putting its power
to use... right away!

00:09:23.026 --> 00:09:25.960
You take damage equal to
Decider's attack points!

00:09:29.426 --> 00:09:32.026
(screaming)

00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:34.060
That was just a preview!

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.793
Grace, that's enough,
let's move it, like now!

00:09:36.793 --> 00:09:38.693
In a minute, okazies?

00:09:38.693 --> 00:09:41.960
I equip Dystopia
with Delay Armor!

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.693
Now attack Odd‐Eyes!

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.126
By destroying your Odd‐Eyes,
Delay Armor energizes

00:09:58.126 --> 00:10:00.900
its blasters and destroys
your Dag Daggerman!

00:10:03.533 --> 00:10:06.933
Plus, you'll get blasted
with 500 points of damage!

00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:14.066
Congratulations.

00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:17.100
You've dueltained yourself
down to 600 life points.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.166
This proves that all this
dueltaining is nothing

00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:22.866
but a joke‐‐
just like your father.

00:10:22.866 --> 00:10:24.933
Galaxy‐Eyes...

00:10:24.933 --> 00:10:28.433
Attack with Cipher Stream
of Destruction!

00:10:36.266 --> 00:10:37.933
Yuya!

00:10:37.933 --> 00:10:39.833
You see that?

00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:42.933
Kite rocked and rolled
those Fusion freaks!

00:10:42.933 --> 00:10:45.433
We'll make sure
Shay gets the help he needs!

00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:47.900
And I suggest you make sure
you don't lose.

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:49.900
You good?

00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:59.833
A legion of our best duelists
took on one lousy louse,

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:02.473
and that louse
laid them all out?

00:11:02.473 --> 00:11:04.340
What a bunch o' wimps!

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.473
But as their superior officer,
the buck stops with you, Noro!

00:11:08.473 --> 00:11:09.573
You'll get the blame.

00:11:09.573 --> 00:11:11.906
You can't pin this fiasco on me!

00:11:11.906 --> 00:11:14.040
Commander Phoenix led our troops
into this mess,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.240
so the buck stops with him!

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.840
(laughing)

00:11:19.806 --> 00:11:21.740
I threw him
under the bus again...

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.440
Uh great, another thing
he'll be mad at me about!

00:11:26.106 --> 00:11:27.840
Sweet!

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.840
Now that the riffraff have,
like, hit the road,

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.040
I can get back to
enjoying the show

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.840
without any rude interruptions!

00:11:34.873 --> 00:11:37.106
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:11:40.273 --> 00:11:42.206
Here I go!

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.140
And now on with the show...

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.540
Since I'm lucky to have already
built the Pendulum Scale,

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.406
I can Summon...
my monsters again!

00:11:57.906 --> 00:12:01.280
Welcome back, Performapal
Dag Daggerman!

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.680
Nice to see ya,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.746
(growling)

00:12:08.013 --> 00:12:10.980
He brought his monsters back,
but they're too weak

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.813
to defeat Aster's Dystopia.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.813
You know Yuya
has a trick up his sleeve.

00:12:16.813 --> 00:12:19.246
And it's gonna be
abracadabralicious!

00:12:19.246 --> 00:12:20.813
(chuckling)

00:12:20.813 --> 00:12:23.713
You brought back
those two losers again?

00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:25.513
If that's your idea
of dueltaining,

00:12:25.513 --> 00:12:28.180
consider myself entertained!

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.346
Because I get to destroy them
all over again!

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.713
That's not how
you're supposed to have fun!

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:36.246
How do I get through
to this guy?

00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:38.980
You're still
on that kick, Yuya?

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.846
He's not just from Duel Academy.

00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:43.113
He's the leader
of their entire army.

00:12:43.113 --> 00:12:46.180
Don't you realize that nothing
will ever change his mind.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.913
Maybe Yuto's right.

00:12:47.913 --> 00:12:50.280
Maybe it is hopeless....

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.446
Or maybe not!

00:12:51.446 --> 00:12:55.580
Because I got an idea!

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.713
I'm about to turn this duel
upside down!

00:12:58.713 --> 00:13:01.920
Handstandacoon's Pendulum
ability activates!

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.686
Letting me bring it back
to my hand!

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:08.653
Why would you break
your own Pendulum Scale!

00:13:08.653 --> 00:13:11.053
Simple, Dag Daggerman's
special ability

00:13:11.053 --> 00:13:13.486
lets me send Handstandacoon
to the graveyard

00:13:13.486 --> 00:13:15.453
to draw a card from my deck!

00:13:15.453 --> 00:13:17.720
And I'm hoping it's a good one!

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.986
Awesome!

00:13:20.986 --> 00:13:23.320
I use Performapal
Trump Witch

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.753
to rebuild my Pendulum Scale!

00:13:25.753 --> 00:13:28.786
It may look like
I took the long way home,

00:13:28.786 --> 00:13:30.686
but I'm glad I went to
all that trouble,

00:13:30.686 --> 00:13:32.453
because she lets me
Fusion Summon

00:13:32.453 --> 00:13:34.453
without using Polymerization.

00:13:34.453 --> 00:13:36.886
I fuse Performapal Dag Daggerman

00:13:36.886 --> 00:13:39.186
with my Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:40.486
What!

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.153
You know how to Fusion Summon?

00:13:42.153 --> 00:13:43.720
Aww, come on, Aster.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.286
If that's gonna leave you
in shock,

00:13:45.286 --> 00:13:47.920
you'll pass out
before I get to my best stuff!

00:13:51.553 --> 00:13:53.653
I Fusion Summon!

00:13:53.653 --> 00:13:56.086
A dragon so hot
that it burns away

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:59.460
all your monster's attack points
before it even hits the field!

00:14:04.226 --> 00:14:05.260
Oh, no, you can't!

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.793
Can too!

00:14:06.793 --> 00:14:09.426
Right, Brave‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon?

00:14:15.326 --> 00:14:17.060
Huh!
Brave‐Eyes!

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.160
(growling)
Sweet!

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.726
(Yuto)
He never learned
that someone

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:23.760
from another dimension
can Fusion summon.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.393
So maybe
he'll question everything

00:14:26.393 --> 00:14:29.226
he's learned from Duel Academy.

00:14:29.226 --> 00:14:31.826
A Fusion Summon...

00:14:31.826 --> 00:14:34.960
And I have to admit,
it's a pretty good one!

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.493
But the good becomes great since
it gains 100 attack points

00:14:38.493 --> 00:14:42.060
for each monster that just had
its attack points drained away!

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.726
Yes!

00:14:43.726 --> 00:14:46.126
With one attack
Aster will be dragon fodder!

00:14:46.126 --> 00:14:49.293
It's all going to plan.
Woohoo!
Really?

00:14:49.293 --> 00:14:52.193
I wonder how the Professor
will react after he learns

00:14:52.193 --> 00:14:54.693
that he's got a fan of the enemy
on his team.

00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:57.660
No no no,
I said "boohoo" not "woohoo!"

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.800
Let's just... forget I
said anything.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.033
Brave‐Eyes!
Attack!

00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:06.233
Take out Destiny Hero
‐ Dystopia!

00:15:06.233 --> 00:15:08.600
Searing Flame Strike!

00:15:12.233 --> 00:15:13.866
Whatever.

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:16.300
Since my Fusion Monster is
equipped with Delay Armor,

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.666
your Fusion Monster
can't harm it.

00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:20.666
Your pathetic Fusion Summon
didn't work.

00:15:20.666 --> 00:15:22.966
It will when it uses
its third ability!

00:15:22.966 --> 00:15:24.833
Third?

00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:29.333
Even with your Armor,
Brave‐Eyes still can destroy it!

00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:31.266
You think you're so smart...

00:15:31.266 --> 00:15:33.133
Well, you've got
much to learn!

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:36.333
I activate Urban Demise,
which gives my Dystopia

00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:38.833
an extra 100 attack points!

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:42.266
A hundred attack points might
not seem like much,

00:15:42.266 --> 00:15:44.166
but it's more than enough!

00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:46.833
Because when Dystopia's
attack points change,

00:15:46.833 --> 00:15:48.666
its special ability activates

00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:51.666
and automatically destroys
your monster‐‐

00:15:51.666 --> 00:15:55.566
and any chance
of you winning this duel!

00:16:01.706 --> 00:16:04.140
Yuya, you may be able
to Fusion Summon,

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.773
but you don't know
the ins and outs like me!

00:16:06.773 --> 00:16:11.506
And because of that
your Dragon's going to pay
the price for your foolishness.

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:16.173
Brave‐Eyes!

00:16:16.173 --> 00:16:20.340
Yuya, I'm afraid that Dragon
was the last that hope you had.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.173
Huh?

00:16:21.173 --> 00:16:23.140
Did Aster drop a card?

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.373
Hey, that's Smile World!

00:16:26.873 --> 00:16:29.473
Aster, is that my dad's card?

00:16:29.473 --> 00:16:32.006
And if it is,
how did you get a hold of it?

00:16:34.173 --> 00:16:36.473
It's still your turn, Yuya,
so get on with it!

00:16:36.473 --> 00:16:38.040
Aster!

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.006
What are you doing
with my dad's card?

00:16:41.973 --> 00:16:43.373
I'll tell you...

00:16:43.373 --> 00:16:45.340
I...

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.540
dueled him right when
I got to this dimension...

00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:54.040
Yusho Sakaki,
I've heard a lot about you.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.640
You're the one who's been
spouting nonsense

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.240
about dueling
to make people happy?

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.946
Well, you're half‐correct.

00:16:59.946 --> 00:17:00.646
Half?

00:17:02.113 --> 00:17:05.546
I do want to spread joy
to others with my dueling,

00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:07.980
but I never said it was
nonsense, dear boy.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.080
That's enough!

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.613
As an enemy of Duel Academy,
I'll turn you into a card.

00:17:13.613 --> 00:17:17.780
Prepare for battle!

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.146
I swore then that I would crush
and humiliate your father

00:17:21.146 --> 00:17:24.213
to prove that Duel Academy
ruled the battlefield!

00:17:25.413 --> 00:17:27.813
Now Dystopia,
unleash your fury!

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:28.913
Attack!

00:17:28.913 --> 00:17:29.780
(growling)

00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:37.180
It seems that I've
broken you already.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.813
Now then, I believe
it's my turn.

00:17:41.813 --> 00:17:43.680
I activate...

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.480
the spell card Smile World!

00:17:51.346 --> 00:17:54.913
That was the turning point
of the duel...

00:17:54.913 --> 00:17:57.480
Things went from
good to horrible in a flash.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.686
I lost...
But how is that possible?

00:18:03.686 --> 00:18:05.620
Cheer up, lad.
Huh?

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.753
At least you had fun.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.453
Fun?

00:18:09.453 --> 00:18:12.086
I lost!
What's fun about that?

00:18:12.086 --> 00:18:15.120
I failed Duel Academy.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.720
Come on, failure's such
a harsh word.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.486
But if you're feelin' down,
the only way to go is up!

00:18:21.486 --> 00:18:24.053
So forget all your conquering
Duel Academy nonsense

00:18:24.053 --> 00:18:26.220
and duel with a smile!

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.986
Hold up...

00:18:27.986 --> 00:18:31.786
Are you seriously expecting me
to turn my back on Duel Academy?

00:18:31.786 --> 00:18:33.420
I am.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.120
Never!

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.453
You're trying to trick me!

00:18:56.453 --> 00:18:58.520
I won't be fooled!

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.186
Dueling isn't for fun!

00:19:00.186 --> 00:19:02.360
You're trying to trick me
into betraying Duel Academy

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.626
and the Professor,
but it won't work!

00:19:04.626 --> 00:19:07.060
(screaming)

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.360
Aster... please trust me.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.593
Where is he?!

00:19:18.593 --> 00:19:21.293
I haven't seen your father
since, Yuya.

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:24.960
For a sec, I thought maybe he
got sent to another dimension.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.926
It happens a lot around here.

00:19:26.926 --> 00:19:30.093
But then I remembered,
your dad's a trickster.

00:19:30.093 --> 00:19:32.393
He was trying to trick me again.

00:19:32.393 --> 00:19:36.060
He knows that I'll turn him
into a card if I ever find him.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.893
He couldn't have gone far.

00:19:37.893 --> 00:19:41.093
I knew he was somewhere
in this city, hiding from me.

00:19:41.093 --> 00:19:43.226
So I searched high and low

00:19:43.226 --> 00:19:46.193
until one day,
lo and behold,

00:19:46.193 --> 00:19:48.193
I find his son.

00:19:48.193 --> 00:19:52.593
The one clue to finding Yusho
Sakaki falls right into my lap.

00:19:52.593 --> 00:19:53.726
A coincidence?

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:54.826
No.

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:55.560
Destiny!

00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:58.833
Our last duel
may have ended in a draw...

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.733
But you're not going to
walk away from this duel, Yuya.

00:20:05.733 --> 00:20:06.300
I promise!

00:20:08.133 --> 00:20:09.566
Do you see Yuya?

00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:12.200
See how deep his anger runs?

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.600
There's nothing you can do
to change his ways.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.533
I'm going to place one card
facedown, ending my turn!

00:20:19.533 --> 00:20:22.600
That means the effects
from Brave‐Eyes' special ability

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.200
will now wear off.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.800
So Dystopia's attack points
return to normal.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.766
My turn, then.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.800
Your father may have eluded me,
but you won't!

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.300
With everything I learned from
Duel Academy, I will end you!

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.100
And once I beat you,
your father's next!

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.100
Commander Phoenix has that twerp
right where he wants him.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.200
It's all over.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.033
You sure?

00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:53.000
This is Yuya
we're talking about!

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.600
(Yuto)
What's so funny?

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.200
Well...

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.773
Aster kept half
of my dad's card.

00:21:01.773 --> 00:21:03.773
That means he's always
thinking of him...

00:21:03.773 --> 00:21:06.206
And I don't think
it's just for revenge.

00:21:06.206 --> 00:21:08.873
I think my dad
got through to him.

00:21:08.873 --> 00:21:13.073
Now, Dystopia, wipe that grin
away once and for all!

00:21:13.073 --> 00:21:16.573
Finish Yuya off!

00:21:16.573 --> 00:21:19.973
Yusho thought he could trick me
into changing my mind,

00:21:19.973 --> 00:21:22.240
but that will never happen!

00:21:26.006 --> 00:21:29.706
Now, Dystopia, end this duel!

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.240
Smile, Yuya!
