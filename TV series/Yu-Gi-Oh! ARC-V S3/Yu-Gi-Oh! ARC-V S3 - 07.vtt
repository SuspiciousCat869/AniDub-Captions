WEBVTT

00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.600
Good, good,
now try again.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.433
Now, it's my turn!

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:04.966
Keep practicing!

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.633
It's good to see you, Zuzu.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:11.933
I just wish it was under
better circumstances.

00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.433
Huh? What are you doing here

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:17.100
in the Fusion Dimension,
Mr. Sakaki?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.033
Well, it's a long tale
that you need to hear,

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:23.100
and one that I wish
I never had to tell.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.133
And it all starts...
with Declan Akaba.

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:30.706
(Yusho)
Three years ago,
Declan ventured

00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:32.773
across dimensions
to find his dad...

00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:34.773
You're going to invade
other worlds?

00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:38.040
Like a conqueror?
Why would you do that?

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.606
I'm planning to create
one supreme world.

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:44.706
(chiming)
Wait‐‐ Father‐‐ no!

00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:50.273
Father,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.673
I promise...

00:01:55.473 --> 00:01:57.540
I'll stop you!

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.473
And when Declan sets
his mind on something,

00:02:00.473 --> 00:02:02.113
he always
follows through.

00:02:02.113 --> 00:02:05.880
Even if that meant hacking
into his dad's files.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.646
I can't believe it.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.646
It's true.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.780
My father is really
trying to combine

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.679
the four dimensions
into one...

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.246
by invading and conquering
each dimension.

00:02:19.246 --> 00:02:21.113
I have to stop him.

00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:23.846
And I will...

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:26.180
By utilizing
the full resources

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.446
of Leo Corporation.

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:32.113
I will raise
an elite force,

00:02:32.113 --> 00:02:34.480
and Yusho,
you will lead my Lancers

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.280
to defeat him
into submission!

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.713
It's our only hope of saving
the universe from my father!

00:02:40.846 --> 00:02:42.580
(Yusho)
Poor Declan.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.446
His heart was filled
with such anger,

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:46.946
abandonment,
betrayal.

00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:49.613
But sometimes a child
doesn't know his dad

00:02:49.613 --> 00:02:51.480
as well as
his friend does.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.180
After spending
many long years

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.913
building the ARC
system together,

00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:57.646
I thought I knew his dad
better than he did.

00:02:57.646 --> 00:02:59.780
So, I believed
there was another option.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.086
A better option
than attacking Leo.

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:03.953
The Leo I knew would
listen to reason.

00:03:03.953 --> 00:03:06.520
So, if I could just
talk to him directly,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.286
I could convince Leo
to stop the invasions.

00:03:09.286 --> 00:03:11.820
I know I taught you
that lying is wrong, Zuzu,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.120
but I said that
I would team up with him.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.886
That allowed me
to gain access

00:03:15.886 --> 00:03:18.720
to Leo Corporation's
transporter.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.220
Without a moment
to waste,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.653
I used it to teleport
across dimensions,

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:26.953
having to leave my dimension,
having to leave Yuya behind.

00:03:28.953 --> 00:03:30.753
Then that was
the day...

00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:34.286
Yes, the day I was supposed
to defend my title

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:35.853
against the Sledgehammer.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.453
My dad's no chicken!
Let me duel the Sledgehammer

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.053
till my dad shows up!
Yuya!

00:03:42.053 --> 00:03:43.686
Calm down, son!

00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:45.353
(thinking)
<i>Poor Yuya.</i>

00:03:45.353 --> 00:03:48.020
<i>All those years, everyone</i>
<i>teasing him...</i>

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.986
<i>He never knew...</i>
<i>he still doesn't know...</i>

00:03:50.986 --> 00:03:52.553
<i>why his dad disappeared.</i>

00:03:52.553 --> 00:03:54.586
But maybe I should've
studied up more

00:03:54.586 --> 00:03:56.853
on teleporter technology,

00:03:56.853 --> 00:03:59.953
because instead
of teleporting to Duel Academy,

00:03:59.953 --> 00:04:03.393
I ended up in an entirely
different dimension,

00:04:03.393 --> 00:04:05.693
the XYZ Dimension.

00:04:05.693 --> 00:04:08.393
You know‐‐ for teleporting
to the wrong place,

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:11.260
it was actually
quite nice.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.660
Until Duel Academy invaded.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.526
(thunderous booms)

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.093
Mr. Sakaki,
it's time for your treatment.

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:22.526
Okay?
Already?

00:04:30.093 --> 00:04:32.760
Alexis, do you know
why's he limping?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.126
He was injured in a duel
with Duel Academy.

00:04:35.126 --> 00:04:36.759
Why are they doing this?

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.893
Why is Duel Academy
invading all these places

00:04:38.893 --> 00:04:40.526
and hurting people?

00:04:40.526 --> 00:04:43.393
This is gonna sound crazy,
because it is crazy.

00:04:43.393 --> 00:04:45.426
They're convinced
the only way to bring peace

00:04:45.426 --> 00:04:48.126
to the universe
is by making war.

00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:50.326
The Professor's
super‐special

00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:52.693
ARC Area Project is
really out there.

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:55.460
I can't believe people
are okay with this!

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.426
The Professor said
we'd be uniting

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:00.460
the four dimensions
into one.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.600
It sounded great,
like we'd be peacekeepers.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.500
In reality, the Professor
wanted to conquer

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.733
the other dimensions
to rule over them.

00:05:09.733 --> 00:05:12.433
And Duel Academy's
greatest duelist,

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:15.566
Aster Phoenix,
led the invasion force.

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:18.200
To tell you the truth,
when they didn't pick me

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.100
to go on the first mission,
I was bummed out.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.466
But I was the lucky one.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.933
So, how many of them
did you get?

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:33.300
It was 25, easy!

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.733
I rounded up 30...
I win!

00:05:35.733 --> 00:05:37.900
The coolest part was
when they tried to run,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.566
and we had
to hunt them down!

00:05:39.566 --> 00:05:41.066
I hope we don't
have to wait long

00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:43.433
for our next raid!

00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:46.700
C'mon, cheer up.
What's the matter?

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.066
You should be out there
celebrating like everyone else

00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:50.566
who went on the mission.

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:52.400
I can't celebrate.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.666
Not after what I saw
and not after what we did.

00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:58.166
(laughing)

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:01.573
What happened there?

00:06:01.573 --> 00:06:04.540
Every single person
was turned into cards!

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.340
Hold on,
we don't do that.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.206
You must have been
seeing things.

00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:11.540
Maybe the stress
got to you.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.340
I know what I saw!
Huh?

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.206
When our platoon arrived
in the XYZ Dimension,

00:06:17.206 --> 00:06:20.306
we were ordered to turn
everybody into cards.

00:06:20.306 --> 00:06:22.840
Even the civilians!

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.340
Civilians?

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.106
Yes!

00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:28.606
They attacked
everyone, Alexis!

00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:32.140
No one was spared,
not even children!

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.373
We weren't sent there
to bring peace.

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:37.906
Our mission was
to take everyone down!

00:06:37.906 --> 00:06:40.373
(boys cackling)

00:06:40.373 --> 00:06:43.406
What did they
make me do, Alexis?

00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:45.373
What did they make me do?

00:06:45.373 --> 00:06:48.206
I can't stay here anymore!

00:06:48.206 --> 00:06:51.206
We have to escape together!

00:06:51.206 --> 00:06:53.606
Leave Duel Academy?

00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:55.340
We have to!

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.406
Or we'll be forced
to attack innocent people!

00:07:02.013 --> 00:07:05.280
(Alexis)
That night, my friend and I
left Duel Academy.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.946
I was still
in a state of shock.

00:07:07.946 --> 00:07:09.580
It's not easy
when everything

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.246
you thought you believed in
turns out to be a lie.

00:07:12.246 --> 00:07:14.280
In my heart,
I knew everything

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.480
my friend had told me
was true.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.180
We had to get as far away
from the Professor

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.280
and Duel Academy
as possible!

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.713
And we thought we did.

00:07:22.713 --> 00:07:25.080
(custodian)
Where do you think
you're going?

00:07:30.446 --> 00:07:33.013
Hope you two runaways
had a nice joy ride

00:07:33.013 --> 00:07:35.880
because your next trip isn't
going to be so pleasant.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.346
I'll hold them off!
Alexis, run!

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.513
(Alexis)
He turned her into a card,
just like that.

00:07:46.513 --> 00:07:49.180
I thought I was next.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.280
But I couldn't have
been more wrong.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.913
I was saved.
Yusho stopped them!

00:08:08.586 --> 00:08:12.020
Yusho sure knows how to make
an entrance, doesn't he?

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:15.486
I guess you could
put it that way.

00:08:15.486 --> 00:08:17.520
He passed out
right in front of me.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.686
Hold on, you mean
he was already hurt?

00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:22.953
Yeah, he hid it well,

00:08:22.953 --> 00:08:24.386
but he was
in pretty bad shape.

00:08:24.386 --> 00:08:27.186
It took everything I had
to bring him back here.

00:08:27.186 --> 00:08:29.953
We did our best
to help him but...

00:08:29.953 --> 00:08:32.286
Yusho's still not 100%.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.320
You see all of them
over there?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.920
They all used to attend
the Academy, too.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.620
But like me,
they couldn't stand

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.253
what the Professor's doing.

00:08:42.253 --> 00:08:44.653
It took guts
to leave that school.

00:08:44.653 --> 00:08:48.253
That's why Mr. Sakaki and I
started the Yusho Duel School.

00:08:48.253 --> 00:08:50.353
To not only
give 'em a safe haven,

00:08:50.353 --> 00:08:53.286
but also to remind them
that dueling is always‐‐

00:08:53.286 --> 00:08:55.220
and always will be‐‐
for fun.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.853
To make people smile.

00:08:58.553 --> 00:09:01.193
If we can get enough students
to see things our way,

00:09:01.193 --> 00:09:04.526
we can stop Duel Academy
in its tracks!

00:09:04.526 --> 00:09:06.193
That's awesome!

00:09:06.193 --> 00:09:08.860
You can count me in
110%, Alexis!

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.593
Nothing's going
to stop us!

00:09:10.593 --> 00:09:13.060
We got trouble!
What happened?

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.993
We were helping
this girl out

00:09:14.993 --> 00:09:16.626
when all of a sudden
we got ambushed.

00:09:16.626 --> 00:09:18.193
We were the only ones
who made it out!

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.193
(cackling)

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:23.426
Your friend will make
a nice bookmark.

00:09:25.226 --> 00:09:28.226
Because I'm writing
the final chapter for you all!

00:09:32.793 --> 00:09:36.693
Now then, are you all
ready to have some fun?

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.726
The Professor has
asked me to come here

00:09:40.726 --> 00:09:42.526
to eradicate
the opposition.

00:09:42.526 --> 00:09:46.660
As you can see,
I'm very good at my job!

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.826
(all gasping)

00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:50.093
But since
my time is precious,

00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:52.193
I'll take on
all five of you

00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:54.160
simultaneously!

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.760
Now, now,
don't thank me all at once.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.993
Let's duel!

00:09:58.993 --> 00:10:00.533
I'll begin
by summoning

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:02.366
Predaplant
Squid Drosera!

00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:06.200
(growling)

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.966
Next, I activate
the spell Predator Planter

00:10:08.966 --> 00:10:10.933
to grow another
Predaplant!

00:10:10.933 --> 00:10:12.933
Take root,
Moray Nepenthes!

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:20.000
I hope you five can summon
some delicious monsters

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.733
for my flowers
to munch on!

00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:23.633
They're famished!

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:25.133
Oh really!?

00:10:25.133 --> 00:10:27.100
I'm gonna wack
those weeds of yours

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.333
with the help
of Polymerization!

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:33.633
I fuse Drillroid, Steamroid,
and Submarineroid!

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.966
I Fusion Summon!

00:10:35.966 --> 00:10:39.366
Super Vehicroid
Jumbo Drill!

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:41.966
Oh, my goodness!

00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:44.300
Such a powerful
Fusion Monster!

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.933
I guess it's true
what they say.

00:10:46.933 --> 00:10:48.933
You can take the student
out of the Academy,

00:10:48.933 --> 00:10:51.633
but you can't take the Academy
out of the student!

00:10:51.633 --> 00:10:54.800
Now listen, I'm sure
if you decide to come back

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.466
of your own free will,

00:10:56.466 --> 00:10:59.166
the Professor will find it
in his heart to forgive you.

00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:02.306
Not a chance, the Professor
uses dueling as a tool

00:11:02.306 --> 00:11:04.106
to scare and destroy
when it should only be used

00:11:04.106 --> 00:11:05.440
to entertain!

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.306
Once we got free
of Duel Academy,

00:11:07.306 --> 00:11:10.006
we learned that our dueling
can be a positive force!

00:11:10.006 --> 00:11:12.240
Uh, what is that
supposed to mean?

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.940
Someone like you will
never understand.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.240
We want to make
everyone smile!

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.740
Make everyone smile?

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.140
(cackling)

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.940
You know
as well as I do,

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.273
there are only winners
and losers in duels,

00:11:24.273 --> 00:11:26.140
and you have
nothing to smile about

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.206
when you're a loser...
(cackling)

00:11:28.206 --> 00:11:31.273
(girl)
That's not true!

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.473
You're wrong, it's not
about winning or losing,

00:11:33.473 --> 00:11:35.706
it's about
how to play the game
and entertain!

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:37.673
Just watch and see!

00:11:37.673 --> 00:11:39.073
It's my turn!

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:41.306
And I'm also activating
Polymerization

00:11:41.306 --> 00:11:44.306
and using it to fuse
Big Koala and Des Kangaroo!

00:11:45.773 --> 00:11:47.840
I Fusion Summon!

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.873
The thunder from down under,

00:11:49.873 --> 00:11:52.006
Master of Oz!

00:11:52.006 --> 00:11:54.206
This king of the ring's
got a one‐two punch

00:11:54.206 --> 00:11:55.640
that'll knock you
all the way back

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.806
to Duel Academy
empty‐handed!

00:11:57.806 --> 00:11:59.806
Empty‐handed?
How so?

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:02.380
I'm going home
with five cards...

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.113
with your faces on them!

00:12:08.713 --> 00:12:11.180
(boy)
You talk a big game,
but me and my pals are

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.213
gonna mow down you
and your pathetic posies.

00:12:14.213 --> 00:12:17.580
It's time to do
some landscapin'!

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.746
And I think
I'll cut to the chase

00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:22.013
by playing Polymerization!

00:12:22.013 --> 00:12:23.946
I'll give you
the royal treatment

00:12:23.946 --> 00:12:27.280
by fusing my three
Ojama brothers!

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.546
I Fusion Summon!

00:12:29.546 --> 00:12:31.713
Make way for the king
of the kini,

00:12:31.713 --> 00:12:33.246
Ojama King!

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.980
(cackling)

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.746
Your King needs a little sun
and a lotta towel!

00:12:41.746 --> 00:12:43.146
You might be laughing now,

00:12:43.146 --> 00:12:46.346
but once Ojama King uses
his special ability

00:12:46.346 --> 00:12:48.980
to have his flunkies occupy
three spots on your field,

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.113
your laughs
might turn to cries.

00:12:51.113 --> 00:12:53.146
(growling laughter)

00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:56.613
Well, these three lookers might
make those tears a reality.

00:12:56.613 --> 00:12:58.413
My turn?
Yeah!

00:12:58.413 --> 00:13:00.413
I draw!

00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:03.720
V‐Tiger Jet,
it's time to pounce and play!

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.786
(roaring)

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:09.786
And then I'll activate
the spell Frontline Base

00:13:09.786 --> 00:13:12.186
so I can summon
W‐Wing Catapult!

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.786
So, you're not planning
on using Polymerization

00:13:19.786 --> 00:13:21.786
like those other dweebs?

00:13:21.786 --> 00:13:24.053
Looks like you don't
know everything, smart guy!

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:27.420
By banishing V‐Tiger Jet
and W‐Wing Catapult,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.186
I can fuse them together
without using Polymerization.

00:13:34.653 --> 00:13:37.586
Hmm, an unexpected
turn of events.

00:13:37.586 --> 00:13:39.120
I do appreciate you

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.320
keeping things
fresh and lively.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.853
Then it's a good thing
that me and my pals...

00:13:43.853 --> 00:13:45.820
are chock full
of surprises.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.286
For now,
I place one card facedown

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.220
and end my turn.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.820
I'm up next!

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.086
And I'm summoning
X‐Head Cannon!

00:13:54.086 --> 00:13:55.886
Then I'll activate

00:13:55.886 --> 00:13:58.886
Frontline Base
like my little bro did...

00:13:58.886 --> 00:14:02.360
so I can summon
Y‐Dragon Head!

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.626
(roaring)

00:14:05.626 --> 00:14:07.026
I activate Foolish Burial

00:14:07.026 --> 00:14:09.926
to send Z‐Metal Tank
to the graveyard!

00:14:12.726 --> 00:14:14.193
And I'll top
those moves off

00:14:14.193 --> 00:14:16.726
by activating the spell
Iron Call!

00:14:16.726 --> 00:14:19.426
It lets me roll out
Z‐Metal Tank from my graveyard

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:21.226
onto my field!

00:14:22.826 --> 00:14:24.893
With X, Y, and Z
out and about,

00:14:24.893 --> 00:14:27.993
my next move is
as simple as A‐B‐C!

00:14:27.993 --> 00:14:32.626
I combine them to form
XYZ‐Dragon Cannon!

00:14:41.993 --> 00:14:44.060
Oh, what a medley
of metal!

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.160
It seems you've saved
the best for last.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.926
Taking you down is
gonna be a team effort!

00:14:49.926 --> 00:14:51.693
So I'll open the way

00:14:51.693 --> 00:14:54.826
using XYZ‐Dragon Cannon's
special ability!

00:14:54.826 --> 00:14:56.893
By discarding one card
from my hand,

00:14:56.893 --> 00:14:59.860
my Cannon prunes
your Moray Nepenthes!

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.933
Going aggressive
on your first turn!

00:15:01.933 --> 00:15:03.466
If I didn't
know any better,

00:15:03.466 --> 00:15:05.266
I'd say you've got
a little Duel Academy

00:15:05.266 --> 00:15:06.800
left in you after all!
No way!

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.733
We're not like you!

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:10.866
The You Show Duel School
taught us that dueling

00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:12.866
is all about dreams,
not screams!

00:15:15.033 --> 00:15:18.066
I'm activating
the trap card Fellow's Gift!

00:15:18.066 --> 00:15:21.366
That way I can give control
of VW‐Tiger Catapult

00:15:21.366 --> 00:15:23.333
to my brother!

00:15:23.333 --> 00:15:25.066
Way to go, bro!

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:29.500
I banish VW‐Tiger Catapult
and XYZ‐Dragon Cannon

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.400
so I can Fusion Summon

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.066
V‐to‐Z‐Dragon
Catapult Cannon!

00:15:47.066 --> 00:15:48.833
Ugh, impressive!

00:15:48.833 --> 00:15:51.066
If I liked building
model robots.

00:15:51.066 --> 00:15:54.000
Well, this robot isn't
about to toy around!

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.466
Catapult Cannon,
blast that Squid Drosera

00:15:56.466 --> 00:15:58.066
back to the greenhouse!

00:16:02.406 --> 00:16:04.773
So much for
your flower power.

00:16:04.773 --> 00:16:08.073
Me and my bro whittled away
all your pesky petunias!

00:16:08.073 --> 00:16:10.406
But they'll be
sprouting back in no time

00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:12.140
thanks to Squid Drosera!

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.173
When it leaves the field,
its special ability unleashes

00:16:15.173 --> 00:16:19.140
Predator Counters, which latch
onto each of your monsters!

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.540
Yeah?
So what?

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.073
Oh, you'll see.

00:16:22.073 --> 00:16:23.940
So, hurry up
and end your turn.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.806
Because I have so many surprises
to share with you!

00:16:27.806 --> 00:16:30.106
Then go‐‐
we're not scared of you!

00:16:30.106 --> 00:16:31.373
But you will be.

00:16:31.373 --> 00:16:33.573
That's a promise!

00:16:33.573 --> 00:16:36.540
As my first step,
by giving up 800 life points,

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.373
I can activate my spell card

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:39.906
Predator Planter.

00:16:39.906 --> 00:16:41.673
Now I can bring back

00:16:41.673 --> 00:16:43.706
my Moray Nepenthes
from the graveyard!

00:16:48.673 --> 00:16:52.640
And joining it will be
my Predaplant Fly Trap!

00:16:55.773 --> 00:16:58.506
So, you think you all know
Fusion Monsters?

00:16:58.506 --> 00:17:00.113
You don't know a thing!

00:17:00.113 --> 00:17:02.946
Now watch and learn
from a true master!

00:17:02.946 --> 00:17:04.680
Pay attention!

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.546
With the power
of Polymerization,

00:17:06.546 --> 00:17:08.980
I fuse Nepenthes
and Fly Trap

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.680
in order to bring out the most
toxic monster ever seen!

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.346
You'll never look
at greenery

00:17:15.346 --> 00:17:17.246
the same way again!

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:19.680
I Fusion Summon!

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.546
The vicious, voracious,
and venomous...

00:17:22.546 --> 00:17:26.180
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.046
(roaring)

00:17:30.413 --> 00:17:32.080
Scary, huh?

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.713
Well, trust when I say

00:17:33.713 --> 00:17:35.746
it's going to get
a lot worse!

00:17:42.913 --> 00:17:43.713
(roaring)

00:17:43.713 --> 00:17:46.713
Scary, huh?
Well, trust when I say

00:17:46.713 --> 00:17:48.813
it's going to get
a lot worse!

00:17:48.813 --> 00:17:51.880
You see, it preys
on all your monsters,

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.346
feasting on their
attack points

00:17:54.346 --> 00:17:56.280
to increase its own!

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.846
What's that?
If it gains
that much power‐‐

00:17:58.846 --> 00:18:00.686
There's no way of
stopping that thing!

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.886
13,000 attack points?

00:18:08.886 --> 00:18:10.886
That's the strongest dragon
I've ever seen!

00:18:10.886 --> 00:18:13.120
Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon can use

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.620
one of your monster's
special abilities.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.153
And I'm choosing
your thrilling drilling

00:18:18.153 --> 00:18:19.786
Jumbo Drill!

00:18:19.786 --> 00:18:22.086
Uh, no way, I never
heard of such a thing!

00:18:22.086 --> 00:18:25.620
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon
can now deal you damage

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.720
even if your monster is
in defense mode!

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.786
I'll start with
the most vulnerable‐‐

00:18:31.786 --> 00:18:33.686
you, the one
with no monsters!

00:18:33.686 --> 00:18:35.653
Starving Venom Dragon,

00:18:35.653 --> 00:18:37.686
strike down
that traitorous slime!

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.520
Aah!

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.620
Next, by sending
Squid Drosera

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.153
from my hand
to the graveyard...

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.786
my Dragon must attack

00:18:49.786 --> 00:18:52.453
every monster that has
a Predator Counter.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.420
But believe me,
it needs no coaxing!

00:18:58.086 --> 00:19:00.060
It's feeding time.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.893
(roaring)

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.560
Aah!

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.626
Next, KO that featherweight.

00:19:14.693 --> 00:19:17.260
Aah!

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.193
Dethrone the pale one.

00:19:19.193 --> 00:19:21.326
Awooo‐ah‐ah‐ah‐ah!

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:24.060
Aah!

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.726
And last but not least,

00:19:25.726 --> 00:19:27.826
lay waste
to that Catapult Cannon.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.326
Aah!

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:42.160
And to the victor...

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.626
go the spoils.

00:19:44.626 --> 00:19:47.293
Fantastic,
I collected the whole set.

00:19:47.293 --> 00:19:48.626
(chuckling)

00:19:56.093 --> 00:19:58.260
Hmm‐‐ Zuzu?

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.300
This is my lucky day.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.700
You know him?
I do!

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.366
That guy's been chasing me
from dimension to dimension.

00:20:05.366 --> 00:20:07.633
What's your problem, creep?

00:20:07.633 --> 00:20:10.466
This "creep" does
have a name, you know.

00:20:10.466 --> 00:20:12.800
It's Yuri,
and I would suggest

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.000
you call me that rather
than using insults, Zuzu.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.500
(cackling)

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.133
Good to see you,
but you know who will be

00:20:20.133 --> 00:20:21.333
more thrilled
to say hi?

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:23.733
The Professor.

00:20:23.733 --> 00:20:26.566
One way or another,
you're coming with me!

00:20:26.566 --> 00:20:28.566
Not on my watch!

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.966
Where did he go?

00:20:35.966 --> 00:20:38.600
No! He vanished again!

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.500
Huh?

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.933
Yugo!

00:20:41.933 --> 00:20:43.133
What are you
doing here?

00:20:43.133 --> 00:20:45.333
No way!
Zuzu!

00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:46.366
It can't be!

00:20:46.366 --> 00:20:48.033
But it is!

00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:51.033
Zuzu!
You're alive!

00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:52.566
Oh, bring it in!

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.733
Sorry, I got
carried away there.

00:20:57.733 --> 00:20:59.666
I just haven't seen you
for the longest time.

00:20:59.666 --> 00:21:02.440
Well, it sure
wasn't long enough!

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.140
Interesting friends
you have there.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.440
Zuzu, check this out.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.073
You might not know this,

00:21:08.073 --> 00:21:09.773
but this is
the Fusion Dimension.

00:21:09.773 --> 00:21:11.540
Meaning Rin Rin is here.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.440
And not just her.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.240
Celina, too,
and I bet even Lulu.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.306
You're sure?

00:21:17.306 --> 00:21:20.973
Yeah, we have to rescue them
before something bad happens.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.573
I've received
a report from Noro

00:21:26.573 --> 00:21:29.040
that the Lancers are
in the XYZ Dimension

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.473
causing a nuisance.

00:21:30.473 --> 00:21:32.573
Just enough
to set my Arc Area Project

00:21:32.573 --> 00:21:34.273
behind schedule.

00:21:34.273 --> 00:21:37.106
I want you
to take care of them.

00:21:37.106 --> 00:21:38.473
Is that understood?

00:21:38.473 --> 00:21:40.440
Like, no probs,
Professor.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.640
We'll mop up the mess.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.206
Y'know, y'shoulda sent us

00:21:43.206 --> 00:21:44.940
instead of that Aster Phoenix
in the first place.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.406
But, like, oh, well.

00:21:46.406 --> 00:21:48.673
We all learn
from our mistakes.

00:21:48.673 --> 00:21:50.806
Yes, don't you fret.

00:21:50.806 --> 00:21:52.806
Heartland City will
soon be sterilized

00:21:52.806 --> 00:21:55.573
of that riffraff‐‐
right, sister?

00:21:55.573 --> 00:21:57.506
Totes!
