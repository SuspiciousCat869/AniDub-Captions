00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.833
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.066
I've been beat...

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.333
But was I able
to beat him, too?

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.466
Guess that's a no.

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.166
The Beast!
Huh? He's real?

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.633
Yeah, he's real...

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:28.066
I should know,
I trained him myself!

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.633
He is BB, the Battle Beast!

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.633
Hey, Crow!
Yuya!

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:33.966
(grunting)

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.933
Crow!

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.433
What we do now we do for Crow!

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:47.566
Let's duel!

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.833
(snarling)

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:53.433
Bestlaurie ability destroy
Odd‐Eyes Unicorn!

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:54.966
Things not look good for you,
Yuya!

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.773
Gyzarus!

00:01:01.773 --> 00:01:04.573
Destroy Gong
two Pendulum monsters.

00:01:04.573 --> 00:01:07.273
Gong now gonna
go goodbye to duel!

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.140
Gong, oh no!

00:01:15.873 --> 00:01:18.540
You will make good card.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.573
No, don't do it!

Is that...
No... can't be!

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.546
But it really is!

00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:37.913
(all)
Jack Atlas!

00:02:37.913 --> 00:02:39.846
Mind if I drop in?

00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:41.513
(grunts)

00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:47.013

00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:50.846
(gasping)

00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:52.646
This here party's private!

00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:54.380
Get lost!

00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:57.713
You kidding?
I just got here...

00:02:57.713 --> 00:03:00.646
Of course, when you're
the Master of Faster

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.353
it doesn't take you
very long to get anywhere.

00:03:03.853 --> 00:03:06.153
How are you, Yuya?

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:07.886
Better now!

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:09.386
You sit tight, Gong.

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:11.420
We'll handle things
from here on out.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.653
Good luck!
Just great.

00:03:13.653 --> 00:03:17.020
I mean, I was gonna come save
the day but Jack had to butt in.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.920
Well if anybody's butt is gonna
to do some saving, it's his.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.353
But it won't be easy.

00:03:22.353 --> 00:03:24.353
He's starting with
half his life points.

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:28.120
What it comes down to is
if they can tame the BB.

00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:31.253
Look, I appreciate the help,

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:32.686
but Heartland City
needs your help more.

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:33.853
You shouldn't have come.

00:03:33.853 --> 00:03:35.620
You might not realize it,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.220
but helping you means
I am helping Heartland City.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.320
If you should
falter here, Yuya,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.186
we're all going to
suffer the consequences.

00:03:43.186 --> 00:03:45.420
And I will not
let that happen.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.453
See...

00:03:47.453 --> 00:03:50.353
I have a responsibility
to the people back home...

00:03:50.353 --> 00:03:52.820
Hey, Jack what are you
still doing here?

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.320
The City's safe now,
but only for now.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.820
If you really want
to save us forever,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.593
you gotta go
to Duel Academy
and stop them!

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:02.226
And help Yuya and Crow!

00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:04.793
(Jack)
Besides, I can't let Crow

00:04:04.793 --> 00:04:07.460
get all the glory
for saving the world.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.726
Where is Crow anyway?

00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:13.526
(gasps)
Crow...

00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:15.460
I bet he's stuck in a tree.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.826
(Sylvio)
He's right here.

00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:21.326
He fought hard...

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:23.326
Trying to protect me...

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:27.293
We weren't able
to save him, Jack...

00:04:27.293 --> 00:04:29.826
I've heard all that I need...

00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:31.226
This is gonna stop!

00:04:32.493 --> 00:04:35.059
No one stop me, not ever.

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:37.526
Well, then, I think
the Master of Faster

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:41.026
should remedy that starting
right here, and right now!

00:04:41.026 --> 00:04:44.160
Is that so?
This moped ridin' maggot's

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.726
got a big mouth that needs
some shuttin' asap!

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:49.626
Go primal BB!

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:52.626
Junk this "pree‐mee‐donna"

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.726
and send him
to the scrapheap!

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.066
(Sanders)
Junk this "preee‐mee‐donna"

00:05:03.066 --> 00:05:05.333
and send him
to the scrapheap!

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:07.666
Me now end turn
with facedown...

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:08.466
Now go you.

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:11.266
I came a long way
to be here,

00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:12.900
so I'm not wasting any time

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.633
kicking this duel
into overdrive!

00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:16.866
Hope Jack has Runner insurance

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:19.600
cause BB's gonna
treat this duel like
a demolition derby.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.533
Yeah, BB's like
a wreckin' ball.

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:25.500
Your wild style
might scare others...

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.733
But as you're
about to discover...

00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:30.266
I'm usually the one
who has people quaking.

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:31.700
I draw!

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:35.100
I place this card...

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.000
facedown!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.900
Whoop‐dee‐doo, you got me
shakin in my boots!

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.500
(tires screeching)

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500
Next I summon
the Tuner Monster Red Resonator!

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.000
Go!

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.100
(giggling)

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.400
And when I summon
a Red Monster,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.100
I'm allowed to fire things up
and summon Red Warg,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.166
so long as I reduce
its attack points by half!

00:06:02.206 --> 00:06:04.373
Prepare yourself
for a terrifying awakening

00:06:04.373 --> 00:06:09.173
as Level 2 Red Resonator tunes
with Level 6 Red Warg!

00:06:09.173 --> 00:06:11.840
Now from the ancient chasms
of a lost world,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.473
I awake a great
and terrible power...

00:06:15.473 --> 00:06:17.740
I Synchro Summon...

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.873
Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:06:26.306 --> 00:06:27.606
(gasping)

00:06:31.206 --> 00:06:32.406
Go time!

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.306
And by "go,"
I mean your life points

00:06:38.306 --> 00:06:41.073
are about to go down because
Scarlight's special ability

00:06:41.073 --> 00:06:42.706
can destroy all your monsters

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:45.040
that have fewer attack points
than my Dragon.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.906
And then you take 500 points

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.540
of damage for each one
that perished by its flames.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.706
His monster
has 3,000 attack points!

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:57.173
That's way more attack points
than what BB's monster has!

00:06:57.173 --> 00:06:58.273
What a move!

00:06:58.273 --> 00:07:01.380
Your monster no hurt me!

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.280
Me activate Gladiator Beast's

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.980
Medusa Shield
and use to protect...

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.446
Gyzarus!

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.880
Gyzarus no go boom!

00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:16.513
Wrong! I activate
the trap Red Vanish!

00:07:16.513 --> 00:07:19.313
Usually I wouldn't be able
to play this trap right now,

00:07:19.313 --> 00:07:22.380
but I can because I happen
to have a Red Monster out.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.913
What?
No what!

00:07:23.913 --> 00:07:26.480
I trained you to deal
with any adversity!

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.813
Red Vanish destroys
Medusa's Shield

00:07:28.813 --> 00:07:31.046
leaving Gyzaurus unprotected!

00:07:35.946 --> 00:07:38.880
All right!
1,500 points of damage!

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.746
Huh? Wait, wasn't it
supposed to be just 500?

00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:44.146
(Gong)
No, dummy...

00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:46.546
You gotta factor in
the trap Thumbs Down!

00:07:46.546 --> 00:07:49.080
Oh, of course!
I was just testing you

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.480
to see if you knew that it
deals 500 points of damage

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.546
for every card
that's destroyed!

00:07:53.546 --> 00:07:55.580
That's right,
so since Medusa Shield

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.413
and Gyzarus
were both destroyed,

00:07:57.413 --> 00:08:01.553
BB's life points took a whopping
1,000 points of extra damage!

00:08:01.553 --> 00:08:04.320
You just drove
in here five minutes ago,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.886
how'd you know to play
that trap card?

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:09.053
I didn't.
But if BB's good enough

00:08:09.053 --> 00:08:11.653
to take Yuya down
to a 100 life points,

00:08:11.653 --> 00:08:14.186
then I knew that I needed
to be ready for anything.

00:08:14.186 --> 00:08:15.753
Jack...

00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:20.020
Don't you get it?
Nothing you do

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.986
will ever work against me
because you are

00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:25.253
of a lesser intellect,
so you don't stand a chance!

00:08:25.253 --> 00:08:30.120
Me... lose?
(snarling)

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.120
BB only has
1,100 life points left!

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.120
If Jack attacks,
it's going to be
game over.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.586
I can't believe
BB's been bested.

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:39.986
(grunting)

00:08:44.053 --> 00:08:47.253
I wish I could end this
right here and now,

00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:49.920
but my Dragon isn't allowed
to attack this turn.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.986
In other words,
you've been spared.

00:08:54.753 --> 00:08:57.820
Wipe that grin of your face...

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.386
Better still...

00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:02.760
Why don't I come on down there
and do it for you?

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.160
Don't you realize
that everything you do

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.960
reflects on me?

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.160
Guess I'm gonna have
to set an example

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.026
of how you're supposed to duel!

00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:16.626
Now watch and learn

00:09:16.626 --> 00:09:19.660
how victory's guaranteed
to be achieved!

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.093
(computer)
<i>Intrusion penalty.</i>

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:22.226
<i>2,000 life points.</i>

00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:26.360
Oh, good...

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.993
For a moment, I thought
this would be too easy.

00:09:28.993 --> 00:09:30.893
I place two cards
face down...

00:09:30.893 --> 00:09:32.426
And end my turn!

00:09:34.126 --> 00:09:35.860
Me now gonna activate

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.193
the Medusa Shield that be
in the graveyard of mine!

00:09:39.193 --> 00:09:42.860
Me select one Gladiator Beast
trap in me deck!

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.926
End turn!

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.293
(scoffs)
It's my turn!

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:54.960
I'm gonna educate
you grunts

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.726
on battling by activatin'
Test Fusion!

00:09:57.726 --> 00:10:00.060
Due to its effect,
I can send Test Ape

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.000
and Test Tiger
to the graveyard...

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.066
So that I am now able to fuse
these wild beasts together!

00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:10.333
Since my student can't
take control of this duel,

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:13.100
I'll bring out
something that can!

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.166
I Fusion Summon!

00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:16.800
Front and center

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.500
Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor!

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.633
(thunder rumbles)
(roaring)

00:10:23.166 --> 00:10:25.900
I activate Editor's ability!

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.733
I can recruit
one Gladiator Beast

00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:32.800
from the Extra Deck
and summon it to my field!

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.900
BB, I summon
Gladiator Beast Andabata

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.833
from your Extra Deck
on to your field!

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:41.533
You're welcome!

00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:43.900
♪♪♪

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.133
Aw, not that
cold‐blooded brute again!

00:10:46.133 --> 00:10:48.566
That Sanders
ain't messin' around.

00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:53.033
He's double dippin'
from BB's deck.

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:57.133
With my Gladiator Beast Tamer
Editor out on the front line,

00:10:57.133 --> 00:11:00.973
he can tame any beast
and in any deck!

00:11:00.973 --> 00:11:05.473
What, BB? No "thank you,"
you wannabe neanderthal?

00:11:05.473 --> 00:11:08.540
Well, I didn't want
no thank‐yous anyway!

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.540
Now let's see
if you can actually put

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.706
your Gladiator Beast to good use
the second time around

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:16.573
'cause you sure didn't
do it the first time!

00:11:16.573 --> 00:11:18.173
Huh...

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.373
(Jack)
What's up?

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.406
Well, Sanders shouldn't
be riding BB so hard.

00:11:25.406 --> 00:11:27.873
Well, what're
you waiting for, BB?

00:11:27.873 --> 00:11:31.006
Permission? Well,
I give you permission

00:11:31.006 --> 00:11:35.040
to make a good move because
you sure haven't so far!

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.606
So do what you've been told

00:11:36.606 --> 00:11:38.640
and crush
those Lancers!

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.340
Especially that no‐good,

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.140
lily‐livered, dueltainer,
Yuya Sakaki!

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.573
He needs to be captured so that
Revival Zero can succeed!

00:11:48.873 --> 00:11:51.273
Yuya?
That ain't good.

00:11:51.273 --> 00:11:55.640
What? Revival Zero,
why are they singling me out?

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.273
(gasps)

00:11:57.273 --> 00:11:59.506
(Declan)
I can only conclude
that Revival Zero

00:11:59.506 --> 00:12:01.546
is at the heart
of the Arc Area Project.

00:12:01.546 --> 00:12:04.313
But how is unclear.
What is clear

00:12:04.313 --> 00:12:07.413
is that if he has a file
on Yuri, then, Yuya,

00:12:07.413 --> 00:12:10.713
Revival Zero must have
something to do with you too.

00:12:10.713 --> 00:12:14.046
So then,
for the Professor's project

00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:16.246
he needs me out
of the picture?

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.946
So then,
for the Professor's project

00:12:22.946 --> 00:12:25.280
he needs me out
of the picture?

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.946
Who knows, Yuya?
But I do know this.

00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:30.013
If their plan is
to neutralize you,

00:12:30.013 --> 00:12:32.880
they're gonna have to defeat
the two of us first!

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.246
That certainly
won't be a problem.

00:12:35.246 --> 00:12:38.346
So why don't we eliminate
you first?

00:12:38.346 --> 00:12:41.413
Now, when there are two
Gladiator Beasts on the field,

00:12:41.413 --> 00:12:43.546
I can use Editor's
special ability

00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:45.380
to destroy one monster

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.246
and then its controller
takes damage

00:12:47.246 --> 00:12:50.180
equal to its monster's
attack points!

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.413
And the monster
I choose to destroy

00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:55.280
is your Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.480
Scarlight's attack points are
higher than Jack's life points!

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.153
The Sarge totally has this.

00:13:00.153 --> 00:13:01.720
Jack is a goner.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.820
You moped riding runt!

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.253
You're eliminated!

00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:09.253
I don't think so!
Red Armor shields

00:13:09.253 --> 00:13:12.186
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend
from destruction!

00:13:14.653 --> 00:13:16.553
I don't know
what's more annoying,

00:13:16.553 --> 00:13:19.520
your constant arrogance
or your blasted cards.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.853
Well, let's see
how high and mighty you are

00:13:21.853 --> 00:13:24.386
when you see your friend
crushed before your eyes!

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.486
Editor!
Attack Yuya directly!

00:13:29.486 --> 00:13:31.720
(Sylvio)
Uh, Yuya? Hello!
(Gong)
Incoming!

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.720
Maggot!

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.686
You cannot escape my attack!

00:13:44.153 --> 00:13:45.886
Stop him now BB!

00:13:45.886 --> 00:13:47.720
(grunting)

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.386
This is insubordination!

00:13:50.386 --> 00:13:52.486
I activate...

00:13:52.486 --> 00:13:56.420
the Action Spell Evasion to side
step that blast of yours!

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.286
Just what I would have done!

00:13:58.286 --> 00:14:00.593
BB...

00:14:00.593 --> 00:14:03.026
I'm talking to you!

00:14:03.026 --> 00:14:05.760
You simpleminded savage!
Snap out of it!

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.426
Respect the chain of command!

00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:09.160
The Professor
wants Yuya incapacitated

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.193
for his Zero Reverse project,

00:14:11.193 --> 00:14:13.193
and I say
sir, yes, sir!

00:14:13.193 --> 00:14:16.160
So you respect my superiority
and follow my orders!

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.360
Because that's what
we're all here for!

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.926
To follow orders and never
question authority!

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.060
Understood?

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.093
(All)
Sir!

00:14:23.093 --> 00:14:25.560
But Sarge,
all your orders did

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.693
was get five of your bestest
students card‐ified.

00:14:27.693 --> 00:14:30.093
I now end my turn.

00:14:30.093 --> 00:14:31.693
Yes!
You hear that?

00:14:31.693 --> 00:14:34.960
You're up now, Yuya,
so show em how we... do?

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.926
Huh?
Yuya?

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.760
(Yuto)
What's wrong, Yuya?

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.426
Like everything...

00:14:42.426 --> 00:14:45.060
Why does the Professor want me
out of the picture?

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.460
Who cares?

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.326
I do, Yuto.

00:14:48.326 --> 00:14:50.360
Declan said that me and Yuri
have something to do with

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.093
The Professor's
Zeros Reverse project,

00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:55.826
and if we're involved,
you must be too.

00:14:55.826 --> 00:14:57.726
Even Yugo.

00:14:57.726 --> 00:14:59.993
Even though we grew up
in different dimensions,

00:14:59.993 --> 00:15:04.666
I don't think it's coincidence
that we ran into each other.

00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:07.766
I mean, after that time
you and Yugo battled,

00:15:07.766 --> 00:15:09.733
you and I
somehow bonded together.

00:15:09.733 --> 00:15:11.066
Always remember...

00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:17.000
The Professor's no dummy...

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.233
What if he knows
that we now share a body?

00:15:20.233 --> 00:15:22.666
So when he's telling Sanders
to get rid of me,

00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:25.500
he's actually trying
to get rid of you too!

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.333
But why would the Professor
want to get rid of us, Yuya?

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:30.333
We didn't do anything to him.

00:15:30.333 --> 00:15:34.100
Maybe because of what happened
when we united as one.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.333
We started to lose control...

00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:38.666
Anger started
welling up within us.

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:42.666
Huh?
We lashed out and started
hurting everyone!

00:15:42.666 --> 00:15:45.633
Like, I felt something deep
and dark inside of me,

00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:48.033
this voice, and it
took everything I had

00:15:48.033 --> 00:15:50.433
and everything you had
to keep it down!

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:52.333
Like, I still don't know
what it actually was,

00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:54.166
but I felt that if it escaped,

00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:56.400
then the entire world
would be in danger.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.466
Maybe the Professor knows
what that thing inside us is,

00:15:59.466 --> 00:16:01.506
that's why
he wants to destroy us.

00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:03.973
I think you're
onto something.

00:16:03.973 --> 00:16:05.840
If we're out of the picture...

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.073
then that thing that's
inside of us will be gone too!

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.006
Well, I'm not planning on
letting the Professor
get his way, Yuya.

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:17.740
(Yuya)
Destroying us,
destroys whatever's inside us...

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.640
(Jack)
Hey, Yuya!
Huh?

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.340
In case you forgot...

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.306
You happen to be
in the middle
of a duel right now!

00:16:24.306 --> 00:16:26.173
So get with it!

00:16:26.173 --> 00:16:28.173
Because unless you do...

00:16:28.173 --> 00:16:30.173
You and I
will both end up cards!

00:16:30.173 --> 00:16:32.206
And that's not my look!

00:16:32.206 --> 00:16:33.740
(Sylvio)
Jack's right!

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.340
You gotta focus!

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.806
This guy is trying to
get in your head,

00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:38.206
but don't let him!

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.373
And remember
who you're dueling for!

00:16:40.373 --> 00:16:42.506
That's right!
My friends!

00:16:43.473 --> 00:16:45.040
I owe them.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.073
Moon Shadow
risked everything for me.

00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:48.940
And Crow did, too.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.473
I can't let my pals' sacrifices
be for nothing!

00:16:51.473 --> 00:16:54.006
I have to make things right!

00:16:54.006 --> 00:16:56.006
It's showtime!

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.913
I can't let my pals' sacrifices
be for nothing!

00:17:00.913 --> 00:17:03.013
My turn!

00:17:03.013 --> 00:17:06.113
And I'll kick things off
with Performapal Pararhino!

00:17:09.513 --> 00:17:12.146
Once per turn,
Pararhino can stick it to

00:17:12.146 --> 00:17:15.046
one of your monsters and negate
their special abilities!

00:17:15.046 --> 00:17:16.446
And that monster
I'm selecting

00:17:16.446 --> 00:17:18.080
is Andabata!

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.746
All right!

00:17:19.746 --> 00:17:22.746
Andabata's special ability can
summon extra Gladiator Beasts

00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:25.346
when it returns to the
Extra Deck, but not anymore.

00:17:25.346 --> 00:17:27.546
Next I play Pararhino's ability!

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:30.946
An ability that lets me bring
Performapal Gongato

00:17:30.946 --> 00:17:32.213
to the stage!

00:17:34.546 --> 00:17:36.480
But that's not all!

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.446
Now Andabata's attack points
get the beat down

00:17:38.446 --> 00:17:40.913
and become
the same as Gongato's!

00:17:40.913 --> 00:17:43.180
Now, Pararhino,

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.313
put some charge
into this next attack.

00:17:45.313 --> 00:17:46.713
Take out Andabata!

00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:49.813
Me no fear that!

00:17:49.813 --> 00:17:52.446
Gladiator Beast's Medallion
protect Andabata.

00:17:53.813 --> 00:17:55.213
You might not be afraid,

00:17:55.213 --> 00:17:57.280
but your life points
definitely are!

00:18:01.786 --> 00:18:05.386
Me activate trap card
Gladiator Beast's Assault Fort!

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:08.486
When me take damage,

00:18:08.486 --> 00:18:12.153
me must destroy me Thumbs Down
on me field.

00:18:12.153 --> 00:18:14.886
Then all me Gladiator Beast
spell and trap cards

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:17.386
turn into Gladiator Beast Forts.

00:18:22.186 --> 00:18:26.120
Gladiator Beast's Valor
and Gladiator Beast's Medallion

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.886
now both set up stronghold.

00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:34.553
(gasping)

00:18:34.553 --> 00:18:36.186
(chuckling)

00:18:36.186 --> 00:18:38.620
Now when
Gladiator Beast battles,

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.086
Gladiator Beast no go kaboom

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:45.853
and me also no take battle
damage once per turn.

00:18:45.853 --> 00:18:47.620
And you can no use effects

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.186
to kaboom
me Gladiator Beast either!

00:18:50.186 --> 00:18:51.553
What?

00:18:51.553 --> 00:18:53.986
So his monsters are
basically indestructible?

00:18:53.986 --> 00:18:56.586
Gladiator Beast's
Assault Fort's power

00:18:56.586 --> 00:18:59.893
lets me place one
Gladiator Beast in each fort!

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.326
First, Gladiator Beast Augustus!

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.493
Next, Gladiator Beast Laquari!

00:19:10.493 --> 00:19:13.326
When me return monster
from Fort to deck...

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.893
... me inflict 1,000 points
of damage on you!

00:19:18.893 --> 00:19:21.626
That's not good!
Not at all!

00:19:21.626 --> 00:19:23.926
(BB)
There! Sergeant happy now?

00:19:25.826 --> 00:19:29.160
Maybe sergeant
now keep mouth closed!

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.093
(grunting)

00:19:38.293 --> 00:19:40.526
He's so upset...

00:19:40.526 --> 00:19:42.993
He reminds me...
of me.

00:19:42.993 --> 00:19:44.560
I'm ending my turn.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.760
(Sanders chuckling)

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.726
It's more than
the end of your turn!

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.493
It's the end of the line!

00:19:51.493 --> 00:19:54.460
BB! Now, bury them!
That's a direct order!

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.760
Well?

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.826
(grunting)

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.933
Just what are you waiting for?
Finish him!

00:20:02.933 --> 00:20:04.966
(Sanders)
Do you hear me?
Finish him!

00:20:04.966 --> 00:20:06.933
That's an order!

00:20:06.933 --> 00:20:09.366
(grunting)

00:20:09.366 --> 00:20:11.066
I'm losing patience!

00:20:11.066 --> 00:20:13.400
If you don't do as I say,
then, BB...

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.133
You're going two‐dimensional!

00:20:19.766 --> 00:20:21.600
Yes, you heard right.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.533
So cease your brainless snorting
and get on with it already!

00:20:25.533 --> 00:20:27.700
(Sanders)
Do as I command!

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.633
(grunting)
Draw!

00:20:31.633 --> 00:20:33.933
Since me have
two Gladiator Beasts,

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:35.900
me now can activate

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.766
Sergeant's Gladiator Beast Tamer
Editor's special ability.

00:20:39.766 --> 00:20:41.933
About time
you made a good move, BB!

00:20:41.933 --> 00:20:43.900
Now use that ability
to destroy

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.266
Jack Atlas's Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend,

00:20:46.266 --> 00:20:47.733
so he'll take
3,000 points of damage

00:20:47.733 --> 00:20:49.600
and be finished for good!

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.433
Me no destroy
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend.

00:20:52.433 --> 00:20:55.466
Me destroy Gladiator Beast
Tamer Editor itself!

00:20:55.466 --> 00:20:57.900
(gasping)

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.440
So Sergeant now be the one
taking the damage

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.206
from crack of Editor's whip!

00:21:03.973 --> 00:21:06.706
Have you lost
your pea‐sized mind?!

00:21:09.373 --> 00:21:11.206
(Editor grunting)

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.473
(screaming)

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.940
(Yuya)
Oh, no!

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.273
BB's completely out of control!
