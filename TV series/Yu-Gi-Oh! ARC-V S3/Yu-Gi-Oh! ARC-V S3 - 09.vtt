WEBVTT

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.033
(Yuya)
Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:06.800
(Gloria)
My, oh, my.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.433
Do my eyes spy
a Lancer, Grace?

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:11.900
(Grace)
And, like, she's all
by herself, Gloria.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.766
I've heard these
Lancers were brave,

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.266
but they're
not very smart.

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.433
Before we make our way
to headquarters,

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.400
what do you say we
bring a welcoming present
along with us...

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.333
in the form
of a gift card?

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.900
Saya!

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.733
You go. I'll handle
these giraffes!

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.566
Alan, until now,

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.233
you've always stood in
front of me to protect me

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.800
when I should've
always been standing
next to you

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.466
so that we can
fight together.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.266
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.000
It's on!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.300
Fairy Cheer Girl,
attack Amazoness Queen!

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.966
Do you think we'd let
a little girl destroy a Queen?

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.100
When you mess with
the Tyler sisters...

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.766
(both)
You're gonna get slammed
with glam!

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.966
These two are bad news.

00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.933
I heard they wiped out
the entire Spade School

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.406
all by themselves.

00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:02.573
That's awful.

00:01:02.573 --> 00:01:05.240
You're finished!

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.373
Aah!

00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:07.840
(both screaming)

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.173
Huh?

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:12.373
Are you ready to make
some gift cards, Sister?

00:01:12.373 --> 00:01:13.806
Yes, let's.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:16.540
Hey!
You responsible for this?

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.273
Hands off our Lancers.

00:01:18.273 --> 00:01:21.506
There not Lancers,
we're Lancers!

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:22.840
I knew it was too easy.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.206
Yeah, you're right.

00:01:24.206 --> 00:01:26.506
But isn't it, like,
totes so convenient

00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:28.073
that the prey comes to us?

00:01:28.073 --> 00:01:29.906

(Sylvio crying in pain)

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:35.913
Whoa... sounds bad!

00:02:35.913 --> 00:02:36.946
This way!

00:02:39.913 --> 00:02:42.546
(grunting)

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:44.846
Oh, no!
Gong! Sylvio!

00:02:44.846 --> 00:02:46.446
What happened, pal?

00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:47.446
Who did this to you?

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:48.646
(Shay)
Alan!

00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:50.713
Saya!
Are you all right?

00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:52.846
Two...
tall twins with 'tude.

00:02:54.713 --> 00:02:57.246
(Gloria)
Ah, looks like some more flies

00:02:57.246 --> 00:02:59.280
have found their way
into our web.

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:03.586
(Shay)
So Grace and Gloria
Tyler are back,

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:05.153
and I'm guessing
it's not because

00:03:05.153 --> 00:03:07.053
you're sorry
for trashing my city.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.620
But after I'm through
with you, you will be.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.986
Like, cool.
Glad to know you're, like,
familiar with our work.

00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:14.620
Look, Grace.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.853
The Resistance really
are like cockroaches.

00:03:16.853 --> 00:03:18.786
Just when you think
you got rid of 'em all,

00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:21.420
a couple more
scurry out of hiding.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.820
Why you‐‐
Zip it!

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.686
The only scurrying
that's gonna happen

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:27.086
is you two
scurrying back home,

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:29.386
'cause hurting
my friends isn't funny.

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:30.720
(Yuya and Yuto)
After I'm done with you,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.786
you'll wish
you never came here.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.486
It appears I've touched
a nerve, Grace.

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:36.786
How fortunate.

00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:39.020
Yeah, Gloria, nice one.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.353
(weakly)
Yuya...

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.320
They're monsters.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.886
They are...

00:03:42.886 --> 00:03:45.953
and monsters will not
be shown any mercy!

00:03:45.953 --> 00:03:49.220
Yuto... we're gonna take
these two down, I promise,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.286
but you have to remain calm.

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:54.386
Don't get so angry that
your anger overwhelms you.

00:03:54.386 --> 00:03:56.153
It clouds your judgment,

00:03:56.153 --> 00:04:00.153
and, even worse, it brings out
your most hateful instincts.

00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:03.193
I don't want to fuel
that fire again.

00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:05.993
(Shay)
If you're done having
your lil' powwow with Yuto,

00:04:05.993 --> 00:04:09.126
we have a duel
to win, Yuya.

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:10.826
Yeah, we're cool, Shay.

00:04:10.826 --> 00:04:12.960
Good, then let's get
to kicking some tail.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.860
These two are first,
then it's Duel Academy's turn.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.626
And we're taking 'em
all down together!

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:20.260
But listen....

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.726
(groaning)

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.226
We gotta do this
the right way.

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:27.693
I'm here to show these two

00:04:27.693 --> 00:04:29.826
that dueling's
about having fun...

00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:31.826
so check all the anger
and all of the hate

00:04:31.826 --> 00:04:33.659
at the door, Shay.
Can you do that?

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.359
I'll try.

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:37.993
Now let's stop yapping
and get down to business.

00:04:37.993 --> 00:04:39.826
(thinking) <i>This is one</i>
<i>duel I can't lose,</i>

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:41.626
<i>but I hope</i>
<i>we can pull this off.</i>

00:04:41.626 --> 00:04:43.926
<i>They took down Gong</i>
<i>and Sylvio real hard,</i>

00:04:43.926 --> 00:04:46.060
<i>and that means</i>
<i>I'm in for a real fight.</i>

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.460
(computer voice)
Generating Action Field‐‐
Crossover.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.793
(Grace)
Oh, joy, two Lancers.

00:04:51.793 --> 00:04:55.526
Now, you do realize tag
dueling's our specialty.

00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:57.760
Yeah, and in this tag duel,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.160
each team share
their life points, fields

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.100
and, like, even their graveyards
are up for sharesies.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.133
The more the merrier!

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:05.633
Ooh, confidence!

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:07.733
It's too bad
that after this match,

00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:08.533
you're not gonna have
any of that left.

00:05:08.533 --> 00:05:09.800
Indeed.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.566
Prepare to be humbled

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:13.566
in a way you won't
ever forget!

00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:16.166
Enough talk‐‐ let's see
if you can back it up.

00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:17.466
It's showtime!

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:18.766
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:22.533
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:24.366
I shall go first.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.966
And since there are
no monsters out, I can do this.

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:30.133
Activate a spell that will
seriously slow down your game...

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:31.966
Quiet Life.

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:35.000
And due to its effect,
when any player Normal Summons,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.300
they can't Special Summon
during that turn!

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.633
And, like, vice versa.

00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:38.966
(gasps)

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.866
Next I'm activating the spell
card Polymerization

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:47.866
to fuse Amazoness Queen
and Amazoness Swords Woman!

00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:51.933
Now, these two warriors of
the jungle will combine into one

00:05:51.933 --> 00:05:55.133
and harness the untamed power
of the jungle itself!

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:57.233
I Fusion Summon!

00:05:57.233 --> 00:06:00.033
Amazoness Empress!

00:06:00.033 --> 00:06:02.606
Hyah!

00:06:02.606 --> 00:06:04.873
And then I'll end my turn
with a facedown card.

00:06:04.873 --> 00:06:06.606
You're up.

00:06:06.606 --> 00:06:08.540
(Yuya, thinking)
<i>But before I draw,</i>

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.540
<i>I need to understand</i>
<i>what she's up to.</i>

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.040
So every turn
we need to choose

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.440
between Normal Summoning
and Special Summoning?

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.640
That cuts our options
in half!

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.006
If I have to choose between
the two, my option is clear!

00:06:20.006 --> 00:06:21.506
I draw!

00:06:22.573 --> 00:06:26.573
I'll use Scale 3
Performapal Turn Toad

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:28.706
and Scale 8
Performapal Odd‐Eyes Unicorn

00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:30.706
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:33.606
I'm taking control of this duel
starting now!

00:06:36.973 --> 00:06:40.240
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 4 through 7

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.440
all at the same time!

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.073
(groaning)

00:06:43.073 --> 00:06:44.206
Go, Yuya...

00:06:44.206 --> 00:06:46.306
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:49.806
Carve the arc of victory!

00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:56.473
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:06:56.473 --> 00:06:58.673
Work your wizardry,
Xiangsheng Magician.

00:06:58.673 --> 00:07:01.446
Tickle the ivories,
Performapal Monkeyboard.

00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:04.013
So you've decided
to put them both

00:07:04.013 --> 00:07:05.280
in defense mode.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.980
Doesn't hurt to be careful.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.613
(chuckles)

00:07:08.613 --> 00:07:11.446
I'm activating the trap card
Amazoness Hall.

00:07:11.446 --> 00:07:13.746
When you
Special Summon a monster,

00:07:13.746 --> 00:07:15.913
we gain life points equal
to its attack points.

00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:18.213
And Pendulum Summoning counts
as Special Summoning.

00:07:18.213 --> 00:07:20.013
What?

00:07:20.013 --> 00:07:21.646
Well, this just went
from bad to worse.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.713
(groaning)

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:28.613
Oh, no...

00:07:28.613 --> 00:07:31.546
We know you Lancers love
to Pendulum Summon,

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:34.046
so we were
prepared to deal with it.

00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:35.746
For realsies‐‐

00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:37.313
the Professor gave us
the lowdown on you chumps.

00:07:37.313 --> 00:07:40.046
Lowdown?!
That's not good!

00:07:40.046 --> 00:07:41.713
Stay focused.

00:07:41.713 --> 00:07:43.480
We can't let our guard down
even for a second.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.646
Please...

00:07:45.646 --> 00:07:48.546
You're acting as though
you actually have a chance.

00:07:48.546 --> 00:07:51.646
But you, like,
most certainly don't!

00:07:51.646 --> 00:07:54.846
I place one card face down
and end my turn.

00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:57.480
That's right.
There's nothing you can do.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.086
That is, except lose,
of course!

00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:02.753
And just like my sis...

00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:05.520
I'm also activating
Polymerization!

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.720
And with it, I'm totally,
like, gonna fuse

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.820
Amazoness Tiger
and Amazoness Spy!

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.953
Get set for some paws, claws,
and, like, roarin' roars!

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:17.086
I Fusion Summon!

00:08:17.086 --> 00:08:19.920
Amazoness Pet Liger!

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.353
(roaring)

00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:25.153
All right, show
that Performapal Monkeyboard

00:08:25.153 --> 00:08:27.420
that not all beasts
are created equal,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.220
especially since
when Liger attacks,

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.686
she gains 500 attack points!

00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:34.486
And due to Amazoness Empress's
special ability,

00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:37.886
you take damage even if
our monster is in defense mode!

00:08:42.953 --> 00:08:44.353
(both groaning)

00:08:44.353 --> 00:08:47.320
Hang in there, you two‐‐
we'll get help soon!

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.553
Now, since our battle
is over,

00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:51.420
Liger's attack points
go back to normal.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.386
But don't think
that means I'm through.

00:08:53.386 --> 00:08:55.653
Since this is a tag match,

00:08:55.653 --> 00:08:58.486
I don't have to be limited
to just using my monsters.

00:08:58.486 --> 00:09:01.060
I can totally use
my sister's, too!

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.926
So, Amazoness Empress,

00:09:02.926 --> 00:09:05.426
make that Magician, like,
disappear for reals!

00:09:10.093 --> 00:09:11.626
Yuya...

00:09:11.626 --> 00:09:13.626
Not good...

00:09:13.626 --> 00:09:16.693
It's, like, so much fun
destroying you and your monsters

00:09:16.693 --> 00:09:20.393
that I almost feel sorry,
but not, like, that sorry.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.893
In fact, like,
not even a little sorry.

00:09:22.893 --> 00:09:26.626
So causing all this pain and
suffering gives you pleasure?

00:09:26.626 --> 00:09:32.026
Me losing my friends
brings a smile to your face?

00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:33.226
Take it easy, Shay.

00:09:33.226 --> 00:09:35.060
Anger won't help us.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.793
I'm not so sure, Yuya.

00:09:36.793 --> 00:09:38.993
Maybe a little fire
is what we need right now.

00:09:38.993 --> 00:09:40.960
Come on now, guys!

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.626
You can't really mean that!

00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:45.793
Sorry, Yuya, this is not
the time for fun and games.

00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:47.493
It's time to bring the pain!

00:09:50.226 --> 00:09:51.626
Here comes the pain!

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:56.226
Since Yuya set
the Pendulum Scale already,

00:09:56.226 --> 00:09:58.893
I can Pendulum Summon too!!

00:09:58.893 --> 00:10:01.366
I call forth...

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:04.433
Three Raidraptor ‐
Singing Laniuses!

00:10:04.433 --> 00:10:07.566
Guess you forgot
we have the trap Amazoness Hall,

00:10:07.566 --> 00:10:10.700
so whenever you Special Summon,
we gain life points.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.300
No!

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.266
They just keep
getting stronger.

00:10:14.266 --> 00:10:16.533
Hang...tough...

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:17.933
Calm down!

00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:19.666
You're not thinking clearly!

00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:22.833
Believe me, Yuya,
I am thinking clearly.

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:25.366
Just watch!

00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:28.433
I Overlay
my three Singing Laniuses

00:10:28.433 --> 00:10:31.466
in order to build...
the Overlay Network!

00:10:31.466 --> 00:10:35.066
Now I can Xyz Summon
and bring forth this!

00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:37.700
Raidraptor ‐ Rise Falcon!

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.366
Really?

00:10:39.566 --> 00:10:41.500
Please.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.366
Do you really think a monster
with so few attack points

00:10:43.366 --> 00:10:44.700
will be of any use?

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.533
You'll find out soon enough,

00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:48.966
because I equip the spell
Raidraptor ‐ Iron Heart

00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:50.366
to Rise Falcon

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:52.733
and raise its attack points
by 500!

00:10:52.733 --> 00:10:55.533
Am I supposed to be,
like, scared?

00:10:55.533 --> 00:10:57.400
Make her eat those words,
make her shake in fear!

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.300
Chill out.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.373
Whatever you're thinking
of doing isn't going to work.

00:11:01.373 --> 00:11:04.373
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not done just yet...

00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:08.006
I activate
Rise Falcon's special ability!

00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:10.173
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:11.973
it gains the attack points
of their two monsters.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.473
It what?!

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:15.373
Like, that's
5,900 attack points!

00:11:16.973 --> 00:11:21.006
Making Rise Falcon the
strongest one on the field!

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.740
Whoa! That thing is,
like, super strong!

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.773
Go, Shay!

00:11:28.773 --> 00:11:31.340
And now, attack!

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.306
Take out Pet Liger
with Ravaging Rebellion!

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.240
Our monsters can take the heat.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.340
Because when Amazoness Empress
is holding court...

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.506
Amazoness monsters
can't be destroyed!

00:11:45.506 --> 00:11:48.306
But you'll still
take damage!

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.573
Shay's Rise Falcon

00:11:53.573 --> 00:11:55.940
can attack every monster
that's on the field

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.206
once per turn!
So hit 'em again!

00:11:58.206 --> 00:12:01.346
Rise Falcon, sink your talons
into Amazoness Empress!

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.580
Wrong!

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.546
So like, Liger doesn't like it
when you attack its owner,

00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:08.680
so its roar is
gonna stop your attack!

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.713
(roaring)

00:12:11.713 --> 00:12:13.680
Aw... not good!

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.246
You got lucky, but I promise you
won't be so lucky next time.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.613
I place one card face down
and end my turn.

00:12:23.613 --> 00:12:25.580
I've gotta admit,
I'm impressed.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.413
You're much better duelists

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.713
than the pathetic trash
we usually go up against.

00:12:29.713 --> 00:12:31.580
(both gasp)

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.713
But as you're about to see,
not good enough to beat us.

00:12:33.713 --> 00:12:35.413
Really?

00:12:35.413 --> 00:12:38.680
Yeah, really,
because I activate my trap card

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.080
Amazoness Hot Spring!

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.413
Due to its refreshing waters,

00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:44.813
we now gain back each and every
life point we lost

00:12:44.813 --> 00:12:46.680
from the, like, yuckiness
of that last turn.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.213
No...

00:12:48.213 --> 00:12:49.846
Wait, so it's
like Shay's attacks

00:12:49.846 --> 00:12:50.880
never even happened?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.846
And now another facedown...

00:12:52.846 --> 00:12:55.346
The trap
Amazoness Cursed Mirror!

00:12:55.346 --> 00:12:58.013
Once per turn,
I can, like, stop the damage

00:12:58.013 --> 00:12:59.580
my sweet sis or I might take.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.453
No way!

00:13:01.453 --> 00:13:03.586
So how are we supposed to
get to their life points?

00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:05.386
That's just it, sweetums.

00:13:05.386 --> 00:13:07.620
You're not going to get to 'em,
so you're not gonna win.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.253
You're just going to end up

00:13:09.253 --> 00:13:11.453
like all these other
who have faced us...

00:13:11.453 --> 00:13:13.453
Mauled into mincemeat!

00:13:13.453 --> 00:13:16.920
And now I'll have my Pet Liger
continue the onslaught

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.753
by having her down your Falcon!

00:13:18.753 --> 00:13:21.920
And don't forget,
due to Liger's special ability,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.086
she gains 500 attack points!

00:13:24.086 --> 00:13:25.986
I activate
a little something called

00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:28.820
Rank‐Up‐Magic Escape Force!

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.153
Stopping your attack.

00:13:31.153 --> 00:13:33.453
And then I can
Xyz Summon a monster

00:13:33.453 --> 00:13:36.253
that's one Rank higher
than Rise Falcon!

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:43.186
Go Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:13:44.453 --> 00:13:48.386
Rise up,
Raid ‐ Raptor Blaze Falcon!

00:13:48.386 --> 00:13:52.486
And that's, like, another 1,000
life points added to us.

00:13:52.486 --> 00:13:55.253
But your life points, Shay,
are about to be decimated!

00:13:55.253 --> 00:13:58.253
Go! Clip Blaze Falcon's wings,
Empress!

00:13:58.253 --> 00:13:59.526
Hyah!

00:14:03.226 --> 00:14:05.126
(both screaming)

00:14:07.093 --> 00:14:09.293
You may have destroyed
one Falcon,

00:14:09.293 --> 00:14:12.460
but another will soon
rise and take its place,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.593
because Raidraptor ‐ Iron Heart
activates from my graveyard,

00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:19.826
allowing me to summon
Rise Falcon back to my field!

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.826
Who cares?

00:14:24.826 --> 00:14:26.193
We'll just beat it again.

00:14:26.193 --> 00:14:28.226
You're, like, so annoying.

00:14:28.226 --> 00:14:30.160
You know you can't win,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.060
so, like, stop wasting
my precious time, okaysies?

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.826
Your friends
aren't worth the hassle,

00:14:34.826 --> 00:14:36.493
so just, like, give up.

00:14:36.493 --> 00:14:38.126
Never!

00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:39.926
I'll never give up!

00:14:39.926 --> 00:14:41.593
(both gasp)

00:14:41.593 --> 00:14:43.093
(Sylvio groans)

00:14:43.093 --> 00:14:46.726
Not for me,
not for my friends...

00:14:46.726 --> 00:14:48.893
not for my sister Lulu.

00:14:48.893 --> 00:14:51.160
I'll take down Duel Academy...

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.660
and that's a promise
I'll never break!

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.626
(gasps)
Shay...

00:14:55.626 --> 00:14:56.926
That's right!

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:58.293
So if you're late...

00:14:58.293 --> 00:15:00.093
(Yuya and Yuto)
for an appointment or something,

00:15:00.093 --> 00:15:01.533
then maybe you should be
the ones to give up!

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:03.500
For "realsies".

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.166
Please. When will you
get it through your thick heads

00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:08.900
that winning this duel
is not in the cards.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.700
Face it!
You two are finished!

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.833
We'll see about that.

00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:14.900
Yuya, crush 'em to a pulp.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.166
No! You need
to calm down.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.933
Yuya, I am calm.

00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:20.733
No, you're not.

00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:22.800
Look, you can't
lie to me.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.133
I can feel your anger, okay?

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.000
And if you don't stop this,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.066
we're gonna lose control
like before

00:15:29.066 --> 00:15:30.833
and then who knows
what will happen?

00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:33.033
Look guys, we all have to take

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.866
a couple deep breaths
and get focused.

00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:37.066
Stay calm instead of angry.

00:15:37.066 --> 00:15:39.433
Trust me that this is
the best way.

00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:40.766
Trust me and
I'll show you a duel

00:15:40.766 --> 00:15:42.400
you've never seen before!

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.766
Okay...

00:15:43.766 --> 00:15:45.400
Let's see what you can do.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.766
Good luck.

00:15:47.933 --> 00:15:49.933
Thanks, Yuto.
Thanks, Shay.

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:50.966
Now then...

00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:53.166
It's showtime!

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.366
Perfect!

00:15:56.366 --> 00:15:57.866
And what's a show
without a Pendulum Monster?

00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:02.606
Now swing into action...!

00:16:02.606 --> 00:16:04.006
Xiangsheng Magician!

00:16:06.006 --> 00:16:07.473
Much obliged.

00:16:07.473 --> 00:16:09.273
It's, like,
not even our birthday,

00:16:09.273 --> 00:16:11.640
but you, like, keep giving
our life points presents.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.340
Then I guess you'll love
when I activate Monster Reborn

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.373
to summon Raidraptor ‐ Singing
Lanius from our graveyard,

00:16:18.373 --> 00:16:21.473
unless of course you want to be
the only birdbrains out here.

00:16:21.473 --> 00:16:23.340
Why, you...

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.040
Now I'll Overlay Xiangsheng
Magician and Singing Lanius

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.006
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.106
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective.

00:16:36.106 --> 00:16:38.340
I call upon
the most dangerous of dragons!

00:16:39.773 --> 00:16:44.140
Now I Xyz Summon
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.240
Like, really?

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.706
Look at her life points.

00:16:51.706 --> 00:16:53.606
They're over 10,000!

00:16:53.606 --> 00:16:56.173
Has Yuya lost his mind?!

00:16:56.173 --> 00:16:58.640
Time will tell...
and that time is right now!

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.313
You know, I've faced
some bad duelists in my time,

00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:03.013
but you are by far the worst!

00:17:03.013 --> 00:17:05.280
You make winning so easy
it's almost not fun!

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.146
Uh, thanks?

00:17:07.146 --> 00:17:09.280
When you said you were
gonna turn things around,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.446
I didn't think you meant
in their favor.

00:17:11.446 --> 00:17:12.846
And you thought
right, Yuto.

00:17:12.846 --> 00:17:14.080
Because for the next step,

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.813
I need the help
of both of you.

00:17:15.813 --> 00:17:17.046
Wait, now you need
our help?

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:21.146
That's right...

00:17:21.146 --> 00:17:22.380
and my Dad's.

00:17:26.513 --> 00:17:28.946
♪♪♪

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.213
Commander Phoenix,
you beckoned?

00:17:34.213 --> 00:17:38.380
I'm looking for Yuya Sakaki‐‐
find out where he is!

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.913
Yes, sir!

00:17:40.913 --> 00:17:43.446
Where is Noro?
I need to speak to him.

00:17:43.446 --> 00:17:45.046
Oh, he told me
not to tell you

00:17:45.046 --> 00:17:46.713
that he had an emergency.

00:17:46.713 --> 00:17:47.813
Oops.

00:17:47.813 --> 00:17:50.646
Oh, is that so?

00:17:50.646 --> 00:17:53.713
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:17:53.713 --> 00:17:55.980
Your eyes are in for a treat!

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.013
My opponents' life points
are over 10,000!

00:17:59.013 --> 00:18:01.853
To win now would be
the miracle of miracles!

00:18:01.853 --> 00:18:03.086
You think you can win?

00:18:03.086 --> 00:18:04.853
Have you forgotten

00:18:04.853 --> 00:18:06.953
about Amazoness
Magic Mirror's effect?

00:18:06.953 --> 00:18:08.620
It, like, stops your lame dragon
from hurting us.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.386
No, ladies, I didn't forget.

00:18:11.386 --> 00:18:12.953
Getting around that effect

00:18:12.953 --> 00:18:15.486
is what's going to make this
so entertaining!

00:18:15.486 --> 00:18:17.853
Now let's set the stage,
shall we?

00:18:17.853 --> 00:18:21.286
I activate the spell
Miracle Rocket Show!

00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:23.786
What's he wasting
our time with now?

00:18:23.786 --> 00:18:26.053
Whoa... I don't know,
but it's, like, so pretty.

00:18:26.053 --> 00:18:28.220
(Yuya)
I think this is one show
you'll like,

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.153
because now, your monsters
can't be destroyed in battle,

00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:34.486
and you take
no battle damage either!

00:18:34.486 --> 00:18:36.586
But that helps them, Yuya!

00:18:36.586 --> 00:18:38.420
Seems like it, doesn't it?

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.853
But maybe... I got into this jam
to get me out of it.

00:18:42.853 --> 00:18:45.020
I play the spell card
Smile World!

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.453
So Noro thinks he can
go off on his own, does he?

00:18:48.453 --> 00:18:49.720
I guess... maybe?

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.253
Commander!

00:18:51.253 --> 00:18:54.186
I think I've found
what you're looking for.

00:18:54.186 --> 00:18:57.986
(Yuya)Smile World gives all
monsters 100 attack points

00:18:57.986 --> 00:18:59.953
<i>for every monster</i>
<i>on the field!</i>

00:18:59.953 --> 00:19:01.093
<i>Since there's a</i>
<i>total of four,</i>

00:19:01.093 --> 00:19:04.426
<i>each monster gains</i>
<i>400 attack points!</i>

00:19:04.426 --> 00:19:07.693
Found you, Yuya Sakaki.

00:19:07.693 --> 00:19:09.426
Everyone gains
attack points?

00:19:09.426 --> 00:19:11.326
You're up to something.

00:19:11.326 --> 00:19:12.893
'Course I am!

00:19:12.893 --> 00:19:15.493
And I'll show you
right now.

00:19:15.493 --> 00:19:17.493
Actually, make that <i>we.</i>

00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:24.093
I use Rise Falcon's Overlay Unit
to activate its special ability!

00:19:24.093 --> 00:19:27.526
It gains Amazoness Empress
and Amazoness Pet Liger's

00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:29.826
attack points!

00:19:32.093 --> 00:19:34.626
And, Yuto,
time for your dragon.

00:19:34.626 --> 00:19:37.193
All right.
Let's do this!

00:19:37.193 --> 00:19:41.093
(Yuya and Yuto)
I activate Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon's special ability!

00:19:41.093 --> 00:19:44.993
By using one Overlay Unit,
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon

00:19:44.993 --> 00:19:48.026
steals half of Amazoness
Pet Liger's attack points!

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.260
(roaring)

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.626
(roaring)

00:19:57.626 --> 00:20:00.200
Power up,
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.200
(roaring)

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.866
(roaring)

00:20:05.866 --> 00:20:08.400
Yuya and Shay
have really strong monsters,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.533
but what's the point?

00:20:09.533 --> 00:20:11.833
No matter how strong they get,

00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:14.233
there's no point
if you can't deal us damage!

00:20:14.233 --> 00:20:15.366
Now sit back...

00:20:15.366 --> 00:20:17.200
and look up!

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.833
'Cause our two dragons are about
to blast off and attack!

00:20:20.833 --> 00:20:23.033
Now I know it's
a bit of a snug fit you two,

00:20:23.033 --> 00:20:25.733
but don't worry‐‐
it'll be a short trip.

00:20:25.733 --> 00:20:27.433
Right towards
Amazoness Pet Liger!

00:20:27.433 --> 00:20:30.466
All systems are go!

00:20:30.466 --> 00:20:34.266
Target has been acquired!

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:36.100
Commence countdown!

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.133
Three...

00:20:37.133 --> 00:20:38.333
two...

00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:40.200
one...

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.766
blastoff!

00:20:48.133 --> 00:20:49.100
Yeah!

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.100
Pretty!

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.366
Whoa...

00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:52.766
I, like, love the glitz!

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.706
Whoa...!
Whoa...!

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.440
(laughs)
How cool!

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.473
And we take no damage.

00:21:11.473 --> 00:21:14.773
True, but what's a rocket show
without a rocking finale?

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:17.473
Since battle damage
is reduced to zero,

00:21:17.473 --> 00:21:19.673
Miracle Rocket Show deals you

00:21:19.673 --> 00:21:21.406
all the damage
you would've taken!

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:25.440
A whopping 10,225 points!

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.506
No way!
Amazing!

00:21:31.173 --> 00:21:33.273
Whoa! They won!

00:21:33.273 --> 00:21:34.806
Against all odds!

00:21:34.806 --> 00:21:37.340
And put on an incredible
show at the same time!

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.206
Sure did!
(laughs)

00:21:40.206 --> 00:21:41.640
Well, folks...

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.806
I hope you all
enjoyed the show.

00:21:43.806 --> 00:21:47.173
Gotta say I think I did
the Sakaki name proud

00:21:47.173 --> 00:21:48.640
on this one.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.940
I won't let you
escape again, Yuya!

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.306
Assemble the team!

00:21:53.306 --> 00:21:54.706
We are moving out in five!

00:21:57.106 --> 00:21:59.106
I can't believe it.

00:21:59.106 --> 00:22:01.113
They struck us down.

00:22:01.113 --> 00:22:03.346
Starstruck down.

00:22:03.346 --> 00:22:06.246
I can't believe you lost!

00:22:06.246 --> 00:22:07.746
What did I pay you for?!

00:22:07.746 --> 00:22:10.346
Well, I didn't pay you,
but you get the idea!

00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:11.446
Go after the Lancers again

00:22:11.446 --> 00:22:12.680
and beat them
this time!

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.013
No. They had
their chance.

00:22:14.013 --> 00:22:15.580
It's our turn.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.080
Because we always
get the job done right.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.246
(whimpers)

00:22:18.246 --> 00:22:20.213
It's the Obelisk Force!

00:22:20.213 --> 00:22:22.646
Why are you here?
