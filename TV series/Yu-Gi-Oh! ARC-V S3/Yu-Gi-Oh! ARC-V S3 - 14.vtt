WEBVTT

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.500
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.066
(Nor)
You've been on quite
the role, Yuya,

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.966
but your dueltaining
ways are coming

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.866
to a screeching halt!

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.700
Aster?!

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.300
The people of the Xyz Dimension
were doing just fine

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.133
until we showed up.

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.200
We took their world
and turned it upside down.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.166
I'm not cool being
the Professor's fool.

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.900
And if that makes me a traitor,
that's fine with me!

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.733
See ya on the other
side, Noro!

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.800
YOLO!
What?!

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.566
(Aster)
Listen... all of you!

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:34.133
The only decent thing to do
is to end the project

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.466
and work on righting
all the wrongs it caused.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.866
Thank you.

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.033
Turning people into cards
is just a way

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.733
to capture and contain
their life force.

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.000
If you can get
those cards back,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.700
we might find a way
to free them.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.566
(Yuya)
So this is where
you zap all those cards

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.000
to the Fusion Dimension?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.433
From that chamber
direct to Duel Academy.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:56.000
Then fire it up!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.600
I'm going to get
my family back!

00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:07.773
Yugo, stop!

00:01:07.773 --> 00:01:09.839
Zuzu, what are
you doing?

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:12.340
I'm gonna
hold these guys off.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.506
You serious?
Yugo!

00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:16.840
(Yuya)
Zuzu!
Ohh!

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.273
Zuzu!

00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:21.540
Yuya.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.173
Well, whadda ya know!

00:01:23.173 --> 00:01:25.606
Looky here,
it's like a reunion.

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:27.906
And you're
our surprise guest.

00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:33.013
Yuya!

00:02:33.013 --> 00:02:35.313
Your dad's here
and he needs our help!!

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:37.913
(Iggy)
No, you're the one
who needs help!

00:02:37.913 --> 00:02:41.613
Aah! Unh!

00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:44.180
Remember me, Yuya?
Huh?

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.246
'Cause you better believe
I haven't forgotten you!

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:50.680
It is time...
for payback!

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.613
Iggy Arlo?!

00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:54.780
I haven't seen you
since our crazy duel

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.680
in the Arc League
Championship!

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.080
What are you
doing here?

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.646
(all gasp)

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:01.553
I'm here to make things
right, Yuya.

00:03:01.553 --> 00:03:04.386
After you beat me,
nothing has been the same.

00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:07.586
Especially at my school.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.586
I had the stink
of defeat on me.

00:03:09.586 --> 00:03:12.820
No one wanted anything
to do with me.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.353
So I turned inward
and began to train,

00:03:16.353 --> 00:03:17.920
letting the pain of losing

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.520
fuel me through
the long nights.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.420
But my focus was lacking...

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.553
that is, until...

00:03:25.553 --> 00:03:28.620
(Dennis)
If you really want
another chance at Yuya,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.586
you'll need to
find him first.

00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:32.386
And I can help.

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:35.986
Dennis brought me
to the Fusion Dimension,

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:38.686
And now that I'm here,
I'm going to finally prove

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.120
who the best duelist
truly is!

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.620
Grr!

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.086
Let him have it, Iggy.
And don't hold back.

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:47.386
Dennis?!
Gong!

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:48.653
Long time no see, chum!

00:03:48.653 --> 00:03:50.053
You creep!

00:03:50.053 --> 00:03:52.120
You've got a lot
to answer for

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.786
and unless you
get talking,
Gong'll get thumping!

00:03:53.786 --> 00:03:56.320
Thumping on you!

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.820
Gong'll have you
beggin' for mercy!

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.386
But that's 'cause
he'll have my help!

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.760
Come now, don't you see

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.726
that you're in no position
to make threats?

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.360
Oh!
Grr!

00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:13.993
Now... I must be going.

00:04:13.993 --> 00:04:15.793
Bye! Whee!

00:04:15.793 --> 00:04:19.193
Hey, hold up!

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:20.360
He got air!

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.426
Leave Dennis to me!

00:04:22.426 --> 00:04:24.560
So we'll chill?

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.726
(Commander)
No, you'll hand
over the girl to us!

00:04:27.526 --> 00:04:30.060
Otherwise, things are
gonna get really bad
for you all.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.493
No way!

00:04:31.493 --> 00:04:33.593
Look, Iggy,
let me go.

00:04:33.593 --> 00:04:35.826
I have to help
protect Zuzu!

00:04:35.826 --> 00:04:38.259
You should think about
helping yourself first!

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.793
Yuya!

00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:42.193
(Gong)
We're not
giving Zuzu up!

00:04:42.193 --> 00:04:46.293
Yeah, you want her,
You're gonna have
to get through us!

00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:48.726
Hmm.
Yuya!

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:49.326
Wha‐‐

00:04:50.693 --> 00:04:52.993
Don't back down to Iggy.
I'll be okay!

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:55.726
Gong and Sylvio are here.

00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:58.093
And I'm ready to
rumble myself!

00:04:58.093 --> 00:05:00.160
Yeah?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.400
Fine then.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.533
C'mon, let's do this, Iggy!

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:08.466
Yah!

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:11.533
I hope you know
what you're doing.

00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:14.100
Yeah, me, too.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.733
And I guess now we're
about to find out!

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.666
(Computer Voice)
Generating
Action Field: CROSSOVER.

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:23.233
(both)
Let's duel!

00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:25.266
I'll go first!

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:28.700
I activate the spell
card Polymerization!

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.833
With it, I'll fuse
Kaiki the Unity Star

00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:33.366
and Hayate
the Earth Star!

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.466
And now from these two...

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:39.000
will come one...

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.733
and will come your
deservingly painful defeat!

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:45.366
I Fusion Summon...

00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:49.000
Idaten the Conqueror Star!

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.433
(grunts)

00:05:51.433 --> 00:05:53.833
He played that
in our last duel!

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:57.666
Then I'll place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.006
You disrespected me
in our last duel,

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:05.940
but I'm the one who will
humiliate you this time.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.073
What happened between
the two of you?

00:06:09.073 --> 00:06:12.206
Iggy was the most
brutal person
in the Championship

00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:14.873
until he faced me.

00:06:14.873 --> 00:06:18.806
I lost control and became
worse than Iggy ever was.

00:06:18.806 --> 00:06:20.940
But that was then.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.040
I draw!

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.540
I set the Pendulum Scale
with with Scale Three
Xiangke Magician

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.440
and Scale Eight
Xiangsheng Magician!

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.940
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.240
I can summon monsters from
Level Four through Level Seven

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.540
all at the same time!

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.306
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:06:40.306 --> 00:06:43.506
Carve the arc of victory!

00:06:43.506 --> 00:06:46.973
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:06:50.673 --> 00:06:53.540
Earn your stripes
Performapal Salutiger!

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.540
Snap to it, Performapal
Whip Snake!

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.273
Drum it up,
Performapal Drummerilla!

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:04.280
Iggy wants payback,
and I don't blame him.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.613
Because I was fueled by rage
and went overboard.

00:07:07.613 --> 00:07:10.313
I can't be like that again,
and I won't!

00:07:10.313 --> 00:07:12.580
As long as I keep
dueltaining!

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.546
Next, I overlay
Salutiger and Whip Snake!

00:07:19.013 --> 00:07:22.213
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective,

00:07:22.213 --> 00:07:24.880
I call upon the most
dangerous of dragons!

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.046
(roars)

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:28.213
I Xyz Summon...

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.546
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.346
Hmph!

00:07:36.346 --> 00:07:38.680
And like in
our first duel,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.580
by using one Overlay Unit,
the attack points

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.446
of your Idaten are
zip‐zapped in half!

00:07:44.446 --> 00:07:46.480
And then Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.113
gets charged up with
those attack points!

00:07:48.113 --> 00:07:52.380
(growls)

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.146
This is how you
beat me last time, but...

00:07:56.146 --> 00:07:58.246
this time will be
very different and all

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:00.613
thanks to
my Fusion Monster!

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:03.420
Since it lost attack points,
I can resurrect

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.820
Kaiki the Unity Star
back from the graveyard!

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.986
Unh!

00:08:08.986 --> 00:08:11.620
Uh, you okay?

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.086
Grr!

00:08:15.086 --> 00:08:17.486
Yeah, no.
Not okay!

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:25.420
You're gonna
fall hard, Yuya,

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.253
and I'm going to
enjoy watching it.

00:08:27.253 --> 00:08:29.686
By paying
500 life points,

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:32.853
Kaiki lets me Fusion Summon
without Polymerization!

00:08:32.853 --> 00:08:34.653
No!
Yes!

00:08:34.653 --> 00:08:37.953
And now that's precisely
what I intend to do, Yuya!

00:08:37.953 --> 00:08:41.220
I fuse Kaiki the Unity Star

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.853
and Idaten
the Conqueror Star!

00:08:43.853 --> 00:08:48.286
So bear witness, Yuya,
as my two monsters combine

00:08:48.286 --> 00:08:51.486
and become legend!

00:08:51.486 --> 00:08:56.320
Show yourself&amp;
Shura the Combat Star!

00:08:59.586 --> 00:09:02.626
Two heads, four arms
but no attack points?

00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:06.060
That's hardly a concern
because with Shura in play,

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.560
the attack points
of all other monsters
on the field become zero!

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.460
You're kidding me.
Ohh!

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.126
No, Yuya, this is
as real as it gets.

00:09:15.126 --> 00:09:16.760
When our monsters battle,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.726
they gain attack points equal
to their level times 200.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:23.193
But your dragon is
an Xyz Monster,

00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:25.460
and Xyz Monsters
don't have Levels.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.926
So from here on out,
its attack points

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:30.260
will be zero!

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.760
In other words,
your dragon's

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.093
just had
its wings clipped.

00:09:34.093 --> 00:09:36.360
Of course,
due to Kaiki's curse,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.326
there's a price
I must pay for utilizing

00:09:38.326 --> 00:09:40.893
these most
magnificent powers.

00:09:40.893 --> 00:09:42.626
When I have
a Fusion Monster,

00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:46.826
I take 500 points of damage
during each of my turns.

00:09:46.826 --> 00:09:49.460
But that's a price
that I'll gladly pay

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.026
because, I'd do anything
to make you suffer as I have!

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:55.760
You don't know what it's
like to hurt every day.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.193
You're wrong.

00:09:57.193 --> 00:09:58.993
I don't think so, Yuya!

00:09:58.993 --> 00:10:01.133
But you will!

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:03.600
Oh, man!
Iggy isn't joking.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.966
He's willing to hurt
himself just to hurt me more.

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:08.366
He's out of control

00:10:08.366 --> 00:10:11.400
like how I was
doing our first duel.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.200
I have to show him
there's a better way

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.666
because I failed to
show him that before.

00:10:15.666 --> 00:10:19.933
I activate
Xiangke Magician's
Pendulum ability!

00:10:19.933 --> 00:10:23.366
It abracadabra's Dark
Rebellion Xyz Dragon's
Rank into a Level!

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.133
(roars)

00:10:37.133 --> 00:10:39.366
So... its level
is so low

00:10:39.366 --> 00:10:41.366
that it can't destroy
Shura anyway!

00:10:41.366 --> 00:10:43.433
Well then it's
a good thing I can use

00:10:43.433 --> 00:10:45.833
Xiangsheng Magician's
Pendulum ability!

00:10:45.833 --> 00:10:47.400
Now Dark Rebellion
Dragon's Level

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.366
becomes the same
as Shura's!

00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:59.200
And now time to tussle!

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.606
Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon,

00:11:01.606 --> 00:11:03.940
attack Shura!

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.306
We'll see about that!

00:11:10.706 --> 00:11:13.406
And now I'll play
Drumerilla's ability!

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:16.940
It drums up my dragon's
attack points by 600!

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.640
(drums thumping)

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.673
No!

00:11:23.673 --> 00:11:27.506
Yaah!

00:11:27.506 --> 00:11:30.773
I play the Action
Spell Choice Choice!

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:32.906
I can choose to prevent
my monster

00:11:32.906 --> 00:11:34.273
from being destroyed

00:11:34.273 --> 00:11:36.706
or cutting the damage
I take in half!

00:11:36.706 --> 00:11:38.840
So I choose to
save my Shura!

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.640
You're gonna hurt
yourself again!

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.240
Unh!

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.106
Now that
the battle's over,

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:49.773
my dragon's power up,
powers down.

00:11:49.773 --> 00:11:52.640
As does Shura's.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.106
So, you through?

00:11:54.106 --> 00:11:56.140
Is that the best
you've got?

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.606
Nah, my best
is way better.

00:11:58.606 --> 00:12:00.580
You just wait.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.780
Sorry, pal,
but now your Level

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.746
changes back
into a Rank.

00:12:04.746 --> 00:12:06.580
My draw!

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.680
(roars)

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.113
(yelling)

00:12:13.113 --> 00:12:17.146
500 points of damage
never felt so good!

00:12:17.146 --> 00:12:20.546
Iggy, you aren't
looking so great.

00:12:20.546 --> 00:12:24.880
Who cares how I look when
such power flows through me!

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.913
Power I'll use to defeat you!

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.913
Ohh!
(maniacal laugh)

00:12:29.913 --> 00:12:33.146
I equip Shura with
Shooting Star Sword!

00:12:33.146 --> 00:12:36.846
So now, when Shura
destroys a lower Level
monster in battle,

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:39.913
Shura can attack again!

00:12:39.913 --> 00:12:40.580
(growls)

00:12:41.413 --> 00:12:43.246
Oh, no!

00:12:43.246 --> 00:12:45.246
Now let's get
to the good part!

00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:48.413
Shura, give Drumerilla
a beat down!

00:12:48.413 --> 00:12:50.680
The only way out of this mess
is to get an Action Card!

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.580
(yelling)

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.846
Unh!

00:12:55.846 --> 00:12:57.613
I'll be taking this!

00:12:57.613 --> 00:13:00.180
And now, due to
Shura's ability,

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.420
our monsters gain
attack points

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.753
equal to their
Level times 200!

00:13:03.753 --> 00:13:05.253
Okay, Drumerilla,

00:13:05.253 --> 00:13:07.653
it's time to drum up
some attack points!

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:09.320
(drums thumping)

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.153
Good thing
I snagged this then!

00:13:11.153 --> 00:13:14.120
The Action Spell
Charge Recklessly!

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.520
It raises Shura's
points by 600!

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.620
(roars)

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.653
(groaning)

00:13:21.653 --> 00:13:24.920
You're looking a little
worse for wear, Yuya,

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.486
and things are only
gonna get worse!

00:13:27.486 --> 00:13:30.786
Since Shura is equipped
with Shooting Star Sword

00:13:30.786 --> 00:13:32.786
it can now attack again!

00:13:32.786 --> 00:13:34.186
And attack it will!

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.620
And while my Shura
gains 2400 attack points,

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.520
your dragon gains none!

00:13:44.986 --> 00:13:50.620
Unh.
(yelling)

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.620
What the‐‐

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.486
Uh, whoa!

00:13:55.486 --> 00:13:57.853
(yelping)

00:13:57.853 --> 00:14:00.693
Ahh! Huh?!

00:14:00.693 --> 00:14:03.393
I play the Action
Spell Restore!

00:14:03.393 --> 00:14:06.326
And even though it won't
help me restore my balance,

00:14:06.326 --> 00:14:09.326
it does restore all of
my dragon's attack points!

00:14:09.326 --> 00:14:10.926
Oh! Whoa! Whoo!

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:15.993
Whoa! It's back
to full power now!

00:14:15.993 --> 00:14:18.093
In that case,

00:14:18.093 --> 00:14:21.293
I play the Action Spell
Double Attack!

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.293
Now Shura's
twice as strong!

00:14:23.293 --> 00:14:26.293
That blade would be
great at dicing up fruit!

00:14:26.293 --> 00:14:29.026
Oh!

00:14:29.026 --> 00:14:31.460
Where's he headed?

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.493
(grunts)

00:14:34.493 --> 00:14:36.360
Hyah!

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.726
All right!

00:14:38.726 --> 00:14:41.060
I activate Evasion,

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.860
so my dragon's able
to dodge your attack!

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.960
Blast it!
Your turn.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.993
Oh, man.
That was a close one.

00:14:50.993 --> 00:14:54.460
Too close.
I'm worried, Yuya.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.726
Me, too.

00:14:55.726 --> 00:14:57.960
And you know what, Yuto?

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.433
It's making me
feel alive!

00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:10.566
Way to duel, Yuya!

00:15:10.566 --> 00:15:13.000
Gong needs you
to focus on
our own battle!

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.133
It's fine.
The guys we're dueling

00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:18.566
are drooling on Yuya's
duel as well!

00:15:18.566 --> 00:15:20.800
Okay, I draw!

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.800
Yes!

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.666
First I'll start by
bringing the beat back

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:28.066
from my Extra Deck!

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:33.133
Nice to see you again,
Drummerilla!

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.833
And I'll add
a little flare

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:36.900
with Performapal
Pyrobster!

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.066
So an ape?
And a lobster?

00:15:40.066 --> 00:15:42.500
Sounds like the beginning
of a bad joke to me.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.800
Next I'll once again
use Xiangke Magician's
Pendulum ability

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.600
to change Dark
Rebellion Xyz Dragon's

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.833
Rank into a Level!

00:15:49.833 --> 00:15:51.733
And just like last time,

00:15:51.733 --> 00:15:54.066
thanks to
Xiangsheng Magician's

00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:56.200
Pendulum ability,
my dragon's Level

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.066
becomes the same
as Shura's!

00:15:58.066 --> 00:16:00.940
Yeah, same move
as last time.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.973
And what good
did it get ya?

00:16:04.973 --> 00:16:07.773
It got me the chance
to do this.

00:16:07.773 --> 00:16:09.973
By using
one Overlay Unit,

00:16:09.973 --> 00:16:11.906
Shura's attack points
are cut in half

00:16:11.906 --> 00:16:13.373
and then my dragon
gains them!

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.740
But half of nothing
is still nothing!

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.273
So your dragon doesn't
gain a thing!

00:16:20.273 --> 00:16:21.940
That's true,

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.840
but I've got
something else planned!

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.973
Something else?

00:16:25.973 --> 00:16:28.573
I now activate
Performapal Pyrobster's

00:16:28.573 --> 00:16:30.240
Pendulum ability!

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.806
It changes Shura's Level

00:16:31.806 --> 00:16:34.006
to the total of the two
Performapals' Levels

00:16:34.006 --> 00:16:35.473
in my graveyard!

00:16:35.473 --> 00:16:36.806
Hmm, I see.

00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:38.573
So you used
an Overlay Unit

00:16:38.573 --> 00:16:40.440
because you needed
another Performapal

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.506
in your graveyard!

00:16:41.506 --> 00:16:42.873
That's right.

00:16:42.873 --> 00:16:44.473
And now
the combined Levels

00:16:44.473 --> 00:16:46.806
of the Performapals
in my graveyard

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:49.906
add up to wait
for it...

00:16:49.906 --> 00:16:53.373
wait for it...

00:16:53.373 --> 00:16:56.340
Eight!

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.840
Grr!

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.813
Now, ladies
and gentleman,

00:17:00.813 --> 00:17:03.513
It's the moment you've
all been waiting for.

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:05.046
It's now showtime!

00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:07.846
Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon attack!

00:17:07.846 --> 00:17:09.846
Due to my Shura's
special ability,

00:17:09.846 --> 00:17:11.680
your Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.446
is 800 attack points
stronger than it now.

00:17:14.446 --> 00:17:15.980
Not just 800!

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.246
Drumerilla's
drum rolling

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:24.313
600 attack points
Dark Rebellion's way!

00:17:24.313 --> 00:17:26.046
Blast!

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:29.780
To survive, I'll need
to find an Action Card!

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.480
But there isn't
one in sight!

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.580
Still I must get my revenge!
I must do something!

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.746
Time for Plan B.
I play a trap!

00:17:39.746 --> 00:17:41.946
Radiance of
the Forbidden Spell!

00:17:41.946 --> 00:17:47.613
But to activate it, I must
pay half my life points!

00:17:47.613 --> 00:17:51.980
Now all open zones
on my field can
no longer be used,

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.546
but my monster gains
800 attack points

00:17:54.546 --> 00:17:57.280
for each of those zones!

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.953
(roars)

00:18:00.953 --> 00:18:04.653
Unh! Ahh!

00:18:04.653 --> 00:18:06.420
And now that
this battle's over,

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.153
all your monsters are
switched to defense mode,

00:18:09.153 --> 00:18:13.353
but my Shura is destroyed.

00:18:13.353 --> 00:18:15.020
You know, Yuya,

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.953
this is about more
than just our last match.

00:18:17.953 --> 00:18:23.420
I doubt that you recall,
but we've crossed paths,

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.086
and I've despised you
ever since!

00:18:26.086 --> 00:18:27.453
Huh?

00:18:27.453 --> 00:18:29.120
It was years ago.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.486
I was headed
to my duel school

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:33.053
when I saw you training.

00:18:33.053 --> 00:18:35.520
you were so happy,
so full of joy

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.086
I was jealous, Yuya!

00:18:38.086 --> 00:18:40.986
But I will be
jealous no more!

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:43.720
Because if I can't have
joy, you can't either!

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.753
But you can have it!

00:18:45.753 --> 00:18:48.420
Your words lie!

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.120
Radiance of the
Forbidden Spell

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.853
has another effect.

00:18:51.853 --> 00:18:53.820
After the battle ends,
we both take damage

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.853
equal to the number
of Monster Zones

00:18:55.853 --> 00:18:58.320
that I can no longer
use times 500.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.620
Say what?!

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.626
That's 2,000 points a piece!

00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:03.093
They'll both lose!

00:19:03.093 --> 00:19:05.293
This is what it's
come to, Yuya!

00:19:05.293 --> 00:19:07.460
If I can't win,

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.360
then neither can you!

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.193
(maniacal laugh)

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:14.493
Iggy!

00:19:14.493 --> 00:19:16.360
Oh! Aah!

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:19.826
Oh! Aah!

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:21.993
Oh!
Yuya!

00:19:22.426 --> 00:19:24.226
No Iggy!

00:19:24.226 --> 00:19:26.393
I'm not going to let it
end like this!

00:19:26.393 --> 00:19:28.560
I activate my trap,
Acrobatic Tower!

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.193
Unh!

00:19:34.193 --> 00:19:34.660
(chuckles)
All right!

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.493
What are you doing?

00:19:42.493 --> 00:19:46.060
You said we take damage
after the battle ends,

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.226
but by playing my trap,

00:19:48.226 --> 00:19:51.160
I'm continuing
the battle!

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.826
Ahh!

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.566
What is that?

00:20:05.566 --> 00:20:08.133
A wobble of wonder,
Acrobatic Tower.

00:20:08.133 --> 00:20:11.833
I took all our monsters
in our graveyards
and fields,

00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:13.733
that's nine of them
if you're counting,

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:15.500
and stacked them up
into a tower!

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.233
Look at those nine balls
balance precariously!

00:20:18.233 --> 00:20:19.733
Don't tip over!

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:21.333
Now comes the fun part.

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:22.966
We both draw two cards
from our deck.

00:20:22.966 --> 00:20:25.266
If either of us
draws a monster card,

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:28.233
we gotta place it on top
of this wobbly tower.

00:20:28.233 --> 00:20:30.633
And if it wobbles
too far and drops
on top of one of us,

00:20:30.633 --> 00:20:32.666
then that
unfortunate fellow

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:35.800
takes 200 points of
damage for each monster!

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.300
So then it all comes down
to these draws.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.200
Sounds like fun.
Let's do it.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.533
On three.

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:45.233
Great!
One, two, three!

00:20:45.233 --> 00:20:46.800
(both)
Draw!

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:51.666
We show our cards

00:20:51.666 --> 00:20:53.400
by sending them
to the graveyard.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.800
All right, it's time.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.106
My first monster
is Performapal Hip Hippo!

00:21:00.106 --> 00:21:03.106
Mine's Hayate
the Earth Star!

00:21:03.106 --> 00:21:06.773
My Hippo's Level Three,
so it's a tiny ball.

00:21:06.773 --> 00:21:09.440
But Hayate's Level Five,
so it's a big ball.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.606
That tower's not
looking too steady.

00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:16.373
Look like's it's
heavy on your end!

00:21:16.373 --> 00:21:19.640
My second monster is
Bit Bite Turtle!

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:25.773
And mine is
Tenma the Sky Star!

00:21:25.773 --> 00:21:29.273
Whoa! The tower's really
movin' and groovin' now!

00:21:29.273 --> 00:21:31.773
I don't see how it can
keep steady and straight!

00:21:31.773 --> 00:21:34.206
All that sway's about
to come into play!

00:21:34.206 --> 00:21:35.840
Uh‐oh!

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.373
Looks like it's
heavier on Iggy's end!

00:21:37.373 --> 00:21:38.773
Uhh!

00:21:38.773 --> 00:21:43.206
So 13 monsters are about
to drop, plop, and pop!

00:21:43.206 --> 00:21:44.940
That's a wrap!

00:21:49.206 --> 00:21:51.006
Ugh.

00:21:51.006 --> 00:21:53.306
I've... failed.
Huh?

00:21:53.306 --> 00:21:55.240
You haven't failed.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.040
You had fun!

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.373
Had fun?

00:21:58.373 --> 00:22:01.580
(cheers and applause)

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.046
And look, everyone
else did, too!

00:22:05.046 --> 00:22:06.646
(cheering grows louder)

00:22:19.646 --> 00:22:21.413
See?

00:22:21.413 --> 00:22:24.013
There's more to
dueling than revenge!

00:22:24.013 --> 00:22:25.780
You may be right.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.446
Huh?

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.646
Thank you.

00:22:32.313 --> 00:22:33.746
Heh heh!

00:22:33.746 --> 00:22:36.346
You did it, Yuya.

00:22:36.346 --> 00:22:39.280
You put on a show
and showed Iggy your smile.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.513
Until we meet
again, friend.
