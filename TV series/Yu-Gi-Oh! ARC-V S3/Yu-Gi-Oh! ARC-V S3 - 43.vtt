WEBVTT

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:04.566
Previously,
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.300
The Standard Dimension
no longer exists.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.666
With Z‐ARC's defeat,
this world has been reborn

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.466
as the Pendulum Dimension,
and as a result,

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.133
all of the Duelists here

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.200
have developed the ability
to Pendulum Summon.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.500
That day transformed everything.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.100
Yuya Sakaki.
Good luck in the tournament!

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.200
(chuckles)
Thank you!

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.433
I'm glad you all made it...

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:30.466
because I've changed the format
of this year's championship.

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.100
You'll be part
of a four‐way Duel.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.400
A battle royal.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.233
It's finally time to kick off

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.266
<i>the Junior Arc League</i>
<i>Championship!</i>

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.000
(all)
Let's do this!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
This is not the first time

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.000
you have dueled each other
like this.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.833
It was in fact during
the ARC League Championship.

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.433
You must remember
or all will be lost.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:51.266
That's why this place
looks familiar.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.000
I've been here before!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.733
There was a Duel going on.

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.600
Some kid named... Sora!

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.300
Oh, yeah!

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.640
Declan selfishly was using
the championship

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.873
to put together
his own fighting force...

00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:05.773
the Lancers!

00:01:05.773 --> 00:01:07.340
(Declan)
<i>Listen up, Moon Shadow.</i>

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.739
Continue the battle.

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:11.173
It may jog more
of their memories.

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:13.340
(Henrietta)
What difference
will it make?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.540
How can they save my dear,
precious Riley?

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.940
If Yuya can't win this Duel,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.406
then he will not be able
to save Riley!

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:24.173
And not just Riley,
Mother.

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:25.873
The entire world will fall.

00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:29.373
Folks, if this attack hits,
Yuya will be one and done,

00:01:29.373 --> 00:01:30.873
<i>and will be</i>
<i>kissing his hopes</i>

00:01:30.873 --> 00:01:34.073
<i>for a pro Dueling career</i>
<i>good‐bye!</i>

00:02:37.646 --> 00:02:40.246
Oh, Riley,
I still can't believe

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:42.546
you've devolved
into a little baby.

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:48.113
Every mother wants to see their
child grow up, not grow down.

00:02:48.113 --> 00:02:51.446
But when you defeated Z‐ARC
and trapped his evil essence

00:02:51.446 --> 00:02:54.813
inside your body,
he did something to you.

00:02:54.813 --> 00:02:58.980
And you haven't smiled
or laughed a day since.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.153
Oh, how I wish
you'd just crack a smile.

00:03:02.153 --> 00:03:04.053
(Moon Shadow)
Over here!

00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:06.920
Turn back!

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.320
There is no escape.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:12.153
Where is Yuya?

00:03:13.753 --> 00:03:17.020
This Action Spell's
just what I needed!

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.553
Miracle protects my Hippo

00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:21.586
and cuts the damage I take
in half!

00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:24.320
Not a bad move,
but I'll do you one better.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.386
'Cause the Trap Card
Abyss Improv

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:28.420
is a real scene stealer!

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.053
Ha!
It lets me pick an Abyss Actor

00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:33.753
that's Level 4 or less
and use its attack points

00:03:33.753 --> 00:03:36.120
to dish out more damage
in this battle!

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.853
No way!

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.586
(Nico)
<i>What a shocker!</i>

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:44.553
<i>Sylvio's teaming up</i>
<i>with Moon Shadow</i>

00:03:44.553 --> 00:03:45.986
<i>to knock Yuya out</i>
<i>of the Duel!</i>

00:03:45.986 --> 00:03:48.386
Gong don't think so!

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:51.386
Gong don't like this not one bit
'cause Gong don't think

00:03:51.386 --> 00:03:53.786
no two‐on‐one's
an honorable way to Duel,

00:03:53.786 --> 00:03:56.286
so Gong's gonna even up
the odds!

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.386
Gong tosses
Superheavy Samurai Helper

00:03:58.386 --> 00:04:02.126
to the Graveyard
to activate its special ability!

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:06.160
Gong can add Superheavy Samurai
Big Benkei's defense points

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.026
to Yuya's Hippo Token
to muscle it up!

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:16.360
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>our free‐for‐all‐brawlers</i>

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.693
<i>are taking sides!</i>

00:04:17.693 --> 00:04:19.693
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:21.960
(growling)
Aah!

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.793
(Nico)
<i>Sylvio sprang his trap</i>

00:04:25.793 --> 00:04:28.226
<i>to help Moon Shadow,</i>
<i>but it backfired,</i>

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.793
<i>and now it's the nimble ninja</i>
<i>Moon Shadow taking a knee!</i>

00:04:33.193 --> 00:04:35.959
(chuckling)
Sorry, that was my bad.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:38.026
Who knew it would've been
much better for you

00:04:38.026 --> 00:04:39.493
if I had kept my trap shut?

00:04:39.493 --> 00:04:41.293
That is all right.

00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:44.160
I am always willing
to give up ground

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.626
if it bring me closer
to my goal.

00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:48.460
(Moon Shadow)
I end my turn.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.860
That was awesome!
Thanks for the rescue.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.293
Don't go thinking
that Gong saved your bacon

00:04:55.293 --> 00:04:57.093
out of kindness.

00:04:57.093 --> 00:04:59.493
Gong's goal is
to Duel you one‐on‐one

00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:01.233
for the championship!

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.266
(chuckles)
Well, then, I guess you and I

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:05.233
are gonna have to team up.

00:05:05.233 --> 00:05:06.200
Right!

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.266
Gong and Yuya
are joining forces

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:12.366
to take down Sylvio
and Moon Shadow!

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:14.733
And just like that,
our melee has mutated

00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:16.333
into a two‐on‐two slugfest!

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:18.933
Gong and Yuya will make
a perfect team.

00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:20.366
And a powerful one,
too!

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:22.433
My goosepickles are pickling!

00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:25.533
Ready or not...

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:26.666
(both)
Here we come!

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:28.100
It's my turn!

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.500
I'll use Scale 1
Stargazer Magician

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.500
and Scale 8 Timegazer Magician

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.200
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:42.000
I'm taking control of this Duel,
starting now!

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:51.033
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:05:51.033 --> 00:05:52.466
all at the same time!

00:05:52.466 --> 00:05:55.266
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:57.200
Carve the arc of victory!

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.773
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:06:03.273 --> 00:06:05.573
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:08.673
(roaring)

00:06:08.673 --> 00:06:10.373
Now, attack!

00:06:10.373 --> 00:06:12.540
Odd‐Eyes,
scorch Curtain Raiser

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.573
with Spiral Flame Strike!

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:16.140
(roaring)

00:06:20.473 --> 00:06:22.473
Oh?

00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:25.673
(thinking)
This reminds me of another
intense Duel I was in...

00:06:25.673 --> 00:06:28.706
only I was riding a motorbike.

00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:30.640
No, that's not it.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.840
It's called a...
Duel Runner.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.073
And it was in...
another dimension?

00:06:37.073 --> 00:06:39.473
Yeah!
The Synchro Dimension!

00:06:39.473 --> 00:06:40.740
Hold on!

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.306
Before your attack hits,

00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:44.540
Curtain Raiser has a surprise
for ya!

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.906
Since it's the only card
on my field,

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.540
Curtain Raiser's attack points
are doubled,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.206
turning its frown upside down!

00:06:55.406 --> 00:06:58.140
Aah!

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.640
Ha!

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.180
You tried torching me
with your precious

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.780
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.646
but due to my quick thinking,
I was barely singed,

00:07:05.646 --> 00:07:08.313
which proves I am the world's
greatest Dueltainer,

00:07:08.313 --> 00:07:10.880
and you're just
a hippo‐hopping hack.
(Yuya)
Oh, really?

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.313
Hip Hippo, it's time for you
to go large and charge!

00:07:15.313 --> 00:07:16.080
(screams)

00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:21.146
(screams)

00:07:24.646 --> 00:07:26.080
(groaning)

00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:30.780
I end my turn.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.913
(thinking)
Hmm, I feel like there was
always someone cheering me on

00:07:33.913 --> 00:07:35.280
when I made awesome plays
like this.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.146
Who was it?

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:42.513
It's scratching at the back
of my head.

00:07:42.513 --> 00:07:45.246
Nice move, Yuya,
just not nice enough.

00:07:45.246 --> 00:07:46.280
C‐plus at best.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.813
Huh?

00:07:47.813 --> 00:07:49.580
You call that Dueltaining?

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.746
Well, I'd say it's more like
drool‐laming.

00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:53.780
I know, I know.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.813
Only a true Dueltainer
can make jokes like these,

00:07:55.813 --> 00:07:57.680
and that Duelist is me!

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.446
So take your circus show back
to Hicksville,

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:03.653
because there's only one true
Dueltainer for this generation,

00:08:03.653 --> 00:08:06.720
and his name's Sylvio,
the best of the best!

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.720
You mean third best...

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.586
behind me and, like,
way, way, way behind my dad.

00:08:12.586 --> 00:08:14.253
He's the best of the best,

00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:17.353
and luckily I inherited all
of his talent!

00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:18.986
Oh?
Then maybe I should put

00:08:18.986 --> 00:08:21.086
your so‐called talent
to the test.

00:08:21.086 --> 00:08:22.953
You're on!
Here goes!

00:08:22.953 --> 00:08:24.986
I draw!

00:08:24.986 --> 00:08:28.353
To start, I'm going to set
the Pendulum Scale

00:08:28.353 --> 00:08:30.886
using my Scale 3
Abyss Actor‐Extras

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:33.520
and Scale 8
Abyss Actor‐Funky Comedian!

00:08:35.153 --> 00:08:38.253
Now I can summon monsters
between Levels 4 and 7

00:08:38.253 --> 00:08:39.986
at the same time.

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:42.053
I Pendulum Summon!

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.386
Center stage,
Abyss Actor‐Superstar!

00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:52.386
And joining it in the spotlight
will be another Curtain Raiser.

00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:56.620
Not so fast!

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.320
I activate the Trap
Dragon's Shadow Performance!

00:09:00.826 --> 00:09:03.493
Watch as I rise like a phoenix!

00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:07.993
Huh?

00:09:07.993 --> 00:09:10.060
(Yuya thinking)
Speaking of phoenixes,

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.560
I remember dueling over...
a special card.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.326
Yeah, my dad's card.

00:09:15.326 --> 00:09:19.760
I feel like my brain's trying
to put together a jigsaw puzzle,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.960
but I don't have all the pieces.

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:25.893
Yo, wake up!

00:09:25.893 --> 00:09:28.226
If you wanna space out,
build a rocket.

00:09:28.226 --> 00:09:32.526
(grunts)
By tributing my Hippo Token...

00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:37.726
I can equip my Hip Hippo
onto Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:40.393
(roaring)

00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:42.160
Well, that was close.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.060
Totally thought my dragon's back
was gonna give out.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.593
Well, it will
when I get through with you.

00:09:47.593 --> 00:09:49.160
Now, then,
let's get back

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.360
to the Sylvio Sawatari
Spectacular!

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.460
Here comes act one.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.960
Funky Comedian's gonna crack you
up with its Pendulum ability!

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.126
By sending
Abyss Actor‐Curtain Raiser

00:10:00.126 --> 00:10:04.200
from my field back
to my Extra Deck...

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.866
my Abyss Actor‐Superstar
gains all

00:10:06.866 --> 00:10:09.033
of Curtain Raiser's
attack points.

00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:16.966
And Superstar has an ability
of its own!

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:19.766
It can draw an Abyss Script
and activate it!

00:10:19.766 --> 00:10:22.100
And this script is...

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.100
none other than
Abyss Script‐Shadow Spirit.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.033
Voila!

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.300
It's time for a wardrobe change,
Superstar!

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.766
(laughing and growling)

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:35.333
And action!

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:38.400
Abyss Actor‐Superstar,
attack Hip Hippo!

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.400
(roaring and laughing)

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.966
You know what?

00:10:42.966 --> 00:10:45.200
I think your monster's role
needs a rewrite.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.766
Abyss Script‐Shadow Spirit

00:10:46.766 --> 00:10:50.066
changes your Hip Hippo's
attack points to become...

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.900
exactly the same as your
pink pal's defense points!

00:10:56.033 --> 00:10:56.966
What?

00:10:59.433 --> 00:11:02.673
<i>Well, I hope Yuya came</i>
<i>prepped with a backup plan,</i>

00:11:02.673 --> 00:11:05.406
<i>'cause if he's showing</i>
<i>all his cards,</i>

00:11:05.406 --> 00:11:07.473
<i>then the kid just dealt</i>
<i>himself a losing hand!</i>

00:11:08.906 --> 00:11:10.040
(screams)

00:11:16.506 --> 00:11:18.506
(whimpering)
Huh?

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.473
Way to work
those nostrils!

00:11:23.206 --> 00:11:25.640
I activate
the Action Spell Encore!

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.640
It lets me re‐use
an Action Spell in my Graveyard!

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.606
Evasion!
Evasion fizzles out your attack!

00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:35.340
(sighing)
That was a close call.

00:11:37.773 --> 00:11:39.906
You are not out
of the woods yet!

00:11:39.906 --> 00:11:42.106
By sending this card
to my Graveyard,

00:11:42.106 --> 00:11:46.173
my Hazy Shuriken deals you
300 more points of damage.

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:48.106
(grunts)

00:11:48.106 --> 00:11:50.573
Aww, man,
I forgot about Moon Shadow.

00:11:50.573 --> 00:11:52.706
I guess that's why ninjas
are sneaky.

00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:55.140
(Skip)
Come on, Skip, think!

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.306
Come on! Come on!
Think, Skip!

00:11:58.306 --> 00:12:00.546
(grunts)
It's no use.

00:12:00.546 --> 00:12:02.713
My mind's like Swiss cheese.

00:12:02.713 --> 00:12:05.646
Hmm?
I know I'm forgetting something.

00:12:05.646 --> 00:12:08.746
Something really,
really important.

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:11.546
Why do I care so much
about this fan?

00:12:11.546 --> 00:12:14.280
Aah!
I just don't know!

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.880
(grumbling)

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.980
I'm just gonna throw this thing
in the closet.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.013
If it's out of my sight,
it's out of my mind.

00:12:24.013 --> 00:12:25.613
(Zuzu)
Dad, stay out of my room!

00:12:25.613 --> 00:12:28.080
Uh, hold on.
Who said that?

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.846
♪♪♪

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:38.913
Wait a minute!
This isn't the closet!

00:12:38.913 --> 00:12:40.180
It's...

00:12:41.813 --> 00:12:43.746
(gasps)

00:12:43.746 --> 00:12:46.646
You may have survived
my opening act,

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:49.013
but get set, Yuya,

00:12:49.013 --> 00:12:51.580
because the second act is where
the real fun kicks in!

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.413
Ha!
Here goes!

00:12:53.413 --> 00:12:55.913
With my spell
Abyss Entertainment,

00:12:55.913 --> 00:12:58.013
by giving up half
my Abyss Actor‐Superstar's

00:12:58.013 --> 00:13:00.653
attack points,
it can attack a second time.

00:13:00.653 --> 00:13:03.320
Looks like your ship
has sailed.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.986
(Yuya)
Yeah!

00:13:04.986 --> 00:13:06.820
We all went
to the Fusion Dimension

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.720
to invade Duel Academy
and rescue our friends.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.053
One friend in particular.

00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:15.320
But who was it?

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.720
Hey, Yuya!
Question!

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.253
How can you Dueltain
when you can't even maintain

00:13:20.253 --> 00:13:21.853
your life points?

00:13:21.853 --> 00:13:25.253
Superstar, take another crack
at Hip Hippo.

00:13:25.253 --> 00:13:27.820
(gasps)
I don't think so!

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.120
Thanks to Dragon's Shadow
Performance,

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.520
my Hip Hippo will now
be shielded from your blast!

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.186
Yeah, but your life points
won't be.

00:13:37.153 --> 00:13:39.186
(grunting)

00:13:43.453 --> 00:13:45.720
(thinking)
Yuya's duelin' like his head's
in the clouds.

00:13:48.186 --> 00:13:50.953
And that brings this act
to a close.

00:13:50.953 --> 00:13:55.320
So my Abyss Actor‐Superstar's
attack points rise back to 3,600

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.320
and the power of Shadow Spirit's
effect also wears off.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.153
(growling)

00:14:00.153 --> 00:14:02.660
(Yuya)
And my monsters
split apart, too.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.426
Sylvio, Moon Shadow,
time for you guys

00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:09.226
to switch your focus
as I bow out

00:14:09.226 --> 00:14:10.626
to give my boy Gong a turn.

00:14:10.626 --> 00:14:12.593
Huh.

00:14:12.593 --> 00:14:15.393
Gong... draws!

00:14:15.393 --> 00:14:17.360
And Gong's gonna
get things started

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.960
by setting the Pendulum Scale

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.526
with Scale 1
Superheavy Samurai Jade

00:14:21.526 --> 00:14:24.460
and Scale 8
Superheavy Samurai Coral!

00:14:25.993 --> 00:14:28.493
Now Gong can summon up
as many monsters

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:31.393
between Levels 2 and 7
as Gong wants!

00:14:31.393 --> 00:14:33.360
And that's just what Gong'll do!

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.393
Gong Pendulum Summons!

00:14:38.393 --> 00:14:42.493
Superheavy Samurai Preparation!

00:14:42.493 --> 00:14:44.693
Gong's gonna grab this Duel
by the horns

00:14:44.693 --> 00:14:47.893
by summoning
Superheavy Samurai Soulhorns!

00:14:51.993 --> 00:14:55.826
Soulhorn's special ability
activates!

00:14:55.826 --> 00:15:01.466
Then Gong equips Soulhorns onto
Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei!

00:15:01.466 --> 00:15:03.366
(Nico)
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

00:15:03.366 --> 00:15:05.866
<i>Pound for pound,</i>
<i>that's the meatiest monster</i>

00:15:05.866 --> 00:15:07.466
<i>on the field, so get</i>
<i>set for some smashing!</i>

00:15:07.466 --> 00:15:08.800
(Skip)
<i>Gimme that mic!</i>

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.800
Wait!
We're on the air, sir!

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.866
That's why I need it!
No way!

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:14.766
Gong just made
his Superheavy Samurai

00:15:14.766 --> 00:15:16.500
even more super!

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.466
There's nothing less lacking

00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:20.266
than a good shellacking
from a monster attacking!

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:21.233
(Skip)
<i>Hey, Yuya!</i>

00:15:21.233 --> 00:15:23.000
So, get ready, folks.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.100
Listen!
It's about Zuzu!

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.600
Huh?

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:36.133
(gasps softly)
This isn't the closet.

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:38.866
This room is Zuzu's.

00:15:38.866 --> 00:15:40.500
My daughter Zuzu.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.600
Oh, yeah, I remember!
Zuzu!

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.533
But why was she kaput
from my noggin?

00:15:45.533 --> 00:15:48.833
All this time and we never
realized she was missing!

00:15:48.833 --> 00:15:50.966
(gasps softly)
Zuzu.

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:53.666
Zuzu?

00:15:53.666 --> 00:15:54.733
Zuzu.

00:15:56.966 --> 00:15:58.366
(thinking)
Of course!

00:15:58.366 --> 00:15:59.906
That's who I was looking for!

00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:02.473
Zuzu.

00:16:02.473 --> 00:16:04.073
She was my best friend.

00:16:04.073 --> 00:16:05.540
How could I ever forget her?

00:16:07.473 --> 00:16:10.540
And the last missing piece
falls into place.

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:17.573
The universe is splitting into
four separate dimensions again.

00:16:17.573 --> 00:16:20.173
Z‐ARC will be reborn
in each dimension,

00:16:20.173 --> 00:16:21.506
restarting the cycle!

00:16:21.506 --> 00:16:23.040
Not on my watch!

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.406
I'm going to seal Z‐ARC away
for good!

00:16:25.406 --> 00:16:27.540
(screaming)

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.406
(Declan)
After Ray's spirit
was forced from Riley's heart,

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:33.340
Riley absorbed Z‐ARC's spirit
instead, sealing him away,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.073
and Yuya was at last freed
from Z‐ARC's control.

00:16:37.073 --> 00:16:39.540
What happened?
Anyone?

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.573
Riley was reborn as an infant‐‐
so innocent,

00:16:45.573 --> 00:16:49.306
yet so very dangerous,
for Z‐ARC's evil lives within.

00:16:49.306 --> 00:16:53.273
Riley hasn't laughed
or smiled since.

00:16:53.273 --> 00:16:55.606
(Henrietta)
It must be Z‐ARC's darkness
that won't allow Riley

00:16:55.606 --> 00:16:58.073
to feel even a moment of joy.

00:16:58.073 --> 00:17:00.913
Yes, and if Z‐ARC's
darkness grows,

00:17:00.913 --> 00:17:03.346
Z‐ARC will return
to threaten the world.

00:17:03.346 --> 00:17:06.546
(Yusho)
Then we must
make Riley smile again.

00:17:06.546 --> 00:17:09.480
And I only know of one Duelist
capable of doing that.

00:17:12.546 --> 00:17:15.480
Looks like Yuya's in sleep mode.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.180
Gong gotta handle this
on Gong's own!

00:17:19.213 --> 00:17:21.246
Superheavy Samurai Preparation,

00:17:21.246 --> 00:17:22.946
it's time to use your ability.

00:17:22.946 --> 00:17:25.480
Gong gives up
a thousand life points,

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.546
so that you can knock off
a thousand attack points off

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:29.180
of one of their monsters.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.146
(whimpering)

00:17:31.146 --> 00:17:34.080
And Gong's picking you,
Abyss Actor Superstar!

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.913
(screams)

00:17:35.913 --> 00:17:39.513
(screaming)

00:17:39.513 --> 00:17:42.380
(grunting)

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.113
What do you say?
Let's do it again!

00:17:45.113 --> 00:17:47.413
(grunting)

00:17:47.413 --> 00:17:50.080
(roaring)

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.913
Gong's still got life points
that Gong can spare!

00:17:53.913 --> 00:17:55.980
(shouting)

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.046
(grunting)

00:17:58.046 --> 00:18:00.420
Superstar!

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.353
Zuzu... it's true.

00:18:04.353 --> 00:18:06.353
I went traveling
across the dimensions

00:18:06.353 --> 00:18:08.986
to track Zuzu down.

00:18:08.986 --> 00:18:11.686
<i>It's time I take</i>
<i>center stage!</i>

00:18:11.686 --> 00:18:13.253
(Zuzu screams)

00:18:13.253 --> 00:18:14.786
(Yuya)
Zuzu!
Yuya!

00:18:14.786 --> 00:18:16.386
Yuya!

00:18:18.986 --> 00:18:22.986
(Yuya thinking)
But every time I found her,
we were always pulled apart.

00:18:22.986 --> 00:18:25.020
Zuzu, it's me!
It's Yuya!

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.853
You have to wake up!

00:18:27.853 --> 00:18:29.520
Yuya?

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.020
Man! Zuzu!
You're really Zuzu!

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.020
It's been like forever!

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.220
(chuckles and gasps)

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.620
Get to attacking, Big Benkei!

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.320
'Cause you can attack even when
you're in defense mode!

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.586
(growling)

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:51.253
(screams and grunts)

00:18:54.186 --> 00:18:55.986
Now that Sylvio's out
of the way,

00:18:55.986 --> 00:18:57.453
you're next, Moon Shadow!

00:18:57.453 --> 00:19:00.193
'Cause my
Superheavy Samurai Soulhorn

00:19:00.193 --> 00:19:04.326
allows Big Benkei to attack
for a second time!

00:19:04.326 --> 00:19:06.293
(growling)

00:19:11.626 --> 00:19:12.593
Aah!

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.926
And I started...
losing control.

00:19:19.926 --> 00:19:24.760
My Odd‐Eyes Raging Dragon
can attack twice in one turn!

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.360
Attack!
Wait, no, stop it!

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.326
Huh?

00:19:29.326 --> 00:19:31.926
Just stop.
I can't see you like this.

00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:33.360
You're dueling out of anger.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.993
Aah!
Odd‐Eyes Raging Dragon, go!

00:19:36.993 --> 00:19:39.593
Attack Pendulum Ruler!

00:19:39.593 --> 00:19:41.826
This isn't you!

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:47.360
Aah!

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.093
Gong's not done, Moon Shadow!

00:19:53.093 --> 00:19:55.793
'Cause you see,
when Gong's on a roll,

00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:57.560
Gong just can't be stopped!

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.566
Since Superheavy Samurai
Big Benkei

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:01.900
destroyed your monster in battle

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.566
by destroying the two cards
in Gong's Pendulum Zone,

00:20:04.566 --> 00:20:07.266
Superheavy Samurai Preservation
allows Big Benkei

00:20:07.266 --> 00:20:08.433
to attack you again!

00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:13.266
Aah!

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.300
Well done.

00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:23.233
Yeah, I lost it.

00:20:23.233 --> 00:20:25.466
Completely.

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:28.800
And from now on, there isn't
any more Dueltaining!

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.533
Only winning!

00:20:30.533 --> 00:20:34.133
You wanted a more brutal Duel,
so I gave it to you!

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.400
Astrograph Sorcerer,
master of time and space...

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.100
I call on you
to use your mystical powers

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.166
to reshape us
into a single unstoppable force!

00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:48.133
I remember.

00:20:57.233 --> 00:20:58.733
(gasps)
No!

00:20:58.733 --> 00:21:00.240
I'm Z‐ARC!
