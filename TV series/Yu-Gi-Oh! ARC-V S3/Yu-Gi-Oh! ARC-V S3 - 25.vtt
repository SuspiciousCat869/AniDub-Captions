WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.933
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.033
You're going to destroy
Duel Academy?

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.666
How can you when
I'm turning you into cards?

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.966
(Sora)
Get out of here!

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.266
(Yuri)
Two traitorous rats
have hit the stage.

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.733
You keep moving!

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.666
Find the Professor
and stop him!

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.000
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.400
So if this card is
your key to victory,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.366
I'll make sure you
never use it.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.133
Fusion Destruction!

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.266
It lets me banish
three Polymerization cards
from your deck,

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.066
and you take 300 points
of damage for each one.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.800
You're about to take
900 points of damage.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.833
(groans)

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.766
You can walk away from here
just like I did,

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.400
and you'll be free.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.966
I've got a better idea.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.633
Why don't I drag you
all the way down with me!

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.733
I Fusion Summon!

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.866
Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem!

00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.340
Eliminate the rest
of her life points!

00:01:02.373 --> 00:01:03.906
(screaming)

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.639
I will keep carding people
in all four dimensions

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:11.940
until I finally stand alone!

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.540
Then the whole universe
will be as perfect as I am!

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.840
(diabolical laughter)

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.606
It's over.

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:19.340
(screaming)

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:23.473
(Yuri)
Oh, Sora. You're up next.

00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:24.840
(student)
That way.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.373
They're holding Zuzu up there
in the lab.

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:27.906
Thank you.

00:01:29.273 --> 00:01:30.906

(thinking)
I have to find Kite.

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:43.880
Sis...

00:02:45.013 --> 00:02:46.713
You just stay here, Shay.

00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:49.046
I'll go find Kite.
I know he'll help!

00:02:55.313 --> 00:02:57.313
(thinking)
Really?

00:02:57.313 --> 00:02:59.113
Which way could he have gone?

00:02:59.113 --> 00:03:00.953
(snickering)

00:03:00.953 --> 00:03:03.220
Aww, poor Lulu.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.420
My little lamb is lost.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.253
Then allow me to help.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.953
(snickering)

00:03:08.953 --> 00:03:11.453
With a little nudge
of your mind.

00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:12.786
(gasps)

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.953
I have...

00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:17.053
to go...

00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:17.786
this way.

00:03:26.153 --> 00:03:28.386
(Yuya)
This has to be the lab.

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:30.553
Zuzu's behind this door.

00:03:30.553 --> 00:03:31.786
Finally.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.786
Hey, Zuzu!

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:44.053
Zuzu?

00:03:44.053 --> 00:03:45.620
You here?

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.286
Just great.
He lied to me.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.620
Huh?

00:03:56.753 --> 00:03:58.786
Zuzu? Zuzu!

00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:04.026
Check your eyes.
Huh?

00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:05.560
That's Lulu.

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:09.126
(Yuya)
You mean Shay's sister?

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:10.526
She's cute.

00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:12.726
I guess she got
the good genes.

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:14.326
(both)
Hey, are you all right, Lulu?

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:16.260
How do you know my name?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.193
I'm Yuya Sakaki.

00:04:18.193 --> 00:04:19.593
Um, okay...

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.493
Look, I'd love
to sit and chat,

00:04:21.493 --> 00:04:23.393
but I'll explain
everything

00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:25.160
once I get you
off this island.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.460
No, I'm not going anywhere
until you help Shay.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.260
What?
Shay's here?

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.026
Like you actually saw him?

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:35.893
Mm‐hmm.
But he's really, really hurt.

00:04:35.893 --> 00:04:37.426
This is bad.

00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:39.559
We have to help him, Yuya.
Hmm.

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.160
Just lead the way, Lulu.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.560
Okay?
Sure.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.326
Oh, she'll be leading you
all right.

00:04:46.326 --> 00:04:48.993
Straight to your demise!

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.360
(gasps)

00:04:55.593 --> 00:04:56.893
What's the holdup?

00:04:57.493 --> 00:04:58.726
Lulu?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.100
Prepare to duel!

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.500
(chuckles)

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:07.600
Lulu?

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.000
It's like she's a totally
different person.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.366
Yeah, you're right, I've never
seen her like this before.

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:14.700
If you refuse to duel me,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.200
then I'll simply turn you
into a card.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.700
I'll bet you hundred to one

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.500
that Duel Academy
scrambled her brain.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.400
Then it's our job
to unscramble it!

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.100
Ha!
I dare you.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.366
Get ready!

00:05:26.366 --> 00:05:27.833
(both)
'Cause together,

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:30.666
we'll break Duel Academy's
control over your mind!

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.866
<i>Generating Action Field:</i>
<i>Crossover.</i>

00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:44.666
(both)
Let's duel!

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm going first!

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.266
Huh?

00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:54.933
These are Yuto's cards.

00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:59.633
He wants me to
play his deck to get
through to Lulu.

00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:00.973
You ready, Yuya?

00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:02.440
Yeah.

00:06:03.373 --> 00:06:06.073
I'll get this show started...

00:06:06.073 --> 00:06:07.773
with three facedowns.

00:06:07.773 --> 00:06:11.440
Three facedown cards without
summoning a single monster?

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.273
I've seen this strategy.

00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:15.473
(Yuto)
Try to remember, Lulu...

00:06:18.173 --> 00:06:19.573
(crowd screaming)

00:06:19.573 --> 00:06:21.240
(man)
We gotta get out of here!

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.440
(screaming continues)

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.640
(grunting)

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.573
(Lulu)
This is wrong.

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:28.940
Teacher always said,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.340
dueling's about keeping the
world entertained and smiling.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.740
It should make people happy,

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.506
bring smiles to kids' faces
and hope for their futures.

00:06:36.506 --> 00:06:37.606
Isn't that right, Saya?

00:06:40.406 --> 00:06:42.906
You know, you said it
yourself, Lulu.

00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:46.040
(both)
We're only supposed to duel
to make people happy.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.306
To give the world hope and joy!

00:06:48.306 --> 00:06:49.306
And you aren't doin' that!

00:06:49.306 --> 00:06:50.740
(quivering)

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.740
(both)
So snap out of it!

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.440
We know this isn't
the real you!

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.340
How do you know, Yuya?

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.180
(both)
'Cause I'm also Yuto!

00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:05.413
(gasps)
Yuto?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.646
Yuto...

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:14.380
No, you're psycho!

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.313
It's my turn!

00:07:16.313 --> 00:07:19.046
When neither one of us have
any monsters on our fields,

00:07:19.046 --> 00:07:21.813
I can summon Lyrilusc
Turquoise Warbler!

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:28.346
And why settle at one monster?

00:07:28.346 --> 00:07:31.880
Turquoise Warbler lets me summon
another Lyrilusc from my hand!

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:35.513
Sapphire Swallow swoops on in,

00:07:35.513 --> 00:07:37.746
giving me two monsters
on my field!

00:07:41.246 --> 00:07:44.513
I overlay Turquoise Warbler
and Sapphire Swallow

00:07:44.513 --> 00:07:46.613
to build the Overlay Network!

00:07:56.746 --> 00:07:59.313
I Xyz Summon!

00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:02.553
Lyrilusc,
Assembled Nightingale!

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.386
This beauty has
two special abilities!

00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:10.753
First, she gains
100 attack points

00:08:10.753 --> 00:08:12.886
for each of her Overlay Units!

00:08:12.886 --> 00:08:15.253
(Yuya and Yuto)
And I know the second.

00:08:15.253 --> 00:08:17.553
She can attack twice
instead of once.

00:08:17.553 --> 00:08:19.953
Correct.
I'm quite surprised

00:08:19.953 --> 00:08:22.553
that you know so much
about this card.

00:08:22.553 --> 00:08:24.986
As if you've seen it before.

00:08:24.986 --> 00:08:26.986
Maybe you really are Yuto.

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:28.320
Either way...

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.786
...here's one card
you've never seen!

00:08:32.786 --> 00:08:34.620
(both gasp)

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.853
My spell card
Parasite Discharge allows me

00:08:37.853 --> 00:08:41.020
to summon a Fusion Parasite
from my deck!

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.320
Ahh!

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.186
Lulu's never
had that monster in her
deck before.

00:08:48.186 --> 00:08:49.553
She does now.

00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:51.420
(laughing)

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.153
Not so predictable
anymore, am I?

00:08:54.153 --> 00:08:57.586
Because I've learned so much
since I came here.

00:08:57.586 --> 00:09:00.460
Like how I can use Fusion
Parasite to Fusion Summon

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.760
without Polymerization!

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.060
No way!

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.193
She can Fusion Summon?

00:09:05.193 --> 00:09:08.793
Watch as I join my Lyrilusc
Assembled Nightingale

00:09:08.793 --> 00:09:12.460
and my Fusion Parasite together!

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.760
From these two will come
a mighty, majestic monster.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.193
Look high to the sky
as I Fusion Summon...

00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:24.426
Lyrilusc Independent
Nightingale!

00:09:30.893 --> 00:09:35.326
Then my pretty Parasite attaches
onto my Nightingale!

00:09:35.326 --> 00:09:38.126
This Fusion Monster
is soooo much better

00:09:38.126 --> 00:09:40.326
than my lame Xyz Monster.

00:09:40.326 --> 00:09:42.326
Because she gains
a level for every one

00:09:42.326 --> 00:09:45.026
of Assembled Nightingale's
Overlay Units!

00:09:45.026 --> 00:09:48.293
Making her Level 3!

00:09:48.293 --> 00:09:51.060
Plus, she gets 500 extra
attack points per level,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.493
raising her to 2,500!

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:56.360
But the best part of all
is that your life points

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.026
take 500 points
of damage per level!

00:09:59.026 --> 00:10:00.200
(gasps)

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:02.700
Haaa...

00:10:05.133 --> 00:10:06.866
(grunting)

00:10:12.566 --> 00:10:15.300
I bet that Parasite card's
messing with her.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.033
Lulu's dueling style
was never this cruel.

00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:19.866
Yeah.
She's quite the charmer.

00:10:19.866 --> 00:10:22.633
(giggling)

00:10:22.633 --> 00:10:24.300
Let's crush that gnat!

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.233
And Lulu will be back
to normal.

00:10:26.233 --> 00:10:28.166
Time to put the pest
to rest!

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:29.366
(Shay)
It won't work.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.366
(Yuya)
Shay!

00:10:37.133 --> 00:10:39.700
(both)
Are you okay?

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.566
Destroying Fusion Parasite
isn't enough to save her.

00:10:49.266 --> 00:10:51.866
Who invited
that lollygagger?

00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:01.206
(giggling)

00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:04.373
I had the exact
same idea as you.

00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:07.640
So I destroyed that Parasite
in our duel.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.740
Lulu, are you okay?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.940
You must keep attacking.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.140
(Shay, thinking)
She seemed back to the Lulu
I know and love.

00:11:17.306 --> 00:11:18.773
But look...

00:11:18.773 --> 00:11:20.706
It didn't last.

00:11:20.706 --> 00:11:23.906
(both)
Then tell us what we can do
to make it stick.

00:11:23.906 --> 00:11:26.240
By getting to the root
of the problem.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.940
The Professor must
hold the cure.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.106
It's our only chance.

00:11:31.106 --> 00:11:33.273
I hope I'm not interrupting...

00:11:33.273 --> 00:11:35.706
but it still happens
to be my turn!

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:37.006
Huh?
Huh?

00:11:37.006 --> 00:11:38.706
Let's fight!

00:11:38.706 --> 00:11:41.673
Lyrilusc Independent
Nightingale...

00:11:41.673 --> 00:11:45.306
Attack him directly and blast
the rest of his life points!

00:11:48.906 --> 00:11:50.340
Not when I have my trap cards!

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.940
The Phantom Knights
of Lost Vambrace!

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.040
These two traps will
prevent you from destroying

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.840
any of our monsters
this turn.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.580
And they also each lower
your Nightingale's attack points

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.413
by 600.

00:12:03.413 --> 00:12:06.513
So your bird's wings
are clipped by 1,200.

00:12:08.946 --> 00:12:12.846
And these cards aren't only
traps, they're also monsters!

00:12:12.846 --> 00:12:15.246
Ready to step in the way
of your Nightingale!

00:12:22.713 --> 00:12:24.380
Big deal!

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.246
They only have
600 attack points!

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.713
You still take damage, Yuya.

00:12:29.713 --> 00:12:32.080
(screaming)

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.380
Well, at least he survived.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.313
(grunting)

00:12:37.313 --> 00:12:40.413
Hey, Shay, you gotta give me
more credit than that.

00:12:40.413 --> 00:12:42.713
You sound like
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:12:42.713 --> 00:12:43.746
Watch this!

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.046
Since I took damage,

00:12:48.046 --> 00:12:50.680
The Phantom Knight's
Twin Medals...

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.746
(both)
...lets us use our two Phantom
Knights to Xyz Summon!

00:12:53.746 --> 00:12:56.046
Oh, no!
An Xyz Summon?!

00:12:57.346 --> 00:13:00.086
Your attack helped us
much more than it hurt!

00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:02.020
Here we go!

00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:07.886
(Yuya)
We use two Phantom Knights
to build the Overlay Network!

00:13:10.286 --> 00:13:13.186
Presenting a warrior
who's bad to the bone!

00:13:16.686 --> 00:13:18.220
We Xyz Summon!

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.253
The Phantom Knights
of Cursed Javelin!

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.086
Well done!

00:13:26.086 --> 00:13:27.820
My Knight's effect's
gonna take the sails

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.753
out of your Nightingale.

00:13:29.753 --> 00:13:34.020
By using one Overlay Unit,
his javelin not only blasts away

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.786
your Nightingale's
special abilities,

00:13:35.786 --> 00:13:37.686
but all her attack points, too!

00:13:45.186 --> 00:13:46.253
(deep sigh)

00:13:48.186 --> 00:13:51.686
This is nothing more
than a temporary setback!

00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:52.853
I end my turn!

00:13:52.853 --> 00:13:55.086
Yuya, I hate to dash...

00:13:55.086 --> 00:13:56.853
but if you got things
under control here,

00:13:56.853 --> 00:13:58.520
I'm going after
the Professor.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.626
Go.

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:04.660
(both gasp)

00:14:06.493 --> 00:14:07.926
(thud)

00:14:09.293 --> 00:14:10.960
Celina?!

00:14:14.426 --> 00:14:17.326
Looks like your brain's
still bamboozled, too.

00:14:18.826 --> 00:14:21.893
Yuya and Yuto,
how chivalrous

00:14:21.893 --> 00:14:23.826
that you were dueling
two‐on‐one.

00:14:23.826 --> 00:14:26.093
It's only fair
to even up the sides.

00:14:26.093 --> 00:14:28.960
<i>Intrusion penalty:</i>
<i>2,000 life points.</i>

00:14:31.093 --> 00:14:33.726
What does Duel Academy
know about fair?

00:14:33.726 --> 00:14:36.193
(Doctor snickering)

00:14:36.193 --> 00:14:39.160
At last, the real fun
is about to begin.

00:14:44.726 --> 00:14:46.126
(Doctor snickering)

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.460
It's my turn.

00:14:50.226 --> 00:14:54.126
I'll begin by summoning
my Fusion Parasite.

00:14:57.826 --> 00:15:00.366
That bug again!
Yeah.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:02.600
And I follow that up
by activating

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.766
my spell Parasite Factory.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.900
(gasps)
It can't be...

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.066
Those look like... eggs.

00:15:14.066 --> 00:15:15.500
Thousands of them.

00:15:18.033 --> 00:15:22.366
(Doctor)
Yes! To hatch more parasites!

00:15:22.366 --> 00:15:23.900
(snickering)

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.066
I'm borrowing
your monster, Lulu.

00:15:28.066 --> 00:15:31.000
Of course.
Anything it takes to win.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.266
With the power of my Parasite
Factory, I can send my Fusion

00:15:35.266 --> 00:15:39.600
Parasite and Lulu's infected
monster to the graveyard

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.900
in order to Fusion Summon.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
You could barely handle
my baby insects.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.866
See how you fare
against their ruler.

00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:54.066
I Fusion Summon!

00:15:55.333 --> 00:15:58.866
The mighty monarch,
Parasite Queen!

00:16:02.573 --> 00:16:04.873
Yes, I've done it!

00:16:04.873 --> 00:16:06.740
No one has ever reached
my heights of evolution

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.806
and scientific achievement!

00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:11.673
Now destroy him,
my lovely!

00:16:11.673 --> 00:16:14.473
(diabolical laughter)

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.173
(both gasp)

00:16:16.173 --> 00:16:19.806
The two Fusion Parasites
that went to the graveyard

00:16:19.806 --> 00:16:22.173
are equipped
onto my Queen instead,

00:16:22.173 --> 00:16:25.540
infusing her body with 300
additional attack points each.

00:16:32.673 --> 00:16:34.906
None of that is gonna
help you out, Celina!

00:16:34.906 --> 00:16:37.973
By using Cursed Javelin's
Overlay Unit,

00:16:37.973 --> 00:16:40.440
your Queen loses
all her attack points!

00:16:44.573 --> 00:16:45.873
You're not taking her crown.

00:16:45.873 --> 00:16:48.006
Parasite Factory
shields my Queen

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:49.240
from your special abilities.

00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:56.540
No! She still has
all her attack points!

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.673
Brace yourself,
Yuya!

00:16:57.673 --> 00:16:59.640
Here goes.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.846
My royal highness,
say a quick good night

00:17:01.846 --> 00:17:02.980
to his Phantom Knight.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.780
(screaming)

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.313
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.046
Heh. You stand no chance
against Duel Academy's best.

00:17:25.046 --> 00:17:26.813
But wait,

00:17:26.813 --> 00:17:29.080
you're not on Duel Academy's
side anymore, Celina.

00:17:30.313 --> 00:17:31.980
Remember?

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.313
You left them
and joined us to be free.

00:17:34.313 --> 00:17:36.113
But I am free.

00:17:36.113 --> 00:17:37.746
(gasps)

00:17:37.746 --> 00:17:40.580
Free to follow
the Professor's orders.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.280
You gotta be kidding!

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.246
You see those?

00:17:44.246 --> 00:17:48.246
Those eggs were created by
the Professor's right‐hand man.

00:17:48.246 --> 00:17:49.246
The Doctor.

00:17:49.246 --> 00:17:51.080
The Doctor?

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.880
And they'll all hatch
into lovely parasites.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.680
"Lovely" and "parasite" don't
go in the same sentence.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.353
And in fact...

00:18:00.353 --> 00:18:02.053
I got one right here.

00:18:02.053 --> 00:18:02.720
No way!

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.653
So it's not the Parasite card
that's controlling her.

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:09.953
It's an actual parasite
in her brain.

00:18:09.953 --> 00:18:11.420
And Yuya?

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.786
Zuzu's been infected, too.

00:18:13.786 --> 00:18:16.220
Huh? Zuzu...

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.886
Oh, no!

00:18:21.953 --> 00:18:24.353
Zuzu... no.

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:25.553
(giggles)

00:18:25.553 --> 00:18:28.286
Why do you look
so sad?

00:18:28.286 --> 00:18:31.220
The Doctor freed us to hurt
anyone whenever we like.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.786
You should be happy.

00:18:33.786 --> 00:18:35.886
Join us, Yuya.

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:37.653
And the joy you'll feel
when you crush your foe‐‐

00:18:37.653 --> 00:18:38.186
(Yuya)
Never!

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:43.353
What kind of monster
would harm Zuzu?!

00:18:43.353 --> 00:18:45.586
(screaming)

00:18:47.686 --> 00:18:51.286
Yuya!
Get a grip! Yuya!

00:18:51.286 --> 00:18:53.820
(growls)
Yuya!

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.820
You're not the only one
who's upset.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.886
And I'll do
something about it.

00:19:11.326 --> 00:19:13.160
(both gasping)

00:19:18.193 --> 00:19:19.826
Yuto?

00:19:21.993 --> 00:19:24.160
I sense there's something
different about him now.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.626
The other one
must have taken over.

00:19:27.893 --> 00:19:29.493
Now it's my turn!

00:19:29.493 --> 00:19:31.426
And I'll kick this off

00:19:31.426 --> 00:19:36.026
by activating The Phantom
Knights' Rank‐Up‐Magic Burial!

00:19:36.026 --> 00:19:39.393
This spell allows me to summon
a Phantom Knight Xyz Monster

00:19:39.393 --> 00:19:39.993
from my graveyard.

00:19:41.526 --> 00:19:45.826
Rise from the ashes, The Phantom
Knights of Cursed Javelin!

00:19:50.493 --> 00:19:51.826
Lulu...

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:59.566
(giggles)
Ahh...

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:01.333
That girl's amazing.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.266
My sis has skills.

00:20:03.266 --> 00:20:05.400
And looks.
(gasps)

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.433
You must be Yuto.
Shay raves about you.

00:20:10.433 --> 00:20:11.766
Uh, uh...

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.633
Then Rank‐Up‐Magic Burial
lets me tribute

00:20:18.633 --> 00:20:20.633
The Phantom Knights
Of Cursed Javelin

00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:25.100
to summon a monster that's two
ranks higher from my extra deck.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.866
I Xyz Summon!

00:20:26.866 --> 00:20:30.800
Hmm, your Lyrilusc deck
is technically solid.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.233
Build it yourself?

00:20:32.233 --> 00:20:34.300
Of course.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.166
When I play those cards,
I also feel like I'm soaring

00:20:37.166 --> 00:20:39.133
through the sky and singing
through the wind.

00:20:39.133 --> 00:20:39.633
(chuckles)
Corny, right?

00:20:41.433 --> 00:20:43.900
(Yuto)
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective...

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.633
I call upon the most dangerous
of Dragons!

00:20:48.633 --> 00:20:51.600
Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.533
After a whole day of dueling,
I'm completely wiped out.

00:20:54.533 --> 00:20:56.400
I could use a nap.

00:21:01.406 --> 00:21:03.840
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.706
Take this duel
to the next level!

00:21:12.273 --> 00:21:13.706
(growls)

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:15.540
Lulu...

00:21:16.673 --> 00:21:18.973
I didn't travel
through dimensions

00:21:18.973 --> 00:21:20.640
to leave empty‐handed.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.673
Yeah!
Neither did I!

00:21:22.673 --> 00:21:25.306
I won't be stopped this close
to the end!

00:21:25.306 --> 00:21:27.473
Especially by a bug!

00:21:27.473 --> 00:21:30.406
Lulu, Celina, Rin...
...and Zuzu!

00:21:30.406 --> 00:21:31.706
(both)
They're coming with us!

00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:33.506
(snickering)

00:21:33.506 --> 00:21:36.073
The only thing coming
is your defeat, Yuya...

00:21:36.073 --> 00:21:39.573
in front of those
you seek to rescue!

00:21:39.573 --> 00:21:41.940
(diabolical laughter)
