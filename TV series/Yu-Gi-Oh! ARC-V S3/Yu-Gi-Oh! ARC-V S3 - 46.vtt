WEBVTT

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.200
Wha?!

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.333
It'’’s Duel Academy!

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.033
Oh!

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.266
(Yuya)
Oh, man...

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.566
I feel so bad...

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.000
I wish I could go back
and change everything,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.133
fix it so this never happened...

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.566
but I can'’’t.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.200
All this destruction...

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.533
all this devastation...

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.566
It'’’s all my fault...

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.533
Yuya!
Sora?

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.600
Hurry!

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.000
This way!
Uh...

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.533
Uh, well,
hello to you too.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.733
So like, what'’’s the big rush?

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.500
You gotta help Shay!
C'mon!

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.000
Open up!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Easy, Shay...
You'll hurt yourself.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.800
So what?
All that matters is my sister!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.933
Open up, Leo!

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:01.980
Let me in, Leo!

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.713
I know you'’’re worried
about your sister,

00:02:03.713 --> 00:02:05.580
but I'm more worried
about your knuckles

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.480
if you keep pounding
like that.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.246
You can't get in
the Professor's lab

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:09.913
without using
that hand scanner.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.746
Last I heard, Shay was looking
for his sister Lulu.

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:17.379
Yeah, that'’’s right...

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.946
And he thinks
the Professor's the only one

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:20.546
who can help him
find her.

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.580
Then buzz me
in Alexis!

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.113
Don'’’t make me
ask twice!

00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:26.246
(Yuya)
Shay!

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.580
Yuya!
Listen, Shay...

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.380
Your sister'’’s not
the only one who'’’s missing.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.580
What?

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.046
Yeah, that'’’s right.
Zuzu's missing, too.

00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:38.780
How can that be?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.413
I know how you feel.

00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:42.880
My brain was
scrambled as well.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.080
It all goes back to the
Professor'’’s daughter Ray.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.480
When she sacrificed herself
to defeat Z‐ARC,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.313
the universe was split
into four separate dimensions.

00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:54.580
And so was Ray.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.946
Into Zuzu, Rin, Celina,
and your sister Lulu.

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:03.953
You'’’re saying Lulu
was some sort of clone?

00:03:03.953 --> 00:03:06.786
Then how come I remember
teaching her how to duel?

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:08.620
Taking her to her
first tournament?

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.386
You'’’re trying to tell me that
everything I remember is a lie?

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:14.920
Well, maybe.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.420
I'’’m not exactly sure
I get it myself.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.886
All I know is that I have
memories of Zuzu,

00:03:19.886 --> 00:03:22.220
and the bruises
to prove it.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.453
This may sound crazy,
but hear me out.

00:03:25.453 --> 00:03:28.353
Maybe when Ray was
split apart into four,

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:30.620
the four girls reverted...
to babies.

00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:35.153
Because I think that'’’s what
happened to Riley.

00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:39.553
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it'’’s plausible, right?

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.586
Not at all.

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:43.386
Well, then you got a better
explanation smarty pants?

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:45.486
No, Yuya.

00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:48.386
But the man with all the answers
is behind this door.

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:49.620
(sighs)

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.853
We'’’re getting nowhere.

00:03:50.853 --> 00:03:52.453
Just let him in.

00:03:52.453 --> 00:03:54.586
If you say so.

00:03:54.586 --> 00:03:57.520
But Shay,
you've got to remember

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.720
that we were only
trying to protect you.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.553
(scanner trills)

00:04:01.126 --> 00:04:03.026
I know you have a lot
of questions,

00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:04.593
but you might
not like the answers.

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:14.026
It'’’s the Professor.

00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:16.126
(computer trills)

00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:17.693
Ah!

00:04:17.693 --> 00:04:19.360
I found her!

00:04:23.893 --> 00:04:26.793
Is that Ray?

00:04:26.793 --> 00:04:28.226
Perhaps...

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.726
But then again,
perhaps it is not.

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:33.393
I'’’m afraid nothing
is ever that simple.

00:04:33.393 --> 00:04:35.659
Things have changed
this time around.

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.493
For you see...

00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:41.160
Yuto, Yugo and Yuri
have not reappeared

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.260
in each dimension.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.593
After Z‐ARC'’’s defeat,
only Yuya remains.

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:47.760
(gasps)

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.426
(Yuya)
Yuto...

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:54.393
Yugo...

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:55.793
Yuri...

00:04:55.793 --> 00:04:58.060
The others are gone.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.360
It's as if the universe has
decided that those three

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.466
individuals are
no longer needed,

00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:04.733
erasing them from existence.

00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:07.900
So that would mean Celina,
Lulu and Rin,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.600
they've all been wiped off the
face of the universe as well,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.166
so they'’’re gone?

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.233
That is precisely
what I believe.

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:15.300
If this girl is to revive,
as with Yuya,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.166
only one will remain.

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:19.600
Zuzu Boyle.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.233
That is so not cool.

00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:24.400
You'’’re saying
my sister'’’s gone?

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.033
I don'’’t believe you!

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.066
Bring Lulu back!
Or you'll be sorry!

00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:33.733
As I said before,
that isn'’’t up to me.

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.900
Even with all my technology,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.166
the impossible
remains impossible.

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:39.533
Well, I don'’’t accept
that answer!

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:43.400
Come on!

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.000
Just save her!

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Come on!

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.466
Shay, no!

00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:49.833
Listen, Shay...

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:52.033
I understand how you feel,

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:54.200
because I feel
the same way.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.933
It'’’s true.

00:05:57.366 --> 00:06:00.606
As much as you loved your
sister, I loved my daughter Ray.

00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:07.406
But when she was taken from me,
separated into each dimension,

00:06:07.406 --> 00:06:10.706
as much joy as it
brought everyone,

00:06:10.706 --> 00:06:14.940
twice as much
heartache was brought to me.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.873
And now knowing that Ray won't
be coming back this time,

00:06:17.873 --> 00:06:20.640
it is not easy
to live with.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.640
But live with it I must,
and so must you.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.673
(growls)

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:28.606
You'’’re right...

00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:30.640
It isn'’’t fair.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.440
It doesn'’’t mean
I'’’m not furious though.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.506
It'’’s all your fault.

00:06:39.506 --> 00:06:41.606
None of this would have happened
if you didn'’’t turn into Z‐ARC.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.040
Yuya...

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.706
Lulu and Yuto are no longer
here because of you.

00:06:50.706 --> 00:06:52.106
Therefore...

00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:54.606
I will now get my revenge!

00:06:54.606 --> 00:06:58.140
Look, Shay‐‐
I haven't finished yet!

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.346
Yuya, you may
be my friend,

00:07:01.346 --> 00:07:04.546
But with every bone in my body,
I wish I had never met you.

00:07:04.546 --> 00:07:06.246
Oh, brother.

00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:08.080
He should write
greeting cards for a living.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.613
Shay'’’s just upset.

00:07:09.613 --> 00:07:11.413
He doesn'’’t really mean it.

00:07:11.413 --> 00:07:14.313
Well, at least
I hope he doesn'’’t.

00:07:14.313 --> 00:07:17.446
'’’Cause if he does, Yuya could be
in a world of hurt.

00:07:17.446 --> 00:07:21.146
When Shay'’’s on his game,
he'’’s unstoppable.

00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:23.513
You ready?

00:07:23.513 --> 00:07:27.013
If you'’’re looking for mercy,
mercy has left the building!

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:29.480
Fine then.
Let's go!

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.646
(electronic voice)
Generating Action
Field Crossover!

00:07:32.646 --> 00:07:34.313
Let'’’s duel!
Let's duel!

00:07:34.313 --> 00:07:36.446
I'm starting things off, Yuya!

00:07:36.446 --> 00:07:38.313
Bring it!

00:07:38.313 --> 00:07:40.313
First I summon forth...

00:07:40.313 --> 00:07:42.546
Raidraptor Rudder Strix
from my hand!

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.380
And when Rudder Strix takes
to the skies,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.646
you take 300 points
of damage right off the bat!

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.113
I'’’ll stop it with this!

00:07:58.113 --> 00:07:59.913
You'’’re stopping nothing!

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:02.686
I activate...
my spell No Action,

00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:04.186
so your Action Spell
is destroyed!

00:08:04.186 --> 00:08:05.786
Ugh.

00:08:08.286 --> 00:08:10.420
No wasting time
for these two!

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.720
No kidding.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.753
They came ready to play!

00:08:13.753 --> 00:08:17.053
I place this card facedown
and end my turn.

00:08:17.053 --> 00:08:18.520
Then I'’’m up!

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.953
I set the Pendulum Scale

00:08:20.953 --> 00:08:23.853
with Scale 3 Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Light Phoenix

00:08:23.853 --> 00:08:26.786
and Scale 8 Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Unicorn!

00:08:26.786 --> 00:08:28.720
I'’’m taking control of this
duel starting now!

00:08:35.553 --> 00:08:37.920
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 4 through 7

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.820
all at the same time!

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.053
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:08:42.053 --> 00:08:45.520
Carve the arc of victory!

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.686
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:08:51.586 --> 00:08:53.486
Work your wizardry
Xiangsheng Magician!

00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:57.253
Turn up the heat Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:00.326
(roars)

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.726
Xiangsheng Magician,
time to take aim!

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:07.560
And fire your mystical bow
at Odd‐Eyes!

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.426
Syphon its strength so that your
attack points become the same!

00:09:11.993 --> 00:09:15.160
Odd‐Eyes, attack Shay'’’s monster!

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.426
Bring this duel to a close
before it begins!

00:09:29.026 --> 00:09:32.693
I activate the trap
Raidraptor Risky Flight!

00:09:32.693 --> 00:09:34.893
Not only does it protect
my Rudder Strix

00:09:34.893 --> 00:09:37.460
and cut the damage
I take in half,

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.160
but you can'’’t attack
for the rest of the turn!

00:09:44.893 --> 00:09:47.926
And whenever you attack
my Rudder Strix,

00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:49.860
I'’’m allowed to summon...

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.960
Two more Rudder Strix
to join up with my flock!

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.693
And then exactly like before
Yuya, you take 300 points

00:09:59.693 --> 00:10:01.700
of damage for each one!

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.900
Oh!

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.500
Whoa!

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.700
Yuya didn't have a chance
to find an Action Card

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.233
to save him that time.

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:13.800
And boy did he pay
the price!

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.166
Since I'm not allowed to attack
for the rest of this turn,

00:10:16.166 --> 00:10:18.933
it looks like Xiangsheng
Magician's power boost

00:10:18.933 --> 00:10:20.200
is going to waste.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.900
That'’’s it for me.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.033
It'’’s my turn!

00:10:26.033 --> 00:10:28.533
And I'll Overlay my three
Raidraptors in order to build

00:10:28.533 --> 00:10:29.900
the Overlay Network...

00:10:35.833 --> 00:10:39.800
From the shadows, the falcon
soars on wings of courage,

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.866
talons ready
for the rebellion!

00:10:42.866 --> 00:10:45.033
I Xyz Summon...

00:10:45.033 --> 00:10:47.500
Take flight!

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.566
Raidraptor Rise Falcon!

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.900
(roars)

00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:55.966
And this is just
the beginning!

00:10:55.966 --> 00:10:59.733
By using one Overlay Unit, Rise
Falcon gains the attack points

00:10:59.733 --> 00:11:01.840
of every monster
on your field!

00:11:11.473 --> 00:11:14.673
And then, it'’’s allowed to attack
both of your monsters!

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:16.273
(roars)

00:11:16.273 --> 00:11:18.840
Starting with Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:11:21.173 --> 00:11:22.340
(grunts)

00:11:25.673 --> 00:11:28.606
One down,
Xiangsheng Magician to go!

00:11:28.606 --> 00:11:31.640
I play the Action Spell Miracle!

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.606
Now Xiangsheng Magician
is safe!

00:11:33.606 --> 00:11:35.540
And I only take
half the damage!

00:11:37.073 --> 00:11:38.740
Don't think so,

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.873
because I just picked up
the Action Spell Encore,

00:11:41.873 --> 00:11:44.506
letting me re‐play an Action
Card in my graveyard!

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:47.173
No Action!

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:50.006
(gasps)

00:11:50.006 --> 00:11:51.973
You'’’re wise to run,
because now,

00:11:51.973 --> 00:11:56.540
it looks like you'’’re
all out of miracles!

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.940
I think Encore deserves
an Encore!

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.480
Which I'’’ll use
to re‐play Miracle!

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.446
What?

00:12:03.446 --> 00:12:05.913
So let'’’s hit the rewind button
on this duel.

00:12:05.913 --> 00:12:08.013
Xiangsheng Magician
can'’’t be destroyed,

00:12:08.013 --> 00:12:10.246
and all damage
is cut in half!

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:12.980
(grunts)

00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:17.780
Action Cards are really
in play this duel...

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.046
And Yuya seems to be playing
them just a bit better.

00:12:21.046 --> 00:12:22.946
You sure about that?

00:12:22.946 --> 00:12:25.013
He'’’s the one that
just took damage.

00:12:25.013 --> 00:12:26.546
(Sora)
I'’’d say Shay knows
what he'’’s doing.

00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:31.980
If this is the best you can do,
it isn'’’t gonna be enough.

00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:39.313
Shay'’’s totally crushing him
in the life point department.

00:12:39.313 --> 00:12:41.180
Yuya has 1,200...

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.346
Yeah, and Shay has more
than double that!

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:46.280
(Shay)
I'’’ve got Yuya just
where I want him...

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.746
Here I go!

00:12:51.746 --> 00:12:54.413
And first up, since I've already
got my Pendulum Scale prepped,

00:12:54.413 --> 00:12:56.513
primed and ready to go,

00:12:56.513 --> 00:12:59.720
my monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.753
Bring balance to this battle,
Balance Magician!

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:09.053
And welcome back Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:13:09.053 --> 00:13:10.720
(roars)

00:13:12.553 --> 00:13:14.553
(Shay)
Two Level 4 monsters...

00:13:14.553 --> 00:13:17.220
This is when he always plays
Yuto'’’s Dark Rebellion.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.986
And now...

00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:21.020
My Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon
is gonna attack...

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.986
Take out
Raid Raptor‐Rise Falcon!

00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:25.086
Go!

00:13:25.086 --> 00:13:27.520
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.020
I activate the spell Rank‐Up‐
Magic Battle Up Force!

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.920
Now, since you attacked me,
I can Xyz Summon a monster

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.153
that's two Ranks higher
than my Rise Falcon!

00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:52.886
Thanks for the assist!

00:13:52.886 --> 00:13:56.953
Fiercest falcon, set your wings
ablaze and lock your gaze

00:13:56.953 --> 00:13:58.820
on our ill‐fated foe!

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.226
Now, make it so!

00:14:01.226 --> 00:14:04.693
Go Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:14:04.693 --> 00:14:08.460
Emerge, Raidraptor
Revolution Falcon!

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.793
(Shay)
Revolution Falcon's special
ability will automatically

00:14:14.793 --> 00:14:19.026
destroy Yuya's Odd‐Eyes and deal
him damage equal to half

00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:21.126
its attack points.

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:23.926
Which means this duel is mine...

00:14:23.926 --> 00:14:25.726
And I get my revenge!

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.760
Revolution Falcon!
End this duel!

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.726
Not so fast, Shay!
Watch!

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.093
Balance Magician, bring some
balance to this battle!

00:14:41.093 --> 00:14:42.826
Your monster
and one of my monsters

00:14:42.826 --> 00:14:45.293
each lose 1,000
attack points!

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.260
(Shay)
Revolution Falcon, bombs away!

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.593
Odd‐Eyes is destroyed,
and you take damage

00:14:52.593 --> 00:14:54.826
equal to half
its attack points.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.060
Then I'’’m glad I lowered
its attack points.

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.866
But things are about
to get even better,

00:15:02.866 --> 00:15:05.000
'cause when you destroy
Odd‐Eyes,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.700
I can tribute two monsters to
summon an even greater dragon!

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:14.533
My Odd‐Eyes... evolves...
into...

00:15:14.533 --> 00:15:16.333
Odd‐Eyes Lancer Dragon!

00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:18.466
(roars)

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.500
Are all those blades
supposed to scare me?

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.400
Go ahead and attack.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.366
My Falcon can use
its ability...

00:15:27.366 --> 00:15:29.566
to lower Odd‐Eyes Lancer
Dragon's attack

00:15:29.566 --> 00:15:31.233
and defense points to zero!

00:15:31.233 --> 00:15:33.300
Oh, no, it can'’’t!

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.400
Because Lancer Dragon
has an ability of its own!

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.000
By sending one Odd‐Eyes
in my deck to the graveyard,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.933
your Revolution Falcon can'’’t
use its special abilities!

00:15:43.933 --> 00:15:45.633
(growls)

00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:47.300
So now...

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.166
Odd‐Eyes Lancer Dragon...

00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:50.533
Let'’’s do this!

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.500
Time to take names
and kick butt!

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.833
Go!
Attack Revolution Falcon!

00:16:01.273 --> 00:16:03.573
I activate Evasion!

00:16:03.573 --> 00:16:06.240
Sorry but I'’’m afraid
that'’’s a no can do!

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.540
My Lancer Dragon prevents you
from playing any spells!

00:16:17.406 --> 00:16:19.740
That sure did a number
on Shay'’’s life points!

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.140
Uh‐huh, it'’’s anybody'’’s
game now, Sora.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.473
(growling)

00:16:24.473 --> 00:16:26.273
There'’’s no way you'’’re
gonna win this, Yuya!

00:16:26.273 --> 00:16:27.940
You hear me?

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.740
I activate Rank‐Up‐Magic
Doom Double Force

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.073
to resurrect my
Revolution Falcon and use it

00:16:33.073 --> 00:16:38.440
to Xyz Summon another Raidraptor
that'’’s twice its Rank!

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.940
They say that
it is the phoenix

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.173
that rises from the ashes
of defeat.

00:16:42.173 --> 00:16:43.940
But they are wrong...

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.506
It is the Raptor!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:50.240
Go Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.540
Fly high, Raidraptor
Final Fortress Falcon!

00:16:56.906 --> 00:17:00.213
Woulda been nice if he played
that monster against Z‐ARC.

00:17:00.213 --> 00:17:02.813
Shay'’’s really angry,
but who can blame him.

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.946
He lost the two most important
people in his life.

00:17:04.946 --> 00:17:07.080
That must'’’ve been so tough.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.913
Well, it'’’ll be tough for Yuya
to get outta this mess.

00:17:09.913 --> 00:17:12.446
I place this card facedown
and... end my turn!

00:17:12.446 --> 00:17:14.313
Bring on the best
you got, Shay!

00:17:14.313 --> 00:17:17.513
Oh, believe me.
You'll get got!

00:17:17.513 --> 00:17:19.513
Raidraptor Final
Fortress Falcon

00:17:19.513 --> 00:17:22.346
attack Lancer Dragon
and end this duel!

00:17:22.346 --> 00:17:26.713
Bombardment Blast Barrage!

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:29.613
C'’’mon you don'’’t think
that'’’ll really work, do you?

00:17:29.613 --> 00:17:32.413
By returning an Odd‐Eyes
to my hand,

00:17:32.413 --> 00:17:34.613
my Lancer Dragon
can't be destroyed,

00:17:34.613 --> 00:17:36.813
and I don'’’t take
any damage either!

00:17:36.813 --> 00:17:38.346
(roars)

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.346
Not a bad ability.
But mine'’’s better.

00:17:47.346 --> 00:17:50.580
Final Fortress Falcon,
use all your Overlay Units!

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.380
Now, by banishing a Raidraptor
Xyz Monster from my graveyard,

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.080
my Falcon can attack again!

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.153
It'’’s over for real
this time, Yuya!

00:18:00.153 --> 00:18:03.320
Falcon, annihilate
Odd‐Eyes Lancer Dragon!

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.520
It'’’s not over
'’’til I say it'’’s over!

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.020
I still have another
Odd‐Eyes on my field!

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.920
I return it to my hand
to block your bombardment!

00:18:15.086 --> 00:18:18.620
That doesn'’’t change a thing,
not in the slightest!

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.886
I still have one Raidraptor
in my graveyard to banish!

00:18:21.886 --> 00:18:24.953
So Final Fortress Falcon
can attack one last time!

00:18:24.953 --> 00:18:27.553
And Yuya doesn'’’t have
any monsters to stop it.

00:18:29.653 --> 00:18:33.020
(Shay)
Lulu, this attack'’’s for you.

00:18:35.486 --> 00:18:39.553
Ready, Yuya?
Nothing will ease my pain...

00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:42.353
But this sure will feel good!

00:18:42.353 --> 00:18:44.186
(roars)

00:18:47.286 --> 00:18:50.386
If I'’’m going down,
I'’’m taking you with me!

00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:53.420
Due to Cross Damage, you take
the exact same damage that I do!

00:19:09.026 --> 00:19:11.026
Now they'’’re both toast!

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:12.626
I can'’’t believe it.

00:19:12.626 --> 00:19:14.293
Since they both took
800 points of damage,

00:19:14.293 --> 00:19:16.226
they're both
out of life points.

00:19:16.226 --> 00:19:17.760
Chalk this up
as a double defeat

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.526
Huh?

00:19:24.693 --> 00:19:26.793
Yuya won?
But how?

00:19:26.793 --> 00:19:28.826
You got me.

00:19:28.826 --> 00:19:30.626
Let's just say
that my Lancer Dragon

00:19:30.626 --> 00:19:32.693
had one last trick
up its wing.

00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:35.126
And boy, did I need it.

00:19:35.126 --> 00:19:38.526
By discarding two Odd‐Eyes
monsters from my hand,

00:19:38.526 --> 00:19:41.460
Lancer Dragon cut the damage
I took in half

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.026
and sent the other half
back to Shay.

00:19:44.026 --> 00:19:48.493
That'’’s why I'’’m standing
and Shay'’’s planking.

00:19:48.493 --> 00:19:51.526
(groaning)

00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:53.726
What a duel.
Good game!

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.760
Shay'’’s smiling?
I don't believe it.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.400
Very funny.
But why can't I be smiling?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.966
Yuya, thanks a lot.

00:20:03.966 --> 00:20:06.166
Huh? Uh...
For what, Shay?

00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:07.666
For giving me hope.

00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:09.900
At the end of the duel,

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.600
I looked into your eyes
and saw Yuto.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.733
He'’’s alive.
Alive within you, Yuya.

00:20:18.733 --> 00:20:20.433
So if he'’’s still here...

00:20:20.433 --> 00:20:22.500
Lulu must be alive too?

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.733
Lulu must be alive too.

00:20:24.733 --> 00:20:26.733
If you can find
a way to save Zuzu,

00:20:26.733 --> 00:20:29.200
you'll be saving
Lulu as well.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.000
Maybe the universe isn'’’t
so cold‐hearted after all.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.166
Well you can count on me!

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:37.566
'’’Cause I'’’m here to make
the whole world smile!

00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:39.900
Well, if you can
make Shay smile,

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.100
the rest should
be a piece of cake.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.066
Good luck, Yuya.

00:20:44.066 --> 00:20:45.500
I know you'’’ll
save us all again.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.633
No pressure or anything.

00:20:47.633 --> 00:20:49.633
But I'’’ll do
what I gotta do.

00:20:49.633 --> 00:20:51.300
And dueltain!

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.533
(man)
You haven'’’t helped one bit!

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.200
Jack Atlas!

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.806
Your dueltaining
is nothing but a joke!

00:21:01.806 --> 00:21:04.240
If that'’’s the best you can do,
all of our worlds are doomed!
