WEBVTT

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.800
Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.266
(Z‐Arc)
Now come to me

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:11.733
Supreme King Dragon
Dark Rebellion!

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:15.833
Rise Falcon,
attack Supreme King Z‐Arc!

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.566
(Z‐Arc)
As long as Dark Rebellion
is on my field,

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.166
you're not allowed to attack
any other Xyz Monsters,

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.900
including Supreme King Z‐Arc!

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.300
Z‐Arc has an answer for
everything we throw at him.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.833
(Kite)
Yuya, if you're still
trapped in there,

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:32.266
I hope you're fighting
as hard as we are!

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:36.366
Because if we fail...
it's the end of everything!

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.533
(Declan)
All the dimensions are
collapsing together into one.

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.066
(Riley screams)
Huh?!

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.466
(Riley whimpering)

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.966
Don't worry they aren't
ghosts, Riley.

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.133
They're people
from other dimensions.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.666
As the four dimensions
continue to merge,

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.933
so do the people
living there.

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.200
(Z‐Arc)
You never had a chance!

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.200
Darkwurms, end this duel!

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.100
Guess this is the end.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.873
Hold it right there!

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:03.173
This duel's not over!

00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:07.106
Huh?!
It's Jack Atlas!

00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:08.973
Join me!
Mm‐hmm!

00:01:08.973 --> 00:01:10.873
You wasted my time!

00:01:10.873 --> 00:01:14.273
And now
you'll pay the price!

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:17.040
(both yelling)

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.806
I couldn't save... Yuya!

00:01:19.806 --> 00:01:22.240
Leave it to Gong!

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.806
(Jack)
Get ready, Z‐Arc!

00:01:24.806 --> 00:01:27.440
(both)
Cause your time of terror's
coming to an end!

00:02:30.513 --> 00:02:33.980
It's time to kick
this duel into overdrive!

00:02:37.913 --> 00:02:39.380
I'll go first!

00:02:40.913 --> 00:02:42.913
When I have no monsters
on my field,

00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:44.446
I can start heating things up

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:48.313
by summoning Red Gargoyle
from my hand!

00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:52.080
(roaring)

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.513
Next, I'll add
fire to the flame

00:02:54.513 --> 00:02:58.180
by summoning the Tuner Monster
Red Resonator!

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.513
Red Gargoyle, use
your special ability

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.953
to double Red Resonator's
Level from 2 to 4!

00:03:03.953 --> 00:03:07.853
That allows me to tune
Red Resonator with Red Gargoyle!

00:03:10.386 --> 00:03:13.253
Now from the ancient chasms
of a lost world,

00:03:13.253 --> 00:03:16.520
I awake a great
and terrible power.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.786
I Synchro Summon Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:23.553
(dragon roars)

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:31.153
What did I miss?

00:03:31.153 --> 00:03:33.553
Only Jack's
best monster!

00:03:33.553 --> 00:03:36.653
It's gonna make
Z‐Arc go kablooey!

00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:40.053
I don't know.
As big as Jack's dragon is,

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.586
Z‐Arc's is
a billion times bigger!

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:45.020
Nice Jack, but I know
you can do better than that!

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.753
C'mon!
Do it for Crow!

00:03:48.753 --> 00:03:50.386
Why Crow?

00:03:50.386 --> 00:03:54.020
Well, because Jack
and Crow were best buds

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.086
well, maybe not best buds.

00:03:56.086 --> 00:03:57.620
Maybe not even buds.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.520
But he sacrificed himself

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.860
just so that
we could get this far.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.726
And I know he'd be all like,

00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:07.526
"C'mon, guys, I didn't turn
into a piece of paper

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:09.126
just so you losers
can lose."

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:11.593
Ahem!
Don't worry, Crow.

00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:13.293
Jack is no loser.

00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:15.760
Yuya, Gong tells me
that you're still alive

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.193
somewhere in that
disgusting‐looking thing.

00:04:18.193 --> 00:04:20.326
That we just need to
wake you up.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:23.126
But I have no time
for therapy sessions.

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:27.326
So I guess I'm just gonna have
to blast you to your senses.

00:04:27.326 --> 00:04:30.060
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend
can destroy all your monsters

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.460
that that are weaker than it,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.326
and deal you
500 points of damage

00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:36.093
for each one
that perishes by its flames!

00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:39.193
Feel the heat
of your impending demise!

00:04:39.193 --> 00:04:42.360
Blast him
(Z‐Arc)
Pathetic!
Just pathetic.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.960
You're the best that
the Synchro Dimension
has to offer?

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.493
I've only been back
for mere minutes

00:04:47.493 --> 00:04:49.593
and I can Synchro Summon
better than you!

00:04:49.593 --> 00:04:51.093
No way!

00:04:51.093 --> 00:04:52.460
Z‐Arc's gonna
Synchro Summon?

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.193
Aw, man, looks like
he knows how to use

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.260
almost all the
summoning methods?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.493
Gong's gotta feelin'
Gong ain't gonna like this.

00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:01.866
I can tribute my two
Supreme King Dragon Darkwurms

00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:04.966
to Synchro Summon, and I can
do it during your turn!

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.033
Feast your eyes on this!

00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:16.233
Supreme King Dragon
Clear Wing!

00:05:20.233 --> 00:05:21.966
(Z‐Arc)
Feast your eyes on this!

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:24.700
Supreme King Dragon
Clear Wing!

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.933
Hey, isn't that
Yugo's Dragon?

00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:28.800
Looks like it
but something's off.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.100
Cause it's like being
used by a bad guy‐‐ Ugh!

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.600
And Yugo is one
of the good guys.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.300
Why does the bad guy
have Yugo's dragon?

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.833
I don't know, but it
can't be a good thing.

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.233
Z‐Arc, didn't
your mom teach you

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:45.833
to keep your hands off
other people's dragons?

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:47.800
If only my duel disk
wasn't broken

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.166
I'd be teaching you
that lesson right now.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:52.700
You tried to destroy
my monsters,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.400
but you're the one
who's going to pay instead,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.200
Because Clear Wing's
special ability
automatically destroys

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.673
your Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:06:01.673 --> 00:06:03.473
Not so fast!

00:06:03.473 --> 00:06:05.040
By discarding
Brutal Red

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.773
from my hand
to the graveyard,

00:06:06.773 --> 00:06:09.840
Scarlight Red
Dragon Archfiend
can't be destroyed!

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.340
In fact, it gains
1,000 attack
points instead!

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.473
(both)
Yeah!

00:06:17.473 --> 00:06:19.373
Jack sure did
serve up a save!

00:06:19.373 --> 00:06:21.806
That's why Jack
is the master!

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:25.073
Hope you're ready, Z‐Arc!
Time for payback!

00:06:25.073 --> 00:06:26.840
Scarlight Red
Dragon Archfiend,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.973
annihilate Supreme King
Dragon Clear Wing!

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.306
You really don't know
jack, Jack.

00:06:33.306 --> 00:06:36.006
Clear Wing can not only
stop this battle

00:06:36.006 --> 00:06:39.340
but it also automatically
destroys your monster,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.973
and you take damage
equal to its attack points!

00:06:42.973 --> 00:06:44.473
Are you daft?

00:06:44.473 --> 00:06:47.140
I just said literally
40 seconds ago

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.940
that my Brutal Red protects
my Dragon from destruction.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.673
He stopped Z‐Arc again.

00:06:52.673 --> 00:06:55.540
You gotta try harder
than that, Z‐Arc!

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.540
For the supreme ruler
of the galaxy,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.540
you sure don't pay much
attention to details.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.113
Or maybe he doesn't
sweat the details

00:07:02.113 --> 00:07:04.280
because he isn't
worried in the least.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.780
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.780
And with that, Brutal Red's
special ability ends,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.313
so Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend's attack points

00:07:13.313 --> 00:07:15.913
return to normal.

00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:18.146
But make no mistake,
Z‐Arc!

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.846
No matter how many roadblocks
you throw our way,

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:21.580
we won't be stopped!

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.146
Not until we rescue Yuya!

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:29.080
And Gong's gonna help bulldoze
the way for us, Jack!

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.380
My turn!

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.313
I summon the Tuner Monster
Superheavy Samurai Battleball!

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:38.446
And this Superheavy Samurai
lets Gong also summon

00:07:38.446 --> 00:07:41.646
Superheavy Samurai Hexagon
from Gong's hand.

00:07:41.646 --> 00:07:43.646
Now what say
you rally up the troops!

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:47.280
(grunting)

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.613
Gong tunes Level 2 Battleball
with Level 6 Hexagon!

00:07:51.613 --> 00:07:54.980
Temper and toughen
your battle tested blades

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.680
and forge 'em
in fierce flames of fury!

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.920
Gong Synchro Summons...

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.986
Superheavy
Samurai Swordsmith!

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.086
So, you can
Synchro Summon as well?

00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:15.720
Lamely, though, as you
summoned it in defense mode.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.753
You stop that right there!

00:08:17.753 --> 00:08:19.253
Now don't you go tarnishin'

00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:21.453
Gong's Heavystrong
dueling style!

00:08:21.453 --> 00:08:22.986
The real Yuya wouldn't!

00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:24.886
Heavystrong?

00:08:24.886 --> 00:08:27.620
Guess Gong's gotta
refresh your memory.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.120
When Gong successfully
summons Swordsmith,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.786
Gong can also summon
every Superheavy Samurai

00:08:32.786 --> 00:08:35.053
Gong's got in Gong's hand.

00:08:35.053 --> 00:08:38.220
First up's, Superheavy
Samurai Swordsman!

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.986
Next, Superheavy
Samurai Blue Brawler!

00:08:41.986 --> 00:08:45.720
And Superheavy
Samurai Big Benkei!

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.553
This way!

00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:50.953
Look!

00:08:50.953 --> 00:08:52.853
(both)
Those're Gong's monsters!

00:08:52.853 --> 00:08:55.253
Oh! But what's
he dueling?!

00:08:55.253 --> 00:08:57.620
The biggest dragon
I've ever seen.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.220
And that's quite
the accomplishment,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.960
cause I've seen some
pretty big ones in my time.

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:06.193
Do you remember, Yuya?

00:09:06.193 --> 00:09:08.526
If there's still a spec
of ya left in there,

00:09:08.526 --> 00:09:10.993
ya gotta remember
these fellas, buddy.

00:09:10.993 --> 00:09:13.993
'Cause ever since
we been toddlers,

00:09:13.993 --> 00:09:16.726
Gong been battling against ya
with these Samurais

00:09:16.726 --> 00:09:19.593
to hone Gong's
Heavystrong style.

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:21.860
We musta dueled
a gazilion and one times,

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.460
and all that trainin'
was no joke.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.626
But in the end, we made
each other better duelists.

00:09:29.626 --> 00:09:32.860
And you... a dueltainer.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.860
I am a dueltainer.
That's right!

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.126
Dueltainin'!

00:09:37.126 --> 00:09:38.726
It's still
in your soul, Yuya!

00:09:38.726 --> 00:09:40.226
You just gotta
wake it up!

00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:43.160
Don't let that Z‐Arc punk
take it all away from you!

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.893
Remember, how duelin's
supposed to make
everyone smile!

00:09:45.893 --> 00:09:48.460
Never forget...
duelin's for fun!

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.693
But... I'm having fun.

00:09:50.693 --> 00:09:52.626
We ain't talkin'
to you, Z‐Arc!

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:54.560
Butt out when grown folks
are talkin'!

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.526
Jack and Gong'll put an end
to your shenanigans!

00:09:57.526 --> 00:09:59.626
As long as we work together.

00:09:59.626 --> 00:10:01.433
What do you have
in mind?

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.833
This... when Z‐Arc
goes on the attack,

00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:06.200
he's now only allowed to
attack Gong's Swordsmith.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.100
Ah, I see!

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.933
That means Z‐Arc can't attack
my Red Dragoon Archfiend,

00:10:10.933 --> 00:10:12.833
keeping it safe from harm.

00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:15.266
And ready to launch
a counterattack

00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:17.100
when it's my turn!

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.066
(laughing)
(Gong)
What's so funny, Z‐Arc?

00:10:20.066 --> 00:10:22.500
You don't think
I'd be ready.. for that?!

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.600
Laughable!

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.933
Then why don't
you attack us,

00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:28.000
and we'll see who gets
the last laugh!

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.766
Bring it on, Z‐Arc.

00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:31.900
Oh, and, Yuya...

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.900
just wait and we'll save ya
from that dunderhead!

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.366
Ha!

00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:36.933
If dueltainin'
is what you want,

00:10:36.933 --> 00:10:38.633
dueltainin' is
what you'll get!

00:10:38.633 --> 00:10:40.566
What?
No way, Kite!

00:10:40.566 --> 00:10:42.566
Z‐Arc's actually
going to dueltain?

00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:44.500
When did Z‐Arc
become a dueltainer?

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.200
Maybe they got to Yuya.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.633
It's showtime!

00:10:48.633 --> 00:10:50.500
I'll kick things off

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.966
by equipping Supreme Presence
on to my Clear Wing!

00:10:54.966 --> 00:10:57.733
And what was it
that your dear old friend

00:10:57.733 --> 00:10:59.400
used to say?

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.573
Time for my monster
to put you in traction!

00:11:02.573 --> 00:11:04.606
Clear Wing,
attack Big Benkei!

00:11:04.606 --> 00:11:06.973
You know what?
I have a better idea!

00:11:06.973 --> 00:11:09.506
By stopping this battle,
Clear Wing's ability

00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:11.440
still destroys
your Big Benkei,

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.706
but you also take damage
equal to its attack points!

00:11:14.706 --> 00:11:16.573
And there's more!

00:11:16.573 --> 00:11:18.473
Due to
Supreme Presence's effect,

00:11:18.473 --> 00:11:21.006
all your monsters
are destroyed!

00:11:21.006 --> 00:11:22.806
What?!
All of 'em!?

00:11:22.806 --> 00:11:25.740
They won't survive this!
They're done.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.673
Z‐Arc's actually gonna win!
It can't be!

00:11:28.673 --> 00:11:31.640
This can't be happening!
I can't watch.

00:11:44.273 --> 00:11:46.873
(Sora)
Z‐Arc's gonna beat
these guys!

00:11:50.006 --> 00:11:52.773
(Gong)
This ain't dueltainin,
and you ain't winnin!

00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:55.873
Gong can tribute
a Superheavy Samurai

00:11:55.873 --> 00:11:59.306
to summon
Superheavy Samurai
Warchief Heavystrong

00:11:59.306 --> 00:12:00.646
in defense mode!

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.580
(roars)

00:12:09.846 --> 00:12:11.480
Heavystrong, protect

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.780
Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend from destruction!

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.513
Oh, man.
Gong got blasted.

00:12:29.513 --> 00:12:31.946
I am now having
the bad goosepickles.

00:12:31.946 --> 00:12:33.180
Is Gong okay?

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.680
Don't fret, children.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.880
No matter how bad
it may look,

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.646
it'll take more
than a couple blasts

00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:39.246
to take down
our friends.

00:12:39.246 --> 00:12:41.246
Guys, look!

00:12:45.513 --> 00:12:47.713
By destroying three
of our monsters,

00:12:47.713 --> 00:12:51.580
we take 1,000 points
of damage.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.913
But you couldn't take down
Red Dragon Archfiend

00:12:53.913 --> 00:12:56.313
or Superheavy
Samurai Heavystrong,

00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:57.946
so Gong's
not feelin' too bad.

00:12:57.946 --> 00:13:00.253
And Heavystrong's special
ability ends the battle,

00:13:00.253 --> 00:13:02.353
so you can't attack
no more this turn!

00:13:02.353 --> 00:13:04.920
Nicely done!

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.686
Of course, if I was dueling,
I woulda done that too,

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:09.653
but with a dash of class
and sprinkle of style!

00:13:09.653 --> 00:13:11.586
I woulda run
all over 'em, I tell ya!

00:13:11.586 --> 00:13:13.520
(both)
Huh?

00:13:15.353 --> 00:13:16.953
(all)
Way to go!

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.653
Huh?!
What's that?

00:13:20.653 --> 00:13:23.186
I'm not sure.

00:13:34.553 --> 00:13:36.286
My word!

00:13:36.286 --> 00:13:37.986
No way!

00:13:37.986 --> 00:13:40.220
I can't believe it,
that's New Domino City!

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.620
You're right!

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.853
Ahh!
Was that... an earthquake?

00:13:45.853 --> 00:13:49.686
(Amanda)
That's no earthquake!

00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:52.620
(laughing)

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.986
You actually managed
to survive!

00:13:54.986 --> 00:13:57.320
I like how you love to
prolong your suffering!

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.320
And I aim to oblige.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.126
The only reason
we're suffering

00:14:01.126 --> 00:14:04.060
is because we have to
listen to your
insufferable voice!

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.426
But your
incessant chattering
will come to an end

00:14:06.426 --> 00:14:08.226
when Scarlight Red
Dragon Archfiend

00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:11.893
blasts you
into oblivion!

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.860
He's heading up
that highway.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.126
But the dimensions haven't
fully converged yet!

00:14:16.126 --> 00:14:19.193
He's insane, he's gonna drive
straight off the cliff!

00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:21.460
I hope he's packin'
a parachute.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.593
Road or no road,
that never stopped Jack!

00:14:23.593 --> 00:14:26.160
Now, put the pedal
to the metal!

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.660
(Jack)
Time to kick things
into overdrive!

00:14:41.826 --> 00:14:46.560
Let's get gritty!

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.293
First, I activate
the trap card Vision Synchro!

00:14:51.293 --> 00:14:53.493
I discard Red Sprinter,

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:55.360
along with two Tuner Monsters,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.393
Dark Resonator
and Net Resonator,

00:14:57.393 --> 00:15:00.266
from my hand to the graveyard
to Synchro Summon!

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:01.766
Show him that you
can Synchro Summon

00:15:01.766 --> 00:15:03.100
better than anyone!

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.100
Yuya, this one's
for you!

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.966
I summoned this

00:15:06.966 --> 00:15:08.833
the first time when
I battled against you.

00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:11.700
A duel that I'll
never forget!

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.033
And I know you haven't
forgotten it either!

00:15:14.033 --> 00:15:18.333
A duel that ignited the flames
of everyone in the city!

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:20.933
And it's time for an encore!

00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:30.400
Together, these monsters
will call forth

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:36.200
an absolute power destined
to rule this duel!

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.466
I Synchro Summon!

00:15:38.466 --> 00:15:40.666
Bow down
and tremble in terror

00:15:40.666 --> 00:15:43.600
before Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:15:47.466 --> 00:15:49.266
Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend

00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:51.633
is like
the best‐est monster ever!

00:15:51.633 --> 00:15:53.366
Jack's got this in the bag!

00:15:53.366 --> 00:15:55.533
(Frankie)
No one can beat
Red Dragon Archfiend,

00:15:55.533 --> 00:15:57.733
much less two of 'em!

00:15:57.733 --> 00:16:00.440
Since I used Net Resonator
to summon Tyrant,

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.373
its special ability
activates!

00:16:02.373 --> 00:16:04.440
As long as Tyrant
is on my field,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.740
your effects can't
deal me damage!

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.340
Gong's gonna give you
an extra protection, Jack.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.306
Heavystrong uses
its special ability

00:16:11.306 --> 00:16:13.573
on both your Red Dragon
Archfiends!

00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:18.073
Now those two dragons
can't be destroyed this turn!

00:16:18.073 --> 00:16:21.006
That's it, that's all Gong
can do to help you out.

00:16:21.006 --> 00:16:23.106
The rest's up to you.

00:16:23.106 --> 00:16:27.340
Now, you take down Z‐Arc
and go and save our pal Yuya!

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.106
(kids)
Yes, go, Jack, go!

00:16:29.106 --> 00:16:33.206
Come on, Jack.
We're all counting on you.

00:16:33.206 --> 00:16:34.640
Now get ready!

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.573
Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend,

00:16:36.573 --> 00:16:39.540
attack Supreme King Dragon
Clear Wing!

00:16:43.506 --> 00:16:45.840
(Z‐Arc)
Must we go through
this again?

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.006
Clear Wing's special ability
not only ends this battle,

00:16:49.006 --> 00:16:51.506
but it also destroys
your monster.

00:16:51.506 --> 00:16:54.340
But Heavystrong stops
Red Dragon Archfiend

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.873
from kickin'
the bucket too!

00:16:55.873 --> 00:16:57.906
I wouldn't be
so sure, Gong.

00:16:57.906 --> 00:17:00.446
Due to my spell
Supreme Presence,

00:17:00.446 --> 00:17:04.846
Clear Wing uses its special
ability on all your monsters!

00:17:04.846 --> 00:17:06.580
So by destroying Heavystrong,

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.513
it won't be protecting
anyone anymore!

00:17:09.513 --> 00:17:13.146
And you take damage equal to
Heavystrong's attack points!

00:17:13.146 --> 00:17:15.780
But as a partin' gift,
Gong's Heavystrong

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.880
will protect Jack's Dragons
as long as it can!

00:17:22.813 --> 00:17:24.480
Aah!

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:29.513
(Gong shouting)

00:17:29.513 --> 00:17:33.113
(Sylvio groaning)

00:17:33.113 --> 00:17:35.080
‐ Oh, no! Crow!

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.346
Me and my butterfingers!

00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:39.980
Shoot!
Ahh!

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.680
(Gong shouting)
Oh man, Gong!

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.646
Aah! Oof! Unh!

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.513
It's all... on you, Jack.

00:17:49.513 --> 00:17:51.180
Gong saved me.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.046
He gave me
a chance to take you down,

00:17:53.046 --> 00:17:55.246
and it's one chance
I won't let go to waste.

00:17:55.246 --> 00:17:57.780
Here I go!

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.580
With one final strike,

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.620
your wretched
reign of terror is over!

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.353
Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend,
destroy Clear Wing!

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.220
Jack did it!
Yeah!

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.986
It's not over yet, Jack.

00:18:18.986 --> 00:18:20.520
Not by a long shot.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.153
Maybe if you showed up
for class on time

00:18:23.153 --> 00:18:25.986
you would've known that
my Supreme King Gate Zero's

00:18:25.986 --> 00:18:28.486
Pendulum ability protects me
for any damage.

00:18:28.486 --> 00:18:30.220
What's that?!

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.486
In fact, Supreme King
Gate Infinity

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:35.353
converts all that damage
into life points for me!

00:18:35.353 --> 00:18:37.486
Too bad all your buddies
didn't fill you in.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.020
What's worse,
since my turn's over,

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.053
Vision Synchro sends
Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend

00:18:47.053 --> 00:18:49.020
back to my Extra Deck.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.053
Farewell, my friend.

00:18:52.053 --> 00:18:55.320
Oh man, that creep's even
more powerful than before!

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.920
Why won't Crow or Yuya
come to save the day

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.620
when he's in
such trouble?

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.060
We really need Crow
right now!

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.560
Gong! Gong!
You okay, big guy?

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.393
Unh!
(moaning)
Not really.

00:19:08.393 --> 00:19:11.193
But bad as it looks,
Gong's thinking...

00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:13.226
we're getting
through to Yuya.

00:19:13.226 --> 00:19:14.960
Like Z‐Arc flinched

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.393
when Gong called him
a dueltainer.

00:19:16.393 --> 00:19:18.060
He really did?

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.293
He's just needin'
a little push.

00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:23.626
You're the only one
left to give it.

00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:25.626
(voice)
Umm, I think you're
forgetting someone?

00:19:25.626 --> 00:19:28.993
Like someone much cooler
and handsome than that scrub?

00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:31.926
It's really you!
How did you escape?

00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:34.660
My turn!
Rargh!

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.660
I have to
hand it to you, Jack.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.326
You were better than those
other dolts I beat.

00:19:39.326 --> 00:19:42.060
Not much better,
but better.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.826
But you're going down
like all the rest!

00:19:44.826 --> 00:19:46.293
(Sylvio)
I don't think so.

00:19:46.293 --> 00:19:48.326
Jack isn't the last
line of defense!

00:19:48.326 --> 00:19:50.660
(computer voice)
Intrusion penalty:
2,000 life points.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.526
How exciting, but first...

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.093
Let me just get rid
of this pest!

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:57.060
(roars)

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.233
(Jack shouting)

00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:22.500
Unh!

00:20:30.066 --> 00:20:32.933
I have to count
on those two jokers now?

00:20:32.933 --> 00:20:35.566
This is not
my brightest moment‐‐ Heh!

00:20:35.566 --> 00:20:37.666
(Sylvio)
Thanks for the pep talk.

00:20:37.666 --> 00:20:41.600
But, Jack.... don't you worry
about a thing!

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.533
Not when Sylvio's arrived
to steal the show!

00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:46.200
Really?
Don't think

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.966
I'm gonna let you hog
the spotlight

00:20:47.966 --> 00:20:50.066
and upstage me.
Hmm.

00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:54.133
Oh yeah!
Crow!

00:20:54.133 --> 00:20:56.300
I knew he'd come!
He'd never let us down!

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.233
I didn't think
it was possible,

00:20:58.233 --> 00:21:00.940
but how did Crow
get out of his card?

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.673
I don't know,
but if you tell me that
dimensions can unite,

00:21:03.673 --> 00:21:06.240
I believe anything
can be done.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.073
What?
That's crazy, Ray!

00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:18.606
What's wrong, Riley?
Is everything all right?

00:21:18.606 --> 00:21:23.340
Ray just said that
since our dad wasn't
able to revive her...

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.540
He's going to fight
Z‐Arc on his own...

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.740
in her place.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.573
Oh, is he now?
