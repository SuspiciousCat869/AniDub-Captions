WEBVTT

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.733
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"!

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.700
I can'’’t believe you turned
them... into cards!

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.300
They got what they deserved.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.033
They'’’re from Duel Academy!

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.166
My sworn enemies.

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.666
We'’’re on the same side!

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.566
I'’’ll be the judge of that.

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:19.600
Anyone can claim to be against
Duel Academy or to be my ally.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.700
But words can deceive.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.066
Lies have cost me too much,
and now I trust no one.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:25.966
So let'’’s duel!

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.800
Kite...
Kite Tenjo.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.600
One of the best, if not the
best, in all of Heartland.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.833
Kite used to duel with joy.

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.700
Now all I sense...
is rage.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.033
A rage so intense it'’’s
consumed him completely.

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:43.300
Let'’’s duel!

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.533
As long as Kite
has that dragon,

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.933
they can'’’t let
their guard down.

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.966
Oh, Yuya, you worry
too much!

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.633
Kite's precious little dragon

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.433
will never make an appearance
in this duel.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.066
No, you'’’re wrong.

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.466
What'’’s that?

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.000
I Xyz Summon!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.906
(roaring)

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:05.740
Cipher Stream of Destruction!

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:12.773
Aah!

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:14.473
Enough!

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.073
We're here to put
an end to this war,

00:01:16.073 --> 00:01:18.840
and we can'’’t stop it
unless we work together!

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.273
Save your breath.
(grunts)

00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:22.706
It'’’s useless.
He doesn't want to listen.

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:26.440
Then I guess I'’’ll have to let my
cards do the talking for me!

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.880
You may think your
judge and jury,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.113
but I'’’m not letting you turn
anyone into a card, Kite!

00:02:38.113 --> 00:02:40.180
You dare oppose me?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180
You must be from
Duel Academy!

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.213
No, I swear I'’’m not!

00:02:44.213 --> 00:02:46.413
Don'’’t you dare deny it.

00:02:46.413 --> 00:02:49.080
I know full well that they want
me neutralized!

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.846
After all, I turned all their
soldiers into cards.

00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:56.446
But still, that'’’s nothing
compared to their crimes.

00:02:56.446 --> 00:02:58.513
Crimes that you played
a part in!

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:03.420
I only unleashed my wrath
on Duel Academy

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.220
because of what happened
to my friends.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.753
You turned them all into cards.

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:10.820
Well, unfortunately for you,
two can play at that game!

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.320
And unless you beg for
forgiveness...

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.820
you'’’re going to
pay most dearly.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.620
I'’’m not your enemy, but I won'’’t
be turned into a card!

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.486
Go!

00:03:21.486 --> 00:03:23.786
(computer voice)
Generating Action Field
Crossover!

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:26.386
Many have tried
to take me down,

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:30.553
but all have failed,
as will you.

00:03:30.553 --> 00:03:32.386
(computer voice)
<i>Action Cards dispersed.</i>

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:34.120
Let'’’s duel!
Let's duel!

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.586
Allow me, won'’’t you?

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:39.353
I'’’ll start by summoning out
Cipher Wing!

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:41.820
And when Cipher Wing
is out on my field,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.453
if I have another Cipher Wing in
my hand, I can summon it, too!

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.520
He'’’s got two
Cipher Wings again?

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.220
Next I'm going to activate
the spell

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.353
Double Exposure from my hand.

00:03:55.353 --> 00:03:58.953
Which means my Cipher Wings
Levels double to 8.

00:04:01.126 --> 00:04:04.093
That'’’s bad!
Yeah, really bad!

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:06.926
I overlay my two Level 8
Cipher Wings.

00:04:06.926 --> 00:04:12.393
With these two monsters, I build
the Overlay Network!

00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:16.960
Now, by way of the cosmic
energies

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.393
that make up our galaxy,

00:04:18.393 --> 00:04:20.393
I'’’ll make something just as
mighty.

00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:24.393
I Xyz Summon...

00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:27.826
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:29.726
(roaring)

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:39.826
I Xyz Summon Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon!

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:42.193
(roaring)

00:04:42.193 --> 00:04:45.226
It'’’s nearly as big as a galaxy!

00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:46.826
That'’’s Kite'’’s top monster!

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:47.626
Not good.

00:04:49.526 --> 00:04:51.893
I'’’ll then end my turn with...

00:04:51.893 --> 00:04:53.593
a facedown!

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:56.460
Yuya,
please, listen to me.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.293
In your duel with Jack Atlas...

00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:03.300
When you battled, you were able
to really get through to him.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.733
But you must realize
that's because

00:05:05.733 --> 00:05:08.033
you both were working toward
the same objective.

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:09.166
(telepathy)
The same objective?

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:11.066
Yes.

00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:14.000
You both wanted peace to prevail
in New Domino City.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.666
But Kite is so angry that he'’’s
not fighting for peace.

00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:19.966
He'’’s fighting for revenge.

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:22.366
So it'’’s impossible for you to
get through to him.

00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:25.000
No! There's always a way!

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.933
I'’’ll figure one out!

00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:29.900
Remember what you said?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.666
Use your power...

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:36.366
to keep the world entertained
and smiling.

00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:38.566
And that's exactly
what I intend to do.

00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:42.700
So please, Yuto, just sit back
and enjoy the show!

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.166
I draw!

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:46.566
I'll use Timebreaker Magician

00:05:46.566 --> 00:05:49.500
and Performapal Whim Witch to
set the Pendulum Scale!

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.066
I'’’m taking control of this duel,
starting now!

00:06:02.773 --> 00:06:06.740
Next I'’’m activating Timebreaker
Magician'’’s Pendulum ability.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.606
With it, I can double Whim
Witch'’’s Scale to 8!

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.073
Now I can summon as many
monsters

00:06:16.073 --> 00:06:19.373
between Levels 3
and 7 as I like.

00:06:19.373 --> 00:06:21.673
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.373
Carve the arc of victory!

00:06:24.373 --> 00:06:30.273
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:35.040
Drum to it, Performapal
Drummerilla!

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.273
Turn up the heat, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.173
(roaring)

00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:45.206
And now,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon,

00:06:45.206 --> 00:06:48.606
show Galaxy‐Eyes who the tougher
dragon on the field is.

00:06:48.606 --> 00:06:50.540
Attack!

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.373
And do so to the beat of
Drummerilla'’’s Pendulum ability!

00:06:53.373 --> 00:06:56.673
It gives Odd‐Eyes a 600 attack
point power up!

00:06:56.673 --> 00:06:58.473
Way to go!

00:06:58.473 --> 00:07:01.380
Now Yuya'’’s dragon is the
strongest one in play!

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.346
So Kite'’’s top monster
is about to bottom out.

00:07:06.346 --> 00:07:09.146
For the last time, Kite,
we'’’re on the same side!

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:11.280
And I can only hope
that this attack

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.813
knocks some sense into you!

00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:14.613
Go Spiral Flame Strike!

00:07:14.613 --> 00:07:17.480
You'’’re in for
a rude awakening Yuya!

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.613
The only striking your Dragon'’’s
doing is striking out!

00:07:20.613 --> 00:07:23.080
Watch as my spell Double
Exposure transforms

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.913
one of your monsters into
another one of your monsters.

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:31.213
I'’’m turning your ape into an
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon.

00:07:31.213 --> 00:07:32.180
Huh?

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.713
But why would he do that?

00:07:33.713 --> 00:07:35.080
I don't wanna know.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.546
(roaring)

00:07:37.546 --> 00:07:40.313
I activate the trap
Double Sensorship!

00:07:40.313 --> 00:07:43.046
When you have two copies
of the same monster,

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.846
you'’’re not allowed to attack!

00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:46.780
(roaring)

00:07:50.546 --> 00:07:51.746
(gasps)

00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:53.680
Oh, no!

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.913
Kite used Yuya'’’s own monsters
against him!

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.080
Clever move.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.353
Now Drummerilla'’’s special
ability ends,

00:08:01.353 --> 00:08:04.153
and Odd Eyes'’’ attack points go
back to normal.

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.720
And Timebreaker Magician's
Pendulum ability

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.353
will end as well,

00:08:12.353 --> 00:08:15.053
which means Whim Witch'’’s scale
returns to normal, too.

00:08:15.053 --> 00:08:17.686
Guess I'’’ll end my turn.

00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:20.153
Yuya played that last round
perfectly.

00:08:20.153 --> 00:08:22.086
He played exactly
the right monsters

00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:24.453
with exactly
the right abilities.

00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:28.153
But still, Kite was able to keep
him from landing a strike.

00:08:28.153 --> 00:08:31.586
Do you think Yuya'’’s finally met
his match, Sylivio?

00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:32.920
Definitely.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.820
But that was when Yuya met me.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.553
I still think Yuya can figure
out a way to beat this guy.

00:08:38.553 --> 00:08:40.486
No chance,

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.586
and you can thank your two dumb
buddies for making sure of that.

00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:44.486
Say what?

00:08:44.486 --> 00:08:46.753
I pay close attention to the
tactics of everyone I duel,

00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:48.886
including your friends.

00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:51.386
And since you'’’re so close with
them it'’’s no surprise

00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:54.886
that you all utilize very
similar strategies,

00:08:54.886 --> 00:08:58.153
so I went ahead and figured out
a way to counter them.

00:08:58.153 --> 00:09:00.626
Now it's as though
I know your moves

00:09:00.626 --> 00:09:03.693
long before you even have
a chance make them,

00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:06.093
as I just demonstrated.

00:09:06.093 --> 00:09:07.960
This is awful!

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.626
We'’’ve tipped him off
to Yuya'’’s game plan!

00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:13.126
You had zero chance
of winning before,

00:09:13.126 --> 00:09:16.293
but now you're in
even deeper trouble.

00:09:17.926 --> 00:09:19.760
It's my turn.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.093
And first I'’’ll use
one Overlay Unit

00:09:22.093 --> 00:09:24.993
to activate Cipher Dragon'’’s
ability!

00:09:24.993 --> 00:09:26.860
Cipher Subjection!

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.193
(roaring)

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:31.360
With it, I gain control of one
of your monsters

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.826
and then I can treat it as
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:09:41.593 --> 00:09:43.760
(roaring)

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.360
No!
My Odd‐Eyes!

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.426
I'’’ll now activate the spell card
Cipher Interference!

00:09:49.426 --> 00:09:51.860
Go!

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.393
And now...

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:56.293
my Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon's
new twin

00:09:56.293 --> 00:10:00.500
will attack your wannabe
Odd‐Eyes and crush your monster!

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.266
(roaring)

00:10:02.266 --> 00:10:05.966
That Drummerilla is about to
really feel the beat!

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:07.600
All right, Drumerilla,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.066
time to drum up some extra
attack points!

00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:13.033
600 to be exact!

00:10:15.033 --> 00:10:18.700
That'’’s a clever play to reduce
the damage you take, Yuya.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.066
But...

00:10:20.066 --> 00:10:22.233
That won't help you
in the slightest

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:25.333
because I'm activating the spell
card Cipher Interference

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:30.033
which doubles Cipher Dragon'’’s
attack points to 6,000!

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:36.833
Lay waste, Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon!

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:39.933
We'’’ll just see about that!

00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:43.033
Go, Cipher Stream
of Destruction!

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.933
I activate the Action Spell
Miracle!

00:10:47.933 --> 00:10:50.666
It stops my monster from being
destroyed

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:53.466
and cuts the damage
I take in half!

00:10:53.466 --> 00:10:54.266
Nice move!

00:10:55.733 --> 00:10:58.833
So Action Cards aren'’’t
exclusively for offense.

00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:00.940
There are defense types
as well.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.673
You mean you didn'’’t know?

00:11:02.673 --> 00:11:05.740
I thought you said that you
figured out all our strategies,

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.573
but I guess you figured wrong!

00:11:07.573 --> 00:11:09.006
You dare lecture me?

00:11:09.006 --> 00:11:11.806
I have more dueling knowledge in
one finger

00:11:11.806 --> 00:11:13.940
then your entire brain!

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.040
My other Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher
Dragon

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.206
will attack Odd‐Eyes
and finish the job!

00:11:20.206 --> 00:11:21.906
No!

00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:25.306
Go, Cipher Stream of
Destruction!

00:11:25.306 --> 00:11:26.306
Aah!

00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:30.673
Aah!

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.106
One step too slow.

00:11:34.106 --> 00:11:35.773
Now that the battle's over,

00:11:35.773 --> 00:11:38.973
my Galaxy‐Eyes'’’ attack points
return to normal.

00:11:38.973 --> 00:11:41.440
Then I'’’ll toss a facedown,
Yuya...

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.106
and end my turn.

00:11:44.106 --> 00:11:48.506
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon now
returns to you.

00:11:51.006 --> 00:11:53.406
But I wouldn'’’t get too attached
to it.

00:11:53.406 --> 00:11:58.506
I'’’ll destroy it next turn,
along with you!

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.846
(thinking)
I'’’ve never dueled someone like
Kite before.

00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:09.013
Someone who knows my tactics
so well

00:12:09.013 --> 00:12:11.346
he knows what I'’’m gonna do
before I do it!

00:12:11.346 --> 00:12:13.046
It'll be tough to beat him

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:14.880
let alone convince him
I'’’m not his enemy.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.880
Not just tough, nearly
impossible.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.980
Yuya, face it.
You can't get through to him.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.380
If you don't want to be
turned into a card,

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.946
forget dueltaining
and focus only on winning.

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:29.713
This isn't the time to try
to convince him

00:12:29.713 --> 00:12:31.280
that you'’’re not the enemy.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.646
But convincing him
I'm not the enemy

00:12:33.646 --> 00:12:35.613
is the only true way to win.

00:12:35.613 --> 00:12:37.680
My turn!

00:12:38.946 --> 00:12:40.946
Yes!
Oh, no!

00:12:40.946 --> 00:12:42.680
Gong can hardly watch this!

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.413
Here goes!

00:12:44.413 --> 00:12:47.746
First I activate
the Pendulum ability of
Performapal Whim Witch!

00:12:47.746 --> 00:12:51.246
It lets me summon it from the
Pendulum Zone to my field!

00:12:52.813 --> 00:12:55.913
And now I activate Whim Witch'’’s
special ability!

00:12:56.913 --> 00:12:58.980
When summoning a new monster,

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.220
Whim Witch counts as two
monsters instead of one,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.953
which is just the right amount
to summon

00:13:04.953 --> 00:13:07.853
her magical friend,
Dragoncaller Magician!

00:13:16.286 --> 00:13:19.286
And now it'’’s time for a little
abracadabra!

00:13:19.286 --> 00:13:22.686
It changes from a Spellcaster
into a Dragon!

00:13:22.686 --> 00:13:25.086
Though you may not be able to
tell from the outside,

00:13:25.086 --> 00:13:29.653
inside it'’’s got the fire to
scorch the enemy!

00:13:29.653 --> 00:13:32.853
Well done. You have two
high‐level Dragons.

00:13:34.553 --> 00:13:36.120
(thinking)
Yeah, it's not bad,

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.820
but if I'm gonna burn away all
the rage in his heart,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.620
then I'’’ll need a stronger
dragon!

00:13:43.086 --> 00:13:46.553
I overlay Level 7 Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon

00:13:46.553 --> 00:13:48.253
and Dragoncaller Magician!

00:13:48.253 --> 00:13:50.853
Go!

00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:53.086
(groans)

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:59.920
Dragon with blazing,
raging eyes,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.260
come and conquer all that stand
against you!

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.493
I Xyz Summon...

00:14:05.493 --> 00:14:08.126
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon!

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.526
So, Kite, how do you like
Odd‐Eyes'’’ makeover?

00:14:14.526 --> 00:14:16.493
That'’’s incredible.

00:14:16.493 --> 00:14:18.626
He'’’s able to Xyz Summon?

00:14:18.626 --> 00:14:21.126
Who in the world is this kid?

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:24.060
And now, Odd‐Eyes
Rebellion Dragon,

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.226
attack Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon!

00:14:27.226 --> 00:14:29.493
(roaring)

00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:31.926
But...
Yuya won't win.

00:14:31.926 --> 00:14:34.393
Both of those dragons have
the same attack points!

00:14:34.393 --> 00:14:35.660
He should call it off!

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.993
It'’’s cool.

00:14:36.993 --> 00:14:38.726
Since I used Dragoncaller
Magician

00:14:38.726 --> 00:14:40.793
to summon Odd‐Eyes Rebellion
Dragon,

00:14:40.793 --> 00:14:42.093
its attack points are doubled!

00:14:50.726 --> 00:14:52.993
All right!
Odd‐Eyes is stronger!

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:55.393
Yuya'’’s totally got this now!

00:14:55.393 --> 00:14:57.360
If not for my facedown.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.493
Go, Double Cipher!

00:14:59.493 --> 00:15:02.133
By using my remaining
Overlay Unit,

00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:08.033
I can now bypass all summoning
requirements and do this:

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:12.633
Return Cipher Dragon to the
field from my Extra Deck!

00:15:12.633 --> 00:15:14.766
It is my pleasure
to welcome back

00:15:14.766 --> 00:15:17.000
this colossus of the cosmos!

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.066
And it will be your pain,
Yuya!

00:15:25.233 --> 00:15:27.000
I Xyz Summon!

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.200
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.266
(roaring)

00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:37.433
And now relive your nightmare

00:15:37.433 --> 00:15:41.166
as Cipher Interference doubles
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon's

00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:44.233
attack points once again!

00:15:44.233 --> 00:15:45.466
You'’’re kidding!

00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:47.100
This guy'’’s relentless!

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.100
Every time Yuya gets a leg up,
he kicks it out from under him!

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.733
He'’’s been able to counter
everything Yuya throws his way!

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.673
(roaring)

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.906
What a collision!

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.840
It took both monsters out!

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.773
And that's bad for Yuya
'cause Kite's

00:16:17.773 --> 00:16:20.706
still got one monster
left on his field!

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:23.640
I don'’’t see how Yuya
can win this!

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.506
I'’’ve done all that I can.

00:16:33.506 --> 00:16:35.740
I just can'’’t get through to him!

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.940
Use Rebellion Dragon'’’s
special ability.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.006
Huh?

00:16:39.006 --> 00:16:40.706
Go for it.

00:16:40.706 --> 00:16:43.040
It'’’s the only play
you have left!

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.940
I activate Rebellion Dragon'’’s
ability!

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.806
When this card leaves
the field,

00:16:49.806 --> 00:16:52.340
all cards in the Pendulum Zone
are destroyed,

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.306
and I can place Odd‐Eyes
Rebellion Dragon

00:16:54.306 --> 00:16:58.006
in one of those Zones.

00:16:58.006 --> 00:17:01.780
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon's
Pendulum ability activates,

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.246
so now I can take a Pendulum
card from my deck

00:17:04.246 --> 00:17:07.946
and place it in the other
Pendulum Zone.

00:17:07.946 --> 00:17:11.346
The card I choose is
Performapal Lebellman!

00:17:11.346 --> 00:17:13.613
With it, I set the Pendulum
Scale!

00:17:13.613 --> 00:17:17.613
I'’’m taking control of this duel,
starting now!

00:17:21.746 --> 00:17:23.880
Now I can summon as many
monsters

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.046
between Levels 1 and 4
as I like!

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:31.613
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.413
It'’’s go time, Timebreaker
Magician!

00:17:37.413 --> 00:17:40.846
Say hey,
Performapal Whim Witch!

00:17:40.846 --> 00:17:43.546
(thinking)
Those two monsters have
the same level.

00:17:43.546 --> 00:17:45.913
Is he going to
Xyz Summon again?

00:17:45.913 --> 00:17:47.646
(telepathy)
I really can't believe

00:17:47.646 --> 00:17:50.280
you'’’ve made it this far
by dueltaining.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.413
You still think you can
change Kite'’’s mind, huh?

00:17:53.413 --> 00:17:54.980
(telepathy)
Yeah, I do.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.380
But it'’’s much harder
than I thought.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.680
I'’’m barely hanging on.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.686
Maybe there's no way
to change his mind,

00:18:01.686 --> 00:18:04.086
to clear his heart of revenge.

00:18:04.086 --> 00:18:06.553
But that doesn'’’t mean
I'’’m going to stop trying.

00:18:06.553 --> 00:18:10.720
Well, if it means anything to
you, you'’’ve changed my mind.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.553
Look, if there's no way
to make you stop trying...

00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:16.686
then I'’’ll have to help you out.

00:18:16.686 --> 00:18:19.986
I have no desire to see you,
and especially me,

00:18:19.986 --> 00:18:21.620
turned into a card.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.186
You can't change him alone,

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:25.720
but maybe by the two of us
working together,

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.020
we can change make Kite
change his ways.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.786
You mean...

00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:31.953
I mean let's finish this
as a team.

00:18:31.953 --> 00:18:33.786
Let's go!
Let's go!

00:18:33.786 --> 00:18:37.786
Now, I activate Performapal
Lebellman'’’s Pendulum ability!

00:18:37.786 --> 00:18:39.720
(both) All right, Lebellman,
ring up an extra Level

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.553
for all of the monsters
that are on my field.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.886
(dinging)

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.020
Next, I overlay Level 4
Timebreaker Magician

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.886
with Performapal Whim Witch!

00:18:52.886 --> 00:18:55.053
Go!

00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:03.593
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective,

00:19:03.593 --> 00:19:06.493
I call upon the most dangerous
of Dragons!

00:19:07.993 --> 00:19:10.293
I Xyz Summon!

00:19:10.293 --> 00:19:11.960
Dark Rebellion!

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.493
XYZ Dragon!

00:19:17.293 --> 00:19:20.360
Wait.
Isn't that Yuto's?

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.560
That'’’s good.
You still remember.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.093
Back in school,
when Shay and I battled you,

00:19:27.093 --> 00:19:29.393
it was always my go‐to.

00:19:29.393 --> 00:19:33.660
Yuya, why do you have that
monster?

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.260
You stole it, from Yuto.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.726
That must be it!
You thief!

00:19:40.726 --> 00:19:42.593
Or maybe not.

00:19:42.593 --> 00:19:44.560
Why do I sense Yuto'’’s here?

00:19:47.226 --> 00:19:51.160
Stop the duel!

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.960
Yuya'’’s our friend.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.360
Is that...?

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.526
It'’’s Shay!

00:19:56.526 --> 00:19:58.793
Isn'’’t it great, Kite?

00:19:58.793 --> 00:20:01.300
Shay'’’s gotten these nice
duelists to help our cause!

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.866
I know what
you'’’re thinking.

00:20:02.866 --> 00:20:05.066
Three duelists isn't
exactly an army,

00:20:05.066 --> 00:20:07.066
but still...
it's something!

00:20:07.066 --> 00:20:09.466
So then...

00:20:09.466 --> 00:20:12.000
They aren'’’t the enemy?

00:20:15.133 --> 00:20:17.933
No, they aren'’’t.
Believe me.

00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:20.633
They fight for what
we fight for,

00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:24.466
to put a stop to Duel Academy'’’s
destructive ways.

00:20:24.466 --> 00:20:26.633
How do you know this
to be true, Shay?

00:20:26.633 --> 00:20:28.066
How are you sure?

00:20:28.066 --> 00:20:31.166
Because Yuya Sakaki
saved my skin

00:20:31.166 --> 00:20:33.200
more times than I can count.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.366
Sakaki?
Come back with us.

00:20:36.366 --> 00:20:38.933
Please, Kite.
We've missed you.

00:20:38.933 --> 00:20:40.500
That'’’s too bad.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.166
I'’’m much better being off
on my own!

00:20:43.166 --> 00:20:45.133
(roaring)

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.040
Huh?

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.873
(thinking)
Kite?

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.440
Kite, he'’’s... gone!

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.073
Not good.

00:21:21.073 --> 00:21:23.273
If Kite's not on our side,

00:21:23.273 --> 00:21:25.573
we'’’ve got a whole new problem
to deal with.
