(Yuri)
Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.966
and the rest
of your life points!

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.733
Ahh...

00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.300
(grunting)

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.100
Game over, Sora.

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.600
(Yugo)
Don't even think about it!

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.600
(laughing)
<i>You're too late.</i>

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.466
<i>Zuzu's already under</i>
<i>my control.</i>

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.066
(Yuya)
You leave Zuzu alone!

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.466
Huh?
Huh?

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:37.066
I Xyz Summon
Odd‐Eyes Raging Dragon!

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:37.933
This is bad!

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.766
(Yuto/Yuya)
Go, Infernal Fury Strike!

00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.266
(screaming)

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:48.766
(Yuya)
Celina! Lulu! Wait!

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.600
(Shay)
Stop them, Yuya.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.600
(Yuya)
Hold up!

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.366
Ah, Yuya Sakaki.

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.600
We finally meet in person.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.940
Zuzu!
Huh?

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.606
(laughing)

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:05.073
I'm pleased to report that

00:01:05.073 --> 00:01:07.873
<i>Yuya Sakaki is safely</i>
<i>in custody.</i>

00:01:07.873 --> 00:01:10.673
(Leo)
At long last, Yusho.

00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:12.173

Sora, I can take it from here.

Whoa, Sora?
You're on our side?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.246
So, uh, you okay?

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:24.346
You've looked better.

00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:26.246
Thanks, but I'll be all right,
just needed a rest.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.646
Well, well, well, if it isn't
the three losers,

00:02:30.646 --> 00:02:33.746
Sora, Aster and...
Oh, wait a sec, have we met?

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:35.946
I'm so bad at
remembering the names

00:02:35.946 --> 00:02:38.213
of those who are way below me.

00:02:38.213 --> 00:02:40.780
Enough with the yappin'
ya creep.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.246
Why don't you go ahead
and zip your lip

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.813
before I go and zip it for you!

00:02:45.813 --> 00:02:48.413
Uh, it's not my fault
you're not worthy of me

00:02:48.413 --> 00:02:50.580
remembering who you are.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.813
Mind if we hash this out
after I'm through with Sora?

00:02:53.813 --> 00:02:55.446
Forget it!

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:57.580
You and I are gonna
settle this right now!

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.246
What about rescuing Rin?

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:01.986
We have to track down the guy
who's controlling her.

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:02.920
Then get tracking.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.420
Me!?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.186
As long as this creep
is creeping around

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:09.286
Duel Academy's halls,
none of us will ever be safe!

00:03:09.286 --> 00:03:11.353
Now get moving!
I'm counting on you!

00:03:11.353 --> 00:03:15.086
All right,
but be careful, Yugo!

00:03:15.086 --> 00:03:19.186
Since you're so gung ho
to make a fool of yourself...

00:03:19.186 --> 00:03:21.153
I'll be delighted to duel you.

00:03:21.153 --> 00:03:22.953
I've had a few victories today,

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:25.420
but for some reason
it's not enough.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.420
Maybe because
I won using an Honor Deck.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.786
Think I'll
change things up again

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:33.286
and go back to using my trusty
old Predaplant deck.

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:35.953
I'm sure you don't have
any objections,

00:03:35.953 --> 00:03:37.453
or is it a no‐go?

00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:39.953
My name is Yugo,
got it!?

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:41.420
Now let's get duelin'!?

00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:51.853
My dad!

00:03:51.853 --> 00:03:55.386
♪♪♪

00:03:55.386 --> 00:03:59.386
It's been a long time,
hasn't it, Leo?

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:00.793
A long time?

00:04:00.793 --> 00:04:03.493
Does my dad actually
know this guy!?

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.193
Leo... Akaba...

00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:07.960
Huh?

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.260
You're fine, Riley.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.126
Riley?

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:16.860
Leo, how could you do this?

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.060
The Leo I know
would never harm others.

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:22.826
Then maybe you never
knew me at all.

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:25.593
But if you're going to
keep this up, my friend,

00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:28.293
I'll have no choice
but to stop you here and now.

00:04:28.293 --> 00:04:29.860
Careful!

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.193
My dear Leo...

00:04:31.193 --> 00:04:34.393
How could the creator
of the ARC system,

00:04:34.393 --> 00:04:37.093
who brought smiles
to so many faces

00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:39.793
now want to go and hurt people?

00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:43.093
Your technology
unleashed a revolution.

00:04:43.093 --> 00:04:45.793
It made Action Dueling possible.

00:04:45.793 --> 00:04:48.726
Not to mention
my dueltaining career!

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:53.560
Yes, the day that we met
would change my life forever.

00:04:58.793 --> 00:05:00.666
(growling)

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:06.266
This is absolutely incredible.

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:07.800
I can actually
touch this monster.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.233
That's right!

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:10.666
Yusho, this is going to
take dueling

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:12.900
to an entirely new level.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.200
(Yusho)
It feels like yesterday
that you and I teamed up

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.500
to bring the ARC
system to perfection.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.766
Your system grew so advanced
that it inspired me

00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:24.166
to add a dash of raz
and sprinkle of mataz

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:26.800
to create
a new style of dueling.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.633
Leo, it's no exaggeration to say

00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:33.033
that every action duelist
and dueltainer competing today

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:36.066
owes their career to you and
your remarkable achievements.

00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:39.300
I am grateful to have met you,
and I always will be.

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:43.733
So, my Dad and Leo Akaba
used to be friends?

00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:46.966
But... I'm baffled, Leo.

00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:49.166
How does a genius like you,

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:51.933
a genius who invented
ARC technology,

00:05:51.933 --> 00:05:54.900
not see how futile it is
to try to achieve peace

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.466
by hurting other people.

00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:58.933
I am no genius, Yusho.

00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:01.040
In fact, I am not
the one responsible

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.806
for inventing
ARC technology either.

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:05.573
But that's impossible.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:09.306
I saw you working on the ARC
prototype with my very eyes.

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:11.873
No, you are mistaken
because it was originally

00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:13.706
invented in a world...

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.640
that no longer exists.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.706
A world that no longer exists?

00:06:21.706 --> 00:06:23.840
(gasping)

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.606
How can a world
no longer exist?

00:06:26.606 --> 00:06:29.973
Allow me to explain, Yusho.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:33.106
Haven't you ever wondered why
each of the four dimensions

00:06:33.106 --> 00:06:34.773
has a different
summoning method?

00:06:34.773 --> 00:06:37.673
It's because all four dimensions

00:06:37.673 --> 00:06:40.506
used to exist as one‐‐

00:06:40.506 --> 00:06:42.206
before they were separated.

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:47.640
(Leo)
In this world,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.673
hologram technology
already existed...

00:06:51.673 --> 00:06:54.906
but it was still
in an early stage.

00:06:54.906 --> 00:06:57.940
So stale, so lo‐res...

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.713
so stiff, so fake.

00:07:00.713 --> 00:07:02.613
But I saw potential.

00:07:02.613 --> 00:07:04.946
If I could improve
that technology

00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:08.413
to make them more lifelike,
you'd never be able to tell

00:07:08.413 --> 00:07:11.046
what's real from a hologram.

00:07:11.046 --> 00:07:13.580
It would revolutionize
the world.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.513
And more importantly,
I would be famous.

00:07:19.046 --> 00:07:22.713
But how could
I make a huge splash?

00:07:22.713 --> 00:07:23.946
And then it hit me.

00:07:23.946 --> 00:07:28.246
With the hottest game
in the land, Duel Monsters.

00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:31.780
Instead of their current
static lo‐rez monsters,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.180
they would be living,
breathing monsters.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.246
Imagine feeling
the sling of the sword,

00:07:38.246 --> 00:07:41.480
the heat of the dragon's flames.

00:07:42.613 --> 00:07:45.213
Ideas were bubbling
uncontrollably.

00:07:45.213 --> 00:07:48.880
So I threw myself
into my work...

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.180
and I succeeded.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.546
At first
I couldn't believe my eyes.

00:07:53.546 --> 00:07:56.380
The duel monsters generated by
my ARC system

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.320
seemed completely real,
down to the smallest of details.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.786
While the system was engaged,
it was impossible

00:08:03.786 --> 00:08:05.353
to tell them apart
from living,

00:08:05.353 --> 00:08:08.320
real‐world creatures.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.720
It was greater than
I ever could have imagined.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.286
During my research,
I made a surprising discovery.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:18.620
The monsters generated by
my ARC system produced faint,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.753
but detectable vital signs.

00:08:20.753 --> 00:08:23.853
They clearly reacted to
outside stimuli,

00:08:23.853 --> 00:08:26.286
but I couldn't explain why.

00:08:26.286 --> 00:08:28.886
The thought occurred to me
that perhaps these monsters

00:08:28.886 --> 00:08:31.486
were more than zeros and ones,

00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:35.120
but I cast the thought aside
as a silly lapse in judgment.

00:08:45.486 --> 00:08:49.220
When my ARC system finally
made its public debut,

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.720
it caused a sensation.

00:08:53.153 --> 00:08:56.386
(roaring)

00:08:56.386 --> 00:08:57.586
(crowd cheering)

00:08:57.586 --> 00:08:59.553
Crowds went wild
with excitement,

00:08:59.553 --> 00:09:02.493
and I was celebrated
as a genius.

00:09:02.493 --> 00:09:04.726
Experts proclaimed
that my ARC system

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:08.126
was the greatest
breakthrough of the century.

00:09:08.126 --> 00:09:11.093
But, no one could foresee

00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:13.760
that my invention
would lead to disaster.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.393
Disaster?

00:09:16.393 --> 00:09:20.160
Unknowingly, I had unleashed
a force I couldn't control.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.826
And the trouble
all began with him.

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:27.093
He didn't stick out
from the others at first.

00:09:27.093 --> 00:09:29.160
There was nothing great
about him,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.826
but that would change.

00:09:31.826 --> 00:09:37.160
Soon he began to pile up
victory after victory.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.093
This duelist
claimed he was unbeatable

00:09:40.093 --> 00:09:42.860
because he could hear his
monsters speaking to him.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.426
And it seemed to be true.

00:09:45.426 --> 00:09:49.260
His fighting was more exciting
and fierce than anyone else.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.060
Until one day...

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:56.360
Ahh!

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.800
(Emcee)
Pahow!He hit him
with his own monster!

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.533
Ooh.

00:10:03.533 --> 00:10:05.633
(laughs)
Yeah!

00:10:05.633 --> 00:10:08.533
(cheering)

00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:13.866
(Leo)
The crowd ate it up.

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:16.466
They demanded more action.

00:10:16.466 --> 00:10:19.566
More KO's,
more brutality.

00:10:19.566 --> 00:10:22.000
More, more, more!

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.300
And he was more
than happy to oblige.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.033
Ahh!

00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:33.133
(screaming)

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:36.833
(Leo)
In fact, he took great joy
in crushing his opponents

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:40.833
in even more brutal,
spectacular ways!

00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:42.733
And the more brutal
the takedown,

00:10:42.733 --> 00:10:45.300
the more the crowd cheered,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.833
He became the most popular
duelist the world had ever seen.

00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:52.833
Everyone on the planet
knew his name.

00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:55.633
Z‐ARC!

00:10:55.633 --> 00:10:57.700
(both)
What's a Z‐ARC?!

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.306
(Leo)
To please his fans,
Z‐ARC kept upping the stakes!

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:03.906
Always pushing the boundaries,
more and more,

00:11:03.906 --> 00:11:06.073
by learning new
summoning methods

00:11:06.073 --> 00:11:08.873
to summon
even more brutal monsters.

00:11:08.873 --> 00:11:12.806
Fusion, Synchro, Xyz.

00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:15.006
He learned
and mastered them all

00:11:15.006 --> 00:11:17.540
and soon he became unstoppable.

00:11:21.406 --> 00:11:23.373
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:11:23.373 --> 00:11:24.973
(Yugo)
I'm up first!

00:11:24.973 --> 00:11:27.073
Since I have no cards
on my field,

00:11:27.073 --> 00:11:30.973
I can activate
the spell card Speedraw!

00:11:30.973 --> 00:11:32.806
This spell gets me
off to a quick start

00:11:32.806 --> 00:11:34.606
by letting me draw
two cards.

00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:38.006
But then I have to discard
one Speedroid to the graveyard.

00:11:38.006 --> 00:11:40.673
Next, I'll summon
Speedroid Double Yoyo

00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:46.373
and use its special ability to
summon Speedroid Tri‐Eyed Dice!

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.040
Here I go!

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.973
Level 3 Tri‐Eyed Dice

00:11:49.973 --> 00:11:52.606
tunes Level 4
Double Yoyo.

00:11:52.606 --> 00:11:57.273
Beat your wings to whip up
a whirlwind of destruction!

00:11:58.173 --> 00:12:00.380
I Synchro Summon!

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.880
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.146
Huh?

00:12:11.146 --> 00:12:14.913
I play three cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:12:14.913 --> 00:12:18.346
That Dragon was spectacular.

00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:20.746
So shimmery
and dazzling.

00:12:20.746 --> 00:12:22.880
The moment it appeared,
I felt the urge

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.913
to eviscerate it
with a Dragon of my own.

00:12:25.913 --> 00:12:28.380
And that's exactly what I'll do!

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.880
I draw!

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.713
Look at what I have here:

00:12:32.713 --> 00:12:34.746
the spell card
Polymerization.

00:12:34.746 --> 00:12:37.246
And now,
I'm activating it to fuse

00:12:37.246 --> 00:12:41.413
Predaplant Flytrap with
Predaplant Moray Bepenthes!

00:12:41.413 --> 00:12:44.546
Your Synchro Dragon
may look impressive,

00:12:44.546 --> 00:12:46.146
but I'm afraid
it's no match

00:12:46.146 --> 00:12:51.946
for the toxic predator
I'm calling to the field!

00:12:51.946 --> 00:12:54.146
I Fusion Summon!

00:12:54.146 --> 00:12:58.646
The vicious, voracious,
and venomous...

00:12:58.646 --> 00:13:01.586
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:13:05.186 --> 00:13:06.120
Whoa!

00:13:08.386 --> 00:13:10.253
No!
Riley, what's wrong?

00:13:10.253 --> 00:13:12.353
Declan...

00:13:12.353 --> 00:13:13.953
it's something bad.

00:13:13.953 --> 00:13:15.253
(panicked grunting)

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.720
(Declan)
Riley has always been able

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.853
to sense things
others could not.

00:13:18.853 --> 00:13:23.086
What is it that has
Riley so spooked?

00:13:23.086 --> 00:13:24.820
(grunting)

00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:28.953
(laughing)

00:13:28.953 --> 00:13:30.820
(roaring)

00:13:34.886 --> 00:13:36.486
(screaming)

00:13:38.053 --> 00:13:39.953
(panting)

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:41.820
What's going on?

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.853
(Kite)
Shay...

00:13:49.853 --> 00:13:51.820
Hey, Shay,
can you hear me!?

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.553
Come on, pal,
you gotta wake up.

00:13:53.553 --> 00:13:56.953
(grunting)

00:13:56.953 --> 00:14:00.460
Someone named The Doctor
is controlling Lulu's mind.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.793
I've been trying
to hunt him down but no luck.

00:14:02.793 --> 00:14:06.293
Listen up, guys,
I got good news.

00:14:06.293 --> 00:14:08.660
I found out where the guy
who's been scrambling

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.126
everyone's brains
is hiding out.

00:14:10.126 --> 00:14:12.493
Good, lead the way.

00:14:12.493 --> 00:14:14.526
Lulu's still in bad shape.

00:14:14.526 --> 00:14:16.593
You mean she's
still brainwashed?

00:14:16.593 --> 00:14:18.960
I thought Shay had
fixed her all up.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.660
I failed, but I had Yuya
chase after her and Celina.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.126
He's gonna need your help.

00:14:25.126 --> 00:14:27.726
Yuya?
Let's go.

00:14:27.726 --> 00:14:29.760
Quickly, there's not much time.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.593
(whimpering)

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.926
(grunting)

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.793
(Leo)
Yes, Z‐ARC was
truly unstoppable.

00:14:43.793 --> 00:14:46.560
By mastering
all the summoning methods,

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.726
he defeated every opponent
until he stood alone

00:14:49.726 --> 00:14:51.593
at the pinnacle
of the dueling world.

00:14:51.593 --> 00:14:55.260
There was no one left
for him to duel.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
No one left to challenge.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.566
But he still was not satisfied.

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.800
Who wants to battle!?

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.066
There must be somebody
willing to challenge me!

00:15:05.066 --> 00:15:07.500
Or are you all too
frightened to lose?!

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.566
Come on, challenge me!

00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:13.066
Someone step up
and challenge me!

00:15:13.066 --> 00:15:15.533
We want some more
smashin' and bashin'!

00:15:15.533 --> 00:15:17.400
Yeah, come on!
Somebody duel him already!

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.766
We wanna see more!

00:15:18.766 --> 00:15:20.600
More action!
More KO's!

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.966
(crowd chanting)
More! More! More!

00:15:21.966 --> 00:15:25.000
Yes! Yes! Duel me!
Challenge me!

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.366
Let me crush you!

00:15:27.366 --> 00:15:30.433
If no one will challenge me,
then I will challenge you!

00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:32.266
I challenge the whole world!

00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:34.733
I will destroy you all!

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:37.566
Yes, yes,
I will destroy you all!

00:15:37.566 --> 00:15:40.833
My four dragons
thirst for a fight!

00:15:40.833 --> 00:15:42.700
(roaring throughout)

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.933
(crowd screaming)

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:51.733
(roaring continues)

00:15:57.133 --> 00:15:58.933
(crowd screaming)

00:16:03.473 --> 00:16:06.940
(Leo)
The crowd wanted
the brutalist duels.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.440
So, Z‐ARC gave it to them
in the worst way imaginable.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.440
Z‐ARC and his dragons were both
one in mind and spirit.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.273
So as Z‐ARC unleashed his fury
on the world,

00:16:18.273 --> 00:16:21.340
so did his dragons.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.406
(screaming)

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:30.173
How can this be?

00:16:30.173 --> 00:16:33.340
I can feel fury,
not just from Z‐ARC,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.773
but also from the dragons.

00:16:35.773 --> 00:16:38.173
Huh?

00:16:38.173 --> 00:16:40.673
(Leo)
And that's when I realized
that with my ARC technology,

00:16:40.673 --> 00:16:42.840
I didn't create mere holograms.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.006
I created
real‐life monsters!

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:49.540
These dragons with their
own desires and emotions.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.706
And they desired
to destroy us all.

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:54.806
We did our best to stop them,

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:59.140
but no army, no weaponry,
could stand up to them.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.313
I could only blame myself.

00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:05.313
What had I done?
What had I created?

00:17:05.313 --> 00:17:08.046
The unbelievable devastation...

00:17:08.046 --> 00:17:10.513
but it was only
the beginning.

00:17:10.513 --> 00:17:12.546
(roaring)

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.080
(roaring throughout)

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.646
Yes, I agree.

00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:36.746
We do need a bigger challenge!

00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:38.780
Let us become one

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.713
and challenge
the whole universe!

00:17:41.713 --> 00:17:44.480
Now, let us...

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.813
merge!

00:17:45.813 --> 00:17:46.946
Yuya!

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.980
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.780
Astrograph Sorcerer,
master of time and space...

00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:02.320
(Z‐ARC)
I call on you to use
your mystical powers

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.853
to reshape us
into a single unstoppable force!

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.353
It's time to...

00:18:14.353 --> 00:18:15.386
(Yuto)
Reunite.

00:18:16.186 --> 00:18:18.153
Yuya...

00:18:18.153 --> 00:18:20.153
It's like
he's possessed
or something, Kite.

00:18:20.153 --> 00:18:21.253
(roaring)

00:18:22.353 --> 00:18:23.620
Reunite!

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.086
Reunite!

00:18:25.086 --> 00:18:26.853
(all)
Reunite as one!

00:18:27.853 --> 00:18:29.520
Reunite as one!

00:18:30.286 --> 00:18:31.520
(laughing)

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.286
Finally time... to reunite.

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:40.886
Reunite...

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:42.520
Resurrect...

00:18:43.953 --> 00:18:47.520
It's like...
what happened before!

00:18:49.386 --> 00:18:50.586
Reunite...

00:18:50.586 --> 00:18:51.386
Reunite...

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.853
(Yuya/Yuto)
Reunite... Reunite!

00:18:55.853 --> 00:18:58.186
As one!

00:18:58.186 --> 00:19:00.093
This is getting freaky!

00:19:02.926 --> 00:19:07.326
It's time...
to become one!

00:19:07.326 --> 00:19:12.060
(loud explosion)

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.926
(roaring throughout)

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.793
(energy crackling)

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.693
Oh, no... stop!

00:19:51.193 --> 00:19:53.226
(growling)

00:19:57.893 --> 00:20:02.933
The four dragons and Z‐ARC
have combined and formed as one.

00:20:02.933 --> 00:20:06.066
(maniacal laughter)

00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:07.900
Kneel before Z‐ARC!

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.933
Kneel before your master!

00:20:10.933 --> 00:20:12.733
(maniacal laughter)

00:20:15.633 --> 00:20:17.833
He became all‐powerful.

00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:19.433
(Leo)
Exactly.

00:20:19.433 --> 00:20:21.633
By combining
the most powerful dragons

00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:23.233
of each summoning method,

00:20:23.233 --> 00:20:26.133
Standard, Fusion,
Synchro, and Xyz,

00:20:26.133 --> 00:20:29.366
Z‐ARC was no longer mortal.

00:20:29.366 --> 00:20:32.866
He transcended
both human and monster.

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:36.033
He became Supreme King Z‐ARC!

00:20:36.033 --> 00:20:39.533
Ahh!

00:20:39.533 --> 00:20:40.933
(whimpering)

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.566
(maniacal laughter)

00:20:50.566 --> 00:20:52.333
What's wrong, humans?

00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:55.366
I thought you wanted
a more brutal duel!

00:20:55.366 --> 00:20:57.900
(maniacal laughter)

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.106
(Leo)
The days that followed were an
endless nightmare of suffering.

00:21:08.106 --> 00:21:10.873
Supreme King Z‐ARC's
power seemed limitless.

00:21:10.873 --> 00:21:13.140
His cruelty knew no bounds.

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.506
(Duelist)
Z‐ARC, stand down!

00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:22.073
Or we'll force
you to stand down!

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:25.906
Oh, yes, I would so love
for you humans to try!

00:21:25.906 --> 00:21:29.106
(maniacal laughter)

00:21:29.106 --> 00:21:31.940
Ahh!

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.873
(screaming)

00:21:34.873 --> 00:21:36.340
(wind raging)

00:21:37.506 --> 00:21:39.340
(screaming throughout)

00:21:49.106 --> 00:21:52.506
This was all my fault,
all my doing.

00:21:52.506 --> 00:21:56.406
Therefore it was my
responsibility to end it.

00:21:56.406 --> 00:21:58.906
I had to put a stop to him.

00:21:58.906 --> 00:22:02.113
Even if I had to pay
the ultimate price.

00:22:02.813 --> 00:22:04.346
No!

00:22:04.346 --> 00:22:06.080
I don't want
to hear any more!

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.946
Relax, Riley.

00:22:07.946 --> 00:22:09.746
He's making this
whole fairytale up.

00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:11.446
You're wrong!

00:22:11.446 --> 00:22:13.080
Everything I've told
you is true!

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.546
(gasping)

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.180
I wish this was all
just a made‐up story, Declan.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.946
But I saw it
with my own eyes.

00:22:24.113 --> 00:22:27.380
I was willing to pay
with my life to stop Z‐ARC.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.413
But little did I know that
I and the whole universe

00:22:30.413 --> 00:22:32.746
would have to pay
an even steeper price!
