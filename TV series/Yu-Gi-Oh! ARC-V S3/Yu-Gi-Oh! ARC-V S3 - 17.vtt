WEBVTT

00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.766
Class, pay attention.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.866
This will be
on the final exam‐‐ Ahh!

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.833
Is it multiple choice?

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.866
Sure hope it is.
I ace those!

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.233
I always answer "C",
as in "See ya later"!

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.000
Hey, you!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.866
Ever think
of taking Driver's Ed?!

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.400
Of course not!
Never needed it!

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.600
Watch out!
Coming through!

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.433
But what I do need is a...

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:28.433
geography lesson!

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:29.700
Where am I?!

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.166
(Doctor)
Professor,
unknown individuals

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.933
have landed
on the island!

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.566
Very good.
I expected as much,

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.633
so no need to worry.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:44.400
But, Yusho Sakaki,
you and your friends

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.866
have much
to be worried about.

(Yusho)
So here we are...

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.280
Duel Academy.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.246
(Alexis)
Something's not right.

00:02:08.246 --> 00:02:10.713
This place is
usually crawling
with security guards.

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:12.113
Mm‐hmm.

00:02:12.113 --> 00:02:14.913
There's certainly no hustle
or bustle brewing about,

00:02:14.913 --> 00:02:18.713
but perhaps we shouldn't
look a gift horse
in the mouth, Alexis.

00:02:18.713 --> 00:02:20.113
I guess.

00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:22.213
No more wasting time.

00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:24.946
There's the tower
where they're
holding Lulu hostage!

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:26.546
I'm going in.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.080
Hold up!

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.980
I said hold up,
not hold me down.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.613
Sorry, got confused.

00:02:33.613 --> 00:02:36.046
Alexis, call off
your dog!

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:37.646
I'm on your side!

00:02:37.646 --> 00:02:39.213
Fine, I'll let you up,

00:02:39.213 --> 00:02:41.713
but don't try
anything funny.

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:44.280
I've no time
for you anyway.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.313
Huh!
What's your problem?

00:02:46.313 --> 00:02:48.380
Yugo?
How'd you get here?

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.846
I didn't see you
on the boat.

00:02:49.846 --> 00:02:51.213
The "yuze".

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.246
Zuzu's bracelet
started glowing again,

00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:54.980
and zip, zap, zam,
here I am.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.746
Uh, forget I asked.

00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:57.980
Glad you're
here, though.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.913
Where is here anyway?

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:02.120
Duel Academy.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.453
Ahh!

00:03:03.453 --> 00:03:04.686
You didn't just say
Duel Academy, did you?!

00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:06.353
I did.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.153
And we know where
your dear friend Rin is.

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:10.220
What?!

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.153
Tell me where she is
right now!

00:03:12.153 --> 00:03:13.486
They've got her
locked up

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:15.486
in the east
tower somewhere.

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:18.320
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?!

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.020
(chuckles)

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.720
They have their missions,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.386
now what do you say
we go and tackle ours?

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:30.586
Yeah, let's do this.

00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:33.320
(Yusho)
Time to go meet Leo.

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:38.986
Alrighty!

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:42.953
Penthouse suite,
I'm coming your way!

00:03:42.953 --> 00:03:44.786
Hang in there, RinRin!

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:54.553
(Kite)
Don't worry, Shay,

00:03:54.553 --> 00:03:57.320
I'll free your sister
and have her home by dinner!

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.293
I just can't believe it.

00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:06.626
I can't believe Celina
kidnapped Zuzu.

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:08.160
Facts is facts.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.593
Duel Academy's got
Celina and Zuzu,

00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:13.026
and also Shay's
sister Lulu.

00:04:13.026 --> 00:04:15.160
Yeah, and let's not forget

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.426
about Yugo's friend
Rin either

00:04:17.426 --> 00:04:20.260
Yuya, if Rin's here,
Yugo can't be far behind.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.493
I'm sure he'll
join our fight.

00:04:22.493 --> 00:04:25.560
But why do we even have to
fight in the first place?

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.260
And why's the Professor
after every Zuzu look‐a‐like?

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.560
Sora, you've talked to him.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.460
Remember anything else
he said?

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.193
Even something that
didn't sound important

00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:35.593
at the time
could be a big clue.

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:37.926
Sorry, Yuya.
I really don't.

00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:39.893
All I know
is what you know.

00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:42.326
That the Professor started
the Arc Area Project

00:04:42.326 --> 00:04:44.626
to combine the four
dimensions into one.

00:04:44.626 --> 00:04:46.826
But beyond that?
He didn't tell me.

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:48.893
But he specifically
went after anyone

00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:50.526
who looked like Zuzu.

00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:53.193
And that tells Gong
that them there four girls

00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:55.326
are the key
to the Professor's plans

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:58.393
for his Arc Area Project.

00:04:58.393 --> 00:05:00.626
(Sora)
Wow, Gong.

00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:02.766
You sounded intelligent
for once.

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:04.000
But you're right.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.433
Four girls,
four dimensions,

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:07.100
one girl from each dimension.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.766
The Professor must
really need them

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:11.766
to carry out his Project,
and he now has 'em all.

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:14.766
But this is also the key
to stopping his plans!

00:05:14.766 --> 00:05:16.033
What do you mean?

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:16.966
Gong's reckonin'

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:19.033
that if we
rescue 'em all,

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:21.966
the Arc Area Project comes
to a complete standstill!

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:23.766
You're right.

00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:26.800
So our one and only mission
is to go save our friends!

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.200
Yeah!
Okay!

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.133
I am the guardian
of the west tower... Diana.

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:43.933
Lulu's in there,
isn't she?

00:05:43.933 --> 00:05:46.133
Unless you defeat me first,

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:48.833
you'll never get
the chance to find out!

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:51.966
Well then, what are
we waiting for?

00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:53.466
(both)
Let's duel!

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:55.700
I shall make
the first move.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.233
And with it I activate...
Polymerization!

00:06:00.233 --> 00:06:02.473
And with it I shall
fuse Guardian Baou

00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:04.206
and Penumbral
Soldier Lady!

00:06:04.206 --> 00:06:06.240
When this righteous,
slashing sword

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.640
shines in the blinding
bright lunar light,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.140
the two warriors
become one!

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.973
I Fusion Summon...
Penumbral Keeper!

00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:17.506
Hyah!

00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:21.840
Next, Penumbral
Keeper strengthens
my and her defenses

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.040
by summoning
a Keeper Shield Token!

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.240
As long as I have
this Token,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.673
you're not allowed to
attack Penumbral Keeper.

00:06:31.673 --> 00:06:34.173
It's your move.

00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:35.340
Hmm!

00:06:40.973 --> 00:06:44.240
RinRin, I'm here
to save you!

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.973
I am the guardian
of the eastern
tower... Apollo!

00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:52.840
Zip it!

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.040
I don't care if you're
a hollow or a swallow!

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.740
I only want one thing
from you, Geezer Caesar
and that's Rin!

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.373
Now be a pal
and go get her!

00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:02.580
If you want her
so badly,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.146
then you are first
going to have
to defeat me.

00:07:06.146 --> 00:07:09.346
Well, that isn't
going to be a problem.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:13.313
I hope you and your toga
are ready to tussle!

00:07:13.313 --> 00:07:15.180
(both)
Let's duel!

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.013
I shall take
the first turn,
young man.

00:07:18.013 --> 00:07:22.213
And with it, I activate
Polymerization!

00:07:22.213 --> 00:07:26.180
I fuse Guardian Tryce
and Luminous Soldier!

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.146
When their glistening
swords shine in the sun,

00:07:29.146 --> 00:07:33.013
my two brave battlers
shall become one!

00:07:33.013 --> 00:07:37.280
I Fusion Summon...
Luminous Keeper!

00:07:39.813 --> 00:07:43.113
I activate
Luminous Keeper's
special ability,

00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:46.046
which strengthens
my and its defenses

00:07:46.046 --> 00:07:48.580
by summoning
a Keeper Shield Token!

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.613
When this Token
is in my possession,

00:07:50.613 --> 00:07:52.880
Luminous Keeper
cannot be vanquished.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.780
With that, I place
one card facedown
and end my turn!

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.480
All right, then I'm up!

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.720
For starters, I activate
he spell card
Speedroid Scratch!

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.953
By discarding
one Speedroid,

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:11.086
I can get
a different Speedroid!

00:08:11.086 --> 00:08:14.820
And this new one
is exactly what I wanted!

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.220
By summoning Speedroid
Double Yoyo...

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.220
I can bring back another
Speedroid from my graveyard,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.486
The Tuner Monster, Speedroid
Den‐Den Daiko Duke!

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.086
And now Level 3 Speedroid
Den‐Den Daiko Duke

00:08:31.086 --> 00:08:34.053
tunes with Level 4
Speedroid Double Yoyo!

00:08:34.053 --> 00:08:38.553
I Synchro Summon
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.586
(roars)

00:08:43.586 --> 00:08:45.753
It's my turn!

00:08:45.753 --> 00:08:47.920
And I'll start it off

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.020
by summoning
Cipher Wing!

00:08:53.153 --> 00:08:56.486
And when I have
one Cipher Wing
out on my field,

00:08:56.486 --> 00:08:58.820
I can summon another
one from my hand

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.960
to come out
and join it!

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.093
Next up...

00:09:03.093 --> 00:09:06.926
I activate the spell
card Double Exposure.

00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:09.426
Which means
my Cipher Wings Levels

00:09:09.426 --> 00:09:11.893
double to 8!

00:09:11.893 --> 00:09:15.560
I overlay my two
Level 8 Cipher Wings

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.560
in order to build...

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.426
the Overlay Network!

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:22.760
I Xyz Summon...

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.760
Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon!

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.926
(roars)

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.993
You have begun
by summoning your
strongest monster first!

00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:47.393
You're obviously trying
to end this duel quickly,

00:09:47.393 --> 00:09:49.693
but I prefer
we have a little fun.

00:09:49.693 --> 00:09:51.593
(both)
I activate...

00:09:51.593 --> 00:09:55.393
the trap Admiration
Of The Keepers!

00:09:55.393 --> 00:09:59.593
This card negates Clear
Wing Synchro Dragon's
special abilities...

00:09:59.593 --> 00:10:01.200
while it also summons

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.700
two Keeper Shield
Tokens to my field!

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.266
(roars)

00:10:06.266 --> 00:10:08.400
(Diana)
Your Dragon doesn't
have much bite now...

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.766
and with two more
Keeper Shield tokens
added to my field,

00:10:11.766 --> 00:10:13.366
it wouldn't matter
if it did!

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:16.500
But your monster
is allowed to attack

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.866
all my Tokens at once.

00:10:18.866 --> 00:10:21.866
And I strongly suggest
that you do...

00:10:21.866 --> 00:10:23.800
or it will be
automatically destroyed.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.833
So are you going
to attack or not?

00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:29.966
The choice seems
rather simple to me.

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:31.933
You certainly wouldn't
want to lose

00:10:31.933 --> 00:10:34.900
your most powerful
monster, now would you?

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.066
I know you're
trying to trap me,

00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:39.966
but I never have
and I never will
fight scared!

00:10:39.966 --> 00:10:42.733
Galaxy‐Eyes, take out
one of her Tokens!

00:10:42.733 --> 00:10:46.233
Cipher Stream
of Destruction!

00:10:46.233 --> 00:10:47.666
Go time!

00:10:47.666 --> 00:10:49.733
Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon,

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:55.200
blast away his Token!

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.000
(both)
Hmm!

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.100
(Apollo)
You fool!
You triggered

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.373
Luminous Keeper's
special ability!

00:11:01.373 --> 00:11:04.106
By destroying
my Keeper Shield Token,

00:11:04.106 --> 00:11:06.373
your Dragon loses
800 attack points,

00:11:06.373 --> 00:11:10.306
and you also take
800 points of damage!

00:11:10.306 --> 00:11:11.673
Ha ha ha ha!

00:11:11.673 --> 00:11:13.540
Now you realize
your dilemma!

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.006
You must
keep attacking

00:11:15.006 --> 00:11:16.673
if you want your
monster to live,

00:11:16.673 --> 00:11:17.873
but every time
it does so,

00:11:17.873 --> 00:11:21.473
it and your life
points grow weaker!

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:23.140
Feeling the burn yet?

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.306
Oh, I'm fired up alright.

00:11:25.306 --> 00:11:27.606
You have set
Penumbral Keeper's

00:11:27.606 --> 00:11:29.940
special ability
in motion!

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.373
Unfortunately for you,
by destroying my Token,

00:11:32.373 --> 00:11:35.906
your monster loses
800 attack points!

00:11:35.906 --> 00:11:38.840
But fortunately for me,
I gain 800 life points!

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.073
Heh heh heh!

00:11:41.073 --> 00:11:43.740
So the more
of my Tokens
that you destroy,

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.973
the more attack points
your monster loses,

00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:48.973
and the more
life points I gain.

00:11:48.973 --> 00:11:51.640
Are you still
eager to attack?

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.773
I'm still eager to beat you!

00:11:53.773 --> 00:11:57.506
There is only one way
for you to stop losing
more life points

00:11:57.506 --> 00:11:59.473
and that way is
by ending your turn,

00:11:59.473 --> 00:12:01.913
But that choice will
result in you losing

00:12:01.913 --> 00:12:04.613
your most precious
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon.

00:12:04.613 --> 00:12:08.146
I'll never choose to destroy
my Clear Wing, not ever!

00:12:08.146 --> 00:12:11.346
Attack, Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:12:11.346 --> 00:12:16.246
Take out
another one of his
Keeper Shield Tokens!

00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:18.813
You should
truly learn to let go.

00:12:18.813 --> 00:12:20.846
It's for the best.

00:12:20.846 --> 00:12:23.713
Your winged friend
loses 800 attack points,

00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:27.413
and you lose another
800 life points!

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:31.846
Attack the last Token!

00:12:31.846 --> 00:12:35.680
And once again you and your
dragon shall pay the price!

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.213
A price you can
ill afford to pay

00:12:38.213 --> 00:12:42.113
(moaning)

00:12:42.113 --> 00:12:44.446
(breathing heavily)

00:12:44.446 --> 00:12:46.980
If you think I'm gonna
give up my Galaxy‐Eyes,

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.513
your greatly mistaken.

00:12:48.513 --> 00:12:50.580
We're taking you down!

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.013
Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon,

00:12:52.013 --> 00:12:53.680
blast that Token
into bits!

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.780
(roars)

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.553
Such loyalty will only
lead to your demise.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.986
But so be it.

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:09.120
I'm sure your friend
appreciates your sacrifice.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.353
(Kite)
I have to keep
my eyes on the prize

00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:14.720
and do whatever it takes
to win this battle.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.520
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon,
attack one more time!

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.053
Destroy the third Token!

00:13:19.053 --> 00:13:22.520
(roars)

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.486
And with that loss,
comes my gain.

00:13:24.486 --> 00:13:27.653
(whimpering)

00:13:27.653 --> 00:13:29.320
As your Dragon weakens
once again,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.520
I shall reap my rewards.

00:13:37.153 --> 00:13:38.753
Ha ha ha!

00:13:38.753 --> 00:13:41.086
All that sacrifice
to keep your dragon.

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:43.986
I would find it admirable
if it wasn't so foolish.

00:13:43.986 --> 00:13:46.886
Especially since you lost
over half your life points

00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:50.753
to keep a monster that has
only 100 attack points!

00:13:50.753 --> 00:13:53.120
Ya think?
Wha‐‐

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.553
Not only did I
get rid of every
one of your Tokens,

00:13:56.553 --> 00:13:58.886
but since I took damage,
I'm allowed to summon

00:13:58.886 --> 00:14:02.026
this bad boy,
Speedroid Gum Prize!

00:14:05.293 --> 00:14:08.126
(grunts)

00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:11.693
And now I tune
Level 1 Speedroid Gum Prize

00:14:11.693 --> 00:14:14.826
with Level 7
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon

00:14:14.826 --> 00:14:17.660
to pave the way for
an even mightier monster!

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.360
(roars)

00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:28.693
I Synchro Summon!

00:14:28.693 --> 00:14:31.660
Take flight, Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:14:35.026 --> 00:14:36.693
With Clear Wing's departure,

00:14:36.693 --> 00:14:39.093
my trap card
Admiration Of The Keepers

00:14:39.093 --> 00:14:41.060
will now be destroyed!

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.393
Facing seemingly
insurmountable odds,

00:14:43.393 --> 00:14:46.493
this young man was able to
summon a greater monster.

00:14:46.493 --> 00:14:48.393
Yet even skill
and good fortune

00:14:48.393 --> 00:14:51.093
will not be enough to
defeat the mighty Apollo.

00:14:51.093 --> 00:14:52.793
You sure about that?

00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:55.893
Cause I'm about to put
my game into gear!

00:14:55.893 --> 00:14:59.760
Since I used Speedroid
Gum Prize to Synchro Summon,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.533
I'm allowed to draw
one card from my deck.

00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:04.900
And if happens to be
a Speedroid,

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.833
I can send it
to the graveyard

00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:08.400
to give
its attack points

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.066
to Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon.

00:15:11.066 --> 00:15:13.733
Deck don't fail me now!

00:15:13.733 --> 00:15:16.900
If I don't draw a Speedroid,
it's all over for me.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.066
Come on!
Rin's counting on me!

00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:21.100
(heart beating)

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.933
Come on cards.

00:15:23.933 --> 00:15:26.366
I draw!

00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:28.400
Yes!
It's a Speedroid!

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.333
(grunts)

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.700
Speedroid Ohajikid,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.400
give your 1,000 attack points
to Crystal wing!

00:15:41.933 --> 00:15:43.366
(roars)

00:15:43.366 --> 00:15:46.266
I'm getting Rin right now!

00:15:46.266 --> 00:15:49.733
Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon
attack Luminous Keeper!

00:15:49.733 --> 00:15:52.066
Even if you're able
destroy my monster,

00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:54.100
I'll still end you
next turn‐‐ Huh?!

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.366
(engine revs)

00:15:56.366 --> 00:15:58.500
There won't be a next turn!

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.073
When Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon
battles a monster

00:16:02.073 --> 00:16:03.773
that's
at least Level 5,

00:16:03.773 --> 00:16:07.973
it gains that monster's
attack points!

00:16:07.973 --> 00:16:09.840
Ah! Such power!

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.006
This cannot
be happening!

00:16:11.006 --> 00:16:12.873
Oh, yes it can!

00:16:12.873 --> 00:16:14.273
Go!

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:16.873
Crystal Cataclysmic Strike!

00:16:16.873 --> 00:16:18.640
(roars)

00:16:23.906 --> 00:16:28.006
Aaahhh!

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.040
Unh.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.440
I hope Rin's okay!

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.006
(groaning)

00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:41.606
(giggles)

00:16:41.606 --> 00:16:43.940
Since you wanted to keep
your little pet around,

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.106
you've given me
an insurmountable
amount of life points.

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:50.406
Your Dragon's measly
600 attack points

00:16:50.406 --> 00:16:53.506
won't even tickle.
(laughing)

00:16:53.506 --> 00:16:55.873
On the contrary.
Oh!

00:16:55.873 --> 00:16:58.973
You see, now that all
your Shield Tokens
are gone,

00:16:58.973 --> 00:17:00.680
I'll activate
the spell card

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.613
Rank‐Up‐Magic
Cipher Pursuit!

00:17:04.613 --> 00:17:07.580
You know why
I let you have all
those life points?

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.946
Because when you
have at least

00:17:08.946 --> 00:17:10.646
2,000 life points
more than me,

00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:13.046
I can Xyz Summon
one Cipher monster

00:17:13.046 --> 00:17:16.346
that's one Rank higher
than my Galaxy‐Eyes!

00:17:16.346 --> 00:17:18.813
Say farewell to
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon

00:17:18.813 --> 00:17:22.746
and hello to a monster
of even greater
galactic power!

00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:25.946
Go Rank Up
Xyz Evolution!

00:17:25.946 --> 00:17:30.680
Arise, Neo Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon!

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.546
With Galaxy‐Eyes gone,
my trap

00:17:32.546 --> 00:17:35.213
Admiration of the Keepers
is destroyed!

00:17:35.213 --> 00:17:36.546
That's just the start!

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:38.580
Thanks to Cipher
Pursuit's effect,

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.413
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes can use
all its Overlay Units

00:17:41.413 --> 00:17:44.380
to activate
its special ability!

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.880
Cipher Super Subjection!

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.780
By negating all
of your monster's
special abilities,

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.413
I gain control
of your monster!

00:17:53.413 --> 00:17:55.046
And once it's mine,

00:17:55.046 --> 00:17:57.580
I transform it
into another

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.420
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon!

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.386
Ugh! My monster's
fighting for him!

00:18:04.386 --> 00:18:06.453
And next, I activate
the spell card

00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:09.186
Galaxy‐Eyes Nova
from my hand!

00:18:09.186 --> 00:18:12.586
I tribute my second
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes

00:18:12.586 --> 00:18:14.986
to bring back
Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon

00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:17.786
from my graveyard!

00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:19.886
(roars)

00:18:22.586 --> 00:18:24.120
(gasping)

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.320
Now you two rise up

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.320
and finish this
once and for all!

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.986
Attack!

00:18:32.686 --> 00:18:34.420
(screeching)

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.053
(both screech)

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:43.420
No... this cannot be!

00:18:47.153 --> 00:18:49.786
There's nothing much
to laugh about now,
is there?

00:18:49.786 --> 00:18:51.486
Ahh!

00:18:51.486 --> 00:18:55.420
Go, Double Cipher
Stream of Destruction!

00:18:59.693 --> 00:19:01.826
Aah!

00:19:10.726 --> 00:19:11.793
Lulu!

00:19:11.793 --> 00:19:13.826
(moaning)

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:23.360
(Kite grunting)

00:19:25.726 --> 00:19:27.726
Lulu!

00:19:28.526 --> 00:19:30.293
Is that really you, Kite?

00:19:30.293 --> 00:19:32.626
I can't believe it!

00:19:32.626 --> 00:19:34.693
Come on, Shay's
waiting for you!

00:19:34.693 --> 00:19:36.493
Oh!

00:19:37.693 --> 00:19:39.326
Kite, thank you.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:40.826
Unh!

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.426
Huh?!

00:19:42.426 --> 00:19:44.426
RinRin!

00:19:44.426 --> 00:19:47.926
(breathing heavily)

00:19:47.926 --> 00:19:49.360
What's up?!

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.826
Yugo?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.493
Rin!

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.133
(groaning)

00:20:00.133 --> 00:20:02.766
What... was...
that... for?

00:20:02.766 --> 00:20:05.433
Yugo, what took you
so long?!

00:20:05.433 --> 00:20:07.300
Uh, Rin...

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.166
Don't you know
how worried I was,

00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:12.633
that I'd never
see you again?

00:20:12.633 --> 00:20:15.633
Scared out of my mind,
not knowing if‐‐

00:20:15.633 --> 00:20:18.266
Yugo...

00:20:18.266 --> 00:20:20.033
you jerk!

00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:22.633
(sobbing)

00:20:22.633 --> 00:20:24.333
Rin.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.766
Heh!

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.766
You're safe now.

00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:43.766
Safe.
