WEBVTT

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:04.566
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V."

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.633
The Arc Five Reactor
is almost fully energized.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:13.000
I will soon reunite
the dimensions back into one.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.333
And after all this time,

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.533
I will have
my daughter back.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.366
(Riley)
Ray says "When Z‐ARC
resurrects,"

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.433
you will need
my help to stop him,

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.966
or the world
as you know it is doomed!

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.333
And I believe her!

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.900
So, we shouldn't
shut down the reactor,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.833
because that's the only way
Ray can come back to help us.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.233
If we do not act now,
the reality around us

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:38.000
could be erased
from existence

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.800
along with everyone
we've ever known.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.933
If you're going to
shut down the reactor...

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.166
then I have to
shut you down!

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.966
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.200
Attack Gust King
Alexander right now!

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.966
(roaring)

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.366
(Declan)
I can't believe it.

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.833
Riley's actually
fighting back!

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:03.940
Sonic Halberd will destroy
Stone King Darius!

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.840
Transferring
the subject Zuzu

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.939
to begin
unification procedures.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.406
Good.

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:11.340
(Yuri)
Now that I've defeated

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.940
both Aster and Kite,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.606
it's time for us to
finish what we started.

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:16.473
Go! Starving Venom!

00:01:16.473 --> 00:01:18.973
Attack Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon

00:01:18.973 --> 00:01:21.640
and finish Yugo off!

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.073
No!

00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:27.873
(both)

Oh!

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.213
Yugo!

00:02:33.213 --> 00:02:34.846
Not good.

00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:40.280
What a pleasant
duel that was.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.146
But as much as I
enjoyed it, guess what?

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:44.680
I'm going to enjoy

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.846
what's about to
happen now even more.

00:02:46.846 --> 00:02:49.513
To the victor goes
the spoils, after all.

00:02:49.513 --> 00:02:52.580
And the spoils are
you and your powers.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.613
Oh, shut your trap.

00:02:54.613 --> 00:02:56.780
And wipe that smirk off
that ugly face of yours.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.213
(grunts)
Ugly?

00:02:58.213 --> 00:03:01.286
But you're me,
and I'm you, Yugo.

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:03.753
It's time now
for us to merge.

00:03:03.753 --> 00:03:06.253
Actually, merging sounds
like we're on equal footing.

00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:08.720
But that won't be
the case, Yugo.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.086
Sure, you put up
a decent fight,

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:12.553
but you never
could beat me

00:03:12.553 --> 00:03:14.553
or my Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon.

00:03:14.553 --> 00:03:16.453
Oh!

00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:19.053
And now, I'm going to
absorb your powers

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:22.886
until there's nothing
left of you, Yugo.

00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:30.186
Uh‐oh!
Wha‐‐ ?!
What now?

00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:32.786
No, stop this.

00:03:32.786 --> 00:03:35.886
Stop this at once!

00:03:35.886 --> 00:03:38.053
Ohh!

00:03:38.053 --> 00:03:40.186
Stop?
But I'm just starting!

00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:45.220
Yes, reunite... as one!

00:03:48.653 --> 00:03:50.686
(all gasp)

00:03:53.853 --> 00:03:56.020
Unh!

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.886
Oh!

00:03:57.886 --> 00:04:01.260
Yugo's gone.
Ahh!

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.826
(Yuri)
He's not gone...

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:05.093
(amused chuckle)

00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:07.993
He's become part of
something much greater.

00:04:07.993 --> 00:04:09.826
And that something is me!

00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:11.960
And with his strength,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.393
none of you peons
can stand in my way.

00:04:14.393 --> 00:04:16.360
But I want more!

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.826
I'm only halfway there to
achieving ultimate power!

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:20.426
I want Yuya's power!

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.693
By uniting as one!

00:04:22.693 --> 00:04:25.060
Unite as one!

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.893
(laughing)

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.593
(Yusho)
No!

00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:34.159
If we can't stop Yuri,
the world is doomed!

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.093
(Declan)
If I don't keep my guard up,

00:04:43.093 --> 00:04:46.960
Riley may actually
win this duel!

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.960
And with my third
and final attack,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.760
Sonic Halberd will
destroy Stone King Darius!

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.360
And I win this duel!

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.100
Sorry, Declan.

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:09.566
No need to be!

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:11.600
I just used
the Action Spell Miracle.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.066
Ohh!

00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:15.133
Not only did it
save my monster,

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:18.133
but the damage
I take is cut in half.

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:19.900
Oh, man.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.200
I should've seen
that coming.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.433
Yes, you should
have, Riley.

00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:26.466
I always taught you to
think three steps ahead.

00:05:26.466 --> 00:05:28.300
Huh?

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.266
Or have your forgotten all
of our training already?

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:35.466
Riley, I understand that
these are confusing times,

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:37.533
but we have
so very much in common

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:39.366
and don't need to fight.

00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:41.200
However, since you're
fighting in the hopes

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.066
of reviving Ray,
then I must tell you.

00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:48.266
I will do all that
I can to stop you.

00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:49.466
And nothing
will change that.

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:51.233
Don't you see?

00:05:51.233 --> 00:05:53.200
I won't let any harm come
to Zuzu and the others.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.133
And I won't let father
combine the dimensions.

00:05:58.133 --> 00:06:01.173
But if I cannot convince
you with my words,

00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:03.806
then, Riley, I'll just
have to convince you

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:06.506
with my cards instead.

00:06:06.506 --> 00:06:09.206
Maybe it's you
who needs convincing.

00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:10.740
I end my turn.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.240
It's my move!
I draw!

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.273
I use Double D
Savant Thomas

00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:19.273
and this Triple D Knowledge
King Tomb Conquistador

00:06:19.273 --> 00:06:21.640
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.740
Prepare yourself, Riley.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.073
I can now summon
as many monsters

00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:36.906
between Levels Two
and Five as I want.

00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:39.040
I Pendulum Summon!

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.440
And call upon
my monster to emerge!

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.540
Come again,
Double D Brownie!

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.506
And when Double D Brownie
is Pendulum Summoned

00:06:50.506 --> 00:06:52.640
from my Extra Deck,
I can tribute it along

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.840
with another monster that's
already out on my field

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.840
to activate its
special ability.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.306
So, let's go ahead
and do just that.

00:07:00.306 --> 00:07:03.813
I tribute Brownie and
Triple D Stone King Darius.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.446
And now Double D Brownie's
Pendulum Ability

00:07:11.446 --> 00:07:13.946
lets me move Knowledge
King Tomb Conquistador

00:07:13.946 --> 00:07:17.613
from the Pendulum Zone
on to my field.

00:07:23.613 --> 00:07:25.380
Pretty big.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.780
But wait,
Tomb Conquistador

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.746
may have
3,000 attack points,

00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:31.680
but that's same amount
as my Sonic Halberd,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.613
so you can't hurt me.

00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:34.813
Not unless I activate

00:07:34.813 --> 00:07:38.146
Conquistador's
special ability!

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:40.913
By sending Dark Contract
With The Eternal Darkness

00:07:40.913 --> 00:07:43.446
to my graveyard,
I raise Conquistador's

00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:45.046
attack points by 1,000

00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:46.846
until the end
of the turn.

00:07:46.846 --> 00:07:48.713
Oh, no, now it's stronger!
Yes, Riley!

00:07:48.713 --> 00:07:52.546
Tomb Conquistador,
destroy Sonic Halberd

00:07:52.546 --> 00:07:54.513
and end this duel!

00:07:54.513 --> 00:07:58.746
Plasmic Pulse Pulverizer!

00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:03.153
Aah‐‐ Unh!

00:08:03.153 --> 00:08:04.386
Riley!

00:08:04.386 --> 00:08:05.920
(explosion)

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.686
(Yusho groaning)

00:08:12.686 --> 00:08:14.553
No, Yusho!

00:08:14.553 --> 00:08:16.920
(grunting)
Huh?

00:08:20.086 --> 00:08:22.053
Oh!

00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:24.986
(chuckling)
Ah, here you are.

00:08:24.986 --> 00:08:27.320
It's you.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.353
Come now...

00:08:29.353 --> 00:08:31.653
Where are your manners?

00:08:31.653 --> 00:08:32.753
I do have a name,
you know.

00:08:32.753 --> 00:08:34.320
It's Yuri.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.786
And I'm here
to absorb you,

00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:37.786
just like I did
your friend Yugo.

00:08:37.786 --> 00:08:39.920
You beat Yugo?

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.920
Unh. He did.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.553
I saw it all.
Poor Yugo!

00:08:44.553 --> 00:08:47.920
He didn't...
stand a chance against him.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.520
Oh!

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.653
But this ends right now!

00:08:53.653 --> 00:08:55.586
Listen to me.

00:08:55.586 --> 00:08:57.286
You're not taking
my son, Yuri,

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.620
because I'm going to
beat you.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.526
And Z‐ARC will not revive.

00:09:01.526 --> 00:09:04.493
Beat me?
How ridiculous.

00:09:04.493 --> 00:09:07.560
How can you beat me
when you can't even stand?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.526
Why don't you... beat it?

00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:13.126
Ahh! Unh!

00:09:13.126 --> 00:09:15.093
You monster!

00:09:15.093 --> 00:09:18.826
Dad! Oh, no!

00:09:18.826 --> 00:09:20.860
Oh, boo‐hoo.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.326
I'm down but not out!
You hear me?!

00:09:25.326 --> 00:09:27.960
You want some, too?
Yaah!

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.326
Ahh! Unh!

00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:33.126
Declan, no!

00:09:33.126 --> 00:09:35.860
I'm okay.

00:09:37.393 --> 00:09:41.626
It certainly looks like
you're all mine now, Yuya.

00:09:41.626 --> 00:09:43.826
(Yusho)
I don't think so.

00:09:43.826 --> 00:09:46.060
And your little
power blast...

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.860
isn't enough
to change that.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.093
Aw, isn't that sweet?

00:09:52.093 --> 00:09:55.393
A father sticking up
for his dear, dear son.

00:09:55.393 --> 00:09:58.526
It's just too bad for Yuya,
though, that dear old dad

00:09:58.526 --> 00:10:00.300
doesn't have what
it takes to save him

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.833
from becoming one with me.

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:05.333
Unite as one!
Naah!

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:07.666
No, I won't!
I won't do it!

00:10:07.666 --> 00:10:09.966
Come on, Pops.

00:10:09.966 --> 00:10:11.900
Let me be nice and put
your son out of his misery.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.766
It's what's best
for him, you know.

00:10:13.766 --> 00:10:15.866
I beg to differ, Yuri.

00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:18.733
You see, the best thing
for Yuya right now

00:10:18.733 --> 00:10:20.233
is to teach you
a lesson.

00:10:20.233 --> 00:10:22.033
Seriously?

00:10:22.033 --> 00:10:23.366
You've caused
enough suffering

00:10:23.366 --> 00:10:25.100
for ten lifetimes.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.400
Maybe if Leo gave you
a couple hours

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.900
of detention every day,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.366
you wouldn't be such
a terrible person!

00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:32.700
Detention, you say?

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.900
But that was
my favorite class!

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.700
This is no joke, Yuri.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.600
You will no longer
hurt anyone.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.800
Because you're going
to stop me, right?

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.766
Fine, I'd be more
than happy

00:10:43.766 --> 00:10:46.333
to add a brand spanking
new card to my collection.

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:48.300
And you know what?

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.500
I'll file you away
with my other rare cards,

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.533
because it's rare
that someone would be

00:10:52.533 --> 00:10:54.400
so stupid
as to challenge me.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.466
(both gasp)

00:10:56.466 --> 00:10:59.333
Now then, get ready, Yusho,

00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:01.740
to become two dimensional!

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.373
What's taking so long?

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:15.040
If Yuri absorbs Yuya,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.906
Z‐ARC will resurrect
at any moment!

00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:19.540
We cannot let that happen,
is that understood?

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.273
Yes, sir, it is!

00:11:21.273 --> 00:11:23.140
But, Professor,
we need more power

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.540
before we can transfer
Lulu into the reactor!

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.073
I don't care!
Transfer Lulu now!

00:11:29.073 --> 00:11:32.206
Time is ticking!
Just do it already.

00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:34.440
Sir!

00:11:37.373 --> 00:11:40.740
Ahh! Must resist!

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.273
Stay strong, Yuya,
don't you give in.

00:11:44.273 --> 00:11:48.040
Please, Yuya,
please hold on.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.073
If only Ray was here.

00:11:52.473 --> 00:11:55.806
Yuri, I will never
let you have my son.

00:11:55.806 --> 00:12:00.040
Not in this dimension
or any dimension.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.946
Oh, such
a good father you are,

00:12:01.946 --> 00:12:04.713
even though it's gonna
end so badly for you.

00:12:04.713 --> 00:12:07.780
I guess that's one
opinion, just not mine.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.346
As calm as you appear to be,
I know you're scared.

00:12:11.346 --> 00:12:13.480
And do you know why that is?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.813
Because if I had to face me,
I'd... be scared, too.

00:12:17.813 --> 00:12:20.680
In fact, I bet all my hairs
would be going white

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.580
from all the fear
I was feeling.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.713
That's why I wear
the top hat.

00:12:24.713 --> 00:12:26.213
Keep joking.

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:30.446
I'll enjoy wiping
that smile off your face.

00:12:30.446 --> 00:12:32.246
(both)
Let's duel!

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.980
I'll go first!

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.180
And to start, I'll summon
Predaplant Cephalotusnail

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:45.046
from my hand!

00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:47.680
And then I'll place
two cards facedown

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.380
and end my turn.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.613
Aah!

00:12:52.613 --> 00:12:54.380
Can the peanut gallery
keep it quiet?

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.313
I'm trying to focus.
(chuckling)

00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:58.680
So that's it?
Huh?

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.586
A monster with 1300 attack
points and two facedowns

00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:03.620
for your first move?

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.353
I mean, it's good,
but it's not spectacular.

00:13:06.353 --> 00:13:07.920
And why would anyone settle

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.386
for anything
less than spectacular?

00:13:10.386 --> 00:13:11.953
It was spectacular!

00:13:11.953 --> 00:13:13.353
You just don't
realize it yet.

00:13:13.353 --> 00:13:15.486
You're up.
Yes, I am.

00:13:15.486 --> 00:13:17.153
And it's a good thing,
'cause someone

00:13:17.153 --> 00:13:18.986
needs to provide this match
with some razzle dazzle.

00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:21.253
So, here I go!

00:13:21.253 --> 00:13:23.620
First, since there are
no monsters on my field,

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.086
but there is a monster
on your field,

00:13:26.086 --> 00:13:28.253
I can summon
Performapal Revue Dancer

00:13:28.253 --> 00:13:30.120
to take her playful
place on stage.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.586
(giggles)

00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:34.653
This gal danced her way
into my heart

00:13:34.653 --> 00:13:36.053
the moment I found out

00:13:36.053 --> 00:13:38.420
she counts as two
monsters instead of one

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.586
when I Tribute Summon.

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:43.186
So I'm using her to summon
the mystical and magical

00:13:43.186 --> 00:13:45.486
Performapal Sky Magician!

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.253
That monster!
Ah!

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.253
It's Yusho's ace.

00:13:59.253 --> 00:14:01.493
Hm, a Magician.

00:14:01.493 --> 00:14:03.160
You do know
a couple of card tricks

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.726
won't win you this duel.

00:14:04.726 --> 00:14:06.726
We'll see about that!

00:14:06.726 --> 00:14:08.726
Are you serious?

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:10.126
Huh?

00:14:10.126 --> 00:14:11.893
Yes.

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.326
But I'm going to make this
duel as grand as I can.

00:14:14.326 --> 00:14:16.326
So get set to
see a spectacle

00:14:16.326 --> 00:14:19.760
the likes of which
you've never seen!

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.860
So get ready,
it's showtime!

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.326
Do it, Dad!

00:14:24.326 --> 00:14:25.860
What's his plan?

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.426
All righty, then.
Now, bring it.

00:14:28.426 --> 00:14:29.793
Start the show.

00:14:29.793 --> 00:14:31.460
Righty‐O!

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.026
First, I activate the spell
Magician's Right Hand

00:14:34.026 --> 00:14:36.560
from my right hand!

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.293
And since Performapal
Sky Magician

00:14:42.293 --> 00:14:43.526
is presently
on my field,

00:14:43.526 --> 00:14:45.626
once during my turn

00:14:45.626 --> 00:14:48.726
I can target a single spell
card that you have out.

00:14:48.726 --> 00:14:50.760
And then destroy it!

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.393
That's a lot of razzle
for no dazzle.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.460
Well, Yuri,
I beg to differ.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.060
Because I believe
your spell card

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.426
is much more valuable
then you let on.

00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:00.966
In fact, I believe
it's your key

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:02.366
to winning this duel.

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:04.000
The key to
winning this duel.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.933
Oh!
Huh?

00:15:05.933 --> 00:15:07.566
That's quite
the proclamation.

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:10.366
But you do realize I have
two cards out, right?

00:15:10.366 --> 00:15:12.133
So, you don't know
which one

00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:13.466
is my ace in the hole
now, do you?

00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:16.900
Ahh... that does seem
to be a problem.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.033
And your
Magician's Right Hand

00:15:19.033 --> 00:15:21.200
only destroys
a spell card, correct?

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.933
What if both of my facedown
cards happen to be traps?

00:15:24.933 --> 00:15:26.533
They most certainly
could be,

00:15:26.533 --> 00:15:28.566
and if I turn out
to be wrong,

00:15:28.566 --> 00:15:30.666
I'll lose this duel
and be at your mercy.

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:33.500
Hmpf, you sure
are a character.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.700
My duel with Yugo
was fun, but this?

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.100
This is next level stuff.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.433
Next, next level.

00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:41.600
Sure puts a smile
on my face.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.633
But if I lose,
I might not be smiling.

00:15:44.633 --> 00:15:46.500
Go ahead and pick, old man,

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.233
but be sure to choose
which card wisely.

00:15:49.233 --> 00:15:52.100
In due time, my boy,
but first I activate

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.800
Sky Magician's
special ability.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.900
So now he gains
300 attack points!

00:16:02.506 --> 00:16:06.073
Next, Sky Magician will
attack Cephalotusnail

00:16:06.073 --> 00:16:07.740
and show our audience

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.940
he's not all
he's cracked up to be.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.740
(all gasp)

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.740
Hm, I don't think so.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.073
Go Dark Seed Planter!

00:16:17.073 --> 00:16:18.773
It transforms
your Sky Magician

00:16:18.773 --> 00:16:20.606
from Wind
to Dark Attribute.

00:16:20.606 --> 00:16:23.940
And when your monster attacks
my own Dark Attribute monster,

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.406
I'm sorry to say
that battle is negated.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.206
Oh!

00:16:30.206 --> 00:16:32.940
I know, Riley,
total game changer.

00:16:34.873 --> 00:16:37.273
Yuri's in total
control of this duel.

00:16:37.273 --> 00:16:40.440
My dad has to act
now or he's gonna lose.

00:16:44.406 --> 00:16:46.706
Yuri's in total control
of this duel.

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:50.273
My dad has to act now
or he's gonna lose.

00:16:50.273 --> 00:16:51.840
Now, now,
no need to worry.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.606
Don't lose faith
in your old man, my boy.

00:16:54.606 --> 00:16:57.473
Now, because you
activated a spell card,

00:16:57.473 --> 00:16:59.173
I can return
a spell card

00:16:59.173 --> 00:17:01.413
on my field
back to my hand.

00:17:01.413 --> 00:17:03.746
And then activate
a different spell card

00:17:03.746 --> 00:17:05.113
from my hand.

00:17:05.113 --> 00:17:06.613
So with a shake
of the wrist

00:17:06.613 --> 00:17:08.346
and quick
sleight of hand,

00:17:08.346 --> 00:17:10.480
my Magician's
Right Hand switches

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.780
with my Magician's
Left Hand!

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.246
And now, with a snap
of its fingers,

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:19.713
your trap is negated
and then destroyed!

00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:29.713
It worked!
It did.

00:17:29.713 --> 00:17:31.280
Ha!

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.713
And look, it seems
Yusho's show

00:17:33.713 --> 00:17:36.780
is having a positive
effect on Yuya.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.913
Huh?

00:17:38.913 --> 00:17:42.280
Bravo, Dad!

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.946
And by activating
this spell,

00:17:43.946 --> 00:17:47.013
Sky Magician gains
300 attack points!

00:17:51.213 --> 00:17:53.080
And that's
no trick, Yuri.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.080
Sky Magician,
attack Cephalotusnail!

00:17:58.346 --> 00:18:00.286
If Yusho's attack connects...

00:18:00.286 --> 00:18:05.053
Yuri'll take 1,800
points of damage.

00:18:05.053 --> 00:18:07.353
I'm afraid this is
nothing I can't handle.

00:18:07.353 --> 00:18:10.286
My monster's special
ability activates

00:18:10.286 --> 00:18:12.286
so it can't be
destroyed in battle!

00:18:12.286 --> 00:18:14.853
And the damage I take
is cut in half!

00:18:17.953 --> 00:18:22.386
Unh! Ohh.

00:18:22.386 --> 00:18:25.553
So... I guess this means
that you've failed.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.320
I failed?
How so?

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.653
(all gasp)

00:18:33.653 --> 00:18:36.020
Your strategy was to use
your Magician's Right Hand

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.786
to destroy my spell card,
my key card as you said.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:42.253
But in order to
protect your monster,

00:18:42.253 --> 00:18:44.786
you had to replace it with
a different spell card,

00:18:44.786 --> 00:18:47.386
you Magician's Left Hand,
thus rendering your entire

00:18:47.386 --> 00:18:50.853
strategy a useless waste
of time and energy.

00:18:50.853 --> 00:18:52.620
Quite the contrary,
young fellow.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.420
My intention all along was
to use Magician's Left Hand

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.953
so that I could
destroy your trap card.

00:18:57.953 --> 00:18:59.660
It was essential
to my plan.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.093
Huh?

00:19:01.093 --> 00:19:02.460
Because for my trick
to work against you,

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.360
I required one thing.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.660
I needed you to have one
facedown on your field

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.160
instead of the two
you originally had.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.726
So, then like everything you
did, all the moves you made,

00:19:11.726 --> 00:19:14.160
were just to get me
to use up my trap card?

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.960
Correct, so now you only
have one card left.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.860
You can say it wasn't
a sleight of hand,

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.960
but a sleight of mind.
(groans)

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.093
And all it leads to this.

00:19:23.093 --> 00:19:25.926
I activate the spell card
Clairvoyance!

00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:27.526
I shall now
attempt to guess

00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:30.060
whether your single
remaining facedown card

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.260
is a spell or a trap.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.693
If I'm correct, that card
returns to your deck,

00:19:34.693 --> 00:19:38.326
and I'm allowed to draw two
brand‐new cards from my deck.

00:19:38.326 --> 00:19:39.693
Say what?!

00:19:39.693 --> 00:19:40.826
You did
all these maneuvers

00:19:40.826 --> 00:19:43.293
to end up with
a 50/50 guessing game?

00:19:43.293 --> 00:19:44.926
It's not 50/50.

00:19:44.926 --> 00:19:47.693
In fact, I'll even guess
the name of the card.

00:19:47.693 --> 00:19:49.326
So let me
get this straight.

00:19:49.326 --> 00:19:51.226
You're going to
guess the exact card

00:19:51.226 --> 00:19:53.626
that my facedown is
without looking?

00:19:53.626 --> 00:19:55.993
Yes, I am.

00:19:55.993 --> 00:19:57.793
Then go ahead!
It will be your end!

00:19:57.793 --> 00:19:59.593
Why, thank you!

00:19:59.593 --> 00:20:02.166
Because this'll
be a showstopper!

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:05.533
(all gasp)

00:20:05.533 --> 00:20:09.400
Now a magician doesn't
usually reveal his tricks,

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.533
but since this is
a duel for the ages,

00:20:11.533 --> 00:20:13.200
I figure why not share

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.633
why I know
what card you have.

00:20:14.633 --> 00:20:17.100
I paid close attention
to the things you said.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.266
They may have just been
passing comments to you,

00:20:19.266 --> 00:20:21.533
but to me they told
quite the story.

00:20:21.533 --> 00:20:23.933
And none was more telling
than what you said

00:20:23.933 --> 00:20:26.800
at the very end of your
first turn of the duel.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.200
It was spectacular!

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.633
You just don't
realize it yet.

00:20:29.633 --> 00:20:32.500
You're up.
With those words,

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.366
it was clear to me
that you were planning

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:37.166
to win the duel with one
of the two facedown cards.

00:20:37.166 --> 00:20:39.500
So, I put this theory
to the test.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.233
By saying that I would
activate my spell

00:20:43.233 --> 00:20:46.466
Magician's Right Hand
to destroy your key card.

00:20:46.466 --> 00:20:48.633
But you didn't seem
concerned at all.

00:20:48.633 --> 00:20:50.633
As if you knew
that my spell

00:20:50.633 --> 00:20:53.133
can't destroy
your key card.

00:20:53.133 --> 00:20:55.600
Providing me with a crucial
piece of information.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.700
The clues were there.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.273
I just had to
piece them together.

00:21:00.273 --> 00:21:02.973
When you played
Dark Seed Planter,

00:21:02.973 --> 00:21:04.206
I switched
Magician's Right Hand

00:21:04.206 --> 00:21:05.840
with Magician's
Left Hand.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.773
This enabled me

00:21:07.773 --> 00:21:11.106
to destroy your
Dark Seed Planter.

00:21:11.106 --> 00:21:13.073
That card could've changed
my Sky Magician

00:21:13.073 --> 00:21:14.673
into a Dark monster,

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:17.373
revealing even more
about your strategy.

00:21:17.373 --> 00:21:20.806
Why would need my monster
to be a Dark Attribute?

00:21:20.806 --> 00:21:23.440
Why, because Yuri,
you were setting the stage

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.540
for something big,
a grand Fusion Summoning.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.640
And how exactly were you
going to achieve this?

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.306
By using my monster,
Sky Magician!

00:21:32.306 --> 00:21:34.040
Grr!

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.140
So, what card can
merge these monsters

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.006
and isn't affected by
Magician's Right Hand?

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:40.740
Ha! Why, there's only one!

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.273
Your key card is...

00:21:43.273 --> 00:21:46.140
Super Polymerization!

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.240
Grr!

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.640
My, my... I'm right.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.206
(both chuckle)

00:21:57.206 --> 00:21:58.673
Yeah, Dad!

00:22:00.046 --> 00:22:02.580
(Yusho)
It's time for
my grand finale!
