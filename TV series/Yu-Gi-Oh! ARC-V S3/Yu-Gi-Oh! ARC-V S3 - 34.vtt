WEBVTT

00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.833
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:07.566
What a pleasant duel that was.

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:11.833
I'm going to enjoy what's
about to happen now even more.

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:14.633
I'm going to absorb
your powers...

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:18.033
until there's nothing
left of you, Yugo.

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:19.933
No!
Stop this at once!

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.400
Reunite as one!

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.633
Tomb Conquistador,

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:31.666
destroy Sonic Halberd
and end this duel!

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.266
Plasmic Pulse Pulverizer!

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.933
Riley!

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.366
No, Yusho!

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.000
Ah, here you are.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.633
It's you!

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:50.466
And I'm here to absorb you,

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.400
just like I did
your friend Yugo.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.000
You're not taking
my son, Yuri.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.866
Because I'm going
to beat you.

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.000
Now then...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.100
Get ready, Yusho...

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.440
To become two dimensional!

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.140
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.173
(Yusho)
Your key card is...

00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:08.739
Super Polymerization!

00:01:12.473 --> 00:01:14.840
I'm right.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.040
Yeah, Dad!

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.806
(Yusho)
It's time for
my grand finale!

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:25.280
What, no applause
for guessing

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.746
your Super Polymerization card
correctly?

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.313
Well, since I guessed
the correct card,

00:02:30.313 --> 00:02:32.013
you have to place it
back in your deck

00:02:32.013 --> 00:02:33.480
so you can no longer use it.

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:38.780
Next I'm allowed
to draw two cards...

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.080
And I think I'll place one
of them facedown.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.480
And with that,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.446
I do believe
I'll end my turn

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:45.980
which means
that you're now up.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.880
So don't let me down.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.713
Let's keep a run on the fun!

00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:52.780
(snickering)

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.946
(laughing)

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:56.180
Oh, I'll have fun,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.780
at your expense!

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.013
And you will pay dearly!
Now it's my turn

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:04.320
to bring the enter‐pain‐ment,
and I plan on doing just that

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.453
'cause, frankly,
your little guessing game

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:10.020
bored me to tears and
it bored our audience, too.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.220
But what's coming next
sure won't.

00:03:13.786 --> 00:03:16.620
So I won't deprive them
any longer.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.686
Now on with the duel!

00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:20.420
I draw! Ha!

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.220
First I summon from my hand
Predaplant Lilizard!

00:03:26.953 --> 00:03:30.120
Next, I activate
Rapid Seed Fire!

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.286
Which means now, by sending
Predaplant Cordyceps

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:35.486
from my deck to my graveyard...

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:37.486
You take 300 points of damage,

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:39.886
and your monster loses
600 attack points!

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.653
In other words, Yusho,

00:03:41.653 --> 00:03:45.120
I've planted the seeds
of your demise!

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.920
Well, I'm going to make sure
those seeds don't take root!

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.386
Since you activated
a trap card,

00:03:50.386 --> 00:03:52.353
Sky Magician returns
a spell card

00:03:52.353 --> 00:03:55.120
on my field to my hand,
and replaces it with

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.820
a different spell
from my hand.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.753
So abracadabra and kalamazam,

00:03:59.753 --> 00:04:02.726
Magician's Left Hand switches
to Magician's Right Hand!

00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:04.826
Magician's Right Hand.

00:04:04.826 --> 00:04:06.993
(Yuya)
Oh, yeah!
Give my dad a hand

00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:09.060
because that card
will destroy Yuri's spell.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.793
Seed ya later!

00:04:13.826 --> 00:04:16.726
There's more! Since my dad
activated a spell,

00:04:16.726 --> 00:04:19.860
Sky Magician now gains
an additional 300 attack points.

00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:25.760
Can it be?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.160
Is Yuya back to normal?

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.026
Well, Rapid Seed Fire
is still useful.

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:34.659
See when it's is destroyed,
I can destroy a card

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.626
for every Predaplant
on my field.

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:40.493
So I destroy Sky Magician and
Magician's Right Hand!

00:04:40.493 --> 00:04:42.260
That would be the case...

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.060
If I didn't play
Performapal Sky Ring!

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.960
But because Sky Magician's
on my field,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.026
not a single one of my cards
can be destroyed!

00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:54.693
All right!
Dad's on a roll!

00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:56.026
You'll have to do
better than that!

00:04:56.026 --> 00:04:57.893
Way, way better,

00:04:57.893 --> 00:05:01.100
because I'm activating
the spell Ivy Bind Castle!

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:15.500
What's happening?

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.833
(Yuri)
Thanks to my green thumb,

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:20.833
you can't use the effects
or special abilities

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:22.700
of all cards on your field!

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.333
What?
All of his cards?

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.066
That's right!

00:05:26.066 --> 00:05:29.066
Spells, traps and monsters
are stuck in the weeds!

00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:30.933
No way.

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:33.233
(scoffs)
And there's more!

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.366
Your monsters can't attack.

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:37.800
And every time it's your turn,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.900
you take 800 points of damage
for every monster you have out.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.833
You see, the Ivy I've played

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:46.533
is very much
the poisonous kind!

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:48.333
Not good.

00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:51.566
Seems as though you've played
a true showstopper.

00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:53.600
It appears
I'm out of options.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.933
Say what?

00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:57.933
Finally, the great entertainer

00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:00.600
realizes that the curtain
is now lowering down.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.473
Of course, things aren't
always as they seem.

00:06:03.473 --> 00:06:05.273
This time they are!

00:06:05.273 --> 00:06:07.440
Face it!
The duel is over!

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.006
You can't attack
and none of your cards

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:12.773
can use their effects,
it's hopeless for you now!

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:15.806
Take your final bow
because it's curtains!

00:06:19.906 --> 00:06:22.673
Take your final bow
because it's curtains!

00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:25.940
My dad's not giving up.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.640
Of course I'm sure.
Trust me!

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.240
Who's Yuya talking to?

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.340
There's just one person
who it could be...

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.240
Yuto.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.506
That means both Yuya and Yuto
are free of Z‐ARC.

00:06:39.506 --> 00:06:42.406
My Dad's been in
worse jams than this.

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:44.273
He has?
Yeah.

00:06:44.273 --> 00:06:47.740
When I was a kid, my mom took me
to see my Dad duel in a match.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.973
I remember it to this day!

00:06:57.673 --> 00:07:02.646
Wow.

00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:04.880
Ha!
Your monster's trapped!

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.413
Oh, no!

00:07:06.413 --> 00:07:08.780
Don't you worry, Yuya.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.613
You sit back and watch
your dad shine bright!

00:07:12.613 --> 00:07:15.913
And boy, did he ever!

00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:18.213
And I just know
he'll do it again!

00:07:18.213 --> 00:07:21.246
You may have my cards wrapped
tighter than a present,

00:07:21.246 --> 00:07:23.180
but I presently present...

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.813
with no precedent,
an escape to this predicament.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:29.380
Oh, how I love
tongue twisters!

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.880
But there's no way you'll
twist your way out of this!

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.213
Just watch me!

00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:35.113
Let's go, Sky Magician!

00:07:35.113 --> 00:07:36.480
Time to shine!

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.080
And also, time for you

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.113
to take a jolting
800 points of damage!

00:07:47.113 --> 00:07:50.213
Not bad, Yuri.

00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:53.846
Your Ivy Bind Castle dealt me
800 points of damage

00:07:53.846 --> 00:07:55.880
for every monster
I have on my field.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.913
I'd say that was
an awesome move,

00:07:57.913 --> 00:07:59.480
but you already know
I'm awesome.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.953
Oh, but Yuri?

00:08:00.953 --> 00:08:03.286
Wouldn't it be humbling
if my Sky Magician

00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:05.686
can magically slip out
of your vines?

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:07.520
(Yuri)
Ha! You're bluffing!

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.786
Nothing can escape my‐‐

00:08:08.786 --> 00:08:10.253
Wha‐‐ No way!

00:08:11.986 --> 00:08:13.453
Oh, yeah!

00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:15.553
It's that old sliperoo!

00:08:15.553 --> 00:08:17.086
(Yusho)
Sky Magician,

00:08:17.086 --> 00:08:20.753
time to bail
'cause you're out on bail!

00:08:20.753 --> 00:08:23.786
Ta‐da!
(Sky Magician laughing)

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:25.586
Yeah!

00:08:25.586 --> 00:08:27.620
No!
How'd he escape?

00:08:34.153 --> 00:08:37.053
And since Sky Magician
has now left the field,

00:08:37.053 --> 00:08:39.386
He can now destroy
one spell card!

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:42.053
So I mow down...

00:08:42.053 --> 00:08:43.920
Your Ivy Bind Castle!

00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:49.753
(laughing)

00:08:49.753 --> 00:08:51.486
Who's that?

00:08:51.486 --> 00:08:54.020
That is Sky Magician's student

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.520
Performapal Sky Pupil!

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.120
Pupil?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.360
Yes, and it's he
who made this all possible!

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.860
Sky Pupil's special ability

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.293
freed his teacher
from your weedy weeds

00:09:06.293 --> 00:09:08.393
and swapped places with him
on the field.

00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:11.860
I'm totally giving
that sweep swap an A++!

00:09:14.193 --> 00:09:15.760
Amazing!

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.260
I told you, Yuya.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.560
Nothing to worry about.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.493
He's the bestest!

00:09:24.526 --> 00:09:26.426
(Pupil laughing)

00:09:26.426 --> 00:09:28.726
It appears, Yuri,

00:09:28.726 --> 00:09:31.026
that your green thumb isn't
all it's cracked up to be.

00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:32.893
Shut up!

00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:34.726
Now for my next step,

00:09:34.726 --> 00:09:36.560
I activate...

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.926
The mystifyingly magical spell
card Magician's Restage!

00:09:40.926 --> 00:09:43.626
When I have a Spellcaster
on my field,

00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:47.093
I can bring back another
Spellcaster from my graveyard.

00:09:47.093 --> 00:09:51.326
So Performapal Revue Dancer,
take the stage!

00:09:54.826 --> 00:09:57.293
And as you know,
she has a special place

00:09:57.293 --> 00:09:59.993
in my heart because
she counts as two monsters.

00:09:59.993 --> 00:10:02.300
So I can tribute her
to bring back...

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.166
Sky Magician!

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.900
Now class
is officially in session,

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.500
and both teacher and student
will give you a lesson

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.166
you won't forget anytime soon!

00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:22.833
And it starts with the spell
Magician's Left Hand!

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:26.933
It hands my Sky Magician
300 additional attack points!

00:10:26.933 --> 00:10:28.566
Sky Magician...

00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:30.666
Attack Lilizard!

00:10:38.266 --> 00:10:40.600
Next: Sky Pupil,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.000
it is time to attack
as well!

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.500
Show him that you're no
mere apprentice either!

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:53.700
I don't care how high
you raise his attack points,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.066
Cephalotusnail can't be
destroyed in battle.

00:10:56.066 --> 00:10:58.833
But when Sky Magician's
on the field,

00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:00.906
Sky Pupil negates
your SNAIL's abilities.

00:11:00.906 --> 00:11:03.540
Now your snail's not all
he's cracked up to be!

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.740
Oh, no!

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.173
I now place one card facedown

00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:11.806
and end my turn!

00:11:11.806 --> 00:11:14.240
Though you may have
life points left,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.740
they will not
lead you to victory.

00:11:18.073 --> 00:11:19.840
Amazing.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.706
Yeah, Dad's got
this duel in the bag!

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.940
I've gotta admit,
you promised

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.873
to put on a good show
and you've done just that.

00:11:31.873 --> 00:11:34.673
But all good things
must come to an end.

00:11:34.673 --> 00:11:36.640
Oh, I disagree.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.473
When something is good.
it lasts forever.

00:11:38.473 --> 00:11:41.140
Even if only in your heart.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.106
Such a sweet sentiment.

00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:46.540
Wonder if that'll be the case
once I turn you into a card!

00:11:49.806 --> 00:11:51.940
Ah, just the thing!

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.006
Your fate is finally sealed.

00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:55.606
What did he draw?

00:11:55.606 --> 00:11:57.673
I bet he's bluffing.

00:11:57.673 --> 00:12:00.213
Just playing mind games
to try and throw my dad off!

00:12:00.213 --> 00:12:02.113
'Fraid not.

00:12:02.113 --> 00:12:04.346
No matter how much
you try to wish it to be so.

00:12:04.346 --> 00:12:06.946
Oh please, it's over.

00:12:06.946 --> 00:12:09.246
My dad's not
gonna lose to you.

00:12:09.246 --> 00:12:10.646
Your dad's a clown.

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:12.580
And the only thing
he's good for

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.313
is a cheap chuckle or two.

00:12:14.313 --> 00:12:16.780
He can't stop me from taking
all your powers,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.513
and I'll be... unstoppable.

00:12:19.513 --> 00:12:21.380
(gasps)
You wish!

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.613
Yes.
It's my deepest wish, Yuya.

00:12:24.613 --> 00:12:26.680
For once I have you and Yuto,

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.813
there will be no one
as powerful as me.

00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:32.580
But alas Yuri, your wish
shall never become reality.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.080
Ever since I stopped you
from playing your key card,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.046
Super Polymerization,

00:12:37.046 --> 00:12:39.180
your strategy has
been in shambles.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.546
I'm always three steps
ahead of you.

00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:45.480
Then I guess
I'm four steps ahead of you.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.280
Because Yusho,
you haven't stopped me.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.146
What do you mean?

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.746
What if
Super Polymerization

00:12:53.746 --> 00:12:55.680
wasn't my key to victory?

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.313
Then I'd say
you're a liar!

00:12:57.313 --> 00:12:59.413
That's not very nice.

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:01.553
But you shall soon see
if I'm lying...

00:13:01.553 --> 00:13:03.520
or if I'm not.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.320
First I activate

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.720
Cordyceps' special ability
from my graveyard!

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.886
Now by banishing it,
I can summon back

00:13:10.886 --> 00:13:14.253
two Predaplants
from my graveyard!

00:13:14.253 --> 00:13:18.653
So welcome back Predaplants
Cephalotusnail and Lilizard!

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.886
And whenever Lilizard is
summoned from the graveyard,

00:13:25.886 --> 00:13:27.686
I can draw one card!

00:13:27.686 --> 00:13:32.620
And now I can fuse them together
with my true key card!

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.186
Not Super,
but Ultra Polymerization!

00:13:36.186 --> 00:13:38.686
No! This can't be!

00:13:38.686 --> 00:13:41.486
Yes, yes, it can.

00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:44.620
I guess you never saw
that coming, now, did you?

00:13:46.353 --> 00:13:49.753
And here's something else that
you never saw coming, Yusho...

00:13:49.753 --> 00:13:52.053
By paying 1,000 life points...

00:13:52.053 --> 00:13:53.953
I can fuse
the two monsters I have

00:13:53.953 --> 00:13:55.953
to bring out a Fusion monster!

00:14:00.826 --> 00:14:03.726
By grafting these
ravenous plants together,

00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:06.760
I'll create a toxic nightmare!

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.893
I Fusion Summon...

00:14:08.893 --> 00:14:13.326
The vicious, voracious,
and venomous...

00:14:13.326 --> 00:14:17.526
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:14:24.293 --> 00:14:26.826
But this is just the start!

00:14:26.826 --> 00:14:29.893
Ultra Polymerization lets me
summon something else.

00:14:29.893 --> 00:14:33.760
The very two monsters that were
used to bring out my Dragon!

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.193
With their attack points reset
to zero, that is.

00:14:37.193 --> 00:14:40.426
And just like before,
I'm allowed to draw one card

00:14:40.426 --> 00:14:41.926
when I resurrect Lilizard!

00:14:44.326 --> 00:14:45.993
But I'm not done yet.

00:14:45.993 --> 00:14:48.160
Thanks to Ultra Polymerization,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.226
I can transform Lilizard
into a Tuner Monster!

00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:52.760
Tuner?
Oh, no...

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.393
Ever since I absorbed
Yugo's powers,

00:14:55.393 --> 00:14:59.560
I've learned the sweet summoning
skills of Synchro Summoning!

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.833
So I'll now make Lilizard

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:04.800
and Cephalotusnail one,
as well!

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.533
Beat your wings to whip up

00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:11.500
a whirlwind of destruction!

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.066
I Synchro Summon...

00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:20.333
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:24.166
(dragons roaring)

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.166
No!
No!

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.666
Yuya!

00:15:35.666 --> 00:15:38.100
Not bad,
but I can do one better.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.600
I activate Sky Illusion!

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.466
Now, so long as
this card is in play,

00:15:43.466 --> 00:15:46.366
your monsters can only
attack Sky Magician!

00:15:46.366 --> 00:15:47.966
And it can't be destroyed

00:15:47.966 --> 00:15:50.500
in battle or by
any special abilities!

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.033
Oh, nice move.
Just not nice enough.

00:15:53.033 --> 00:15:55.533
Because my Starving
Venom Fusion Dragon

00:15:55.533 --> 00:15:58.500
will now steal your Sky
Magician's special abilities!

00:16:00.206 --> 00:16:02.473
I'm afraid this turn of events

00:16:02.473 --> 00:16:05.206
certainly doesn't bode well
for you or Yuya.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.440
And it's going to get worse.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.873
Because as you see,

00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:11.440
I have two Dragons
at my command.

00:16:12.973 --> 00:16:14.773
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:17.740
will now activate
its special ability!

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.540
And by way of Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon's powers,

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.873
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon
is destroyed!

00:16:22.873 --> 00:16:26.573
And with that done, Clear Wing
now gains its attack points!

00:16:26.573 --> 00:16:29.773
Yuri just destroyed
his own monster?
But why?

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.673
5,300 attack points?

00:16:42.673 --> 00:16:45.540
If Clear Wing Synchro Dragon
attacks Sky Magician,

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.440
Yusho will take
2,500 points of damage!

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.206
Only 2,500 points, huh?
That's no fun.

00:16:52.206 --> 00:16:54.673
I'd rather take a page
from my opponent...

00:16:54.673 --> 00:16:56.440
And do something
more dramatic.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.380
I send your Magician's Left and
Right Hands to the graveyard...

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.446
To activate two spells
from my hand:

00:17:03.446 --> 00:17:05.680
Destruction Flower
and Destruction Fruit!

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.580
Presto!

00:17:08.946 --> 00:17:12.646
Destruction Fruit decreases
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon's

00:17:12.646 --> 00:17:14.680
attack points by 3,000

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.246
and revives Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon from my graveyard!

00:17:24.246 --> 00:17:26.313
(both screaming)

00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:30.313
And when I successfully summon
a monster from my graveyard,

00:17:30.313 --> 00:17:32.213
Destruction Flower's
effect activates!

00:17:32.213 --> 00:17:33.880
With it,
the difference between

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.646
Clear Wing's
decreased attack points

00:17:35.646 --> 00:17:38.880
and original attack points
are dealt to you as damage

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.513
and Sky Magician's
attack points

00:17:40.513 --> 00:17:42.880
are reduced by
that same amount!

00:17:46.813 --> 00:17:49.813
You may have only lost
200 life points.

00:17:49.813 --> 00:17:52.313
But this is
only the beginning.

00:17:52.313 --> 00:17:55.280
A cruel, cruel beginning
that will last until

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.413
your very last life point
is gone.

00:17:57.413 --> 00:17:59.313
What does he mean?

00:17:59.313 --> 00:18:01.386
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon

00:18:01.386 --> 00:18:04.386
uses its ability on
Sky Magician once more!

00:18:04.386 --> 00:18:07.420
So like before,
Clear Wing uses its ability

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.920
to destroy Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon!

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.653
And then once again,

00:18:12.653 --> 00:18:15.386
Clear Wing gains Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon's attack points!

00:18:17.086 --> 00:18:18.786
Then Destruction Fruit lowers

00:18:18.786 --> 00:18:21.886
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon's
attack points by 3,000

00:18:21.886 --> 00:18:24.453
to resurrect
the toxically terrifying

00:18:24.453 --> 00:18:26.653
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:18:29.253 --> 00:18:30.920
(both screaming)

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.686
Guess what's next:

00:18:32.686 --> 00:18:34.220
Destruction Flower!

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.053
I use its effect
on Clear Wing!

00:18:36.053 --> 00:18:38.120
So you now take damage equal

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.786
to the difference between
its old and new attack points!

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:43.953
And Sky Magician's attack
points lower by that same
amount!

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.353
400 this time?
And it's going to get worse!

00:18:51.353 --> 00:18:53.753
Yusho, you are caught

00:18:53.753 --> 00:18:56.153
in an endless cycle
of pain and suffering

00:18:56.153 --> 00:18:58.820
where you take damage
every single loop!

00:19:01.226 --> 00:19:04.960
And the only thing that
will end it is your defeat!

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.193
No! It can't end this way.

00:19:07.193 --> 00:19:08.893
Dad, no!

00:19:12.926 --> 00:19:14.993
No! It can't end this way.

00:19:14.993 --> 00:19:16.460
Dad, no!

00:19:18.493 --> 00:19:21.393
This cycle will lead
to your end, Yusho,

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:23.893
and the beginning of my reign

00:19:23.893 --> 00:19:27.293
as the most powerful
person ever!

00:19:27.293 --> 00:19:30.126
So long, Yusho,
and good riddance!

00:19:30.126 --> 00:19:31.260
Attack!

00:19:33.926 --> 00:19:35.860
One final transfer,

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.660
and I will finally have
my daughter back...

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.826
While it seems your time,
Yusho, is at an end.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.260
(dragons roaring)

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.493
Yuri, don't!

00:19:57.493 --> 00:19:59.400
Leave my dad alone!

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:02.766
Oh, no...

00:20:02.766 --> 00:20:05.033
Control yourself!

00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:06.233
Yuya!

00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:09.566
I blast you again!

00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:11.366
Yuya!

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.166
I have to stop this!
Declan!

00:20:19.166 --> 00:20:22.200
Your help isn't needed!

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.966
But you're going
to lose the match!

00:20:23.966 --> 00:20:26.400
That may well be,
but if that's how

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.600
this show must come to an end,
then so be it.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.366
W hat a wonderful show it was.
Only because I won, obviously.

00:20:33.366 --> 00:20:35.400
You may have
won the duel, Yuri,

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.166
but if you duel with heart
you're always a winner.

00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:41.633
Even when
the final curtain falls.

00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:43.666
Yusho, no!

00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:45.700
(screaming)

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.000
Yuya.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.466
I love you, my son.

00:20:49.466 --> 00:20:51.833
With all my heart!
Be quiet!

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:54.866
All the love in the world
couldn't save him!

00:20:54.866 --> 00:20:57.333
Or you,
for that matter!

00:20:57.333 --> 00:21:00.606
What do you say we end
this show with a bang?

00:21:00.606 --> 00:21:03.540
Oh, Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon...

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.340
Attack Sky Magician!

00:21:26.673 --> 00:21:29.106
Dad, no!

00:21:29.106 --> 00:21:32.140
(Yusho)
Yuya, it's your time to shine.

00:21:51.873 --> 00:21:54.273
(cackling)
(gasping)

00:21:54.273 --> 00:21:57.373
(laughing)

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.313
No!

00:22:14.846 --> 00:22:16.613
(screaming)
