WEBVTT

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.466
(Yuya)
Previously on Yu‐Gi‐Oh!
ARC‐V...

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.966
Why hasn'’’t Ray revived?

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.666
No!

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.333
I didn't provide
the Arc Five Reactor

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.100
with enough energy!

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.133
She's gone... forever.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.033
Duel or be destroyed!

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:21.166
Z‐ARC! Your dragon's breath
won't get past us!

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.933
Finally!
An adversary!

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.533
(laughing)

00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.533
After all these years,
I can duel again.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.433
And you two will be
my first victims!

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:34.433
(all)
Time to duel!

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.433
Astrograph Sorcerer!

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:38.633
Channel the energies...

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.333
of my Dark Rebellion
XYZ Dragon,

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.800
my Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.066
my Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon,

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:49.166
and my Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.166
Let the reunion begin!

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.500
Let us reunite!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.433
The ultimate union
of man and monster!

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:02.373
Together, we are
Supreme King Z‐ARC!

00:01:02.373 --> 00:01:06.440
With my arrival,
all your monsters are destroyed!

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.739
And you take damage equal
to their attack points!

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.940
Kite and I are
taking you down, Z‐ARC.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.406
And saving... our friends!

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.013
Z‐ARC may be half‐human
half‐monster,

00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:31.213
but he'’’s a total freak.

00:02:35.913 --> 00:02:37.613
Let'’’s hope not.

00:02:37.613 --> 00:02:41.680
Sora and Aster risked everything
to try and save Yuya.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.480
It'’’s up to us now.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.346
Well then, I guess
we're gonna have to pick up

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:48.280
where those two left off!

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.146
The let'’’s get on
with it, Kite!

00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:52.013
To start,
I'll summon...

00:02:52.013 --> 00:02:54.246
Raidraptor King Lanius!

00:02:57.446 --> 00:03:00.580
And now King Lanius can
call on some royal subjects

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.553
to join his army
and serve him

00:03:02.553 --> 00:03:05.920
because its special ability lets
it summon another Raidraptor!

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:09.520
So joining the fight is

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.320
Raidraptor Vanishing Lanius!

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.086
(crowing)

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:18.286
When it's summoned, I'm allowed
to call on some back‐up,

00:03:18.286 --> 00:03:20.420
so I'm bringing out
a third bird

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.920
to triple the threat‐‐

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.820
Raidraptor Fuzzy Lanius!

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.953
(screeching)

00:03:26.886 --> 00:03:28.453
And now I overlay

00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:31.220
King Lanius,
Vanishing Lanius...

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.020
and my Fuzzy Lanius!

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.786
In order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:39.920
From the shadows,
the falcon soars

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.986
on wings of courage,

00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:43.720
talons ready
for the rebellion!

00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:48.353
I Xyz Summon!

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.286
(growling)

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:53.320
Witness the ascent
of Raidraptor Rise Falcon!

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.120
(screeching)

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:57.920
Do you think you're
the only one

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.486
who can Xyz Summon?

00:03:59.486 --> 00:04:00.893
You'’’re wrong!

00:04:00.893 --> 00:04:03.660
Now, I overlay
my two Darkwurms

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.960
to build
the Overlay Network!

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.026
I Xyz Summon!

00:04:08.026 --> 00:04:09.626
He can Xyz Summon?

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:11.760
And it'’’s not even
his turn now!

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.960
That's because
your best strategies

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.193
are far inferior
to even my worst techniques.

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:19.260
So while you pitter patter away
in your simple duels,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
I work tirelessly
to take dueling to a new level.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.626
Since you Xyz Summoned
a monster,

00:04:24.626 --> 00:04:28.826
I'’’m allowed to Xyz Summon
a special monster of my own!

00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:30.926
Now come to me...

00:04:30.926 --> 00:04:33.959
Supreme King Dragon
Dark Rebellion!

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:39.193
It'’’s Dark Rebellion?

00:04:39.193 --> 00:04:41.326
He's using Yuto's powers,

00:04:41.326 --> 00:04:43.260
but it won'’’t be enough
to stop me!

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.426
I activate Rise Falcon's
special ability!

00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:51.393
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:04:51.393 --> 00:04:54.593
it gains the attack points
of every monster on your field.

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:06.366
6,600 attack points!

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:09.333
That'’’s strong enough
to destroy Supreme King Z‐ARC!

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.900
Rise Falcon!
Attack Supreme King Z‐ARC!

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:33.566
Get ready, Z‐ARC...
for a beat down!

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:37.233
You fool, the only one who is
going to be beaten down is you!

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:40.100
As long as Dark Rebellion
is on my field,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.100
you're not allowed to attack
any other Xyz Monsters,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.600
including
Supreme King Z‐ARC!

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.866
Z‐ARC has an answer

00:05:50.866 --> 00:05:52.566
for everything
we throw at him.

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:54.533
Nothing phases him.

00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:56.833
It'’’s like he'’’s playing
with cheat codes.

00:05:56.833 --> 00:06:00.133
They better do something
before it'’’s game over.

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:02.540
(Gong)
Sora! Aster!

00:06:04.073 --> 00:06:06.473
It'’’s Gong and Sylvio!

00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:11.740
You okay?
Uh‐uh.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.840
Man, what happened
to you guys?

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.540
It looks like you took on
a whole army and lost.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.940
Fine then,
Rise Falcon will attack

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.006
your Dark Rebellion
instead!

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:24.173
When will you learn that nothing
you do will work against me?

00:06:24.173 --> 00:06:26.573
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:30.440
Dark Rebellion steals all
of Rise Falcon'’’s attack points!

00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:41.140
(roaring)

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.340
This is bad,
Shay'’’s gonna lose!

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.306
Your bird is toast!

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:49.673
No way! I activate the spell
Overlay Burst Armor!

00:06:49.673 --> 00:06:53.206
By removing all
of Rise Falcon's Overlay Units,

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:55.673
it can't be destroyed
in battle

00:06:55.673 --> 00:06:56.906
nor do I take any damage!

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.246
(thinking)
I feel like I'm dueling Yuya
and Yuto at the same time,

00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:04.746
<i>and I'’’m barely</i>
<i>hanging on!</i>

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.080
I end my turn
by playing two facedowns!

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.413
But why?
You must know

00:07:12.413 --> 00:07:15.613
when you've been
outclassed and outmatched.

00:07:15.613 --> 00:07:19.080
My victory is
already sealed.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.580
I couldn'’’t do much,
but you can!

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.146
Show '’’em
what you got, Kite!

00:07:24.146 --> 00:07:25.480
It'’’s my turn!

00:07:29.413 --> 00:07:32.213
I draw!

00:07:32.213 --> 00:07:35.446
First I'’’m summoning...
my trusty Cipher Wing.

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:42.046
But I'm not gonna settle
for just one Cipher Wing.

00:07:42.046 --> 00:07:45.280
I'’’m allowed to automatically
summon Cipher Wing #2!

00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:50.046
Next I activate
Double Exposure

00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:52.013
to double
my monsters'’’ Levels,

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.846
all the way from 4 to 8!

00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:58.513
I overlay my Level 8
Cipher Wings

00:07:58.513 --> 00:08:00.020
to build
the Overlay Network!

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:08.386
Now, by way
of the cosmic energies

00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:09.820
that make up our galaxy,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.020
I'’’ll make something
just as mighty!

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.720
I Xyz Summon

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.953
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:08:17.953 --> 00:08:19.553
(roaring)

00:08:25.053 --> 00:08:28.353
(thinking)
Yuya, if you're still
trapped in there,

00:08:28.353 --> 00:08:31.020
<i>I hope you'’’re fighting</i>
<i>as hard as we are!</i>

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.786
<i>Because if we fail,</i>
<i>it'’’s the end of everything!</i>

00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:38.853
The only goal is
to destroy Z‐ARC'’’s dragon!

00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:40.886
That'’’s easier said
than done.

00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:42.920
As long as
he has Dark Rebellion,

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.553
we'’’re not allowed to attack
Supreme King Z‐ARC!

00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:47.020
I know!

00:08:50.886 --> 00:08:54.353
<i>But just because it'’’s hard</i>
<i>doesn'’’t mean it'’’s</i>
<i>impossible!</i>

00:08:54.353 --> 00:08:55.953
I use one Overlay Unit

00:08:55.953 --> 00:08:58.086
to activate Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon's

00:08:58.086 --> 00:08:59.653
special ability!

00:08:59.653 --> 00:09:00.660
It'’’s a game changer!

00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:04.826
With it, I gain control
of one of your monsters,

00:09:04.826 --> 00:09:06.526
and then I'm able
to transform it

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:09.060
into another
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.560
So your Dark Rebellion
now belongs to me!

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.626
You'’’re so naïve!

00:09:22.626 --> 00:09:24.760
With my supreme powers,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.226
I can shut down
all your Fusion,

00:09:27.226 --> 00:09:30.826
Synchro and Xyz Monsters'’’
special abilities!

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:32.493
What!?
You gotta be kidding!

00:09:33.826 --> 00:09:35.593
He'’’s countering
everything!

00:09:35.593 --> 00:09:38.693
(thinking)
We can't attack or use
our special abilities

00:09:38.693 --> 00:09:40.360
<i>against his dragon!</i>

00:09:41.826 --> 00:09:44.260
<i>It'’’s like he has us</i>
<i>totally boxed in!</i>

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.493
<i>But you know what?</i>

00:09:46.493 --> 00:09:48.793
<i>Maybe it'’’s time</i>
<i>I think outside the box!</i>

00:09:50.193 --> 00:09:52.526
I place three cards
facedown.

00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:54.126
Your move, Z‐ARC!

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.466
Hmm, looks like we'’’re
right back where we started.

00:10:22.466 --> 00:10:23.533
We haven'’’t tried
this way.

00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:25.133
Whattaya think?

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.566
All the dimensions are
collapsing together into one.

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:43.000
(screaming)
Huh?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.200
What'’’s wrong, Riley?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.666
(whimpering)

00:10:56.566 --> 00:10:58.900
Are they ghosts?

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.873
Did I take
a wrong turn?

00:11:00.873 --> 00:11:03.306
This doesn'’’t look
like Heartland City.

00:11:03.306 --> 00:11:06.406
You mean
New Domino City?

00:11:06.406 --> 00:11:08.940
Don'’’t worry,
they aren'’’t ghosts, Riley.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.173
They'’’re people
from other dimensions.

00:11:11.173 --> 00:11:12.973
Huh?

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:15.706
As the four dimensions
continue to merge,

00:11:15.706 --> 00:11:17.740
so do the people
living there.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.273
(man)
This is weirding me out.

00:11:20.273 --> 00:11:22.306
(screams)

00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:24.173
Saya, this way!

00:11:24.173 --> 00:11:25.906
Come on!

00:11:25.906 --> 00:11:27.473
We have to move!

00:11:27.473 --> 00:11:29.240
Look! I think
I see Shay!

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.440
Oh...

00:11:32.773 --> 00:11:35.473
It'’’s really him!
And Kite, too!

00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:38.606
Saya!

00:11:38.606 --> 00:11:39.840
Watch out!
Huh?

00:11:42.806 --> 00:11:44.540
Aah!
(gasping)

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840
(both screaming)

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:03.913
What was that?

00:12:11.546 --> 00:12:14.380
It'’’s Kite!
Shay!

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.246
What are you doing here?

00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:17.880
This place
isn'’’t for you.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.013
Stay focused!

00:12:19.013 --> 00:12:21.546
My turn! Hah!

00:12:21.546 --> 00:12:25.013
Dark Rebellion,
attack Galaxy‐Eyes!

00:12:29.846 --> 00:12:31.746
(roaring)

00:12:31.746 --> 00:12:33.413
Your Galaxy‐Eyes will
be in no shape

00:12:33.413 --> 00:12:35.046
to survive this attack!

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.046
By using
one Overlay Unit,

00:12:37.046 --> 00:12:39.046
Dark Rebellion steals

00:12:39.046 --> 00:12:42.280
all of Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon'’’s attack points!

00:12:46.013 --> 00:12:47.746
(roaring)

00:12:49.613 --> 00:12:52.580
(roaring)

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.046
Do something, Shay!

00:12:55.046 --> 00:12:57.380
I'’’ve got this!

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.813
(thinking)
Because Z‐ARC may
have dangerous cards,

00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:02.053
<i>but we'’’ve got</i>
<i>all the heart!</i>

00:13:02.053 --> 00:13:04.553
Now I'm activating
my spell card,

00:13:04.553 --> 00:13:07.253
Rank‐Up‐Magic
Devotion Force!

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:09.153
Since your monster attacked,

00:13:09.153 --> 00:13:11.820
I can use this spell
on my Xyz Monster!

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.686
Raidraptor Rise Falcon!

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.720
And I get to Xyz Summon
a Raidraptor

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.953
that'’’s one Rank higher!

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.420
Terror of the skies,

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.253
predator of blazing force,

00:13:28.253 --> 00:13:31.820
with wings that slash
and talons that tear!

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.286
Now go, Rank Up
Xyz... Evolution!

00:13:36.286 --> 00:13:39.320
Rise up, Raidraptor
Blaze Falcon!

00:13:42.686 --> 00:13:44.720
(thinking) <i>Nice, Shay used</i>
<i>Z‐ARC's move</i>

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.220
<i>to summon</i>
<i>a stronger monster.</i>

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.086
<i>And two can play</i>
<i>that game 'cause</i>

00:13:48.086 --> 00:13:50.153
<i>I'’’ll summon a stronger</i>
<i>monster of my own!</i>

00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:52.053
I activate...

00:13:52.053 --> 00:13:55.653
the spell card Rank‐Up‐Magic
Limit Over Force!

00:13:55.653 --> 00:13:58.620
Since Shay used
a Rank‐Up‐Magic card

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.726
to summon a monster,

00:14:00.726 --> 00:14:02.593
I can use this spell
on my Cipher Dragon

00:14:02.593 --> 00:14:04.660
if I give up
half of my life points.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.326
(screaming)

00:14:10.093 --> 00:14:12.526
But that lets me
Xyz Summon a monster

00:14:12.526 --> 00:14:14.660
that'’’s one Rank higher!

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.626
Now bear witness

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:21.260
as the same
fantastic powers

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.826
that forged the universe

00:14:22.826 --> 00:14:25.493
forge this
most mighty creature!

00:14:25.493 --> 00:14:28.626
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon!

00:14:31.093 --> 00:14:32.360
But that'’’s not all!

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.793
Limitover Force multiplies

00:14:33.793 --> 00:14:36.660
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon's attack points

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.293
by the number
of Rank‐Up‐Magic cards

00:14:38.293 --> 00:14:40.293
that were played so far!

00:14:40.293 --> 00:14:41.960
Just like that,

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.693
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes doubles
its firepower!

00:14:47.426 --> 00:14:49.493
Not too shabby
a move there, Kite!

00:14:49.493 --> 00:14:53.326
I think I'’’ll activate
a Limitover Force of my own!

00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:56.126
But by doing so,
I also have to pay

00:14:56.126 --> 00:14:57.860
half my life points,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.560
but that's
a small price to pay

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.100
if it gives me
even the tiniest of chances

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.733
to bring you down, Z‐ARC!

00:15:03.733 --> 00:15:05.900
(screaming)

00:15:07.633 --> 00:15:09.733
I Xyz Summon a monster

00:15:09.733 --> 00:15:12.000
that'’’s one Rank higher
than Blaze Falcon!

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.366
Fiercest falcon,

00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:20.233
set your wings ablaze
and lock your gaze

00:15:20.233 --> 00:15:22.100
on our ill‐fated foe!

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.400
Now, make it so!

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.066
Go Rank Up
Xyz Evolution!

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.800
Welcome to the frontline,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.100
Raidraptor
Revolution Falcon!

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:38.866
And since three
Rank‐Up‐Magic cards

00:15:38.866 --> 00:15:40.366
have been played
up to now,

00:15:40.366 --> 00:15:42.100
Limitover Force
multiplies

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.733
Revolution Force's
attack points by three,

00:15:44.733 --> 00:15:47.766
making my monster
three times more powerful!

00:15:47.766 --> 00:15:51.566
Revolution Falcon now has
6,000 attack points!

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:57.500
You think they got
a fighting chance?

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.873
I hope.
Yeah.

00:16:07.173 --> 00:16:09.473
Got any more tricks
up your sleeves, Kite?

00:16:09.473 --> 00:16:12.173
I always got tricks.
Just watch.

00:16:12.173 --> 00:16:16.073
I activate
the trap Rank‐Up Gravity.

00:16:16.073 --> 00:16:18.340
This card weighs down
your options,

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.140
because your monsters are
now only allowed to attack

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.140
our Ranked up monsters!

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.506
But if you don't attack,

00:16:25.506 --> 00:16:27.473
your monsters will
pay most dearly

00:16:27.473 --> 00:16:29.440
because they will end up
being banished!

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.340
Whoa, what a move!

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.173
Z‐ARC's monsters aren't
as strong as Neo Galaxy‐Eyes

00:16:34.173 --> 00:16:35.840
or Revolution Falcon!

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.740
So they'’’re
as good as gone!

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.306
Kite and Shay got this!

00:16:39.306 --> 00:16:40.306
They'’’ll win!

00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:42.073
(chuckling)

00:16:42.073 --> 00:16:45.740
(evil cackling)

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:50.173
How cute!

00:16:50.173 --> 00:16:52.473
You actually thought
you had this in the bag!

00:16:52.473 --> 00:16:53.540
But you don'’’t!

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.240
I have Dark Rebellion

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.073
to stop anything you try!

00:16:57.073 --> 00:16:59.340
By returning it
to my Extra Deck,

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.546
I can resurrect
two Supreme King

00:17:01.546 --> 00:17:04.246
Dragon Darkwurms
from my graveyard.

00:17:04.246 --> 00:17:06.346
And both
your Xyz Monsters

00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:07.813
lose all their
attack points,

00:17:07.813 --> 00:17:09.713
leaving you powerless!

00:17:14.913 --> 00:17:16.613
What?!
Oh, no!

00:17:16.613 --> 00:17:18.813
They'’’re gonna lose!
I can't believe it.

00:17:18.813 --> 00:17:20.313
Uh, oh!

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.846
Oh, no!
Not again!

00:17:28.513 --> 00:17:30.480
Gong don'’’t like this
one bit!

00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:32.780
Come on, Yuya.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.613
You gotta stop Z‐ARC,

00:17:34.613 --> 00:17:36.413
or Kite and Shay are
done for!

00:17:36.413 --> 00:17:39.013
Stay and look
after these guys.

00:17:39.013 --> 00:17:40.613
Why do I have
to babysit?

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.513
You're like
all the others,

00:17:45.513 --> 00:17:48.080
pretenders instead of
contenders!

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.513
You never had a chance!

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.480
Darkwurms,
destroy Revolution Falcon

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.813
and Neo Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon

00:17:57.813 --> 00:17:59.286
and end this duel!

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:10.286
I now activate
the Action Spell Miracle!

00:18:10.286 --> 00:18:13.086
And I also
activate Evasion!

00:18:13.086 --> 00:18:14.786
Now, now, now,

00:18:14.786 --> 00:18:16.653
don'’’t try to make
a liar out of me!

00:18:16.653 --> 00:18:18.453
I said the duel is over!

00:18:18.453 --> 00:18:21.120
And what I say goes
because my special ability

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.753
destroys those pathetic cards
you just played!

00:18:32.053 --> 00:18:34.086
Guess this is the end.

00:18:37.553 --> 00:18:38.953
Hold it right there!

00:18:38.953 --> 00:18:41.286
This duel'’’s not over!

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:43.186
Huh?

00:18:45.986 --> 00:18:47.453
It'’’s Jack Atlas!

00:18:50.753 --> 00:18:51.953
Join me!

00:18:51.953 --> 00:18:53.453
Mm‐hmm.

00:18:54.786 --> 00:18:56.220
(computer voice)
<i>Intrusion penalty:</i>

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.586
<i>2,000 life points.</i>

00:19:02.526 --> 00:19:06.760
Excellent‐‐ this duel was
growing tedious anyway.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.893
I only hope you prove
more challenging than these two.

00:19:09.893 --> 00:19:11.793
You wasted my time!

00:19:11.793 --> 00:19:13.593
And now you'’’ll pay
the price!

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:23.693
(both screaming)

00:19:23.693 --> 00:19:25.360
Oh, no!

00:19:31.293 --> 00:19:34.493
We failed.
Z‐ARC is just too strong.

00:19:38.026 --> 00:19:40.660
I couldn't save... Yuya.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.360
But you can.

00:19:45.926 --> 00:19:47.960
Leave it to Gong!

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.360
Good luck.
You'’’ll need it.

00:19:52.193 --> 00:19:53.660
Gong never
let no one down,

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.360
and Gong ain'’’t starting now!

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.866
Yuya'’’s seen better days.

00:20:04.866 --> 00:20:06.466
That'’’s Z‐ARC.

00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:07.966
He's the worst
o' the worst o' the worst,

00:20:07.966 --> 00:20:09.900
and he's got Yuya
under wraps.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.600
Well then,
if that thing has Yuya,

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.266
let'’’s defeat that monster
and free him!

00:20:15.266 --> 00:20:17.300
Gong'’’s good with that!

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.133
This duel sounds like
one of the most dangerous ever,

00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:24.700
which is to say
it'’’s right up my alley!

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.933
Let'’’s see if you'’’re ready
for the Master of Faster!

00:20:27.933 --> 00:20:30.200
Hang in there, buddy!

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.300
Gong'’’s not leavin'’’
this dimension without ya!

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.833
Take this flyin'’’ freakster down,
you two!

00:20:37.833 --> 00:20:39.366
Do what I would do,
and you'’’ll be fine!

00:20:40.766 --> 00:20:43.300
(Jack)
Get ready, Z‐ARC...

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.666
Cause your time of terror'’’s
coming to an end!
