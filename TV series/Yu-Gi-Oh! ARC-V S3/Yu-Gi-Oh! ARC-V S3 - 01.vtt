I lost again.

One more duel!

(Yuto)
The people of Heartland
lived in peace...

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.033
'til the day
Duel Academy struck!

(panicked shouting)

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.933

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:41.366
He sent wave after wave of
combat machines against us,

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:45.200
and legions of his fanatical
Fusion Warriors, Obelisk Force,

00:01:01.073 --> 00:01:02.773

Nope.

It's just...
so wet.

Hey!

Hello there!

00:02:58.413 --> 00:03:00.013
Care to share?

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.320
We're awfully thirsty!

00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:06.586
What's wrong?

00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:19.653
Guys, how 'bout a quick
snack to lighten the load?

00:03:19.653 --> 00:03:21.253
You only volunteered
to carry the grub

00:03:21.253 --> 00:03:23.386
to get your mitts
on that meal.

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:24.920
Gong shoulda known.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.386
I don't think gobbling
up someone else's eats

00:03:27.386 --> 00:03:29.420
is the best way to make
a good first impression

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.386
to the folks
in this dimension.

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:33.220
She needs that food.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.220
But...

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.353
So do I!

00:03:36.353 --> 00:03:38.220
(stomach growling)

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.020
(man)
No!
Don't do it!

00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:43.620
I'm begging you!

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.253
I'll give you
anything you ask!

00:03:45.253 --> 00:03:47.286
(trilling sound)

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:48.186

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.320
No way!

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.920
He turned him into a card!

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.893
The Professor's responsible
for all this destruction.

00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:07.226
He has to be stopped.

00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:10.360
(girl)
They're going
to find us.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.626
I don't wanna
be turned into a card!

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:13.693
(woman)
Shh!
Be quiet!

00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:15.826
But Mom...

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:17.260
They'll hear you!

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.793
No!
Stay back!

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:21.126
I beg you!

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:22.360
Spare my children!

00:04:23.093 --> 00:04:24.826
It's okay.

00:04:24.826 --> 00:04:26.860
You just left in such
a hurry that you forgot

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.893
to take your stuff
with you.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.126
So we're returning it.

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:32.226
Here you go.

00:04:33.026 --> 00:04:34.026
Just take it!

00:04:34.026 --> 00:04:34.826
It's all yours!

00:04:35.926 --> 00:04:37.959
Please, just leave us be.

00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:42.593
You got it wrong.

00:04:42.593 --> 00:04:45.326
We just came here to give you
your food and water back.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:46.826
And thanks to me,
we didn't drink a drop

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:48.126
or sneak a snack.

00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:49.260
Here...

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:53.726
No, come back!

00:04:55.293 --> 00:04:56.560
Get back here!

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:04.133
Leave him!

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:05.200
Ta‐da!

00:05:08.633 --> 00:05:11.566
(scarfing)

00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:18.266
(moaning)

00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:21.533
You quit ogling
that food like a hungry pup!

00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:23.700
Those peepers need to be on
the look out for the enemy.

00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:26.733
Thank you.

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:28.666
I'm sorry I mistook you
for those invaders.

00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:30.400
But who are you?

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.033
What are you doing here?

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:33.900
We're looking for
a friend of ours.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.133
Her name
is Zuzu Boyle.

00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:38.166
She has blue eyes
and pink hair,

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:40.633
and a bracelet
on her right wrist.

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:42.600
Seen anyone fitting
that profile?

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:44.900
No.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.600
And if she was here,
she's probably

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.033
been turned
into a card by now.

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:52.600
There's not many of us left.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.433
But... how can that be?

00:05:55.433 --> 00:05:57.933
I thought that the Resistance
was holding their own against

00:05:57.933 --> 00:05:59.200
the warriors of Duel Academy.

00:06:00.606 --> 00:06:02.140
Not anymore.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.006
(man)
Someone stop them!

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:11.606
(crowd yelling)
Help me!

00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:16.740
Dimensions?

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.473
What's your master plan?

00:06:18.473 --> 00:06:19.840
(groans)

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.640
Our universe has been split
into four dimensions:

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.340
Fusion, Xyz, Synchro and
Standard all exist separately.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.506
But Duel Academy will
bring them all together...

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:33.040
that is the will
of the Professor!

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.806
No, never!

00:06:34.806 --> 00:06:36.640
I'll turn you
all into cards!

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.340
We can't.
It's payback!

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.973
Start down that road
and we'll become like them.

00:06:40.973 --> 00:06:41.840
So what?

00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:47.773
Acting like savages won't save
anyone or bring about peace.

00:06:47.773 --> 00:06:51.173
(thumping)

00:07:01.846 --> 00:07:03.546
(Shay)
The Resistance
has been wiped out.

00:07:03.546 --> 00:07:06.013
All of them!

00:07:06.013 --> 00:07:09.746
I can't remember the last time
we saw a Resistance fighter.

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:11.746
In fact, I don't think
any of them made it.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.680
Even my dear husband.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.880
He...

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.780
He was turned into a card!

00:07:20.146 --> 00:07:23.613
Dueling has brought nothing
but suffering to this world!

00:07:25.713 --> 00:07:28.646
(Gong)
Keep away from that can
of sardines!

00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:29.913
But Gong...

00:07:29.913 --> 00:07:32.146
The food's calling me over!

00:07:32.146 --> 00:07:34.913
Well, tell it you're
too busy right now!

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:37.146
Can't I please
have one crumb?

00:07:37.146 --> 00:07:38.680
Just an itty bitty bite.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.713
I'm famished!

00:07:39.713 --> 00:07:40.246
Tough it out!

00:07:41.313 --> 00:07:42.646
You don't
hear me groaning!

00:07:42.646 --> 00:07:44.580
(stomach growling)

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.246
But your stomach sure is!

00:07:47.246 --> 00:07:48.746
What?

00:07:48.746 --> 00:07:50.813
Clean them ears out, kid.
You're hearing things.

00:07:50.813 --> 00:07:51.546
Gong's stomach don't growl!

00:07:51.546 --> 00:07:52.780
(growling)

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.046
Oh.

00:07:56.046 --> 00:07:58.513
(giggling)

00:07:58.513 --> 00:08:01.120
(laughing)

00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:04.320
Care for a bite?

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.220
Really?

00:08:11.053 --> 00:08:14.486
Six targets found
and soon to be acquired.

00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:16.020
Don't think so!

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.720
Ah!

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.653
Our new friends wanna play!

00:08:21.653 --> 00:08:22.653
(man 1)
Excellent.

00:08:22.653 --> 00:08:25.386
I can't wait to see them
squirm and beg for mercy!

00:08:25.386 --> 00:08:28.786
(man 2)
Yeah, the begging's
the best part!

00:08:28.786 --> 00:08:31.920
You guys have a lot to learn.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.020
And we three are gonna teach you
a lesson you'll never forget!

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.586
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:45.320
(device)
Generating Action Field
Crossover.

00:08:49.286 --> 00:08:52.586
I want you to stay back here
where it's safe.

00:08:52.586 --> 00:08:54.153
All right, I'm up!

00:08:54.153 --> 00:08:56.653
I've never seen Duel Disks
like those before

00:08:56.653 --> 00:08:58.886
So that means they're
not the Resistance.

00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:01.426
No we're not,
we're Lancers.

00:09:01.426 --> 00:09:02.593
You're Lancers?

00:09:02.593 --> 00:09:03.760
Yeah...

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.193
(Declan)
Like legendary knights,

00:09:07.193 --> 00:09:08.660
those who will stand
on the front lines

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.126
are modern‐day warriors.

00:09:11.126 --> 00:09:14.726
And like those honorable,
ancient heroes, these Lancers

00:09:14.726 --> 00:09:17.360
will meet their enemies
and defeat them!

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.960
(cheering)

00:09:22.593 --> 00:09:26.560
We swore we would stop Duel
Academy from wreaking havoc...

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.993
and prove how wrong

00:09:27.993 --> 00:09:30.393
the Professor's
inter‐dimensional war is.

00:09:30.393 --> 00:09:31.460
No chance.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.960
Not happening.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.226
You might think we're
just following

00:09:34.226 --> 00:09:35.960
the Professor's orders.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.860
But we'd carry out his plan even
if he didn't order us to

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.126
because we believe
in his project!

00:09:41.126 --> 00:09:45.360
Yeah, it's a mindblower
he calls the ARC Project.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.960
It'll merge all four dimensions
into a single, perfect world!

00:09:51.426 --> 00:09:53.426
A perfect world?

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.560
Sounds fishy.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.526
And smells it, too.

00:09:56.526 --> 00:10:00.093
I like my dimension
exactly the way it is.

00:10:00.093 --> 00:10:02.100
So you better
back off, bub.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.100
What you're doing is wrong,
can't you see that?

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.466
If you knew our story, I think
you'd see that Duel Academy's

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:10.466
mission is hurting people...

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:14.933
Real change comes from making
people happy, not hurting them!

00:10:14.933 --> 00:10:16.800
When we arrived
in the Synchro Dimension,

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.566
we didn't know what
to expect,

00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:20.866
but thanks to a good friend
we got the lowdown,

00:10:20.866 --> 00:10:22.933
and boy was it low.

00:10:22.933 --> 00:10:25.600
You see, the city
was divided in two.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.566
Topsiders lived in luxury

00:10:27.566 --> 00:10:29.800
and had everything they could
possibly need,

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.633
while the Commons were forced
to live in their shadows,

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:35.200
struggling to survive.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.733
If you tried to fight back,
you risked Sector Security

00:10:37.733 --> 00:10:39.233
coming after you.

00:10:39.233 --> 00:10:40.633
They were the meanest
of the mean

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:43.100
and didn't mind
playing favorites.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.866
We saw firsthand how Sector
Security made life easy

00:10:45.866 --> 00:10:48.933
for the Topsiders, and
everything but for the Commons.

00:10:48.933 --> 00:10:51.233
And that's cause they were
controlled by a snake named

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:54.866
Roget who had slithered his way
into power and was secretly

00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:57.566
planning to take over
the entire city.

00:10:57.566 --> 00:10:59.500
He planned to use the cover
of a duel tournament

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.340
to make that happen.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.006
Roget knew the winner would
become the city's new hero‐‐

00:11:04.006 --> 00:11:05.840
so he used every
dirty trick in the book

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.473
to make sure the outcome
of the tournament

00:11:07.473 --> 00:11:10.106
would tilt
his way no matter what.

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:11.906
In Synchro,
they Turbo Duel!

00:11:11.906 --> 00:11:15.040
It was super entertaining,
and super fun.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.040
Every round was filled
with excitement and danger,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.506
especially with Roget's henchman
trying to take down

00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:23.306
my friends and me!

00:11:23.306 --> 00:11:25.506
But I wasn't gonna
let that stop me!

00:11:25.506 --> 00:11:28.240
I made it loud and clear to
everyone watching that dueling

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.573
should pull Topsiders
and Commons together

00:11:30.573 --> 00:11:32.806
and heal New Domino City...

00:11:32.806 --> 00:11:35.940
But not all my friends
agreed with me.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.540
That's why I'm fighting
to change this rotten

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.373
society once and for all!

00:11:40.373 --> 00:11:44.406
I'm tired of being treated like
an animal by this stinking mess

00:11:44.406 --> 00:11:45.306
they call a city!

00:11:45.306 --> 00:11:46.540
(nervous groan)

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.206
I've had enough.

00:11:48.206 --> 00:11:50.606
I'm going to force
them to change!

00:11:50.606 --> 00:11:53.106
I'm going to lead the Commons
in a rebellion to take the power

00:11:53.106 --> 00:11:56.140
that's rightfully ours and
overthrow the Topsiders!

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.540
(Yuya)
But Shinji didn't realize
he was playing

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.140
right into Roget's hands.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.346
The Commons and Topsiders
were just pawns in his game.

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:05.846
He wanted the city
to fall into chaos.

00:12:05.846 --> 00:12:07.846
Then he could
step in and seize control!

00:12:07.846 --> 00:12:10.213
It looked like Roget
was gonna succeed.

00:12:10.213 --> 00:12:13.713
Before the final duel began,
a massive protest broke out!

00:12:13.713 --> 00:12:16.046
Let's move out!

00:12:16.046 --> 00:12:18.880
(Yuya)
New Domino City
was falling into chaos...

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.146
<i>Attention,</i>
<i>people of New Domino!</i>

00:12:22.146 --> 00:12:24.913
<i>The chaos you are witnessing</i>
<i>in our fine city is proof</i>

00:12:24.913 --> 00:12:27.346
<i>that the High Council</i>
<i>has failed you,</i>

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:29.713
<i>and failed</i>
<i>to maintain the peace.</i>

00:12:29.713 --> 00:12:31.646
<i>But have no fear,</i>
<i>as there is one person</i>

00:12:31.646 --> 00:12:34.213
<i>who has never</i>
<i>failedyou...</i>

00:12:34.213 --> 00:12:36.113
<i>me.</i>

00:12:36.113 --> 00:12:38.880
<i>Therefore, I have taken it</i>
<i>upon myself</i>

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.313
with the humblest of humbles

00:12:40.313 --> 00:12:43.313
to be the new leader
of New Domino City.

00:12:43.313 --> 00:12:44.246
(gasps)

00:12:44.246 --> 00:12:46.013
That rat snake!

00:12:46.013 --> 00:12:48.313
<i>To ensure order, I have no</i>
<i>choice but to assume</i>

00:12:48.313 --> 00:12:51.513
<i>full authorityover this city</i>
<i>and its government.</i>

00:12:51.513 --> 00:12:54.180
<i>And as your new leader, I</i>
<i>think it would be in your</i>
<i>best</i>

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.346
<i>interests to declare a full</i>
<i>lockdown of the city.</i>

00:12:57.346 --> 00:12:59.246
(Yuya)
That's when Zuzu crashed in and
tried to set everyone straight!

00:13:01.186 --> 00:13:03.253
He's lying!

00:13:03.253 --> 00:13:06.086
He's using the chaos
so he can take over the city!

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:10.320
But people, both Commons and
Topsiders, you can't let him!

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.153
The City belongs to you!

00:13:12.153 --> 00:13:14.086
<i>So you gotta</i>
<i>work together...</i>

00:13:14.086 --> 00:13:15.986
Zuzu!

00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:18.886
'Cause when you're all united,
you can create a city

00:13:18.886 --> 00:13:20.520
where everybody is happy!

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.486
A city you could be proud of.

00:13:22.486 --> 00:13:26.720
If you're not one ‐ you're done!

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.520
Yuya, if you can hear me,
you have to convince them

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.753
to stop fighting
with each other.

00:13:31.753 --> 00:13:35.186
<i>I know you can do it.</i>

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:37.086
<i>I think that's</i>
<i>why we here.</i>

00:13:37.086 --> 00:13:39.386
<i>Not only to save our own</i>
<i>dimension but to bring peace</i>

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:41.120
<i>to all dimensions!</i>

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.886
<i>To show that dueltaining</i>
<i>is the way to achieve it!</i>

00:13:43.886 --> 00:13:45.986
<i>Dueltain your way</i>
<i>into their hearts!</i>

00:13:45.986 --> 00:13:46.486
(Roget)
<i>That's enough!</i>

00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:47.186
Zuzu!

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.620
(Yuya)
Just then, an urgent message
arrived from the reigning

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.086
Duel King, Jack Atlas.

00:13:54.086 --> 00:13:57.720
He challenged me to come face
him in the Friendship Cup final.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.360
Jack wanted me to go bold
and show the whole city

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.493
what dueling meant to me.

00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:05.226
I want to know if you
have what it takes.

00:14:05.226 --> 00:14:06.826
Yuya!

00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:09.926
Are you going to show how
a real dueltainer duels?

00:14:09.926 --> 00:14:13.260
Or let stage fright keep you
pacing behind the scenes?

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.026
The choice is yours!

00:14:15.026 --> 00:14:19.293
Jack wanted me to duel the only
way I knew how, by having fun.

00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:21.026
And that's what
I learned to do,

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.693
and that's what
I'm gonna do now!

00:14:29.826 --> 00:14:31.593
(Shay)
The scenery
hasn't changed much

00:14:31.593 --> 00:14:33.793
since the last time
I was here.

00:14:33.793 --> 00:14:36.460
(panting)

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.860
I already told you everything
I already know!

00:14:41.293 --> 00:14:42.393
Please!

00:14:42.393 --> 00:14:43.960
Let me go!

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.860
Declan Akaba...

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.160
Are you sure that's the name
of the Professor's son?

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.793
Yes, I'm sure!

00:14:51.793 --> 00:14:54.493
And that's everything,
I promise!

00:14:54.493 --> 00:14:56.226
Guess I'll go
pay him a visit.

00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:58.293
Cool, you do that.

00:14:58.293 --> 00:15:00.000
We're good now right?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.300
No, don't!

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.433
Your despicable father
has Lulu and I'll do anything

00:15:10.433 --> 00:15:12.433
and everything
to get her back.

00:15:12.433 --> 00:15:15.766
If you want to battle,
I have no objection to doing so.

00:15:15.766 --> 00:15:18.066
But I have one condition.

00:15:18.066 --> 00:15:20.433
And what's that?

00:15:20.433 --> 00:15:25.066
If you do exactly what I ask
and if you do it successfully,

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:27.633
then I'll agree
to be your opponent.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.200
(Shay)
Deciding to team up with Declan
gave me the best chance

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.300
to save Lulu.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.600
I just hope I was right...

00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:41.000
Once I realized
I was gonna duel for fun

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.900
no matter what the stakes,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.200
my one‐time enemies changed
ways and joined my side.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.033
And it wasn't only Shay.

00:15:49.033 --> 00:15:50.700
Barrett...

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.166
That's not me anymore.

00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:55.033
I've learned too much...

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:58.033
Far too much about Duel Academy.

00:15:58.033 --> 00:16:01.506
The Professor is a destructive
maniac with a mad dream,

00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:03.706
and I won't be part
of his scheme!

00:16:03.706 --> 00:16:07.606
I know that she would do
anything for me so I'm gonna do

00:16:07.606 --> 00:16:10.140
anything and everything
in my power to keep Zuzu

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.173
out of their hands.

00:16:12.173 --> 00:16:14.073
After first battling us,

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:17.806
two members of Duel Academy
joined our team.

00:16:17.806 --> 00:16:20.073
Our adventures together taught
us that when you duel

00:16:20.073 --> 00:16:23.006
with all your heart,
you can bring people together

00:16:23.006 --> 00:16:24.940
and change the world
for the better,

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.006
just like my duel with Jack
changed New Domino City!

00:16:28.006 --> 00:16:29.473
(laughing)

00:16:29.473 --> 00:16:31.340
Very clever!

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.706
You used your moves to send
a message to the whole city!

00:16:34.706 --> 00:16:38.406
None of those four monsters were
especially strong by themselves,

00:16:38.406 --> 00:16:41.606
but by working together
they made a huge impact!

00:16:41.606 --> 00:16:43.506
That's just what'll happen
in New Domino

00:16:43.506 --> 00:16:45.373
if people pull together!

00:16:45.373 --> 00:16:47.673
You've proven yourself
a worthy adversary,

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.740
but you still have to
prove you can beat me!

00:16:53.273 --> 00:16:54.940
Don't you see?

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.473
Change comes from
making people happy.

00:16:57.473 --> 00:16:59.640
They changed
and you all can too.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.080
The only things that are gonna
be changing here

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.946
is you three into cards!

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.880
(man)
The only things that
are gonna be changing here

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.713
is you three into cards!

00:17:14.713 --> 00:17:16.080
(Yuya)
All right then!

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.413
Swing far Pendulum!

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:23.413
And carve the
arc of victory!

00:17:23.413 --> 00:17:25.480
(all)
Our monsters are ready...

00:17:28.746 --> 00:17:31.380
... to swing into action!

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.946
(yelling)

00:17:34.713 --> 00:17:36.046
(grunting)

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.480
(yelling)

00:17:39.946 --> 00:17:42.846
(yelling)

00:17:53.913 --> 00:17:55.780
(screaming)

00:17:58.013 --> 00:17:59.546
So cool!

00:17:59.546 --> 00:18:01.786
Those creeps aren't
gonna bother us anymore!

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.420
Maybe...

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.320
I was wrong about dueling.

00:18:13.986 --> 00:18:17.420
(Yuya)
My duel with Jack really was
a new start for New Domino City,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.053
but I still can't believe Roget
wanted to destroy the city

00:18:20.053 --> 00:18:22.120
if it couldn't be his!

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.353
(Roget)
You think your all safe!?

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:26.586
That you've
defeated me and won?

00:18:26.586 --> 00:18:28.986
I hope that you don't
scare easily...

00:18:28.986 --> 00:18:33.053
Some of these dimensions
can be quite horrific.

00:18:33.053 --> 00:18:35.486
And this is checkmate!

00:18:35.486 --> 00:18:37.286
I'm clearing the board.

00:18:37.286 --> 00:18:40.186
Bon voyage, Yuya!
You lose!

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:44.453
(Yuya)
Roget was crazy, and if he was
trained by the Professor,

00:18:44.453 --> 00:18:46.920
I can only imagine
what he'll be like.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.153
(Roget laughing)

00:18:49.153 --> 00:18:50.786
I've really outdone myself.

00:18:50.786 --> 00:18:53.286
This is an incomparable
end game!

00:18:53.286 --> 00:18:55.953
(Yuya)
I still wish I could have
gotten through to Roget.

00:18:55.953 --> 00:18:58.820
But there was no talking
sense to him in the end.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.860
It was all chaos.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.526
You saved me.

00:19:03.526 --> 00:19:05.826
Hang on!

00:19:05.826 --> 00:19:07.360
(explosion)

00:19:09.093 --> 00:19:11.593
When Roget's interdimensional
transporter was fully

00:19:11.593 --> 00:19:14.793
operational I didn't know
what was gonna happen.

00:19:14.793 --> 00:19:17.293
I was so afraid my friends
would get hurt

00:19:17.293 --> 00:19:18.926
and that I'd never see
them again.

00:19:18.926 --> 00:19:21.326
The poor people of the City must
have been so scared,

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:23.360
'cause I knew I sure was.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.360
(laughing)

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.393
It's time,
time for you all to fall!

00:19:33.393 --> 00:19:36.893
You're all going into the void,
to disappear, forever!

00:19:36.893 --> 00:19:38.560
(laughing)

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.693
(Yuya)
I really thought
we were all done for.

00:19:40.693 --> 00:19:43.360
That Roget was going
to send us all away.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.126
All I could do was hope
for a miracle, and it happened.

00:19:47.126 --> 00:19:49.860
When Roget's plan backfired
and set him away

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.960
I knew that I could
never give up hope

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.693
that things can always
swing my way, our way!

00:19:55.693 --> 00:19:58.993
But little did I know how
short that moment would last.

00:19:58.993 --> 00:20:01.166
The hole's closed up!

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:03.300
And we're all
in one piece.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.733
Are we...

00:20:12.733 --> 00:20:13.633
safe now?

00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:15.233
We are.

00:20:15.233 --> 00:20:17.200
Everything's gonna
be okay, Zuzu.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.400
I promise.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.733
'Cause you're back
with your friends.

00:20:21.733 --> 00:20:24.266
And Roget won't
bother us anymore.

00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:26.600
So let's win this war
and go home.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.766
Yuya...

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.266
I'm glad you're all right.

00:20:41.233 --> 00:20:45.333
(alarm beeping)

00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:47.900
What the‐‐
Yuya, what's happening now?

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.900
Not sure, but it looks like
the dimensional transporter

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.666
is rebooting again!

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:53.666
Zuzu!

00:20:53.666 --> 00:20:55.300
Yuya!

00:20:56.666 --> 00:20:59.233
Zuzu!

00:20:59.233 --> 00:21:00.306
(screaming)

00:21:00.306 --> 00:21:01.473
(Gong grunts)

00:21:01.473 --> 00:21:03.706
Don't let go!

00:21:03.706 --> 00:21:05.306
(Yuya)
I may have you lost you, Zuzu,

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:08.306
but I won't stop until
I find you again!

00:21:08.306 --> 00:21:10.173
And I'll do it with
the help of my friends!

00:21:10.173 --> 00:21:13.706
(screaming)

00:21:13.706 --> 00:21:15.540
(trilling sound)

00:21:18.706 --> 00:21:20.340
All righty!

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.606
It's time to give you losers
a piece of your own medicine

00:21:22.606 --> 00:21:24.573
and turn you three
into cards.

00:21:24.573 --> 00:21:25.773
Hold on!

00:21:25.773 --> 00:21:27.540
How does this
Duel Disk work?

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.273
We can't turn
them into cards!

00:21:29.273 --> 00:21:31.306
We have to, Yuya!

00:21:31.306 --> 00:21:33.606
If not, they'll call
for reinforcements!

00:21:33.606 --> 00:21:36.440
Even so, we can't duel down
to their level!

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.573
You know that!

00:21:37.573 --> 00:21:38.706
Come on!

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.706
Just as I thought!

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:44.840
(explosion)

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.240
What was that?

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:56.706
Looks like this
is my lucky day.

00:22:01.146 --> 00:22:03.646
I love it when
the prey comes to me.
