WEBVTT

00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.200
Yuya!

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.966
Zuzu!

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.566
I'm so glad
that you're safe.

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.866
Less chat, more run!

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.566
Uh, nice to see you too?
What's up?

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.333
It's your dad!

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.566
He's down at the docks,
Yuya, but not for long!

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.600
Uh, you saw my dad?

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.400
(Yusho)
Alexis, it's not safe
for you to go.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.100
Please, listen to me.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.633
I will not put one
of my students in danger.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:33.633
Sorry, but I am going,
and that's final.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:36.200
Oh, Alexis,
you're as stubborn as ever.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.433
All I ask is that
when we meet Leo,

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:41.033
you promise to let me
do all the talking.

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:43.500
And I promise
you something, Yusho.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500
You're never getting
to Duel Academy.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.933
You may have been able
to elude me once,

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.966
but now, you're mine!

(Sylvio)
You slow pokes!
We just missed 'em!

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:01.680
My dad is really on that ship?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.646
Yeah.
I'm so sorry, Yuya.

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:05.780
We can't give up that easy!

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.246
Where are you going?

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:08.446
(Yuya)
To find another boat!

00:02:08.446 --> 00:02:10.213
A yacht would do.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.580
All right, Gong's gonna
go check out the marina.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.846
You jet over to the jetty
and see what you see.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:17.379
(ship horn blowing)

00:02:20.246 --> 00:02:22.180
If it's a duel
that you want,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.580
it's a duel that
you'll get, Dennis!

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.880
Oh, I do want a duel,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.980
just not with you.
Huh?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.580
So, Teach, tell me.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.513
You up for putting your razzle
against my dazzle?

00:02:32.513 --> 00:02:35.080
Zip it, red.
Huh?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.280
Kite!
What a surprise!

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.880
What are you
doing here?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.313
I did a little dimension hopping
to help free a friend.

00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:44.180
Is that so?

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.480
I didn't think someone
like you had friends.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.546
Guess the brooding
loner thing's still in.

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:51.613
The Professor is holding
Lulu hostage.

00:02:51.613 --> 00:02:54.113
You're gonna tell me
where he's keeping her.

00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:55.880
But I kinda hope you won't,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.413
because I'd love
to duel it out of you.

00:02:58.413 --> 00:03:00.346
Duel it out of me?

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.753
You're a regular
laugh riot!

00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:04.553
I guess the only thing
Duel Academy

00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:07.420
didn't take away from you
was your sense of humor.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.286
Funny, but I wonder
if you'll be laughing

00:03:10.286 --> 00:03:13.186
after I tell you Duel Academy
is starting to doubt

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:15.420
the Professor
and his plan.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.020
Even your leader Aster Phoenix
joined our side.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.520
Is this true?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.220
Yeah. After getting his deck
handed to him by Yuya,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.986
Aster pulled a 180
on Duel Academy.

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:28.853
Yuya sure knows
how to put on a show.

00:03:28.853 --> 00:03:30.453
(chuckles)

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:33.120
He even got me to cool it
a couple of degrees.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.386
But I'm thinking
that right now,

00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:38.086
it's time to heat
things up again!

00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:40.153
Whatever.
I can't believe Aster

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:43.286
actually joined your side
because of Yuya's lame‐taining.

00:03:43.286 --> 00:03:44.586
How pathetic.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:47.386
Yuya... huh.

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:50.420
Now then, Kite,
enough with all this chit‐chat.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.853
Let's get to dueling.

00:03:51.853 --> 00:03:54.620
After all, schooling you
in front of our teacher

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.353
will be so much fun!

00:03:56.353 --> 00:03:59.020
Come to think of it,
why stop there?

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.026
I think I'll make
a point of embarrassing you

00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:02.960
in front of each and every
passenger on this ship!

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.393
I'm going to put on
a duel‐stravaganza!

00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:07.060
That's bad, right?

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.893
Yes.
I still don't think

00:04:08.893 --> 00:04:11.826
Dennis knows what it means
to be a dueltainer.

00:04:11.826 --> 00:04:13.393
Come one, come all!

00:04:13.393 --> 00:04:15.260
Watch as I put on
a dueltaining performance

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.860
that you'll never forget!

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.826
And it won't cost you
a thing!

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:21.060
However, my opponent
will pay most dearly!

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.460
Hurry up now!

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.393
You won't want to miss
a thing!

00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:25.793
This sounds good.

00:04:25.793 --> 00:04:26.793
Ooh!
A duel!

00:04:26.793 --> 00:04:28.660
Let's move down.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.393
(Dennis)
Please, get off your seats
and rise to your feet,

00:04:31.393 --> 00:04:34.259
and welcome the hero
who's no zero‐‐ me!

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.493
Dennis McField!

00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:40.193
And now, let's shed some light
on the villainous Kite!

00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:43.060
Quit messing around.
Let's just duel.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.926
I don't understand, Kite.

00:04:44.926 --> 00:04:47.260
You're pal Yuya's
all about this stuff.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.893
If it's 'cause
I called you villain,

00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:51.360
I could change it to heel
or maybe scoundrel?

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.060
Enough jibber jabber!

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.560
Fine, on with the show!

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.260
(together)
Let's duel!

00:05:01.733 --> 00:05:03.833
I'd let you go first,
but this crowd

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:05.466
deserves a big opener!

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:06.800
So I'm going
to give them one,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.766
with a Pendulum Summon!

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:10.200
I set the Pendulum Scale

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.633
with Scale Two
Performage Bubble Gardna

00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:16.933
and Scale Five Performage
Candy Crafter!

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.200
Now, I can summon monsters
between Level Three and Four

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.766
all at the same time!

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:28.200
I Pendulum Summon!

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.733
First up
is Performage Hat Tricker.

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:35.866
Then the red hot performer
Performage Flame Eater!

00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:39.766
With two Level Four monsters,
he can Xyz Summon!

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:43.266
But ladies and gentlemen
don't you bat an eye,

00:05:43.266 --> 00:05:47.333
because before you know it,
these two will be gone, bye‐bye!

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:49.966
Now, watch as I overlay
these two monsters

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.200
and build the Overlay Network!

00:05:54.966 --> 00:05:57.833
Direct your eyes to the skies,

00:05:57.833 --> 00:06:02.640
as I present to you
a swinging star performer!

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.273
Here he comes!

00:06:05.273 --> 00:06:10.873
I Xyz Summon,
Performage Trapeze Magician!

00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:12.473
(crowd gasping)

00:06:12.473 --> 00:06:14.140
Wow!

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.073
I think that'll do
for my turn,

00:06:16.073 --> 00:06:18.073
which means it's your time
to shine, Kite,

00:06:18.073 --> 00:06:19.673
unless you have
stage fright.

00:06:19.673 --> 00:06:21.406
You'd like that.

00:06:21.406 --> 00:06:23.973
But I don't scare
that easily.

00:06:23.973 --> 00:06:25.840
Since you have
an Xyz Monster,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.273
then I'm allowed
to summon this.

00:06:28.273 --> 00:06:31.140
So set your sights
on my Cipher Twin Raptor!

00:06:35.273 --> 00:06:37.006
But I'm not done just yet.

00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:38.973
There's more.
Much more.

00:06:38.973 --> 00:06:41.040
Next I summon
Cipher Wing!

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.006
And by tributing
my Cipher Wing,

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:46.873
its special ability increases
my Raptor's Level by four.

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:48.273
Whenever I'm Xyz Summoning,

00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:51.306
Cipher Twin Raptor
counts as two Monsters.

00:06:51.306 --> 00:06:55.173
So with these two, I build
the Overlay Network!

00:07:00.573 --> 00:07:02.680
Now, by way
of the cosmic energies

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.313
that make up our galaxy,

00:07:04.313 --> 00:07:06.580
I'll make something
just as mighty.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.880
I Xyz Summon
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:07:16.413 --> 00:07:19.013
Ooh, nice!
A ferocious dragon

00:07:19.013 --> 00:07:20.346
is just what a villain
would use

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:22.980
against my poor
acrobatic hero.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.046
You ever think of taking up
my line of work?

00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:28.246
I'll let you
be my opening act!

00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:32.413
Work your way to partner.
Imagine the box office!

00:07:32.413 --> 00:07:35.913
But 90‐10 split for me.

00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:37.646
Let's get on
with the show,

00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:39.613
'cause this next move's
a real blockbuster!

00:07:41.246 --> 00:07:44.980
I now use one of
Cipher Dragon's Overlay Units

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.213
to activate
its special ability!

00:07:47.213 --> 00:07:49.413
Cipher Subjection!

00:07:49.413 --> 00:07:51.880
(roars)

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.980
I gain control
of your Trapeze Magician...

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.786
and transform it
into a Galaxy‐Eyes!

00:08:00.786 --> 00:08:02.853
Wow!
Great plot twist!

00:08:02.853 --> 00:08:05.686
I didn't see that one coming.

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:09.586
But since you took my monster,
you have nothing to attack.

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:11.853
(gasps)
Unless you plan
on attacking moi!

00:08:11.853 --> 00:08:13.653
Exactly.

00:08:13.653 --> 00:08:15.586
Galaxy‐Eyes,
let's do this!

00:08:15.586 --> 00:08:17.320
Unleash your fury!

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.786
Cipher Stream
of Destruction!

00:08:19.786 --> 00:08:21.420
So predictable.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.986
You've played
right into my hands!

00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:24.986
Thanks to your attack,
I can now summon

00:08:24.986 --> 00:08:27.586
Performage String Figure!

00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:30.086
He's gonna give me
a hand with this.

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:32.020
(laughs maniacally)

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:37.586
(crowd gasping)

00:08:37.586 --> 00:08:39.353
<i>Tres magnifique!</i>

00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:42.186
Not only did String Figure
bring some flash to our clash,

00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:44.720
but he gets to stick around
for the fireworks!

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.386
Sweet, right?

00:08:46.386 --> 00:08:48.520
Well, things are about
to get even sweeter,

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.953
because I'm activating
Candy Crafter's Pendulum ability

00:08:51.953 --> 00:08:54.986
which gives me
1,000 life points!

00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:57.720
(singing)

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.220
(growls)

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.626
Candy Crafter can only
give me those sweet treats

00:09:01.626 --> 00:09:04.426
because I have a Performage
monster on my field.

00:09:04.426 --> 00:09:06.326
So thanks
a whole bunch, Kite!

00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:09.360
Because if you attacked
my Trapeze Magician

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.326
rather than taking
control of it,

00:09:11.326 --> 00:09:12.860
I would have
taken more damage

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.960
instead of gaining
life points.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.993
I'm the one
who's got the candy,

00:09:16.993 --> 00:09:18.593
but it looks like
the crowd's the ones

00:09:18.593 --> 00:09:20.160
who are eating it up!

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.126
I place a card facedown
and end my turn, which means

00:09:25.126 --> 00:09:27.893
now Cipher Dragon's
ability comes to a close,

00:09:27.893 --> 00:09:29.526
and control
of Trapeze Magician

00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:31.160
returns to you.

00:09:33.993 --> 00:09:36.026
You really almost
had me there, Kite!

00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:38.193
I'd say your strategies
are two‐dimensional,

00:09:38.193 --> 00:09:40.660
but I haven't even
turned you into a card yet.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.926
But I have all the pieces
in place to do so,

00:09:42.926 --> 00:09:44.960
and our teacher
has a front row view!

00:09:47.393 --> 00:09:48.526
(chuckles)

00:09:57.493 --> 00:09:59.560
Here I go!

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.333
First up, I summon
Performage Damage Juggler!

00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:05.533
(chuckles)

00:10:05.533 --> 00:10:06.933
And now, I'll activate

00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:09.400
Performage String Figure's
ability!

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.600
With it, I can fuse
monsters together

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.866
without having
to use Polymerization!

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:16.500
So, without further ado,
Damage Juggler

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.266
and String Figure...

00:10:18.266 --> 00:10:23.766
let your magic and majesty mix,
mingle, merge and become one!

00:10:23.766 --> 00:10:26.633
One with the power
to both delight and destroy!

00:10:26.633 --> 00:10:28.966
I Fusion Summon!

00:10:28.966 --> 00:10:31.900
Performage Trapeze Witch!

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.133
This tandem of high flyers
are gonna swing me to victory!!

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:40.300
Next I'll use an Overlay Unit

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.266
to activate Trapeze Magician 's
special ability!

00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:46.266
And this ability
is not all smoke and mirrors.

00:10:46.266 --> 00:10:48.533
You see, it allows
Trapeze Magician

00:10:48.533 --> 00:10:50.600
to attack two times
in one turn!

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.866
Of course, since my dragon

00:10:52.866 --> 00:10:54.666
is stronger
than Trapeze Magician,

00:10:54.666 --> 00:10:56.066
you'd lose those battles.

00:10:56.066 --> 00:10:58.366
So I have to assume
the witch you just played

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.800
has an ability‐‐

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.340
one that gives you
the clear edge.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.940
Exactly right!

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.206
I sure can't sneak
anything past you!

00:11:06.206 --> 00:11:08.073
So let me guess,
you have something

00:11:08.073 --> 00:11:09.973
all set to offset this, right?

00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:12.540
You better believe I do.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.406
I'm activating the trap card
Cipher Deterrent,

00:11:15.406 --> 00:11:18.873
so now my dragon
can't be destroyed this turn.

00:11:18.873 --> 00:11:22.873
And after a battle,
its attack points are doubled!

00:11:22.873 --> 00:11:25.406
Ahh!
I sure didn't see that coming!

00:11:25.406 --> 00:11:27.140
Actually, if we're being
completely honest,

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.173
I totally did.

00:11:29.173 --> 00:11:31.473
In fact, I've got all
the deets on your deck, Kite.

00:11:31.473 --> 00:11:33.573
You lie.
It's the truth.

00:11:33.573 --> 00:11:36.440
See, back at Duel Academy
we have the best database

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.540
in this or any dimension,
and it's got info

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.806
on duelists from everywhere‐‐
duelists like you, Kite.

00:11:41.806 --> 00:11:43.906
So I did my research
and memorized

00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:45.506
each and every one
of your duel tactics.

00:11:45.506 --> 00:11:46.906
(growls)
In other words,

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:49.440
I know every move
you can possibly make!

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.673
And because I do,

00:11:51.673 --> 00:11:54.240
there's no way you can
out‐strategize me!

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.840
I use Trapeze Magician's
last Overlay Unit!

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:01.680
So now his high‐flying partner

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.880
can swing way high in the sky
and attack twice!

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.813
And it's going to make
for a swing‐tacular show!

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:13.046
Trapeze Magician,
swing your size 16s

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:14.613
into Galaxy‐Eyes!

00:12:14.613 --> 00:12:16.046
Ya‐ha!

00:12:16.046 --> 00:12:18.946
And Trapeze Force Witch
lends a helping hand

00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:21.380
by lowering the attack points
of Galaxy‐Eyes

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.780
by 600!

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.680
But due to Cipher Deterrent,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.180
nothing you do can destroy
my Galaxy‐Eyes!

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.746
But you still take damage.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.846
Granted, it's only 100 points,
but that number will grow,

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:44.813
especially when
Trapeze Magician

00:12:44.813 --> 00:12:46.946
attacks you for a second time!

00:12:46.946 --> 00:12:48.613
Ya‐ha‐ha!

00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:53.546
Throw him harder this time
so that Galaxy‐Eyes

00:12:53.546 --> 00:12:57.080
loses even more attack points!

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.246
(roars)

00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:00.953
Oh, no, Kite's poor monster

00:13:00.953 --> 00:13:02.986
keeps getting
weaker and weaker.

00:13:02.986 --> 00:13:06.020
Since your monster is weaker,
you take more damage!

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.153
700 points, to be exact!

00:13:08.153 --> 00:13:09.886
(wincing)

00:13:09.886 --> 00:13:12.520
Trapeze Magician
may have finished attacking,

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.320
but now
it's Trapeze Witch's turn!

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.253
First things first!

00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:20.553
Swing the attack points of
Galaxy‐Eyes down another 600.

00:13:20.553 --> 00:13:23.886
Ya‐ha!

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.753
Now, Trapeze Witch,
let that Galaxy‐Eyes have it

00:13:26.753 --> 00:13:28.686
with all your toe‐tapping might,

00:13:28.686 --> 00:13:31.286
and kiss Kite's
life points away!

00:13:33.886 --> 00:13:35.086
(roars)

00:13:35.086 --> 00:13:37.053
(gasps)

00:13:37.053 --> 00:13:38.553
(grunts)

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:43.153
Oh, no!

00:13:43.153 --> 00:13:43.720
(whimpers)

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.353
(moans)

00:13:47.353 --> 00:13:49.353
How was that for you?

00:13:49.353 --> 00:13:50.786
Because I must admit,

00:13:50.786 --> 00:13:53.153
it was a real day
at the circus for me!

00:13:53.153 --> 00:13:53.253
(giggles)

00:13:54.686 --> 00:13:56.786
That was seriously one
of my top moves ever‐‐

00:13:56.786 --> 00:13:58.486
a big top move!

00:13:58.486 --> 00:14:00.660
Quit clowning around
and finish your turn!

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.260
You have one attack left,
after all!

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
I completely understand,
just like our audience,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.360
you can't wait
to see how this ends.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.593
So now, on with the show!

00:14:10.593 --> 00:14:13.393
Attack Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon!

00:14:13.393 --> 00:14:17.360
But don't forget to dock it
600 attack points first!

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.260
Ah, how the mighty
have fallen.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.160
And now,
it's your turn to fall!

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.393
(battle cries)

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.660
(groans)

00:14:27.793 --> 00:14:30.193
Job well done!
Take a bow!

00:14:31.726 --> 00:14:34.693
Since we've now reached
the end of the turn,

00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:36.960
Cipher Deterrent
doubles the attack points

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.093
of Galaxy‐Eyes.

00:14:38.093 --> 00:14:39.660
(grunting)

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.460
It's my turn.
I draw!

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.226
It's Saya's card.

00:14:48.226 --> 00:14:50.326
With her by side,

00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:54.393
there's absolutely nothing
that I can't do.

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:55.960
I think it's my turn to show you

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.293
what real entertainment is,
Dennis!

00:14:58.293 --> 00:15:00.600
Real entertainment?

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.766
I summon forth Little Fairy!

00:15:05.766 --> 00:15:06.900
(giggles)

00:15:08.333 --> 00:15:10.200
Oh, my!
Little Fairy!

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.633
This can't be.

00:15:11.633 --> 00:15:14.666
The database never said
you had that card.

00:15:14.666 --> 00:15:17.066
I guess your database
doesn't know everything,

00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:18.466
does it, Dennis?

00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:19.933
What do you mean?

00:15:19.933 --> 00:15:21.800
It doesn't know
the power of friendship

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.400
can get me out of anything,
and that's a lesson

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.433
you're about to learn
the hard way.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.433
By sending one card
in my hand to the graveyard,

00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:33.400
Little Fairy
gains a Level.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.800
So I discard Cipher Etranger
to raise her to Level Four!

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.000
And when Cipher Etranger
is sent to the graveyard,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.366
I can add one
Rank‐Up‐Magic card to my hand.

00:15:44.366 --> 00:15:47.533
And I'm not gonna waste
any time in activating it!

00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:51.600
So, go!
Rank‐Up‐Magic Cipher Ascension!

00:15:53.266 --> 00:15:56.533
Say farewell to Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon

00:15:56.533 --> 00:16:00.706
and hello to a monster
of even greater galactic power!

00:16:00.706 --> 00:16:03.673
Go! Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:16:03.673 --> 00:16:07.773
Now, bear witness, as the same
fantastic powers

00:16:07.773 --> 00:16:11.540
that forged the universe
forge this most mighty creature!

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:16.873
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:16:16.873 --> 00:16:18.873
(roars)

00:16:18.873 --> 00:16:20.540
Amazing!

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.873
Incredible!

00:16:21.873 --> 00:16:24.440
(gasps)

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.506
And Rank‐Up‐Magic
Cipher Ascension

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:29.140
gives my Neo Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.473
500 extra attack points!

00:16:31.473 --> 00:16:32.473
(crowd gasping)

00:16:32.473 --> 00:16:33.773
(man)
That thing packs a punch!

00:16:33.773 --> 00:16:36.140
(woman)
I've never seen
a monster so powerful!

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.973
Now comes the fun part.

00:16:37.973 --> 00:16:41.306
I use all of Neo Galaxy‐Eyes'
Overlay Units

00:16:41.306 --> 00:16:43.673
to activate
its special ability!

00:16:43.673 --> 00:16:47.106
Cipher Super Subjection!

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:50.540
This time, I steal

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.506
all your monsters,
and transform them

00:16:53.506 --> 00:16:56.106
into Neo Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon!

00:16:56.106 --> 00:16:58.306
(crowd cheering)

00:16:58.306 --> 00:17:01.313
While I appreciate you
getting the crowd riled up,

00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:04.013
the truth is, there's really
nothing to applaud.

00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:07.680
Because you must remember,
I analyzed all your cards

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.746
in Duel Academy's database,
and I know the monsters

00:17:10.746 --> 00:17:13.646
you stole from me
aren't allowed to attack me.

00:17:13.646 --> 00:17:16.546
And your two remaining monsters
that can attack me?

00:17:16.546 --> 00:17:19.380
I can use my Bubble Gardna's
Pendulum ability

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.613
to cut the damage
I take in half.

00:17:21.613 --> 00:17:24.113
So you're saying that
even if I attack you,

00:17:24.113 --> 00:17:26.346
you'll still have
life points left.

00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:27.713
Exactly right.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.046
Exactly wrong.

00:17:29.046 --> 00:17:30.446
I'm now activating

00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:33.046
the spell card
Cipher Interference!

00:17:34.713 --> 00:17:38.613
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon,
attack Dennis directly!

00:17:38.613 --> 00:17:40.846
(roars)

00:17:43.213 --> 00:17:45.746
And this attack will be
one for the ages,

00:17:45.746 --> 00:17:47.446
because Cipher Interference

00:17:47.446 --> 00:17:50.413
doubles Neo Galaxy‐Eyes
Cipher Dragon's attack points!

00:17:50.413 --> 00:17:52.546
I don't like
where this is going.

00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:54.313
Go, Neo Galaxy‐Eyes!

00:17:54.313 --> 00:17:57.013
Cipher Stream
of Devastation!

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.953
(gasps)

00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:02.220
(screams)

00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:16.886
(crowd muttering)

00:18:24.753 --> 00:18:26.753
(one person clapping)

00:18:26.753 --> 00:18:28.253
Huh?

00:18:31.386 --> 00:18:34.420
(crowd begins applauding)

00:18:37.453 --> 00:18:39.486
(woman)
Bravo!
(man)
Amazing!

00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:40.720
(woman 2)
What a show!

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.553
(man 2)
Man, I'm so lucky
I got to see this duel.

00:18:43.553 --> 00:18:45.053
(grunts)

00:18:45.053 --> 00:18:46.353
This can't be.

00:18:46.353 --> 00:18:48.386
I did everything
I possibly could.

00:18:48.386 --> 00:18:51.320
But my best just wasn't even
close to being good enough!

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.353
(Yusho)
Dennis, don't be rude.

00:18:53.353 --> 00:18:55.153
The first rule
for a dueltainer

00:18:55.153 --> 00:18:56.720
is to acknowledge the crowd,

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.220
especially one
that's cheering for you.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.153
Why don't you take a bow?

00:19:00.153 --> 00:19:02.793
You're wrong.
They're not cheering for me.

00:19:02.793 --> 00:19:04.660
A crowd never cheers
for the loser.

00:19:06.326 --> 00:19:09.493
Then I think you need
to listen a bit more closely.

00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:10.793
(crowd cheering)
Huh?

00:19:10.793 --> 00:19:13.360
You see, a true dueltainer

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.993
doesn't focus
on winning the duel.

00:19:14.993 --> 00:19:17.726
A true dueltainer focuses
on winning the crowd

00:19:17.726 --> 00:19:19.960
and making them smile.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.393
You and Kite both did,
and that's what makes

00:19:22.393 --> 00:19:24.460
for a great show.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.360
(cheers and applause)

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.360
Now then, Dennis, join us.

00:19:33.993 --> 00:19:37.393
Join our side and we can
fix Duel Academy together.

00:19:37.393 --> 00:19:40.293
Bring smiles to the world
instead of fear,

00:19:40.293 --> 00:19:42.760
as a true dueltainer.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.693
There's still time to change.

00:19:44.693 --> 00:19:46.093
There's not.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.360
All the things I've done
and friends I've betrayed,

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.593
there's no coming back
from that.

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:55.593
Dennis...

00:19:55.593 --> 00:19:57.093
Stay back!

00:19:57.093 --> 00:19:59.526
Listen, Kite,
I know where Lulu is,

00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:02.300
And a girl who looks
just like her, named Rin.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.333
Hey, that's who Yugo
was looking for!

00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:07.400
There are two huge towers
at Duel Academy.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.133
You can't miss it.

00:20:09.133 --> 00:20:11.766
Rin is in the east tower,
Lulu's in the west.

00:20:11.766 --> 00:20:13.233
(gasps lightly)

00:20:13.233 --> 00:20:14.933
If the Professor knew
I told you that,

00:20:14.933 --> 00:20:17.233
he'd have me walking
a tightrope with no net!

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:18.900
But I would never
forgive myself

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.000
had I kept it from you.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.700
'Cause when you're in
the business of dueltaining

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.066
it's all about
leaving the crowd

00:20:25.066 --> 00:20:27.266
with a smile on their face.

00:20:27.266 --> 00:20:29.300
Many thanks
for everything, Teach.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.466
I really hope you enjoyed
the show.

00:20:31.466 --> 00:20:32.866
Dennis, don't do this!

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:34.266
(Yusho and Alexis gasp)

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:36.766
And now, it's time
for my swan song,

00:20:36.766 --> 00:20:39.200
the grand finale,
the final curtain.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.133
In other words,
goodbye, everyone!

00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:42.300
No, don't!
Dennis!

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.300
No!

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.033
Until next time!

00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:58.300
(seagulls cawing)

00:21:01.073 --> 00:21:02.873
Anyone have any luck?

00:21:02.873 --> 00:21:04.573
Gong sure didn't.

00:21:04.573 --> 00:21:06.606
Same with me‐‐ nothing.

00:21:06.606 --> 00:21:08.973
There's not a captain
in sight!

00:21:08.973 --> 00:21:10.773
I'm afraid we're just
gonna have to face it.

00:21:10.773 --> 00:21:12.540
We're completely landlocked.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.906
(woman)
Don't be so sure.

00:21:13.906 --> 00:21:16.573
Wait a minute.
Is that...?

00:21:16.573 --> 00:21:17.506
Celina!

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.373
Heard you need a boat!
Well, I'm lookin' for a crew!
