WEBVTT

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.566
(Yuya)
Previously on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh!
ARC‐V"...

00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.866
(Aster Phoenix)
Those circus moves
aren't gonna save you forever,

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.333
'cause you are destined
for defeat, Yuya.

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.500
And it's a defeat
I can't wait to deliver!

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.033
(Yuya)
The Professor taught you

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.000
that dueling is for power
and control,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.533
but my dad told you
that it's for fun and smiles.

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.266
So which of the two is right?

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.833
For me it's a no brainer,
but I bet you're having doubts.

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:27.633
Not in the slightest.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:31.766
Now, Dystopia, muzzle that
laugh maker once and for all!

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.766
(screaming)

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.466
Bet you don't feel
like smiling now.

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.566
I'm not givin' up gettin'
you to duel for fun.

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.066
It's showtime!

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.200
I activate the action spell
Miracle Fire!

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.466
Huh?!

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.700
It doubles Brave‐Eyes's
attack points to 6600!

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.500
Searing Flame Strike!

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:07.906
A dueltainer
beat me again.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.406
(Grace)
Yuya won!

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.740
If the Professor hears
how the Lancers outdueled us,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.740
he's going to make us pay
for failing him.

00:01:18.606 --> 00:01:19.806
(Noro)
Don't worry.

00:01:19.806 --> 00:01:22.906
You won't be punished,
because Noro has a plan.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.146
You've been on quite
the roll, Yuya,

00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:38.846
but your dueltaining ways
are coming to a screeching halt!

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:41.846
For you see, watching you
topple the Tyler twins

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:43.913
and cruise past Commander
Phoenix has confirmed

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:45.546
what I've known all along,

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:49.013
and that's, that I, and I alone
am the only one capable

00:02:49.013 --> 00:02:52.380
of putting you and your lot
of Lancers out of commission.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.313
Now, soldiers, capture him.

00:02:54.313 --> 00:02:57.346
I'm already 23 minutes
and 32 seconds behind schedule.

00:02:57.346 --> 00:03:00.380
Figures you'd have others
do the heavy lifting for you.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.086
Like, you couldn't duel
yourself out of a paper bag.

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:04.586
(grunting)

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:07.086
Of course I can beat
them on my own!

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.753
But I don't like getting
my hands dirty.

00:03:09.753 --> 00:03:12.486
Now enough standing around!
Get ready for battle!

00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:15.353
Grr.
Aster?!

00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:17.586
Uh, Aster, what are you doing?

00:03:17.586 --> 00:03:19.753
What I should've done
a long time ago...

00:03:19.753 --> 00:03:21.686
stand up for what's right.

00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:24.686
We all need to chill out
on the gloom and doom.

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:25.786
Yeah.

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.786
Instead of fear,

00:03:30.786 --> 00:03:34.286
Yuya and his dad ducked the
tears and brought the cheers.

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:36.886
We all need to
do a lot more of that.

00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:39.920
I didn't want to believe it
at first, but I was wrong.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.053
Hmm?

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:42.886
Uh‐oh, Noro.

00:03:42.886 --> 00:03:44.620
This is utter nonsense!

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.520
(Aster Phoenix)
Time to face facts, Noro.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.186
The people of the Xyz Dimension
were doing just fine

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:50.753
until we showed up.

00:03:50.753 --> 00:03:53.286
We took their world
and turned it upside down.

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:56.320
You're the commander‐in‐chief
and you have the audacity

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.320
to stand there and condemn
the Arc Area Project?!

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.820
Don't you understand
that such language

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.493
is a total betrayal
of the Professor?

00:04:02.493 --> 00:04:04.526
Course I do.

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:06.193
But I'm not gonna go
and bark out orders

00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:08.160
that I don't think
are above board.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.726
I'm not cool being
the Professor's fool.

00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:13.360
And if that makes me a traitor,
that's fine with me.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.493
(gasps)
(gasps)

00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:18.226
Oh, man, I don't want
to be around the Professor

00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:20.226
when he hears about this.

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:22.560
He's doing a turnzy
on Duel Academy.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.393
I think that's...
like totally cool!

00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:26.326
Hold up a sec.

00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:27.593
You're not telling me
you're buying

00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:29.426
what this guy's selling,
are you?

00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:32.160
Well, kinda sorta I guess.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.126
You can't be serious!

00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:35.059
Come on, sis, admit it.

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:36.459
You like so enjoyed
the sweetness

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:38.993
of Yuya's awesome
dueltaining.

00:04:38.993 --> 00:04:40.360
Maybe a smidge.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.160
Welcome to Team Yuya.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.460
(groans)

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.326
See ya on the
other side, Noro!

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:46.460
Yolo!
What?!

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.226
Glad to have
you on board.

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:55.926
Now that we're
working together,

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:58.826
I know we can put a stop to
the Professor's pointless war!

00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:00.666
Things are looking up, Yuto.

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:01.766
Yuto?

00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:03.800
Yeah.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.233
Just someone very special to me,
someone from this dimension.

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:09.066
And we know that
by working together,

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:12.466
we can make this, and all
other dimensions, smile.

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:14.066
(both)
What do ya say?

00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:17.100
You ready to bring
the fun back here,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.666
'cause this place can use
all the smiles it can get.

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:21.566
You got it.

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:25.900
We're totally in
to bring the grin 110%, Yuya.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.933
And we're not gonna stop
until the jobs done,

00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:30.533
no matter how long it takes.

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:32.266
(Noro)
You won't get
that chance.

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:34.266
That's because all of you
are going to be eliminated

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:36.333
right here and now!

00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:39.866
Since Aster Phoenix has turned
traitor and I'm next in command,

00:05:39.866 --> 00:05:42.366
that of course makes me
the highest‐ranking officer

00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:44.200
in the Xyz Dimension!

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200
So, I hereby order my army‐‐

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.100
(Kite)
To chill out.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.000
Huh?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.900
(Noro shrieks)

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.533
It's Kite!

00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:55.233
If you're planning
on taking anyone down,

00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:56.866
you and your army of goons

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:59.100
are gonna have to go
through me first.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.306
And when I say me,
I mean we.

00:06:02.306 --> 00:06:03.740
We who?!

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.306
(gasps)

00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:08.340
Hey, look.
Kite brought backup.

00:06:10.073 --> 00:06:12.673
(nervous groan)

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:15.106
(Yuya)
That's what I call
an unexpected surprise.

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:16.940
Kite said he won't let me
take all the credit

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.006
for roundin' these guys up,
but I will anyway!

00:06:20.006 --> 00:06:22.740
It'll be our secret, ha.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.473
And don't worry about Shay!
He's snoozin' his brusin' away!

00:06:26.473 --> 00:06:28.906
Good to know.
Thanks, Alan.

00:06:28.906 --> 00:06:31.540
Seems like you and your goons
were about to mix it up

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.140
with my pals down there.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.706
Well, then let's get to mixing!

00:06:34.706 --> 00:06:36.540
And since you're the one
calling the shots,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.173
I think I'll call
you out first!

00:06:39.173 --> 00:06:40.440
(nervous groan)

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.940
Well, thanks
for the invitation, but...

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.406
you see, I'm more of
a behind‐the‐scenes‐type guy,

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:46.706
y'know with henchmen.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.106
(crying)
Oh, my!

00:06:51.873 --> 00:06:53.373
(Aster Phoenix)
Listen all of you.

00:06:53.373 --> 00:06:55.273
It's time for us to face facts

00:06:55.273 --> 00:06:56.673
and admit
that the Professor's project

00:06:56.673 --> 00:06:59.473
was nothing less than a war
of conquest in disguise.

00:06:59.473 --> 00:07:02.880
It goes against everything
we believe in.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.880
The only decent thing
to do is to end the project

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.246
and work on righting
all the wrongs it caused.

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:11.513
This is your decision.

00:07:11.513 --> 00:07:13.713
Any of you who don't agree
with what I'm proposing

00:07:13.713 --> 00:07:16.613
have my permission to go back
to Duel Academy.

00:07:16.613 --> 00:07:19.146
But I hope each one of you
will find it in your heart

00:07:19.146 --> 00:07:22.346
to stay here with me and help
rebuild what we destroyed.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.346
Thank you.

00:07:40.413 --> 00:07:42.280
Late!

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.546
I gave those two
strict instructions

00:07:44.546 --> 00:07:46.480
that the soup was to be
completed and ready to serve

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.213
in precisely 29 minutes
and 58 seconds!

00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:52.780
By my watch it's already
taken them 30 minutes!

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.980
Hungry people are kept waiting
and waiting and waiting

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.113
and waiting and wait‐‐

00:07:57.113 --> 00:07:58.746
(Grace)
Soup's on.
At last!

00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:00.620
Slopping soup
is so beneath me.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.586
You gotta like look
on the bright side, sis.

00:08:03.586 --> 00:08:06.320
Think of all the slurping smiles
your slopping will bring.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.486
(Alan)
Look at them goody two shoes.

00:08:09.486 --> 00:08:11.386
This is too good to be true.

00:08:11.386 --> 00:08:13.386
And when something's
too good to be true,

00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:15.053
well, then then
it probably isn't.

00:08:15.053 --> 00:08:16.586
It's all crazy.

00:08:16.586 --> 00:08:19.053
Think about it,
yesterday they're houndin' us

00:08:19.053 --> 00:08:20.820
and today they're helpin' us?

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.253
One of 'em even took
toilet duty from me.

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:26.320
The whole things
seems a bit too easy.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.486
Well, they've been nothing
but help for me.

00:08:28.486 --> 00:08:29.920
Saya's right.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.553
They even offered
to heal Shay,

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.886
and Gong ain't one to look
a gift horse in the mouth.

00:08:33.886 --> 00:08:35.253
Gong's all good
with this.

00:08:35.253 --> 00:08:36.953
(Sylvio)
Of course you're good with it

00:08:36.953 --> 00:08:39.886
because you're all brawn
and no brain.

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:42.186
But for the first
and probably last time,

00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:43.420
I actually agree with you.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.053
I mean, people change.

00:08:45.053 --> 00:08:48.153
Look at me, I used to be
handsome, and now I'm gorgeous.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.620
Chill out, guys...
he's cool.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.286
I agree.

00:08:52.186 --> 00:08:53.986
What? You do?

00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:54.853
We all
can change.

00:08:56.153 --> 00:08:57.953
And if I changed,
anything's possible.

00:08:57.953 --> 00:09:01.826
We gotta give him a shot,
let him prove himself.

00:09:01.826 --> 00:09:05.660
If he's really looking
to make up for things he did...

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.093
then we gotta let things
play out.

00:09:08.093 --> 00:09:10.460
Second chances
are the most important ones.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.993
If he and his peeps want
to pour soup and clean dishes,

00:09:12.993 --> 00:09:14.960
more power to 'em.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.693
I'm not gonna stand in the way.

00:09:16.693 --> 00:09:20.326
But just as they're trying
to do the right thing now,

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:23.293
I have to make up
for what I did, too.

00:09:23.293 --> 00:09:26.026
I was just as cruel
to more Duel Academy soldiers

00:09:26.026 --> 00:09:27.093
than I could ever count.

00:09:27.093 --> 00:09:28.926
Oh, Kite.

00:09:28.926 --> 00:09:30.493
But you had a good reason.

00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:33.460
They turned your family
into cards, so fair is fair!

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.626
(Yuto)
There's nothing
fair about that.

00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:38.326
Uh...
you need a lozenge, Yuya?

00:09:38.326 --> 00:09:41.826
I think it's Yuto
speakin', dummy

00:09:41.826 --> 00:09:45.393
(Yuya and Yuto)
Just because you had bad
things happen to you

00:09:45.393 --> 00:09:47.693
doesn't mean you have
to be bad back,

00:09:47.693 --> 00:09:50.493
because then it's stacks
and stacks of bad on top of bad,

00:09:50.493 --> 00:09:52.226
and who would want to deal
with that?

00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:55.860
Instead turn that
frown upside down.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.360
(Yuya only)
My dad always said, try to laugh
when you feel like crying.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.600
When things get tough,
respond with a smile!

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.000
It will give you the strength
to keep moving forward.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.100
So, if we want a better
future for everyone,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.300
we have to have
the courage to try.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.166
(both)
It's the only way
to make a world

00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:16.900
where everyone can be happy.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.600
Kite, you just showed
that courage.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.566
Losing your family hurt,
but you forgave Duel Academy,

00:10:22.566 --> 00:10:24.266
and you're even sorry

00:10:24.266 --> 00:10:25.833
for turning all those
soldiers into cards.

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:26.500
I am.

00:10:28.533 --> 00:10:31.966
(Yuya only)
You can still make your family
proud, Kite.

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:34.033
Yeah, like when you
find them all

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:35.166
and turn them all back
to normal.

00:10:36.133 --> 00:10:38.033
Hold on,
what do you mean?

00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:41.066
Turning people into cards
is just a way to capture

00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:43.066
and contain their
life force.

00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:46.600
The Professor is collecting your
family, and everyone, as cards.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.233
Not sure why, but...

00:10:48.233 --> 00:10:50.133
anyway, if you can get
those cards back,

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:52.133
we might find a way
to free them.

00:10:52.133 --> 00:10:54.733
You mean they'll be
as they were?

00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:56.800
Are you saying my family...

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.033
will be with me again?

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.866
Yeah.

00:10:59.866 --> 00:11:02.140
Where are all them
people cards now?

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.506
All the cards go straight
to Duel Academy.

00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:06.306
There's a teleportation
device

00:11:06.306 --> 00:11:10.040
located in our headquarters.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.273
So this is where you zap
all those cards

00:11:12.273 --> 00:11:13.306
to the Fusion Dimension?

00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:14.973
That's right.

00:11:14.973 --> 00:11:17.573
From that chamber direct
to Duel Academy.

00:11:17.573 --> 00:11:18.940
Then fire it up.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.973
I'm going to get
my family back.

00:11:20.973 --> 00:11:22.973
And when
you're there...

00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:25.506
please find Lulu.

00:11:25.506 --> 00:11:30.406
Not just for me,
but for Shay.

00:11:30.406 --> 00:11:33.906
Can you go with Kite, too?
I know he can use your help.

00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:35.940
Please?
I'll stay with Shay.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.506
I know Aster
will make sure

00:11:37.506 --> 00:11:40.306
he gets the best care
Duel Academy has to offer.

00:11:40.306 --> 00:11:42.840
Don't worry, he'll be up
and dueling before you know it.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.106
That's my promise to you.

00:11:45.106 --> 00:11:48.006
I have no doubt
about it, Aster.

00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:51.240
We're all in this
thing together.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.906
You better
believe it, Yuya.

00:11:53.906 --> 00:11:57.106
There's a lot I wish I change
if could do things over.

00:11:57.106 --> 00:11:58.906
And one of the top things
on my list

00:11:58.906 --> 00:12:01.313
would be to go back
to the time I dueled your dad

00:12:01.313 --> 00:12:04.213
and let him know...
let him know that..

00:12:04.213 --> 00:12:07.080
I get it.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.146
I'd like to pass
that message along, but...

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.146
I think it's better
if you tell him yourself.

00:12:12.146 --> 00:12:13.613
Deal.

00:12:13.613 --> 00:12:15.280
One last thing...

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.980
did you get a chance
to ask your squad about Zuzu?

00:12:18.813 --> 00:12:20.946
Sorry, Yuya.

00:12:20.946 --> 00:12:25.080
No one's seen her, much less
anyone with‐‐ and I quote‐‐

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.113
fab pink hair.

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:28.813
Thanks anyway.

00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:30.713
Let's get
teleporting.

00:12:30.713 --> 00:12:32.246
Yeah!

00:12:32.246 --> 00:12:33.013
Huh?
Ready?

00:12:33.013 --> 00:12:34.013
Yeah.

00:12:34.013 --> 00:12:34.680
Hold it!

00:12:35.913 --> 00:12:37.213
Alan.

00:12:37.213 --> 00:12:38.913
I want you to take these.

00:12:38.913 --> 00:12:40.513
Your rollerboots?
I can't‐‐

00:12:40.513 --> 00:12:43.413
Don't argue with me,
just take them, Yuya!

00:12:43.413 --> 00:12:44.746
Alan.

00:12:52.213 --> 00:12:54.813
I can't.
Just take it.

00:12:54.813 --> 00:12:57.180
I've seen you duel, Kite,

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.546
and you need all the help
that you can get.

00:12:59.546 --> 00:13:01.220
You're right.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.986
And with this card in my deck,
I'll be unstoppable.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.220
Good luck.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.620
Now, you ready?

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.953
Gong is ready to rock!

00:13:17.953 --> 00:13:20.053
Let's do this.

00:13:20.053 --> 00:13:21.453
Yeah!

00:13:21.453 --> 00:13:22.986
(warbling beeps)

00:13:36.253 --> 00:13:37.886
(Alexis Rhodes)
Things are getting
too dangerous,

00:13:37.886 --> 00:13:39.286
we can't wait much longer.

00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:41.620
One of the Professor's
enforcers just took down

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.086
five of our strongest.

00:13:44.086 --> 00:13:46.486
And turned them into cards!

00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:48.320
At this rate,

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.686
we'll lose before we even mount
an attack against Duel Academy.

00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:54.453
The time to attack is now,

00:13:54.453 --> 00:13:56.786
and with Zuzu and Yugo
teaming up with us,

00:13:56.786 --> 00:13:58.420
we'll never have
a better chance.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.060
We'll take down
Duel Academy
piece by piece.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.626
They won't know
what hit 'em.

00:14:02.626 --> 00:14:04.426
You got that right, Zuzu.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:07.426
Let's teach the Professor
a lesson he'll never forget.

00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:10.026
(man 1)
Yeah!
Let's go get 'em, Yugo!

00:14:10.026 --> 00:14:11.693
(woman)
Let's do it!
(man 2) All right!

00:14:11.693 --> 00:14:13.260
(man 3)
We gotta do this!

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.826
Agreed.

00:14:14.826 --> 00:14:16.893
But I'll be going solo.

00:14:16.893 --> 00:14:19.393
No, you can't go alone.

00:14:19.393 --> 00:14:20.760
You stay here
and rest that leg,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.426
we can handle things!

00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:23.793
(sharp clack)

00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:25.826
Of course you can,

00:14:25.826 --> 00:14:28.360
but I'm not sure bringing
the fight is right.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.660
There may be another way.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.826
And that way is to say, hey.

00:14:33.826 --> 00:14:36.693
I'll talk this through
with Leo Akaba personally.

00:14:36.693 --> 00:14:38.593
Oh, no, you won't.

00:14:38.593 --> 00:14:42.026
(Dennis)
To speak to the professor,
you must meet him first,

00:14:42.026 --> 00:14:44.693
and the only way to meet him
is through me.

00:14:44.693 --> 00:14:45.460
It's you!

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.826
(Zuzu)
Dennis!

00:14:49.826 --> 00:14:52.826
Hi there, Zuzu.
Long time no see.

00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:54.560
I've been looking for you.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.626
(gasps)

00:14:55.626 --> 00:14:57.026
And you found trouble.

00:14:57.026 --> 00:14:59.860
Ooh, Yugo.
So scary.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.033
Tough words
from a mediocre duelist.

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:04.333
I saw you duel back
in the Synchro Dimension,

00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:06.900
and news flash,
you're no match for me.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.766
So why don't you scurry away
and let the big boys talk.

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:12.500
Zip it, buddy!

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.200
How about I show you

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.200
what a mediocre duelist can do
to a backstabbing traitor!

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.733
(Dennis)
I did put on quite
the performance, didn't I?

00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:23.833
I had everyone fooled,
but what can you expect

00:15:23.833 --> 00:15:26.666
from someone as talented
a performer as me.

00:15:26.666 --> 00:15:29.733
And I owe it all
to one man.

00:15:29.733 --> 00:15:33.066
Is that so, Mr. McField?

00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:34.666
You know him?

00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:35.900
(Dennis)
It's been a while...

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.000
teacher.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.033
Teacher?
Teacher!

00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:41.066
(chuckling)
That's correct.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:44.166
Oh, how I admired you
when I first saw you duel

00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:46.300
on the street corners
of Heartland.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.400
That's where my passion
for dueltaining was born.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.133
But it's the old story,

00:15:52.133 --> 00:15:54.366
the one where the student's
superior skills

00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:56.433
overtake those of his teacher.

00:15:56.433 --> 00:15:58.133
Don't be so sure.

00:15:58.133 --> 00:16:00.373
Then why don't we find out?

00:16:00.373 --> 00:16:04.240
I brought a few friends
who love a good show.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.040
How did you find us here?

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.773
Oh, quite easily.
We have eyes everywhere.

00:16:10.773 --> 00:16:13.106
You know, Teach,
I think it was destiny

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:15.373
that brought you here
to the Fusion Dimension.

00:16:15.373 --> 00:16:19.040
Now I can take to the stage and
steal the spotlight from you.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.173
Hey!

00:16:20.173 --> 00:16:21.940
If you're looking
to put on a show,

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.206
I'm all up for playing the guy
who bangs up the bad guy!

00:16:25.206 --> 00:16:26.706
You tell him, Yugo!

00:16:26.706 --> 00:16:29.173
Shut your mouth, Dennis,
or we'll shut it for you!

00:16:29.173 --> 00:16:32.140
Step aside, Yugo.
I can handle this.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.373
Huh?

00:16:33.373 --> 00:16:35.006
(Dennis chuckling)

00:16:37.073 --> 00:16:41.006
But first, an observation.
You disappoint me, Dennis.

00:16:41.006 --> 00:16:43.606
After all this time,
you still haven't changed a bit.

00:16:43.606 --> 00:16:44.673
(Dennis)
That's a bad thing?

00:16:44.673 --> 00:16:46.406
Yes.

00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:48.706
You were always fascinated
by flashiness:

00:16:48.706 --> 00:16:51.173
the showy, shallow things.

00:16:51.173 --> 00:16:53.940
I was hoping that someday you'd
understand the part of dueling

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.140
that can truly move
the human heart.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.606
That's why you can
never put on a real show.

00:16:59.606 --> 00:17:01.546
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:17:01.546 --> 00:17:03.280
I had to endure
your mind‐numbing lectures

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.546
when I was your student,
but not anymore, Teach!

00:17:07.546 --> 00:17:09.380
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.313
Age before talent.

00:17:12.313 --> 00:17:17.780
It's possible to possess both
at once, as you'll soon see.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.613
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:17:20.613 --> 00:17:22.480
What?
That's your move?

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.213
Hey, what's the deal, Teach?

00:17:24.213 --> 00:17:25.813
Calm down there.

00:17:25.813 --> 00:17:29.646
Don't burn yourself out
on the very first turn.

00:17:29.646 --> 00:17:31.546
Why, I'm merely
setting the stage.

00:17:31.546 --> 00:17:34.246
And I'm taking it down.

00:17:34.246 --> 00:17:37.713
It's my turn!

00:17:37.713 --> 00:17:40.846
After I mastered a few
of your rudimentary tricks,

00:17:40.846 --> 00:17:43.013
I improved upon them
by adding my own flair

00:17:43.013 --> 00:17:45.380
to become a greater
dueltainer than you.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.346
And here's the proof.

00:17:47.346 --> 00:17:48.813
I set the Pendulum Scale

00:17:48.813 --> 00:17:51.413
with Scale three Performage
Mirror Conductor

00:17:51.413 --> 00:17:56.046
and Scale six
Performage Fire Dancer.

00:17:56.046 --> 00:17:58.913
Now I can summon monsters
between Level four and five

00:17:58.913 --> 00:18:00.753
all at the same time!

00:18:00.753 --> 00:18:05.620
I... Pendulum Summon...!

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.286
Now taking center stage are

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:09.886
Performage Ball Balancer

00:18:09.886 --> 00:18:13.586
and the too hot to handle
Performage Plushfire!

00:18:13.586 --> 00:18:15.820
He opened
with a Pendulum Summon!

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.586
And that's
just for starters.

00:18:17.586 --> 00:18:18.620
Since they're both
the same Level,

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.086
Dennis is gonna Xyz Summon.

00:18:21.086 --> 00:18:25.686
I overlay Level four
Ball Balancer and Plushfire!

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.953
And right before your very eyes,

00:18:30.953 --> 00:18:35.386
the majestic magician
will materialize!

00:18:35.386 --> 00:18:37.020
I Xyz Summon!

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.553
Appear.

00:18:38.553 --> 00:18:42.120
Performage Trapeze
Magician!

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.153
(cackling)

00:18:44.153 --> 00:18:46.420
I know this
has been great fun,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.720
but I'm sad to say this show
is nearly at an end.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.686
Because I use one of Trapeze
Magician's Overlay Units

00:18:53.686 --> 00:18:56.820
to activate its special ability!

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.320
And just like that,

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.426
Trapeze Magician can attack
twice this turn.

00:19:01.426 --> 00:19:04.960
Since Trapeze Magician
has 2,500 attack points.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.593
Two direct attacks and all
of your life points will poof,

00:19:08.593 --> 00:19:11.993
vanish into thin air.
Best trick ever.

00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:18.626
All right, Trapeze Magician,
swing on in and attack!

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.626
(cackling)

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:31.893
(gasping)

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.626
(Dennis)
All right, Trapeze Magician,
swing on in and attack!

00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:45.893
(gasping)

00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:48.626
I activate...
the trap Miraculous Hats!

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.160
He's gone!

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.360
<i>(laughing)</i>

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.826
(Yusho)
<i>Not quite.</i>

00:19:55.826 --> 00:19:57.860
<i>It only appears</i>
<i>that I've disappeared!</i>

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.066
(Dennis)
You're inside one of those hats!

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:01.633
<i>Correct.</i>

00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:03.733
<i>It wouldn't be very</i>
<i>dueltaining for our audience</i>

00:20:03.733 --> 00:20:06.500
<i>if the show were over after</i>
<i>only a swing and a fling.</i>

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.333
<i>This little trick adds</i>
<i>just a bit of... suspense!</i>

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:10.166
<i>Don't you agree?</i>

00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:11.600
No.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.400
<i>In one hat</i>
<i>is a spell card.</i>

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.933
<i>In the other...</i>

00:20:14.933 --> 00:20:18.533
<i>me, along with a monster</i>
<i>that has zero attack points.</i>

00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:21.633
<i>If you choose wisely</i>
<i>and attack the hat</i>

00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:23.366
<i>with me and my</i>
<i>monster inside,</i>

00:20:23.366 --> 00:20:26.200
<i>I'll take double</i>
<i>the damage and lose.</i>

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.600
You got that right,

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.666
because Trapeze Magician
can attack twice this turn,

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:34.200
so it can attack
both your hats.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.233
I get you no matter what!

00:20:37.233 --> 00:20:39.633
(Yusho)
Oh, no!
You're right.

00:20:39.633 --> 00:20:41.366
<i>I wish I had</i>
<i>a third or fourth hat,</i>

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:43.866
<i>but the haberdashery</i>
<i>was closed.</i>

00:20:43.866 --> 00:20:46.000
<i>Just attack me and put me</i>
<i>out of my misery.</i>

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.766
Now, Trapeze Magician,
attack the hat on the right!

00:20:52.133 --> 00:20:53.800
<i>Oops, missed me.</i>

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.766
<i>That hat contained the spell</i>
<i>Wonder Balloons.</i>

00:20:56.766 --> 00:20:59.333
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>I escaped unscathed.</i>

00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:00.873
Though not
for long, Teach.

00:21:00.873 --> 00:21:04.506
Okay, Trapeze Magician, time
to attack the remaining hat!

00:21:07.006 --> 00:21:09.873
Gotcha!
I win!

00:21:09.873 --> 00:21:11.173
Oh.

00:21:11.173 --> 00:21:14.940
(snickering)

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.240
Did you lose weight?

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.906
Wait up, that's Paper Doll.

00:21:19.906 --> 00:21:23.406
That's a spell card but it can
also be treated as a monster.

00:21:23.406 --> 00:21:25.206
I can't believe it,
he tricked me.

00:21:25.206 --> 00:21:27.806
(banging)
Oh.

00:21:27.806 --> 00:21:31.706
They're gone.
I've been played for a fool.

00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:33.806
They're headed
towards Duel Academy.

00:21:33.806 --> 00:21:35.373
Find them now!

00:21:35.373 --> 00:21:37.706
Move it or I promise
you'll lose it!

00:21:46.873 --> 00:21:48.506
Faster!

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.506
Yugo, stop!

00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:01.246
Zuzu, what are
you doing?

00:22:01.246 --> 00:22:03.680
What does it look like,
I'm gonna hold these guys off.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.546
(Yugo)
You serious?

00:22:06.546 --> 00:22:09.413
You'd rather
face them than me?

00:22:09.413 --> 00:22:12.313
Zuzu, come on.

00:22:12.313 --> 00:22:14.046
My driving
can't be that bad.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.546
Yugo!

00:22:17.246 --> 00:22:17.913
(Yuya)
Zuzu!

00:22:20.013 --> 00:22:21.680
Zuzu!

00:22:23.013 --> 00:22:24.980
Yuya.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.413
Well, what do you know, lookey
here, it's like a reunion.

00:22:29.413 --> 00:22:31.713
And you're our surprise guest.
