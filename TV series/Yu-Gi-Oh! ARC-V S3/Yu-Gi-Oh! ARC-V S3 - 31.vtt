Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.433
(growling)

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:10.300
I can sense Z‐ARC's
consciousness getting stronger

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.033
with each passing moment.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.200
We have to get
the Reactor working!

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.366
(grunting)

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.600
(Z‐ARC)
You'll never stop
my resurrection...

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.533
Then... you all will
pay the price!

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.700
I Xyz Summon!

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.600
Odd‐Eyes Raging Dragon!

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.233
Not good...

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.166
Just stop!
You're dueling out of anger!

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.733
I know deep down you can duel
the way you used to duel...

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.466
No!

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:46.533
Infernal Fury Strike!

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:51.800
I'll end you!

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.333
I banish Performapal Nightmare
Knight from my graveyard

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.833
to deal 1,000 points of damage

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:00.500
to everyone who took
battle damage this turn!

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.240
But that means he's going to
hurt Declan, too!

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.673

I hope you can forgive me...

It is time!

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.073
To become one...

00:01:28.073 --> 00:01:31.673
Take Riley and find a way
to free those girls.

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:33.873
And where are you going?

00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:37.106
You don't think I'd let evil
take my son, do you?

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:38.973
What kind of father would I be?

(Kite )
C'mon, Aster!

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.713
Mr. Sakaki!

00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:48.980
Hi, Kite...
And Aster?

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.180
You're hurt?
Have you seen your son?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.846
I think he needs our help.

00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:57.180
He's not acting
like himself.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.546
Well, Kite...

00:02:58.546 --> 00:03:00.346
You're half right.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.086
It's worse than
you can imagine.

00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:05.686
(screaming)

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.253
Oh, Yuya!

00:03:09.353 --> 00:03:11.153
<i>Professor, sir!</i>

00:03:11.153 --> 00:03:13.886
<i>The Reactor's power level</i>
<i>is now at 50%.</i>

00:03:13.886 --> 00:03:15.653
Understood.

00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:21.553
Hold on!

00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:23.386
Don't do this!

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:25.420
Shut down the reactor
before it's too late!

00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:29.186
Young ladies...

00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:32.653
Your life energy
will further fuel my reactor.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.586
Z‐ARC sounds like
the worst of the worst.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:47.020
We can't allow him
to resurrect!

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.420
I agree.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.786
Since Z‐ARC can only resurrect

00:03:50.786 --> 00:03:54.653
if Yuya and the other versions
of my son combine back into one,

00:03:54.653 --> 00:03:57.886
we must keep them apart.

00:03:57.886 --> 00:03:59.453
Because if we fail,

00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:01.393
the world as we know it
will be over.

00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:07.760
But Yuto's
already merged
with Yuya...

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.660
That makes it
even more critical for us,

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.526
to keep the other two away
and away from each other.

00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:16.526
(gasping)
Do you know where they are?

00:04:16.526 --> 00:04:18.426
Yeah, I do.

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:20.093
The last I saw of 'em,
they were dueling each other

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.760
in the corridor back there.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.093
What?

00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:26.726
Careful!
I'm... okay.

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:28.493
You stay here,
I'll take care of 'em.

00:04:28.493 --> 00:04:30.226
You will?

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:32.560
Yusho, I know we never
saw eye‐to‐eye,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.826
but I now know that
you were trying to save us all,

00:04:35.826 --> 00:04:37.959
including me.

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:41.060
So it's time
I repay the favor.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.360
Wasn't that my card?

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.360
He kept it all this time.

00:04:58.393 --> 00:05:04.066
When I defeat you, I will absorb
you into me and take your power!

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:07.266
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon,
attack!

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:12.933
You're not absorbing anybody!

00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:15.266
I'm absorbing you!

00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:17.766
I activate the trap card
Burning Sonic.

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:23.133
It not only stops your attack,

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:25.933
but it powers up my
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:31.100
by 500 attack points!

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.366
You gotta stop this duel, Aster!

00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:36.800
That's just what I came to do!

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.733
With my help!

00:05:38.733 --> 00:05:41.033
(digital voice)
Intrusion penalty.
2,000 life points.

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:44.533
Hey, I never called for backup!

00:05:44.533 --> 00:05:49.933
Personally, I always believe
the more the merrier.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.666
It's my turn now!

00:05:51.666 --> 00:05:54.700
Since you already have
a Fusion Monster on your field,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.866
I'm allowed to summon
this monster from my hand.

00:05:57.866 --> 00:06:00.200
Cipher Twin Raptor!

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.506
And my Ciphers don't like
to fight alone,

00:06:02.506 --> 00:06:03.773
so I also get
to summon

00:06:03.773 --> 00:06:06.640
Cipher Biplane!

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.473
Then my Biplane's special
ability kicks in

00:06:09.473 --> 00:06:12.240
to raise Cipher Twin Raptor's
level to eight!

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.640
Not so fast!

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.573
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon's
special ability activates!

00:06:17.573 --> 00:06:21.806
So not only does my Dragon stop
your Biplane's special ability,

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:23.840
but it destroys it as well!

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.573
I told you
to stay out of this!

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:32.806
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon
gains attack points

00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:34.740
equal to Biplane's
attack points!

00:06:37.273 --> 00:06:40.340
That's nice, but when Cipher
Biplane is destroyed,

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.940
I can banish it from my
graveyard to add a Cipher Wing

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.540
from my deck to my hand
and then summon it!

00:06:50.206 --> 00:06:54.406
And by tributing my Cipher Wing,
its special ability activates!

00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:58.206
And the level of my Cipher
Twin Raptor increases by four.

00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:03.680
So, is that supposed to
scare me?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.813
It should,
because when I Xyz Summon,

00:07:06.813 --> 00:07:11.246
my Cipher Twin Raptor
counts as two Monsters!

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:13.413
I build the Overlay Network!

00:07:15.146 --> 00:07:17.480
Now, by way of
the cosmic energies

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.213
that make up our galaxy,

00:07:19.213 --> 00:07:21.613
I'll make something
just as mighty...

00:07:21.613 --> 00:07:23.180
I Xyz Summon!

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.613
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.513
(roaring)

00:07:32.913 --> 00:07:34.680
(Kite)
I Xyz Summon!

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.946
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:39.480
Here we go!

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.246
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon

00:07:41.246 --> 00:07:43.813
attack Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:45.446
(roaring)

00:07:45.446 --> 00:07:47.180
That wasn't smart.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.213
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon
has less attack points

00:07:49.213 --> 00:07:51.213
than my Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon.

00:07:51.213 --> 00:07:54.346
Not if I activate the spell
Attack Reversal!

00:07:54.346 --> 00:07:57.880
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon
and Clear Wing Synchro Dragon

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.646
swap their attack points!

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.686
Oh, yeah?

00:08:01.686 --> 00:08:05.253
I'm countering your spell
with Burning Sonic!

00:08:05.253 --> 00:08:08.086
By sending this trap card
straight to the graveyard,

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:10.353
I can put a stop to that swap!

00:08:10.353 --> 00:08:13.786
So even though my Clear Wing
loses 500 attack points,

00:08:13.786 --> 00:08:16.186
it's still stronger than
your Galaxy‐Eyes.

00:08:16.186 --> 00:08:19.153
Kite laid it all on the line
with his attack

00:08:19.153 --> 00:08:21.620
but it's gonna
cost him his Dragon!

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.786
No it won't, 'cause I activate
Rank‐Up‐Magic Cipher Shock!

00:08:25.786 --> 00:08:29.453
Not only do all monsters
lose their special abilities
this turn,

00:08:29.453 --> 00:08:31.820
but this spell stops
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.986
from being destroyed!

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.586
But you still take damage!

00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:43.686
I may have taken damage,
but it's a small price to pay

00:08:43.686 --> 00:08:45.820
for what I can do next.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.386
Rank‐Up‐Magic Cipher Shock lets
me use Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon

00:08:49.386 --> 00:08:53.120
to Xyz Summon a Cipher monster
that's one Rank higher!

00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:02.826
Now bear witness
as the same fantastic powers
that forged the universe

00:09:02.826 --> 00:09:05.693
forge this most mighty creature!

00:09:05.693 --> 00:09:08.893
Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:09:08.893 --> 00:09:13.360
Rise up,
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.626
I use all of Neo Galaxy‐Eyes'
Overlay Units

00:09:16.626 --> 00:09:19.226
to activate
its special ability!

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:22.426
Now I can steal your monsters
and transform them into

00:09:22.426 --> 00:09:25.660
Neo Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragons!

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.460
Cipher Super Subjection!

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.393
Thanks for all the
reinforcements you guys.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.226
You're up next, Aster.

00:09:36.226 --> 00:09:38.060
Hmm!

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.793
I'm placing one card facedown
and ending‐‐

00:09:40.793 --> 00:09:42.726
Wait!
Hold up, Kite!

00:09:42.726 --> 00:09:45.193
I've got a surprise!

00:09:45.193 --> 00:09:48.393
I can summon this bad boy when
you have a monster but I don't.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.026
My Speedroid Skull Marbles might
not have any attack points,

00:09:55.026 --> 00:09:57.026
but don't let that fool you...

00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:59.693
It packs quite a punch,
because if you attack it,

00:09:59.693 --> 00:10:01.866
you take the damage
instead of me!

00:10:01.866 --> 00:10:04.066
You just don't give up, do ya?

00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:07.633
Aster, looks like you're
gonna have a tougher time
than I hoped.

00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:10.333
No sweat, I got this.

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:11.466
Ha!

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:14.233
(thinking)
Aster...

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:23.066
Hey, Sora?

00:10:23.066 --> 00:10:24.766
What do you want?

00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:26.700
I've been keeping my eyes
on you.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.600
You're clearly one of the top
duelists in your class,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.366
maybe even this generation.

00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:33.733
Why don't you join my squad
when you graduate?

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:35.566
No thanks.

00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:37.700
'Fraid I'm not the army type.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.466
See, I like to work solo.

00:10:40.466 --> 00:10:42.500
(thinking)
But some fights
I can't fight solo.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.833
Glad to have him on our side.

00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:48.033
Because he might be the only one
tough enough to end this duel.

00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:50.366
And they're about to
find out why.

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:56.100
I activate the spell card
Polymerization!

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.366
And now I'm gonna fuse
Destiny Hero‐Decider

00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:01.840
and Destiny Hero‐Dreamer
together!

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.073
With the help of
this next monster

00:11:04.073 --> 00:11:07.940
your fate's are about to take
a terrifying turn for the worse!

00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:12.606
I Fusion Summon!

00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:14.706
Destiny Hero Dystopia!

00:11:16.673 --> 00:11:18.706
(growling)

00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:23.640
And I activate Dystopia's
special ability

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.606
so Yugo takes damage equal to
Decider's attack points!

00:11:29.873 --> 00:11:31.640
You gotta do better than that,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.773
because I have my trap
Speedroid Shuriken Hurricane!

00:11:35.773 --> 00:11:38.773
It reflects the damage
right back to you!

00:11:38.773 --> 00:11:40.673
In that case,
by returning

00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:44.506
Destiny Hero‐Decider in my
graveyard back to my hand

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:46.273
I take no damage!

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:49.073
You may have survived,
but I'll end you next turn!

00:11:49.073 --> 00:11:50.773
You wish.

00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:53.040
I don't need to wish, I know.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.140
Then I guess
it's time to prove you wrong.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.740
Because no one beats
Aster Phoenix!

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.946
I activate D‐Dragging Hammer!

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.880
This spell lets me equip
Decider on to Dystopia,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.613
lowering its attack points
by 1,600!

00:12:10.613 --> 00:12:12.680
You made
your own monster weaker?

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.846
Well, that's a genius move!

00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:16.780
And now you'll
pay for that mistake

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.480
with my Hurricane's
second effect!

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.546
Since your monster lost
1,600 attack points,

00:12:21.546 --> 00:12:23.313
you lose 1,600 life points!

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.946
Dystopia, make your move!

00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:29.946
Since its attack points changed,

00:12:29.946 --> 00:12:33.213
Dystopia can destroy
one card on the field.

00:12:33.213 --> 00:12:36.480
So say goodbye to Skull Marbles!

00:12:41.046 --> 00:12:44.880
That means my Shuriken Hurricane
will also be destroyed.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.680
But I promise
to do the same to you!

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.213
C'mon, Yugo!
Snap out of it!

00:12:50.213 --> 00:12:53.346
What would Rin think if she
saw you acting like a jerk?

00:12:53.346 --> 00:12:59.013
Rin?

00:12:59.013 --> 00:13:01.553
(laughing)

00:13:01.553 --> 00:13:03.386
Friends fighting friends.

00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:04.953
I wish I had some popcorn

00:13:04.953 --> 00:13:07.620
because I could
watch this all day!

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.020
Yeah, Rin!

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.553
The girl you came here
to save?

00:13:11.553 --> 00:13:14.686
I knew you were dumb,
but I didn't think
you'd forget her already.

00:13:14.686 --> 00:13:17.486
Dystopia, knock some sense
into him!

00:13:17.486 --> 00:13:20.253
Dystopian Destruction!

00:13:20.253 --> 00:13:23.953
I activate Speedroid
Tri‐Eyed Dice's ability!

00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:25.920
By banishing it
from my graveyard,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.053
your attack fizzles out.

00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:32.653
Argh, his brain's
still all scrambled.

00:13:32.653 --> 00:13:34.886
Yeah, but did you see
what happened?

00:13:34.886 --> 00:13:38.186
I really think I'm starting
to get through to him, Kite.

00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:39.786
Like when I said Rin's name,

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:42.353
it definitely
gave him pause.

00:13:42.353 --> 00:13:46.720
And I'll take any opening
I can get to end this duel!

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.353
That guy
is getting on my nerves...

00:13:49.353 --> 00:13:51.586
I draw!

00:13:51.586 --> 00:13:53.553
I summon the Tuner Monster...

00:13:53.553 --> 00:13:57.586
Speedroid Maliciousmagnet!

00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:00.993
And I activate
its special ability!

00:14:00.993 --> 00:14:05.393
I can use one monster on
your field to Synchro Summon!

00:14:05.393 --> 00:14:09.326
I'm taking back the Clear Wing
you stole from me!

00:14:09.326 --> 00:14:13.826
I tune Speedroid Maliciousmagnet
with Clear Wing Synchro Dragon

00:14:13.826 --> 00:14:17.926
to pave the way
for an even mightier Dragon!

00:14:17.926 --> 00:14:20.760
Watch as the essence of
that monster takes shape!

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.026
Watch as it is forged
by raw power!

00:14:24.026 --> 00:14:26.260
I Synchro Summon!

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.193
Take flight,
Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.193
Now Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon,

00:14:35.193 --> 00:14:39.760
annihilate Dystopia with
Crystal Cataclysmic Strike!

00:14:43.293 --> 00:14:45.026
(Yugo)
Attack!

00:14:45.026 --> 00:14:46.960
I activate the trap...

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.960
Urban Demise!

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.726
It gives my Dystopia an extra
100 attack points!

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.826
By doing that,
its special ability activates.

00:14:56.826 --> 00:14:59.926
Because whenever Dystopia's
attack points change,

00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:02.533
it automatically
destroys your monster.

00:15:04.766 --> 00:15:06.700
Yeah, right!

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.033
Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon's
own special ability

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:12.200
puts an end to your plan by
destroying your monster instead!

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.733
No, it won't!

00:15:13.733 --> 00:15:16.333
Because I'm activating
the trap card Split Guard!

00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:19.533
When I have two monsters with
the same name on my field,

00:15:19.533 --> 00:15:21.666
Dystopia can't be destroyed
in battle!

00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:28.400
(grunting)

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.300
Is that the best you got?

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.866
'Cause it's nowhere good enough
to stop us!

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:35.966
Because when you duel
out of anger and hate,

00:15:35.966 --> 00:15:37.633
there's no way you can win.

00:15:37.633 --> 00:15:39.400
And believe me,
I know all about it.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.533
You know I had to learn
that lesson...

00:15:42.533 --> 00:15:44.700
Aster...

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.500
(Aster)
And it's a lesson
that you need to learn as well.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.766
If you don't shut your yap,
I'm gonna shut it for ya!

00:15:50.766 --> 00:15:53.500
Because when Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.233
battles a monster
that's at least level five,

00:15:56.233 --> 00:15:58.533
it gains that monster's
attack points!

00:15:58.533 --> 00:16:00.173
Finish him!

00:16:00.173 --> 00:16:02.306
Hold on to that thought, Yugo!

00:16:02.306 --> 00:16:05.906
I activate Destiny
Hero‐Dreamer's special ability!

00:16:05.906 --> 00:16:09.606
If a Destiny Hero on my field
is about to be destroyed,

00:16:09.606 --> 00:16:11.673
Dreamer stops it
from being destroyed,

00:16:11.673 --> 00:16:14.040
and I don't take any damage!

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.073
And then I can summon Dreamer
to my field!

00:16:17.073 --> 00:16:20.706
But one drawback is that
your Dragon is allowed
to attack again,

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:22.606
but that's one risk
I'm willing to take.

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:24.606
By stopping my attack,

00:16:24.606 --> 00:16:27.206
Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon's
attack point's

00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:29.740
fall all the way down to 3,000.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.906
See, Yugo?

00:16:31.906 --> 00:16:34.540
I told you there was no way
you could win and I was right!

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.273
Well, the duel's not over

00:16:36.273 --> 00:16:38.840
so I'm gonna make you
eat those words!

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.473
You know what?

00:16:40.473 --> 00:16:42.973
You're all talk and no heart.

00:16:42.973 --> 00:16:46.506
And no heart means you have
no chance to win.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.140
(thinking)
Aster's got this.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.740
If he wins and stops them,

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.740
he can stop them from
resurrecting Z‐ARC.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.006
I activate the trap D‐Fusion!

00:16:56.006 --> 00:17:00.480
This allows me fuse
both my Dystopia and
my Dreamer together!

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.280
And when that happens...

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.613
I can bring out a monster

00:17:04.613 --> 00:17:06.780
the likes of which
you have never seen,

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.713
and this monster will spin
this duel in my favor!

00:17:10.713 --> 00:17:12.346
I Fusion Summon!

00:17:12.346 --> 00:17:14.880
Destiny Hero Dusktopia!

00:17:22.946 --> 00:17:24.713
(roaring)

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.613
(Aster)
I Fusion Summon!

00:17:31.613 --> 00:17:34.313
Destiny Hero Dusktopia!

00:17:34.313 --> 00:17:36.413
(roaring)

00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:42.713
Once I defeat you, Z‐ARC will
no longer be able to resurrect!

00:17:42.713 --> 00:17:46.746
And that'll put an end to this
farce, once and for all, Yugo!

00:17:46.746 --> 00:17:48.046
(grunting and roaring)

00:17:48.046 --> 00:17:49.413
Whatever!

00:17:49.413 --> 00:17:51.646
Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon,

00:17:51.646 --> 00:17:55.313
destroy Destiny Hero Dusktopia!

00:17:55.313 --> 00:18:00.020
And Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon
gains Dusktopia's attack points!

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.520
Crystal Cataclysmic Strike!

00:18:04.553 --> 00:18:08.720
Your mouth is writing checks
that your deck can't cash.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.686
Dusktopia can't be destroyed
in battle this turn,

00:18:11.686 --> 00:18:13.853
and I also don't take
any damage.

00:18:13.853 --> 00:18:19.853
So looks like the sun is setting
on your chances at victory.

00:18:19.853 --> 00:18:20.953
Yugo?

00:18:20.953 --> 00:18:22.353
(growling)

00:18:26.953 --> 00:18:29.520
Yugo...
You okay?

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.520
Yeah, why wouldn't I be, Aster?

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.286
Good work, Aster!

00:18:39.886 --> 00:18:43.220
(thinking)
Yeah, I wasn't sure
he could pull it off...

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.386
Oh man, guys...

00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:47.520
Feels like I had a bowling ball
lodged in my head.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.553
Hope I didn't go
too crazy on you.

00:18:52.353 --> 00:18:55.620
You and I
have unfinished business!

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.920
Then let's finish.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.560
I'm summoning...

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.226
Predaplant Sarraceniant
from my hand.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.960
What can you do with a monster
with only a 100 attack points?

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.826
Oh, plenty.

00:19:12.826 --> 00:19:14.926
That's why I'm the greatest
and you're not.

00:19:14.926 --> 00:19:16.060
So you ready...

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.593
to lose?

00:19:18.593 --> 00:19:22.460
By discarding
Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra
from my hand...

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.560
I can activate
Super Polymerization!

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.860
Whoa!
No...
way!

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.160
By harnessing
the power of this spell

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.460
I can Fusion Summon using
any monsters on the field,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.293
including the ones
that you control!

00:19:37.293 --> 00:19:41.026
Our Monsters?
(growling)

00:19:41.026 --> 00:19:42.860
(thunder crashing)

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.126
Which monster should I fuse
my Sarraceniant with?

00:19:47.126 --> 00:19:51.026
Ah, yes, the monster
that Kite stole from me.

00:19:51.026 --> 00:19:53.793
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:19:53.793 --> 00:19:57.726
When you combine the viciously,
voracious venom of a dragon

00:19:57.726 --> 00:20:00.400
with the cunningness
of a carnivorous plant,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.400
the result is
toxically terrifying!

00:20:09.866 --> 00:20:12.466
I Fusion Summon!

00:20:12.466 --> 00:20:15.400
Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.800
I activate Greedy Venom Fusion
Dragon's special ability!

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.733
It erases one monster's special
abilities and attack points!

00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:30.833
And the monster I choose is...

00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:31.633
Dusktopia!

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:37.766
I activate my Crystal Wing's
special ability!

00:20:37.766 --> 00:20:42.366
It not only stops Greedy Venom
Fusion Dragon's special ability,

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:45.000
but it annihilates your dragon
as well!

00:20:47.233 --> 00:20:49.966
And to put the icing
on this cake,

00:20:49.966 --> 00:20:53.066
Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon
gains Greedy Venom's
attack points

00:20:53.066 --> 00:20:54.633
until the end of this turn!

00:20:54.633 --> 00:20:56.133
Which means
you're toast!

00:20:56.133 --> 00:20:58.933
You have it backwards, Yugo.

00:20:58.933 --> 00:21:02.940
Destroying Greedy Venom was a
big time blunder on your part,

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.340
because once it's gone,

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.273
all the other Monsters
on the field

00:21:06.273 --> 00:21:09.140
are immediately destroyed
and you three take damage

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.340
equal to
their attack points.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.273
That means they'll all lose!

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.006
(thinking)
Nope, not all of us...

00:21:16.006 --> 00:21:18.540
I'm not going down
without a fight!

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.773
Dusktopia can save one monster
from destruction!

00:21:21.773 --> 00:21:24.040
(roaring)

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.273
Only one can be saved?

00:21:26.273 --> 00:21:30.340
And the monster I'm saving is...

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.406
Yugo's Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:21:37.173 --> 00:21:38.673
Aster!

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:40.440
The rest is up to you, Yugo!

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.340
(rumbling and screaming)

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:48.073
Oh no, Aster!

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:49.340
Kite!

00:21:56.773 --> 00:21:59.073
Kite and Aster
sacrificed themselves

00:21:59.073 --> 00:22:01.080
to give Yugo one last chance...

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.113
Let us hope
he won't let it go to waste.

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:04.480
(Yugo)
I'm still standing, Yuri.

00:22:06.213 --> 00:22:09.846
And as long as I stand,
you don't stand a chance.

00:22:09.846 --> 00:22:11.713
(thunder crashing)
