WEBVTT

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.066
(Declan)
You may have mastered
the power of the four dragons,

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.466
but you still haven't
mastered dueltaining,

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.733
and you never will until you
find the fun again.

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.766
And since you haven't so far,

00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.933
not only will you fail
to save Riley,

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.766
but you will also fail
to claim victory today!

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.933
I use Super Doom King
Bright Armageddon's ability

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.433
to force you to pick one
Pendulum Monster on your field.

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:23.566
Not much choice is there

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.100
since Odd‐Eyes is
the only one on my field.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.766
Right.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.200
So choosing shouldn't
make your brain hurt.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.800
And now Doom King Bright
Armageddon will wipe out

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.866
the special abilities
of all your other dragons!

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.500
Wha‐‐
(Dragons roaring)

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.033
Next I activate Dark
Armageddon's special ability!

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.966
By using one Overlay Unit,
Dark Armageddon destroys

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.166
all your
non‐Pendulum Monsters!

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.933
So three of your four
dragons are no more!

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.733
What?!

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.600
And to get rid
of your final dragon,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200
Doom King Purple
Armageddon's special ability

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.373
destroys Odd‐Eyes
and deals you damage

00:01:02.373 --> 00:01:04.006
equal to its
attack points!

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.840
Yaah!

00:01:09.573 --> 00:01:10.273
(Sylvio and Gong)
Yuya!
(all gasp)

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.540
Unh! Oof.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.340
Your turn, Yuya.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.740
Not that you can do
much of anything.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.840
Without your four dragons,
you're helpless.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.673
It looks like it's
impossible to win.

00:01:23.673 --> 00:01:26.206
But when I battle, Declan,

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:28.706
the only thing possible
is the impossible.

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:31.940
I will defeat you
and save Riley!

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.840
(crying)
I'll make her laugh more
than the tickle monster!

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.573
And you know what,
while I'm at it,

00:01:36.573 --> 00:01:37.940
I'll even revive Zuzu!

00:01:39.806 --> 00:01:42.206
But I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:46.773
Yuri... Yugo... Yuto!

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.840
We've been with you
right from
the beginning, Yuya!

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.640
The four of us are
all in this together!

00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:54.973
We can pull this off Yuya.

00:01:54.973 --> 00:01:57.040
Just remember,
that if you duel for fun,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.440
you've already won!

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:01.653
Okay guys!

00:03:01.653 --> 00:03:03.853
We're in this together
to the end!

00:03:03.853 --> 00:03:06.186
(all)
I draw... draw...
draw... draw!

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:09.553
Perfect!

00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:11.486
This card will put us
on the fast track!

00:03:11.486 --> 00:03:13.586
Go, Yuya!

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:16.253
I use the spell
Odd‐Eyes Fusiongate!

00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:20.786
You'll want to get
a closer look at this,

00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:22.886
so how about I help out by
coming closer to you?

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:24.986
I get to resurrect
my Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:27.253
and Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:29.086
and fuse I them together!

00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:32.586
You can fuse
them together?

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:34.753
Now the power of Pendulum...

00:03:34.753 --> 00:03:37.253
combines with
the forces of Fusion...

00:03:37.253 --> 00:03:39.520
...to create
a brand‐new dragon!

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.986
I Fusion Summon!

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.786
Odd‐Eyes Venom Dragon!

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.153
(Dragon roars)

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:54.786
Odd‐Eyes Venom Dragon,

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:57.120
let's get toxic!

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.760
Absorb the attack points
of all of Declan's monsters!

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.660
Now attack
and turn down the lights

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.793
on Doom King
Bright Armageddon!

00:04:14.693 --> 00:04:17.193
You must take me
for an amateur, Yuya.

00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:19.260
My team's set up
to help each other out!

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.360
My Purple Armageddon's
special ability

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.393
drops your dragon's strength

00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:26.126
back to its
starting attack points!

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.593
That's not good.

00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:32.826
Yuya's attack is
going to backfire!

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:34.226
Ja, I can't look!

00:04:35.893 --> 00:04:37.359
I need an Action Card!

00:04:38.859 --> 00:04:40.693
This spell won't help.
Aww, man.

00:04:42.626 --> 00:04:43.960
Aah!

00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:45.726
Unh!

00:04:47.893 --> 00:04:49.960
Oh well.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.126
Ya still got other tricks.

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:55.093
You may have destroyed
my Fusion Dragon,

00:04:55.093 --> 00:04:57.993
but that lets me send Odd‐Eyes
Fusiongate to the graveyard

00:04:57.993 --> 00:04:59.526
to exchange it
for something brand‐new...

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:03.566
the spell card
Odd‐Eyes Synchrogate!

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:05.433
Another Gate?

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:07.233
That's right Declan.

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:08.700
And I can use it
to bring back

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.700
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum
Dragon again,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.200
but this time
I'm also bringing along

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.966
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon
that was in my graveyard!

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.433
The Synchro Gate
is now open,

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:20.400
so I can use Odd‐Eyes
to tune Clear Wing!

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:23.533
I Synchro Summon...

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:25.366
Odd‐Eyes Wing Dragon!

00:05:28.566 --> 00:05:29.933
(Dragon roars)

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.766
Odd‐Eyes Wing Dragon, unleash
your special ability!

00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:39.366
Wipe out all the monsters
on Declan's field

00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:41.800
to create a clear lane
to rain down the pain!

00:05:44.066 --> 00:05:45.600
(Dragon roars)

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.833
Pathetic.
Simply pathetic!

00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:54.300
Due to Dark Armageddon,
your special abilities

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.633
can't destroy
my Pendulum Monsters.

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:58.433
Well, then,
Odd‐Eyes Wing Dragon,

00:05:58.433 --> 00:06:00.506
attack Dark Armageddon!

00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:05.240
Ahh, but Odd‐Eyes Wing Dragon
has fewer attack points!

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.640
What's he thinking?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.306
(Dragon roars)

00:06:15.673 --> 00:06:18.373
(Yuya)
Odd‐Eyes Wing Dragon,
attack Dark Armageddon!

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.540
(Yuya straining)

00:06:23.106 --> 00:06:24.540
Heh heh!

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.506
Huh?
Huh? Why's he smiling?

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:28.540
Yeah, it's like
the more trouble he's in,

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.240
the more fun he's having.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.940
Maybe he bonked his head
in the last attack.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.706
Odd‐Eyes Wing Dragon
took one for the team

00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:38.340
because when it's destroyed,
it's lets me do a switcheroo,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.640
so now I'm replacing
my Odd‐Eyes Synchrogate

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.340
with... Odd‐Eyes Xyzgate!

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.473
And trust me, Declan,
this one's a doozy!

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:49.973
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon takes
to the stage one more time,

00:06:49.973 --> 00:06:53.040
bringing its partner in crime
from the Xyz Dimension,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.840
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon,
whose Level rises from 4 to 7!

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.940
And since they now have
the same Level,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.413
I can overlay
these two dragons

00:07:00.413 --> 00:07:03.446
to build
the Overlay Network!

00:07:03.446 --> 00:07:05.913
I Xyz Summon!

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.080
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon!

00:07:13.613 --> 00:07:16.546
And next, I banish
Xyzgate along with

00:07:16.546 --> 00:07:19.213
the other two Gates
in my graveyard.

00:07:19.213 --> 00:07:22.580
Thanks for all your help,
but it's time for you to go.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.180
And with their departure,
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.546
not only gains
1,000 attack points,

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:29.680
but it can attack twice
this turn!

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.213
Oh, did I say twice?

00:07:32.213 --> 00:07:34.980
I meant thrice, because
I activate WONDER CHANCE

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.613
to give my dragon
a third attack,

00:07:37.613 --> 00:07:40.280
which equals exact number
of monsters you have!

00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:45.846
(Dragon roars)

00:07:48.313 --> 00:07:49.880
Attack 'em all at once...

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.446
Sweeping Static Charge!

00:08:01.586 --> 00:08:03.620
Ooh!
Wowza!

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.653
Ohh!

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:07.020
It's over!

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.986
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:08:08.986 --> 00:08:10.986
This is Declan
we're talking about.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.053
You'll have to do
better than that.

00:08:20.053 --> 00:08:22.153
I'm afraid
Purple Armageddon

00:08:22.153 --> 00:08:24.320
is more formidable
than you thought.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.020
Thanks to it,
my Pendulum Monsters

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.086
cannot be destroyed
by your attacks.

00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:31.120
Ugh! Well, that didn't
go as planned.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.586
It turned out way
better in my imagination.

00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:35.753
Now that the battle's over,
Rebellion Dragon's

00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:38.286
attack points drop
back down to 3,000.

00:08:38.286 --> 00:08:39.953
Man, I must still be
at Duel Academy

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:41.686
'cause Declan's
taking me to school.

00:08:41.686 --> 00:08:44.220
Get your game in gear!

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.053
Why do I gotta feel like
I got a dozen jackspiders

00:08:47.053 --> 00:08:51.186
down my shirt while Yuya's
as calm as as a cucumber?

00:08:51.186 --> 00:08:53.386
(Declan, thinking)
I thought he'd learn
by now the one piece missing

00:08:53.386 --> 00:08:55.853
from his dueltaining...
but I was wrong.

00:08:55.853 --> 00:08:57.620
(crying)
He can't save Riley.

00:08:58.786 --> 00:09:01.593
It's over... Zuzu...

00:09:01.593 --> 00:09:03.126
She's gone for good!

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:06.126
It is my turn!

00:09:06.126 --> 00:09:08.660
Purple Armageddon,
use your special ability

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.393
to destroy
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon

00:09:10.393 --> 00:09:13.626
and deal 3,000 points
of damage to end this duel!

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.293
I don't think so!

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:22.693
My trap Abysmal Entertainment
zeroes out all that damage

00:09:22.693 --> 00:09:24.460
and then sends my
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.326
to the Pendulum Zone.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.360
That was a close one!

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.660
But I'm afraid close
don't cut it, Declan!

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.226
Hmph.
Very well.

00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:39.593
I end my turn.

00:09:39.593 --> 00:09:40.960
But all you're doing is
prolonging the inevitable.

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:44.893
Oh? We'll see!

00:09:44.893 --> 00:09:47.993
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon,
how about I invite a buddy

00:09:47.993 --> 00:09:50.193
to join you on the other
side of the Pendulum Zone?

00:09:50.193 --> 00:09:52.626
How about this guy?

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:55.193
The one‐and‐only Scale 12

00:09:55.193 --> 00:09:57.560
Performapal
Five‐Rainbow Magician!

00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:06.333
Scale 12? Golly!

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:08.266
Oh my, I had no idea

00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:10.966
that Yuya had the ability
to count that high!

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:13.200
(Yuya)
Swing far, pendulum!

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.633
Carve the arc of victory!

00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:20.066
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:25.966
Welcome back,
Odd‐Eyes Venom Dragon!

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.066
And Odd‐Eyes Wing Dragon!

00:10:32.133 --> 00:10:34.200
Plus Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Seer!

00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:38.333
And Performapal
Ignition Eagle!

00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:40.066
Summon all the monsters
you want!

00:10:40.066 --> 00:10:42.500
It changes nothing!

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.900
Bright Armageddon forces you
to choose a Pendulum Monster,

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.266
and all your other monsters
lose their special abilities.

00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:53.666
Okay then, I choose
Odd‐Eyes Seer!

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:55.933
Now use your ability!

00:10:58.266 --> 00:11:00.440
By banishing it,
I can summon

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.873
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon
from my graveyard!

00:11:04.173 --> 00:11:05.440
(Dragon roars)

00:11:07.006 --> 00:11:09.540
But that just triggers
my Bright Armageddon

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.673
to activate its
special ability again!

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:14.173
Then this time
I'll shield

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:16.206
my Performapal
Ignition Eagle!

00:11:16.206 --> 00:11:17.706
(grunts)

00:11:19.973 --> 00:11:23.140
Five‐Rainbow Magician,
use your special ability!

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.040
Show 'em it's not over
till it's over!

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.373
He drained
all the attack points

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.973
of every single monster?!

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.673
I get getting rid of
Declan's attack points,

00:11:52.673 --> 00:11:55.340
but Yuya got rid of
his own points too?

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.506
It's like
slappin' each other
with wet noodles.

00:11:57.506 --> 00:11:59.573
Yeah, but look at Yuya.

00:11:59.573 --> 00:12:01.280
He doesn't seem worried.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.280
In fact, he looks like
he's having fun!

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.280
Man, you don't know
how long I've been
waiting to play this.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.213
It's a game changer!

00:12:08.213 --> 00:12:10.480
When we have four or fewer
Spell or Trap cards

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.546
face down on our field,
our monsters can't attack.

00:12:13.546 --> 00:12:15.413
But why would you
want to attack anyway

00:12:15.413 --> 00:12:17.080
because they also lose
all their attack points

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.346
and special abilities.

00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:22.880
But... the moment we place
a fifth card, it's go time!

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.146
Our monsters not only
get all of their
attack points back,

00:12:25.146 --> 00:12:26.680
but their attack points
are doubled!

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.713
Ready?
All righty then!

00:12:28.713 --> 00:12:30.946
I place my first
facedown card!

00:12:30.946 --> 00:12:33.746
Oh, and when we
place a card facedown,

00:12:33.746 --> 00:12:36.146
Five‐Rainbow Magician
automatically ends the turn.

00:12:36.146 --> 00:12:37.713
I know that's
a lot to ponder,

00:12:37.713 --> 00:12:39.046
but, hey,
you're the genius.

00:12:39.046 --> 00:12:40.880
I see.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.146
So the first one to place
five cards face down

00:12:43.146 --> 00:12:44.346
will win this duel.

00:12:44.346 --> 00:12:46.980
Yeah, it's a race to five

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.246
to see who gets
to stay alive!

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.346
You're on!
I dra‐‐

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:54.580
Hold on, don't be
so quick to draw!

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.680
'Cause if you do, you can't
place a spell or trap

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.980
on your field that turn.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.146
Yeah, thanks
for the warning!

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:02.553
I just have to get five
Action Cards before you do!

00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:03.586
(grunting)

00:13:05.353 --> 00:13:07.753
Whoa! Yeah!
(laughing)

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:08.986
Huh?!

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.653
Too slow, Yuya.

00:13:13.653 --> 00:13:16.520
Now we each have one card
facedown on our fields!

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.253
So you tied it up.

00:13:18.253 --> 00:13:19.720
But I'll make sure
to take the lead

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.353
instead of spinnin'
my wheels!

00:13:25.486 --> 00:13:29.720
(yelping)
Oh, me and my big mouth!

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.320
I found
a second card, Yuya!

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.820
Not like this, not like this,
not like this,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.220
not like this,
not like this!

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.086
And another!

00:13:37.086 --> 00:13:40.120
Ha, that's my third card
while you still only have one!

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.786
(grunting)

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.720
Boost me up!

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.720
I'm catching up, Declan!

00:13:50.253 --> 00:13:53.653
Yeah, there's still
a lot of duel left, Declan!

00:13:53.653 --> 00:13:55.820
He's only one card down!
Yeah!

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.086
Keep it rolling, Yuya!

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:58.653
Woo‐hoo!

00:13:59.726 --> 00:14:01.560
That makes three!

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.493
He's rackin' 'em up!

00:14:03.493 --> 00:14:05.593
Yeah, they're tied!
Ha‐ha!

00:14:06.693 --> 00:14:09.093
Just two more!
Hyah!

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.426
What's this?
What's happening?

00:14:18.426 --> 00:14:20.426
There's a surge
in the energy readings.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.093
(Riley cooing)

00:14:24.193 --> 00:14:25.926
She's stopped crying.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.960
Found my fourth!

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.093
Declan only needs
one more card!

00:14:31.093 --> 00:14:32.860
But Yuya still has
to find two!

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.126
It's over Yuya!

00:14:35.126 --> 00:14:37.293
Not if I can help it!

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.826
You and I are
all tied up again!

00:14:40.793 --> 00:14:43.460
Whomever finds the next card
will take control of this duel.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.060
(heartbeat pulsing)

00:14:46.593 --> 00:14:48.960
I can't control it
any longer!

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.493
Found one!

00:14:51.493 --> 00:14:52.860
Same here!

00:14:55.193 --> 00:14:57.360
Which one of 'em got
an Action card first?

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360
Hyah!

00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:00.533
(Sylvio)
Yuya did!

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.066
I only beat you
by a hair to that card,

00:15:06.066 --> 00:15:08.400
but a hair makes all
the difference, doesn't it?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.966
Now, not only do my monsters
regain their attack points,

00:15:10.966 --> 00:15:12.133
but they're' doubled!

00:15:12.966 --> 00:15:15.333
I win!

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:18.266
Odd‐Eyes, attack Bright
Armageddon and end this duel!

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:21.433
I don't think so!

00:15:21.433 --> 00:15:24.133
Getting those five cards first
would be a guaranteed victory

00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:27.333
against any duelist as long
as that duelist isn't me!

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:29.900
By sending D/D Savant Einstein
to the graveyard,

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.333
I get to place
a spell on my field.

00:15:32.333 --> 00:15:35.033
Now that I also have
five cards,

00:15:35.033 --> 00:15:37.066
my monsters become
stronger than yours!

00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:40.066
Well then, I'll spark up

00:15:40.066 --> 00:15:41.433
Ignition Eagle's
special ability!

00:15:42.866 --> 00:15:45.633
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon
and Ignition Eagle

00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:47.900
will switch places
so Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.466
is back in the fight!

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.266
Plus Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon

00:15:54.266 --> 00:15:56.733
gains Odd‐Eyes Rebellion
Dragon's attack points

00:15:56.733 --> 00:15:58.900
making it stronger
than your Super Doom King!

00:16:00.973 --> 00:16:02.873
Yuya, half the trick
of dueling

00:16:02.873 --> 00:16:05.140
is remembering the moves
of your opponent,

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.306
and it's abundantly clear
that you have forgotten

00:16:07.306 --> 00:16:09.173
what my monsters
are capable of.

00:16:10.673 --> 00:16:12.640
Oh, but, I do remember.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.973
Bright Armageddon removes
all my monsters'

00:16:14.973 --> 00:16:17.706
special abilities, except for
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon.

00:16:17.706 --> 00:16:19.006
That's right!

00:16:19.006 --> 00:16:21.306
But you've forgotten
that Purple Armageddon

00:16:21.306 --> 00:16:23.906
not only stops my Super Doom
Kings from being destroyed

00:16:23.906 --> 00:16:26.606
but it also drops
your Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon's

00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:29.006
attack points back
down to the starting line.

00:16:29.873 --> 00:16:30.573
(Dragon roars)

00:16:32.673 --> 00:16:34.806
So you lose due
to your own attack!

00:16:34.806 --> 00:16:36.740
A sorry end
to your sorry duel!

00:16:38.473 --> 00:16:40.306
Come on, ya party pooper.

00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:41.840
Who said the show's over?

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.840
But it is over!

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.006
It's not...
'cause my Dragon

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.173
isn't going into
this fight alone!

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.140
You think I'll just have
one measly dragon

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.806
fight all by itself?

00:16:51.806 --> 00:16:54.140
I have a whole
rainbow of monsters

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.073
ready to finish
this duel!

00:16:56.073 --> 00:16:59.006
Rainbow of monsters?

00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:01.113
And they work as a team!

00:17:01.113 --> 00:17:03.580
Starting off with
Performapal Ignition Eagle!

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.413
By banishing my bird

00:17:05.413 --> 00:17:07.480
and Performapal
Five‐Rainbow Magician,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.813
all of our facedown
cards are destroyed!

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.213
You know, Declan,

00:17:13.213 --> 00:17:15.246
with Z‐ARC
and the dimensional wars

00:17:15.246 --> 00:17:16.880
and the constant fight
to save the world,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.580
I forgot something
along the way.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.146
Something simple.

00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:21.613
That when you
get down to it,

00:17:21.613 --> 00:17:23.246
dueling's just fun.

00:17:23.246 --> 00:17:25.746
And sometimes,
all I need to smile

00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:28.980
is just some random...
Performapal Pyrotechnics!

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.213
So five... four...

00:17:31.213 --> 00:17:33.613
(all)
Three... two... one!

00:17:33.613 --> 00:17:34.846
Ignition!

00:17:53.746 --> 00:17:56.546
(people cheering)

00:18:00.686 --> 00:18:03.120
(cooing)

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.986
Now... it's time
for my grand finale!

00:18:05.986 --> 00:18:08.686
Ignition Eagle's
special ability

00:18:08.686 --> 00:18:12.286
gives Odd‐eyes Pendulum
Dragon 500 attack points

00:18:12.286 --> 00:18:14.386
for every Pendulum Monster
on my field.

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.420
That's 2000 attack points!

00:18:20.453 --> 00:18:22.553
It's showtime!

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:24.120
(Dragon roars)

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.086
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:18:28.786 --> 00:18:31.386
I'm able to protect
my monster from destruction,

00:18:31.386 --> 00:18:33.686
but I'm still going to
have to take the damage.

00:18:33.686 --> 00:18:35.953
Yeah, you got that
right, Declan!

00:18:35.953 --> 00:18:38.120
In fact, you take
double the damage!

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.686
It's a wrap!

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.720
(all cheering)

00:19:05.093 --> 00:19:07.360
(laughing)
Oh, Riley!

00:19:09.393 --> 00:19:10.860
Oh, yeah!
Hear that?

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.560
Riley's laughing!

00:19:18.393 --> 00:19:20.893
As the winner of this duel,

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:23.626
Yuya Sakaki advances
to the professional ranks!

00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:25.693
I knew you had it
in you, Yuya.

00:19:25.693 --> 00:19:27.793
That you'd remember
that your dueltaining

00:19:27.793 --> 00:19:30.960
can only make people smile
if it makes you smile first.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.260
Ohh!

00:20:20.566 --> 00:20:21.466
Oh!

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:34.466
Oh!

00:20:54.266 --> 00:20:55.300
Yuya...

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.100
Ohh!

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.173
I'm back home.
(all gasp)

00:21:00.173 --> 00:21:02.773
I knew you'd save the world.
You just can't help yourself.

00:21:04.673 --> 00:21:06.606
Ya know... I try Zuzu.

00:21:07.773 --> 00:21:09.906
I know.
I know.

00:21:11.073 --> 00:21:12.640

00:21:17.373 --> 00:21:19.073
Riley is laughing,

00:21:19.073 --> 00:21:20.806
so Z‐ARC's evil
is gone forever.

00:21:20.806 --> 00:21:22.873
♪♪ Can you feel the power? ♪
Yes.

00:21:22.873 --> 00:21:26.173
Yuya has successfully
brought our worlds together

00:21:26.173 --> 00:21:28.306
by making each
and everyone smile.

00:21:28.306 --> 00:21:30.506
Everyone except for me.

00:21:30.506 --> 00:21:32.606

00:21:32.606 --> 00:21:34.373
(laughing)

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.473
(Yusho)
Now now, my son, your journey
is only just beginning.

00:21:40.473 --> 00:21:42.540
Whoa! Dad?!

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.240
Yuya, becoming a pro dueltainer
means embracing

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.773
each new duel as a new
challenge to overcome!

00:21:48.773 --> 00:21:50.640
Are you ready
to take your dueltaining

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.506
to the next level, son?

00:21:52.506 --> 00:21:54.973
You bet!
I could duel all day!

00:21:54.973 --> 00:21:57.106
Hey, I'd even skip dessert!

00:21:57.106 --> 00:21:59.373
You sure did
teach me a lot Dad,

00:21:59.373 --> 00:22:01.746
but you didn't
teach me everything!

00:22:01.746 --> 00:22:04.413
It's time
to swing into action!

00:22:04.413 --> 00:22:06.246
♪♪ Can you feel the power?
