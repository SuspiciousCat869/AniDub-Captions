WEBVTT

00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.733
Previously on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V."

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:08.233
(Leo)
It seems the impending danger
is fast approaching.

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:13.033
I must accelerate my timeline
to unite you all into one.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.133
The Arc Five reactor condenses
all the life energies

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.200
my students have collected.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.700
Its power will then be able to
create a new single dimension

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.866
by fusing the existing four
dimensions back into one.

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.966
And when the dimensions
reunite as one,

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.933
so will these four girls,

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.666
and I will have
my daughter Ray back.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.900
(Yuya)
We're gonna put
a stop to you!

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.466
(Yusho)
Yuya is in for the match
of his life now.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:40.233
Z‐ARC will do as he pleases.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:42.066
He will resurrect!

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.633
Yuya has already
combined with Yuto.

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:48.600
He's only steps away from
transforming back into Z‐ARC.

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.500
It's only a matter
of time now

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.633
until the Reactor
is fully functional.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.933
No! Yuya!

00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.973
Stop all this!
Right now!

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.106
Huh?

00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:05.006
(Z‐Arc)
How dare you turn on me.

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:06.006
You'll pay!

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:07.673
Yuya! Fight it!

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:10.373
Ahh!

00:01:10.373 --> 00:01:13.406
(Yusho)
Z‐ARC could've resurrected
anytime, why now?

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.940
What's different?

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.240
He could already Fusion,
Synchro and Xyz Summon.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.940
But he couldn't Pendulum!

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.606
Because it's a whole new power!

00:01:21.606 --> 00:01:24.106
And that's why
he's resurrecting now!

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:25.940
(sinister laughter)

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.840
Yuya!

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.606
(grunts)

00:01:30.806 --> 00:01:32.906
And now goodbye!

(Yuya/Z‐Arc)
Professor!
You're through!

00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:42.213
I don't think so.

00:02:42.213 --> 00:02:46.113
I'm activating my Spirit
Reactor's special ability.

00:02:46.113 --> 00:02:48.146
And because I have...

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:51.080
If an Earth, Water, Fire
or Wind attribute monster

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.480
is on the field...

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.146
Then my monsters
cannot be destroyed.

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:57.780
And since Gust King Alexander
is a wind monster

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.586
and Wave King Caesar
is a water monster,

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:02.920
Pendulum Governor is safe!

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.286
(Declan)
So, you used my own
monsters to our advantage?

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:10.486
(Yuya/Z‐Arc)
I place one card face down
and end my turn!

00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:14.420
Please stay calm.

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:17.386
(growling)

00:03:17.386 --> 00:03:19.453
I can sense Z‐ARC's
consciousness

00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:21.853
getting stronger with each
passing moment.

00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:24.953
Tell me, what's the energy
status of the Arc Five Reactor?

00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:27.120
<i>Functionality</i>
<i>is currently at 20%.</i>

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.520
That's it?

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.420
Override the power dampeners.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.020
Triple the ignition
input energies.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.953
We have to get
the reactor working.

00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:36.620
(Declan)
Father!

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.320
You think your machine
will save us.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.220
But there isn't
any truth to that.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.053
It will hurt
even more people

00:03:42.053 --> 00:03:44.620
than this revived
Z‐ARC you so fear!

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.186
It's like trying to put a fire
out with gallons of gasoline.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:51.153
And I'm not going
to sit by and let you.

00:03:51.153 --> 00:03:54.220
For the sake of everyone here,
this ends now.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.786
It's my turn!

00:03:56.786 --> 00:04:00.186
I tribute Triple D
Gust King Alexander

00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:03.426
and Triple D Wave King Caesar

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:06.960
to summon Triple D
Doom King Armageddon!

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:15.960
He got rid
of his Synchro Monster?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.593
And his Xyz monster?

00:04:17.593 --> 00:04:19.560
But that only helps his dad.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.926
(Celina)
You're right
because now the Professor

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:24.660
can summon Synchro and Xyz
Monsters again!

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.926
(Yusho)
Declan's certainly taking
a huge risk,

00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:29.526
but it may pay off for him.

00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:32.160
By getting rid of his own
Wind and Water monsters,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.659
Spirit Reactor's
Pendulum ability

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.859
no longer protects
Pendulum Governor.

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:40.460
And Pendulum Governor can only
be attacked by Pendulum Monsters

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.826
which is exactly what
Doom King Armageddon is!

00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:46.860
Correct, it appears that
it's time for the son

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.626
to school the father.

00:04:48.626 --> 00:04:51.826
(Leo)
Oh, please, your monster
has 3,000 attack points.

00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:55.293
Mine has 2800 so when all
is said and done,

00:04:55.293 --> 00:04:57.660
I'll only take
a paltry 200 points of damage.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.426
Might wanna check your math.

00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:01.100
What?

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.366
(Declan)
By sending Wave King Caesar
to the graveyard,

00:05:03.366 --> 00:05:06.133
I can add one Contract
card to my hand!

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.533
And now I'll activate it.

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:13.666
Deceitful Dark Contract
with the War Deity!

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:16.500
Now Doom King Armageddon
gains and additional

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.666
1,000 attack points
until the end of the battle.

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:22.600
And your Pendulum Governor
loses that same amount.

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:29.233
So, you don't take 200 points
of damage, you take 2200.

00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:31.433
Yuya, hang in there.

00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:33.400
This will all be
over very soon.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.000
Now, go Doom King Armageddon!

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.533
Attack Pendulum Governor!

00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:40.266
(Leo)
I think not!

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:43.266
I play my trap card:
Dis‐swing Fusion!

00:05:43.266 --> 00:05:46.266
Now I can negate
your monster's attack.

00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:49.100
And then bring it on over here
to join my forces.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.166
What?

00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:53.200
(Leo)
Oh, and from here on out,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.166
this monster can't
be destroyed by effects.

00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:57.600
(gasps)
He stole his monster!

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.600
Not just any monster
but his best.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.506
You were waiting for me to
attack with my Pendulum Monster.

00:06:03.506 --> 00:06:06.773
You tricked me into thinking
I had the edge, Father.

00:06:06.773 --> 00:06:09.740
Silly boy, you'll never
have the edge over me.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.873
With Dis‐swing Fusion,
I'm allowed to summon

00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:15.406
a Fusion Monster
using one fewer monster.

00:06:15.406 --> 00:06:19.840
So now I'll use Pendulum
Governor to Fusion Summon.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.306
Witness the monster you were
so certain you had vanquished

00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:26.973
becomes a force that
will soon vanquish you!

00:06:26.973 --> 00:06:31.406
Behold, Master Spirit
Tech Force Pendulum Ruler!

00:06:44.473 --> 00:06:46.140
(Zuzu)
No way!

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.673
(Rin)
That monster's
super powerful!

00:06:48.673 --> 00:06:50.273
(Lulu)
Unbelievable!

00:06:50.273 --> 00:06:52.940
Nothing seems to throw
Leo off his game.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.340
(Yusho)
He has a solution
for everything.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.306
He plans ahead
and anticipates your every move.

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:02.180
(sinister laugh)

00:07:04.246 --> 00:07:06.746
You make it too easy, Declan.

00:07:06.746 --> 00:07:09.680
Your approach hasn't changed
a bit since you were a child.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.446
Sure, now you may
look like an adult

00:07:12.446 --> 00:07:14.713
but that
doesn't make it so.

00:07:14.713 --> 00:07:18.613
You have so much
growing up to do.

00:07:18.613 --> 00:07:21.546
The next time you get delusions
of grandeur about using

00:07:21.546 --> 00:07:24.213
Pendulum abilities
to save your monsters

00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:26.313
or alter summoning requirements

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:28.646
or whatever else your little
brain can come up with,

00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:30.380
just realize something.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.513
My big brain
has already thought of it.

00:07:33.513 --> 00:07:37.946
In other words, you'll never
catch me off guard, Declan.

00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:40.780
The truth is I know
what you're going to do

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.980
even before you do it.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.113
And not just
in dueling,

00:07:45.113 --> 00:07:48.313
but in life,
which is why I know,

00:07:48.313 --> 00:07:50.946
you'll always be second best!

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.880
And that is why you are
incapable of stopping me

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.780
from finishing Yuya
on my next turn.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.153
(Yuya/Z‐Arc)
I'd like to see you try
especially after I do this!

00:08:03.153 --> 00:08:06.286
I activate the trap card
Twin Big Shields!

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:08.886
And now these twin shields

00:08:08.886 --> 00:08:11.053
Protect Performapal Gatlinghoul

00:08:11.053 --> 00:08:13.120
from being destroyed
twice per turn.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.086
I just can't tell if Yuya
or Z‐ARC's in control.

00:08:16.086 --> 00:08:18.520
I can't tell either!

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.086
(Leo)
So be it, but though you may be
able to prolong this duel,

00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:23.820
you will not succeed
in prolonging

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.953
your presence here, Z‐ARC.

00:08:24.953 --> 00:08:27.420
I will stop you.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.086
And there's nothing, Declan,
you can do to stop me either.

00:08:31.086 --> 00:08:33.786
Just know that I won't
give up, Father.

00:08:33.786 --> 00:08:36.520
Deceitful Dark Contract with
the War Deity's effect ends.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.786
And Doom Armageddon's attack
points return to normal.

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.986
I end my turn.
It's your move.

00:08:43.986 --> 00:08:45.286
Yuya, he's up.

00:08:45.286 --> 00:08:47.620
Get ready.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.320
I draw!

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.920
Since I already
set my Pendulum Scale,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.353
I can summon a monster
from my Extra Deck.

00:08:58.353 --> 00:09:00.060
Now rise!

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.460
Spirit Gem Salamander Core!

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.560
And Spirit Gem
Silpheed Core!

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.693
When I Pendulum Summon
Salamander Core

00:09:11.693 --> 00:09:13.393
from the Extra Deck,

00:09:13.393 --> 00:09:16.426
it immediately
returns to my hand.

00:09:16.426 --> 00:09:18.260
It doesn't matter what you do,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.393
there's no way you're
gonna walk away a winner.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.526
I don't think you're in any
position to say such things.

00:09:23.526 --> 00:09:27.160
The four dimensions will merge
together and unite as one.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.293
And then I will have
my daughter Ray back,

00:09:30.293 --> 00:09:32.893
and Z‐ARC's fate
will be sealed!

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.526
Pendulum Ruler's
ability activates!

00:09:37.526 --> 00:09:43.293
Now, by tributing Silpheed Core,
I can use its ability twice!

00:09:43.293 --> 00:09:47.060
And it's an ability that deals
you 800 points of damage

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.160
for every spell
or trap card I destroy.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.993
So, first, I'll destroy
Twin Big Shields!

00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:58.060
(Pendulum Ruler growling)

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:04.133
And Pendulum Ruler
doubles the damage you take.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.366
And don't think I forgot about
you, Declan!

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:15.000
I destroy your Contract!

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.033
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:25.366
(console beeping)

00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:27.966
<i>Professor Akaba, the Arc</i>
<i>Reactor's functionality</i>

00:10:27.966 --> 00:10:29.633
<i>is now at 30%.</i>

00:10:29.633 --> 00:10:32.333
Proceed to Phase Two.

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:37.200
And soon, the Arc Five Reactor
will be 100% operational.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.000
And I will finally bring
my dear daughter back to me!

00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:49.666
Keep energizing the reactor.

00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:51.933
Let me know when we're
ready for Phase Three.

00:10:51.933 --> 00:10:53.266
<i>Yes, sir, Professor!</i>

00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:54.266
<i>Will do! I'm on it!</i>

00:10:56.333 --> 00:11:00.366
(Yusho)
Oh, no, when the reactor's
fully charged,

00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:03.940
he'll use it to unite the four
dimensions and destroy us all!

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.606
And what happens to my son
in all of this?

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:11.040
Yuya...

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.006
This card may be the only way
to stop you,

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:17.006
but I fear it may create
even greater danger.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.140
Now.

00:11:25.206 --> 00:11:28.940
Pendulum Ruler attack
Gatlinghoul!

00:11:38.006 --> 00:11:41.140
With one more attack,
Z‐ARC will finally be finished

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.940
and the dimensions will unite.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.540
I attack with Triple D Doom King
Armageddon!

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.440
Yes, Declan,
I'm using your monster.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.740
So, I guess we were actually
working together after all.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.946
(Yuya/Z‐Arc)
I activate Evasion!

00:12:10.946 --> 00:12:12.546
To avoid your attack!

00:12:15.246 --> 00:12:17.813
(Leo)
An Action Card, what luck.

00:12:17.813 --> 00:12:20.246
I end my turn!

00:12:20.246 --> 00:12:22.180
That was too close
for comfort.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.780
Playing Action Cards,
skating up walls,

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.713
that's definitely
how Yuya duels.

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:30.213
So that proves Z‐ARC
isn't in control of him.

00:12:33.413 --> 00:12:36.446
(Declan)
Because Yuya will never
let his spirit break,

00:12:36.446 --> 00:12:39.980
especially when it's
to save his friends.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.213
Now, listen up and hear
what I'm saying, Yuya.

00:12:44.213 --> 00:12:46.713
I need you to get up.

00:12:46.713 --> 00:12:48.646
This fight isn't over yet.

00:12:48.646 --> 00:12:50.946
Let's stop my father together.

00:12:50.946 --> 00:12:52.580
What do you say, Yuya?

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.346
(Yuya)
All right.

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:00.820
We will fight.
We will fight.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.586
Yuya!

00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:03.320
Stop Leo!

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.153
Come on, Yuya.

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:10.086
(Z‐Arc)
You'll never stop
my resurrection!

00:13:10.086 --> 00:13:12.753
Then you all will
pay the price!

00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:15.320
(screaming)

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.253
(Yuya)
It's so hard
to hold him down.

00:13:18.253 --> 00:13:21.120
But I can't give up,
I must fight.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.820
(Leo)
Yuya, Z‐ARC, whichever you are,
you won't win.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.553
You have nothing
to destroy my monsters.

00:13:26.553 --> 00:13:28.586
It's only a matter of time.

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:32.586
(Yuya/Z‐Arc)
My turn!

00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:37.253
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:44.720
Turn up the heat
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.386
Get going,
Performapal U Go Golem!

00:13:48.386 --> 00:13:51.686
Scare to it,
Performapal Nightmare Knight!

00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:55.186
I overlay U Go Golem
and Nightmare Knight

00:13:55.186 --> 00:13:57.153
to build the Overlay Network!

00:14:01.993 --> 00:14:05.060
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective,

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.160
I call upon the most dangerous
of dragons!

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.393
I Xyz Summon...

00:14:10.393 --> 00:14:14.693
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:14:14.693 --> 00:14:16.793
(roaring)

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.293
One of Yuto's favorite monsters!

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.593
That proves that Yuto
is still here fighting!

00:14:23.593 --> 00:14:26.526
No, this is pure Z‐ARC.

00:14:26.526 --> 00:14:28.993
Z‐ARC controlled
that dragon as well.

00:14:40.226 --> 00:14:42.360
(Leo)
Just look at him,
all of you!

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.126
Can you truly not see
what is so evident?

00:14:46.126 --> 00:14:48.193
All that remains now is Z‐ARC!

00:14:48.193 --> 00:14:50.226
No, you're wrong, Father!

00:14:50.226 --> 00:14:52.326
He's still Yuya
and he will be forever!

00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:54.093
Absolutely!

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:57.126
And I feel Yuto's fighting
alongside Yuya.

00:14:57.126 --> 00:14:59.126
I'm not going to give up hope.

00:14:59.126 --> 00:15:01.266
Same here!
We all still believe!

00:15:01.266 --> 00:15:02.466
Yeah, that's right!

00:15:02.466 --> 00:15:04.300
No one is giving up
on you!

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.800
So, Yuya, you can't
give up on yourself!

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.900
Fight Z‐ARC with every
ounce of your strength!

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.166
And remember the reasons
why you duel!

00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:13.700
(screaming)

00:15:15.066 --> 00:15:17.166
(gasping)

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.866
(roaring)

00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:22.500
(Yuya/Z‐Arc)
I activate my spell card!

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.333
The Phantom Knights
Possession!

00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:27.333
And now my Xyz Dragon

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:29.200
can take on the level
of another monster!

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.133
So go!

00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:34.233
Odd‐Eyes, transfer your level
to Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:37.033
But I'm not through!

00:15:37.033 --> 00:15:39.566
I overlay Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon

00:15:39.566 --> 00:15:41.466
And Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:15:41.466 --> 00:15:43.933
to build the Overlay Network!

00:15:43.933 --> 00:15:46.333
By joining together
two of the strongest

00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:48.633
dragons in the universe,

00:15:48.633 --> 00:15:53.566
I'll create a dragon
that's all the rage!

00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:57.400
I Xyz Summon...

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.640
Odd‐Eyes Raging Dragon!

00:16:06.606 --> 00:16:08.573
Not good, not at all.

00:16:08.573 --> 00:16:10.806
(screaming)

00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:15.273
(Yuya/Z‐Arc)
I use all of Odd‐Eyes Raging
Dragon's Overlay Units!

00:16:15.273 --> 00:16:17.806
That means the effect of all
spell and trap cards

00:16:17.806 --> 00:16:20.273
currently out are negated!

00:16:20.273 --> 00:16:24.573
And all other cards
on the field are destroyed!

00:16:39.806 --> 00:16:43.206
And Odd‐Eyes Raging Dragon
gains 200 attack points

00:16:43.206 --> 00:16:45.840
for every card it destroyed!

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.306
Since it destroyed
seven cards, it gains 1400.

00:16:49.306 --> 00:16:52.506
(Yuya/Z‐Arc)
But since you have a couple
monsters that can't be destroyed

00:16:52.506 --> 00:16:57.173
by special abilities, I'll just
have to destroy them in battle!

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:07.246
Odd‐Eyes Raging Dragon, attack
Triple D Doom King Armageddon!

00:17:07.246 --> 00:17:10.446
Infernal Fury Strike!

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.713
(screaming)

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.080
What happened?

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.846
Foolish move!

00:17:23.846 --> 00:17:26.280
Doom King Armageddon
originally belonged to Declan.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.146
So, my trap Dis‐swing Fusion

00:17:29.146 --> 00:17:31.880
transferred the damage
to him instead of me.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.713
So you've gone and hurt
your own teammate.

00:17:33.713 --> 00:17:36.180
That... doesn't matter!

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.513
Because my Odd‐Eyes
Raging Dragon

00:17:38.513 --> 00:17:41.913
can attack twice in one turn!
Attack!

00:17:41.913 --> 00:17:43.880
(Zuza)
Wait, no, stop it!

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.513
Huh?

00:17:45.513 --> 00:17:48.113
Just stop, I can't
see you like this.

00:17:48.113 --> 00:17:49.280
You're dueling out of anger.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.380
Where's that smile I love?

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.246
This isn't how you duel.

00:17:54.246 --> 00:17:56.280
So just stop.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.813
I know deep down you can duel
the way you used to duel.

00:17:59.813 --> 00:18:02.820
Look inside
and find the fun.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.220
Zuzu's right.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.520
We all know you can do this.

00:18:10.386 --> 00:18:12.086
Update.

00:18:12.086 --> 00:18:13.953
(console beeping)

00:18:13.953 --> 00:18:17.653
<i>The Reactor's functionality</i>
<i>is now above 40%, Professor.</i>

00:18:17.653 --> 00:18:19.586
<i>Enough to move on</i>
<i>to Phase Three.</i>

00:18:19.586 --> 00:18:21.820
Very good,
you may proceed.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.986
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

00:18:23.986 --> 00:18:26.953
(warbling sound)

00:18:26.953 --> 00:18:27.986
(both gasp)

00:18:27.986 --> 00:18:29.520
(both gasp)

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.953
What's happening?!

00:18:31.953 --> 00:18:33.120
(Lulu)
My hand!

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.886
No!

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.153
(Yuya/Z‐Arc)
Odd‐Eyes Raging Dragon, go!

00:18:39.153 --> 00:18:41.453
Attack Pendulum Ruler!

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:43.653
This isn't you!

00:18:43.653 --> 00:18:45.420
Do it now!

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.720
Infernal Fury Strike!

00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:59.286
I'll end you!

00:18:59.286 --> 00:19:03.026
I banish Performapal Nightmare
Knight from my graveyard

00:19:03.026 --> 00:19:05.560
to deal 1,000 points of damage

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.493
to everyone who took
battle damage this turn!

00:19:08.493 --> 00:19:11.160
(Zuzu)
But that means he's going to
hurt Declan too.

00:19:16.193 --> 00:19:19.626
(Zuzu)
Yuya, why?

00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:24.593
(computer voice)
Intrusion penalty
2,000 Life Points.

00:19:24.593 --> 00:19:27.360
I play from my hand
the trap card.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.460
Restraining Sword of Impact!

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.526
I'm sorry, Yuya, but what's
about to happen

00:19:33.526 --> 00:19:35.160
is for your own good.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.960
I hope you can forgive me.

00:19:47.426 --> 00:19:49.493
<i>Unrecognized</i>
<i>card detected.</i>

00:19:49.493 --> 00:19:52.260
<i>Duel automatically</i>
<i>terminated.</i>

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.993
The match is over?

00:19:58.793 --> 00:20:00.200
That trap card.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.766
That's right.

00:20:01.766 --> 00:20:04.600
It's the same one
you gave to me years ago

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.533
back when you were experimenting
with all sorts of cards.

00:20:07.533 --> 00:20:11.166
It was just a prototype
but I kept it anyway.

00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.733
(Yuya/Z‐Arc)
Let me go!

00:20:12.733 --> 00:20:15.866
Let me go!

00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:18.066
(Yusho)
Though I must admit I never
believed I'd have to use it

00:20:18.066 --> 00:20:20.633
against my own son.

00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:24.266
But alas, I had to stop this
duel while I still could,

00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:27.033
before he lost all control.

00:20:27.033 --> 00:20:29.433
Because Leo was right
about one thing.

00:20:29.433 --> 00:20:31.500
He was?

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.933
Yes, no matter how shocking
it might seem,

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:39.400
Leo was speaking the truth
that Yuya is connected to Z‐ARC,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.900
similar to how you are connected
to Leo's daughter Ray, Zuzu.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.900
(all)
Huh?

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.333
But destiny is always
an interesting thing.

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:49.366
I believe that Yuya
never succumbed

00:20:49.366 --> 00:20:51.766
to the darkness
because of you, Zuzu.

00:20:51.766 --> 00:20:55.366
You were always by his side,
helping him, and reminding him

00:20:55.366 --> 00:20:58.100
to bring a smile
to everyone's faces.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.473
As Ray would have wanted.

00:21:00.473 --> 00:21:03.740
So I was helping Yuya?

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.573
(Yusho)
But now that you're trapped
and not by his side,

00:21:06.573 --> 00:21:08.640
no one is helping him fight
against the darkness,

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.340
making it harder for him
to suppress the evil.

00:21:15.406 --> 00:21:17.706
It is time!

00:21:17.706 --> 00:21:20.540
To become one.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.973
Declan, take Riley and find
a way to free those girls.

00:21:24.973 --> 00:21:27.640
You haven't
much time so hurry.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.940
Everyone's counting
on you, Declan.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.506
(Declan)
And where are you going?

00:21:34.506 --> 00:21:37.940
You don't think I'd let
evil take my son, do you?

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.173
What kind of father
would I be?
