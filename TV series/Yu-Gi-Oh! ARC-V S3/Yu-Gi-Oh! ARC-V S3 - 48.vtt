WEBVTT

00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:03.366
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.466
(Yusho)
That's Jack Atlas.

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:10.033
He may be Yuya's friend from
the Synchro Dimension

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.900
but he's also
a great adversary

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.533
that can push Yuya's
skills to the limit.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.400
(Jack)
Your dueltaining couldn't
make a hyena smile, Yuya!

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.933
<i>If I summon</i>
<i>those dragons,</i>

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.933
<i>Zarc might take over</i>
<i>Riley's body.</i>

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.733
When you're in
a race against time,

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.366
you can't afford to slam
on the brakes!

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.833
And the Master of Faster

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:27.300
is going to teach you
that lesson

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.733
by challenging
you to a duel!

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.266
(Declan)
This, Yuya,
is the Multiverse Speedway.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.300
An incredible Duel Runner track

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.766
that runs through
all four dimensions!

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.333
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.500
Go, Molten Crimson Flare!

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:45.666
(Yuto)
This is how
you're gonna lose?

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.266
(Yuri) What's wrong with you?
(Yugo) What's wrong with you?
(Yuto) What's wrong with you?

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.100
But what if we
resurrect Zarc?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.433
You know you
can always make things

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:51.333
swing your way again.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.466
So don't you worry about
anything, all right?

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.366
Try to enjoy the ride.

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.500
(all)
It will give you the strength
to keep moving forward!

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.740
(Yuya)
Yuto... Yuri...

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.506
and Yugo, you were right.

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:06.140
It's a new dimension,
so it's a new me.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.673
I can't be afraid of who I was

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:09.940
or I'll always be
afraid of what I'll be.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.606
I Xyz Summon!

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:14.206
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.406
(cooing)

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.073
Yuya summoning that dragon
must have triggered Zarc.

00:01:20.873 --> 00:01:22.140
(Yuya)
Here they are.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.940
All four dimension dragons.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.673
No going back.

00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:27.440
It's time for me to
swing into action!

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:33.313
(roaring)

00:02:34.746 --> 00:02:35.846
Hey, Jack!

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:37.313
I was sabotaging myself

00:02:37.313 --> 00:02:39.446
by playing with only
half a deck.

00:02:39.446 --> 00:02:41.180
I know it wasn't
the smartest of strategies

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.513
but that's all changing,

00:02:42.513 --> 00:02:44.180
which is terrible news
for you!

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.146
I'm no longer scared.

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:48.713
I'll battle you
with all that I've I got!

00:02:48.713 --> 00:02:51.413
And you better believe, Jack,
that what I've got is plenty!

00:02:51.413 --> 00:02:53.846
Plenty being
the four strongest dragons!

00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:55.813
One from each dimension!

00:02:55.813 --> 00:02:58.246
And each one is hankering
to get in...

00:02:58.246 --> 00:03:00.280
on this duel!

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.753
And first up is gonna be
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:04.286
It steals all of your

00:03:04.286 --> 00:03:06.753
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend's
special abilities

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.320
until the end of this turn!

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.853
You gotta eat
when you're starving.

00:03:11.853 --> 00:03:13.720
You'd know.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.186
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon
isn't finished feasting yet!

00:03:17.186 --> 00:03:19.153
It gains both of your
monsters' attack points!

00:03:22.753 --> 00:03:23.820
(roaring)

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.820
(Crow)
Oh man, I don't know
if it's the Runner,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.353
but Yuya's on some
kinda roll now!

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.553
Now Starving
Venom Fusion Dragon

00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:34.786
uses the special ability
that it stole from

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:36.753
Scarlight Red
Dragon Archfiend!

00:03:36.753 --> 00:03:38.353
It destroys any of
your monsters

00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:40.920
that are weaker than
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.186
which is... all of 'em!

00:03:43.186 --> 00:03:46.253
Plus, you take 500 points
of damage for each one!

00:03:46.253 --> 00:03:47.853
Lands sakes!

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:50.053
I know Yuya wants to win
this Turbo Duel,

00:03:50.053 --> 00:03:53.386
but he's goin' after
Jack Atlas like a crazed coyote!

00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:56.053
That's downright
un‐neighborly.

00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:58.786
Yeah, but Jack's always
prepared for everything.

00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:00.220
Nice try, Yuya!

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.360
But not
nice enough.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.026
I activate Invalidate!

00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:06.093
Special abilities can
no longer destroy

00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:08.093
any monsters this turn!

00:04:08.093 --> 00:04:09.460
Not bad.

00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:19.793
You think I started
dueling yesterday?

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:21.226
I've seen all and done all,

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:22.693
so those
cheap parlor tricks

00:04:22.693 --> 00:04:24.893
won't work against me!

00:04:24.893 --> 00:04:27.926
Even with four dragons
all I see is one loser!

00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:33.359
<i>(Melissa)By gum, the Master</i>
<i>of Faster's as fired‐up as a</i>
<i>mountain lion</i>

00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:34.993
<i>with its tail ablaze!</i>

00:04:34.993 --> 00:04:36.626
<i>He's showin' the grit</i>
<i>and guts that make him</i>

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:38.893
<i>the pride of New</i>
<i>Domino City!</i>

00:04:38.893 --> 00:04:41.226
I guess I gotta
step my game up then.

00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:44.260
Or I mean... we have to
step our game up.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.960
Next up, Yuto's
dragon takes the stage!

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.193
I use all of Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon's Overlay Units

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.393
to activate
its special ability!

00:04:56.393 --> 00:04:58.126
Treason Discharge!

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.666
Your dragons' attack points
are slashed in half!

00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:04.366
But don't worry.

00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:06.966
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
won't let them go to waste

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:08.566
because it takes
them for itself!

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:12.133
Time to fight!

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:14.333
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon,

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:16.366
attack Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.033
I activate...

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:24.566
Evasion,
to dodge your attack!

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:26.733
Hoo‐wee!

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:28.633
That strike would've ended it,

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:31.233
but Jack shook it off like
a horsefly dodgin' a swatter!

00:05:31.233 --> 00:05:33.066
You may have
stopped one of my dragons,

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.333
but I got more plenty more
waiting in the wings!

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:37.333
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon,

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:39.266
attack Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:05:45.233 --> 00:05:48.433
Jack's being put out to
pasture for real this time!

00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:50.433
(Jack)
I'm activating this
Miracle Action Spell!

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.000
It shields Tyrant

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.300
and cuts all the damage
I take in half!

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.533
<i>(Melissa)</i>
<i>Glory be!</i>

00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:58.766
<i>Ya can't cut it much</i>
<i>closer than that!</i>

00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:01.106
<i>But Jack isn't</i>
<i>out of the woods yet!</i>

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:03.806
<i>Yuya still has two more</i>
<i>dragons that can attack!</i>

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:05.206
That's why you're
the king, Jack.

00:06:05.206 --> 00:06:06.540
I don't know anyone else

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.940
who could've
dodged those attacks.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.340
But you won't dodge
a third!

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.140
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.573
attack Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:15.306
Spin Storm Sky Strike!

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.106
So what!

00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:23.473
I'm sending Invalidate
to the graveyard

00:06:23.473 --> 00:06:26.506
so that I can cut all
the damage I'm taking in half!

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:28.140
Your dragons will
not end me!

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.340
(cooing)

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.073
What's wrong, dear?

00:06:33.073 --> 00:06:35.540
Every time
Yuya's dragon attacks,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.473
Zarc is slowly waking up
inside Riley.

00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:45.840
I'm down to
one last attack,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.540
but that's all
I need!

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.606
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon,

00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:51.940
attack Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.140
and finish Jack!

00:06:58.906 --> 00:07:01.780
(Yuya)
Attack Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend and finish Jack!

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.413
I activate Rejuvenation!

00:07:07.413 --> 00:07:09.646
Not only can
you no longer destroy

00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:11.380
Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.080
but it bulks it up with
800 extra attack points!

00:07:19.413 --> 00:07:20.780
All right!

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.080
Thanks for the lift,
Clear Wing!

00:07:23.146 --> 00:07:24.613
And now with the help of

00:07:24.613 --> 00:07:26.946
the Action Spell
Charge Recklessly,

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.913
I can lift Odd‐Eyes'
attack points by 600!

00:07:29.913 --> 00:07:30.646
No!

00:07:30.646 --> 00:07:32.080
Impossible!

00:07:36.513 --> 00:07:38.546
And that's not all!

00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:40.546
Odd‐Eyes deals you
double the damage!

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:01.086
Great, Yuya!

00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:02.186
He won!
He won!

00:08:02.186 --> 00:08:04.353
(laughing)

00:08:04.353 --> 00:08:05.753
<i>(Melissa)</i>
<i>Yee‐haw!</i>

00:08:05.753 --> 00:08:07.953
<i>It's over!</i>

00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:10.653
<i>After an epic duel that</i>
<i>spanned all four dimensions,</i>

00:08:10.653 --> 00:08:12.053
<i>we have</i>
<i>a clear‐cut champ:</i>

00:08:12.053 --> 00:08:14.820
<i>Yuya Sakaki!</i>

00:08:25.853 --> 00:08:27.020
You must be so proud!

00:08:28.553 --> 00:08:30.020
That's the way
to play, Yuya.

00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:35.186
You earned that victory.

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:37.986
You conquered
your fears to best me.

00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:41.486
But... you're still
no dueltainer.

00:08:41.486 --> 00:08:42.486
Far from it!

00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:50.020
So long!

00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:53.953
See you later,
I guess.

00:09:01.426 --> 00:09:02.560
Declan...

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.793
Declan...
is Riley smiling now?

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.226
See for yourself, Yuya.

00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:15.360
That's not a smile
unless you change

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.760
the definition
in the dictionary.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.293
So, Zarc's evil
is still in her.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:22.960
Then it looks
like I failed.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.693
Even with all
four dragons

00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:26.493
and my very
best dueltaining.

00:09:26.493 --> 00:09:28.426
Was that really your
best dueltaining, Yuya?

00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:32.626
Y'know, you sound
exactly like Jack.

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:35.393
He said I still had
a lot to prove too,

00:09:35.393 --> 00:09:37.526
and since I couldn't
make Riley smile,

00:09:37.526 --> 00:09:39.393
you're both right.

00:09:39.393 --> 00:09:40.960
Perhaps you need more
motivation.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.426
How about this‐‐

00:09:42.426 --> 00:09:43.793
I'll give
you one shot

00:09:43.793 --> 00:09:44.960
at achieving your
lifelong dream.

00:09:47.293 --> 00:09:49.093
You'll have one
final duel,

00:09:49.093 --> 00:09:50.726
one last
chance to dueltain

00:09:50.726 --> 00:09:52.493
and make Riley smile.

00:09:52.493 --> 00:09:55.093
If you succeed, I'll promote
you to the pro ranks.

00:09:55.093 --> 00:09:56.660
But if you fail,

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.526
then you must
never duel again.

00:09:58.526 --> 00:09:59.866
Never duel again?

00:10:02.633 --> 00:10:04.533
Well, that's a risk
I have to take!

00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:06.133
So, you're on, Declan!

00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:08.366
'Cause I never
turn down a duel!

00:10:08.366 --> 00:10:09.833
Now, who is it that
I gotta face?

00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:12.266
Tell me!

00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:13.900
The only one worthy
of such importance.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.433
Everyone, Yuya will
now take his pro exam!

00:10:19.433 --> 00:10:22.866
And his opponent...
will be me!

00:10:22.866 --> 00:10:24.500
He's dueling Declan?!
He's dueling Declan?!

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.400
Go, Yuya!
Go, Yuya!

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.500
Remember, Yuya,
to pass this test,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.100
not only must you
win this duel,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.300
but you must
also make Riley smile.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.400
(Yuya)
Got it.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.766
Then... let's
begin this duel!

00:10:50.766 --> 00:10:52.533
Generate
the Action Field

00:10:52.533 --> 00:10:53.733
Performance Coliseum!

00:10:56.233 --> 00:10:58.466
<i>(computerized voice)</i>
<i>Augmented reality</i>
<i>combat system energized.</i>

00:10:58.466 --> 00:10:59.840
<i>Generating Action Field.</i>

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:23.573
A circus?

00:11:23.573 --> 00:11:25.273
The first time
Yuya and Declan dueled

00:11:25.273 --> 00:11:27.040
it was at a circus too!

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.540
But that duel
was cut short,

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.506
so we don't know
who would've won.

00:11:30.506 --> 00:11:31.940
It's like they're
finishing things up

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.406
after a long
time out...

00:11:33.406 --> 00:11:34.806
like really long!

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.306
(Yuya)
This sure is
a blast from the past.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.206
Oh man, I was barely getting
my feet wet in dueltaining,

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.706
much less figuring out

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:49.506
all the cool secrets of
Pendulum Summoning.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.806
But every duel I had since then

00:11:53.806 --> 00:11:57.106
has led me to becoming
the duelist I am today.

00:11:57.106 --> 00:11:58.240
But was it enough?

00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:03.146
Winning a tournament
takes skill,

00:12:03.146 --> 00:12:06.013
but defeating
me requires perfection!

00:12:06.013 --> 00:12:08.213
Let's see if you're
a real champion.

00:12:08.213 --> 00:12:09.580
Because if you're not,

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.213
you're just
wasting my time.

00:12:12.213 --> 00:12:14.546
Your final test
begins now!

00:12:14.546 --> 00:12:16.380
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.746
I will allow you to make
the first move, Yuya.

00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:22.913
But know that
is the only act of mercy

00:12:22.913 --> 00:12:24.713
I will be showing you
this duel.

00:12:24.713 --> 00:12:26.846
Good to know, Declan!

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:30.280
First off, I'm summoning
Performapal Duck Dealer

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.746
from my hand!

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:36.713
Isn't he supposed to
Pendulum Summon?

00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:38.480
Guess Yuya's tryin'
some new moves.

00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:43.480
And since birds of a feather
like to flock together,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.846
I can automatically summon

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:47.946
Performapal Card Canard
to take the air!

00:12:51.546 --> 00:12:53.346
Next, Performapal Duck Dealer

00:12:53.346 --> 00:12:55.146
gives its special ability
a whirl

00:12:55.146 --> 00:12:57.746
to deal me another
card from my deck!

00:12:57.746 --> 00:12:59.386
I really do hope
it's a good one!

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.953
Yes!

00:13:00.953 --> 00:13:02.753
Then right away,

00:13:02.753 --> 00:13:05.453
I'll activate
Pendulum Card Burst.

00:13:05.453 --> 00:13:07.486
By sending both of
my birds south,

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.520
I can use
this spell...

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.953
to draw two cards!

00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:14.220
I set the Pendulum Scale with

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.786
Scale Three
Performapal Odd‐Eyes Seer

00:13:16.786 --> 00:13:19.453
and my Scale Ten Performapal
Ignition Eagle!

00:13:19.453 --> 00:13:21.720
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.853
I'm allowed
to summon monsters

00:13:28.853 --> 00:13:30.120
from Level Two
through Nine

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.653
all at
the same time!

00:13:31.653 --> 00:13:33.153
Now he's in business!

00:13:33.153 --> 00:13:34.120
Go for it!

00:13:35.953 --> 00:13:37.720
(Yuya)
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.853
Carve the arc of victory!

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:44.486
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:13:48.486 --> 00:13:49.586
Turn up the heat,

00:13:49.586 --> 00:13:51.453
Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:13:51.453 --> 00:13:52.720
(roaring)

00:13:54.686 --> 00:13:56.286
If you can't solve it,
dissolve it,

00:13:56.286 --> 00:13:57.753
Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Dissolver!

00:13:59.553 --> 00:14:00.993
Spin and win,

00:14:00.993 --> 00:14:03.526
Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Synchron!

00:14:03.526 --> 00:14:06.260
And migrating all the way back
from my Extra Deck are...

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.760
Performapal Duck Dealer

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.860
and Performapal
Card Canard!

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.393
(all)
Five Monsters at once!

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.160
That's uber cool!

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.593
You know...

00:14:14.593 --> 00:14:16.026
this is just
the opening act!

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.893
(Yuya)
Because I'm no longer
afraid of my dragons!

00:14:23.526 --> 00:14:25.960
I activate Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Dissolver's

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.693
special ability!

00:14:27.693 --> 00:14:30.426
I fuse him with
Performapal Odd‐Eyes Seer

00:14:30.426 --> 00:14:31.626
in my Pendulum Zone!

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.660
To bring out
a diabolical botanical!

00:14:41.126 --> 00:14:43.626
I Fusion Summon!

00:14:43.626 --> 00:14:46.060
The vicious, voracious,
and venomous

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.660
Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon!

00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:53.760
But why stop at two dragons
when I can summon a third?

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.726
I use
Performapal Ignition Eagle

00:14:55.726 --> 00:14:57.926
and my Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Seer

00:14:57.926 --> 00:14:59.726
to Synchro Summon!

00:14:59.726 --> 00:15:02.366
Beat your wings to whip up
a whirlwind of destruction!

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.300
I Synchro Summon!

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.900
Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:15:10.266 --> 00:15:13.533
Finally I overlay
Duck Dealer and Card Canard

00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:16.433
to build...
the Overlay Network!

00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:19.866
Cloaked in shadows

00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:21.866
and relentless
in its objective,

00:15:21.866 --> 00:15:24.300
I call upon the most
dangerous of dragons!

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.833
I Xyz Summon!

00:15:27.566 --> 00:15:30.100
Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:40.700
Look at all those
dragons!

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.233
Yuya summoned
four of them on his first turn!

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.466
Finally, as a parting gift,

00:15:51.466 --> 00:15:54.200
Performapal Card Canard
lets me draw one card

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.900
before
my turn ends.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.433
You're up, Declan!

00:15:57.433 --> 00:15:59.366
You may have summoned

00:15:59.366 --> 00:16:02.506
the four most powerful
dragons in every dimension,

00:16:02.506 --> 00:16:05.740
but that power means nothing
if you haven't mastered it.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.440
So let's see if
that power is for real...

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.840
or if you're nothing
more than a fake!

00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:16.473
Now watch as I use my Scale
One D/D Savant Copernicus

00:16:16.473 --> 00:16:19.240
and my Scale Ten
D/D Savant Newton

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.540
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.906
I can now summon monsters
from Level Two through Nine

00:16:27.906 --> 00:16:30.073
at the same time!

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:33.473
Your skills have improved
since our first duel, Yuya,

00:16:33.473 --> 00:16:35.406
but mine have evolved
even more.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.240
I Pendulum Summon...

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.406
bringing forth
a trio of monsters!

00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:47.540
Behold the three fearsome
immortals

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.506
who can command
the obedience of all!

00:16:50.506 --> 00:16:53.540
My trio of D/D/D
Doom King Armageddons!

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.006
Oh man,
not those again!

00:16:58.006 --> 00:16:59.573
Those three monsters

00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:01.713
put Yuya through the wringer
in their first battle!

00:17:01.713 --> 00:17:04.280
Yeah, and my pants
are no longer dry!

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.346
You can stop
sharing now.

00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:08.580
To begin, my first
Doom King

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.480
will attack your
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:17:12.313 --> 00:17:14.180
After all that work,

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.513
Yuya's already gonna
lose his dragon!

00:17:16.513 --> 00:17:17.746
Come on, let's move!

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:18.946
Hurry!

00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:22.280
I activate
the Action Spell Evasion

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.113
to slip through your
attack!

00:17:24.113 --> 00:17:26.413
But you won't elude
a second attack!

00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:29.180
Doom King number two
will take out Clear Wing!

00:17:29.846 --> 00:17:30.846
Really?

00:17:30.846 --> 00:17:32.246
Ya think?

00:17:37.913 --> 00:17:38.946
(gasping)

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.646
You're 0 for two
so far, Declan.

00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:44.446
Just before your attack hit,

00:17:44.446 --> 00:17:46.313
I activated
the Action Spell Miracle

00:17:46.313 --> 00:17:47.980
to save Clear Wing!

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.080
I won't let up!

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.980
My third Doom King,

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.480
strike down Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.646
I activate High Dive!

00:18:00.486 --> 00:18:02.720
It increases
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon's

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.353
attack points by 1,000!

00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:10.086
Making my monster
stronger than yours!

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.153
Whoa!

00:18:16.153 --> 00:18:17.853
He's beating Declan!

00:18:17.853 --> 00:18:19.386
Gong sure does
like that!

00:18:19.386 --> 00:18:20.986
Gong's feeing happier

00:18:20.986 --> 00:18:22.620
than when Gong's petting
a mile high pile of otters!

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.553
Thanks a ton,
you guys!

00:18:25.553 --> 00:18:26.953
You were awesome!

00:18:26.953 --> 00:18:28.220
You too, pal!

00:18:29.986 --> 00:18:31.053
Yeah.

00:18:31.053 --> 00:18:33.253
That was a blast.

00:18:33.253 --> 00:18:35.386
Our teamwork
is totally on point!

00:18:35.386 --> 00:18:36.720
(roaring)

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.753
Sorry!

00:18:38.753 --> 00:18:41.186
Of course you're pretty
awesome too, Odd‐Eyes!

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.320
(Yuya)
Whoa!

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.486
I'm really
talking with my dragons!

00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:48.653
Like, for real for real!

00:18:48.653 --> 00:18:51.153
I bet this is
how it was with Zarc.

00:18:51.153 --> 00:18:54.153
Well, before he went
super destruct‐o.

00:18:54.153 --> 00:18:56.120
He and his
monsters worked together

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.653
so that they could entertain
the crowd.

00:18:58.653 --> 00:19:01.626
But then the crowd
shouted for him to go further.

00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:04.593
They wanted him to pump up
the thrills and intensity.

00:19:04.593 --> 00:19:06.926
It's only when they wanted
more brutality

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:08.426
that Zarc lost his way.

00:19:08.426 --> 00:19:09.993
But that's because
he wanted to give them

00:19:09.993 --> 00:19:11.426
what they were
asking for.

00:19:11.426 --> 00:19:13.060
He wanted to entertain them.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.260
He just went about it
all wrong.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.660
And now all that's left of
Zarc is the evil within Riley.

00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:21.160
(whimpering)

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.360
(Henrietta)
Riley, why are you crying?

00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:26.426
When Zarc
first started dueling

00:19:26.426 --> 00:19:28.660
he didn't want to
hurt anyone.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.426
He just wanted
to make people happy.

00:19:31.426 --> 00:19:34.326
But instead of spreading joy,
he spread suffering.

00:19:34.326 --> 00:19:36.526
So I'm gonna
entertain these fans,

00:19:36.526 --> 00:19:38.326
but I'll do it
the right way!

00:19:38.326 --> 00:19:40.426
You haven't been
able to prove it yet!

00:19:40.426 --> 00:19:41.426
I'm trying!

00:19:43.393 --> 00:19:44.693
Well, I'll make you
try harder, Yuya!

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.826
And I'll start with this!

00:19:47.826 --> 00:19:50.326
The spell Dark Contract
With The Insurance!

00:19:50.326 --> 00:19:51.593
For every dragon that

00:19:51.593 --> 00:19:53.426
I failed
to destroy this turn,

00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:55.960
I'm allowed to
draw one card!

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.060
Impressive, right?

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.933
He just pulled off
a triple draw!

00:19:59.933 --> 00:20:01.733
By replenishing my hand,

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:03.766
countless more strategic
opportunities

00:20:03.766 --> 00:20:05.400
are available to me!

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.866
I activate
D/D/D Fusion

00:20:07.866 --> 00:20:09.566
and fuse it together
with one of my

00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:11.633
D/D/D Doom King Armageddons!

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.533
I Fusion Summon!

00:20:16.533 --> 00:20:21.233
Unite to form D/D/D Super Doom
King Purple Armageddon!

00:20:21.233 --> 00:20:22.666
(roaring)

00:20:24.433 --> 00:20:27.966
Next I activate the spell card
D/D/D Synchro.

00:20:27.966 --> 00:20:29.733
It turns into
a Tuner Monster

00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:31.166
that I can tune with

00:20:31.166 --> 00:20:32.633
my second
Doom King Armageddon!

00:20:35.466 --> 00:20:37.566
I Synchro Summon!

00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:40.233
D/D/D Super Doom King
Bright Armageddon!

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.900
And calling on the strength
of the Xyz Dimension,

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.933
I activate D/D/D Xyz

00:20:49.933 --> 00:20:51.666
to summon two
Doom King Armageddons

00:20:51.666 --> 00:20:53.233
from my Extra Deck

00:20:53.233 --> 00:20:55.300
and use them to build
the Overlay Network!

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.473
I Xyz Summon!

00:21:02.473 --> 00:21:03.840
You're completely
unprepared

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.473
to face the gloom of

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:09.306
D/D/D Super
Doom King Dark Armageddon!

00:21:09.306 --> 00:21:12.140
I activate Dark Armageddon's
special ability

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.840
to attach
Doom King Armageddon

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.206
as an Overlay Unit!

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.806
You couldn't beat my
Doom Kings before.

00:21:29.806 --> 00:21:31.373
What chance
do you have now

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.806
that they've evolved into
Super Doom Kings?

00:21:33.806 --> 00:21:36.206
Your time in
this duel is over.
