WEBVTT

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:04.866
(Yuya)
Previously on Yu‐Gi‐Oh Arc‐V!

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.366
How 'bout I tell you
all about

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.233
those evil jerks
from Duel Academy.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:12.733
They came out of nowhere,
and destroyed everything.

00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.300
They turned everyone
into cards.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.766
And that's why
Kite's so angry...

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.366
You said...
Your name is Sakaki?

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.033
Huh?
Yeah.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:25.433
Wait so... then are you
related to Yusho Sakaki?

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:26.433
You know my dad?

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:27.900
But of course...

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.966
After all, Yusho Sakaki
was our teacher.

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.766
(woman)
You're gonna be
a great duelist!

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.166
(man)
We believe in you!

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.433
Guess all these kids
are heading off to Duel School.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.133
But why by boat?

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.600
'Cause they're going to
Duel Academy.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.700
Then that must mean...

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.133
I'm in the Fusion Dimension!

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.500
If they catch me,
they'll send me to Duel Academy

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.466
and right into
the Professor's hands.

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.700
C'mon‐‐ open!

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.566
Now just come along with us!

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.800
Stop!

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.833
If you want to duel....

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:00.940
You'll duel me!

00:01:03.973 --> 00:01:06.406
The girl on the Professor's
Ten Most Wanted List!

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:07.606
We better be careful!

00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:09.006
(all)
Let's duel!

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.440
(Alexis)
Let 'em have it,
CYBER ANGEL VRASH!

00:01:12.373 --> 00:01:13.906
(screaming)

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.140
(grunting)

00:01:19.173 --> 00:01:20.940
Welcome to our duel school.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.540
The You Show
Duel School.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.773
And here's our dean...

00:01:24.773 --> 00:01:26.273

Mister Sakaki.

00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:42.446
Aren't you... Zuzu?

00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:43.880
I can't believe it.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.913
It's really you.

00:02:45.913 --> 00:02:47.546
You're all right.

00:02:47.546 --> 00:02:49.680
(sobbing)

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.513
You're all right!

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:54.580
We've been
so worried about you!

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.880
Yuya and Yoko...

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.846
My dad, too.
(sobbing)

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:01.420
Oh, Zuzu...
Please don't cry.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.620
Remember what I taught you:

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.253
Cheers, not tears.

00:03:04.253 --> 00:03:06.053
(sobbing slows)

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.220
You've been gone so long.
Where have you been?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.386
Now that's a tale
longer than a dragon's tail.

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:17.386
I was bouncing through
dimensions, one to the next...

00:03:17.386 --> 00:03:20.220
Like the Xyz Dimension!?

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.386
Ah, it seems you know more
than I thought you did.

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:25.420
Yes, I did end up there.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.586
In fact, that's where
I ended up first.

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.386
Then why are you here now?

00:03:30.386 --> 00:03:32.753
Well....

00:03:32.753 --> 00:03:34.886
Now that's another story.

00:03:34.886 --> 00:03:36.820
Or should I say,
another boy...

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.286
Late, late, late, late, LATE!

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:41.586
The Xyz Phase
of the ARC Area Project

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:43.786
is currently 3 days,
18 hours

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:46.753
and 43 minutes behind schedule!

00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:49.853
Gah! Make that 44 minutes!

00:03:49.853 --> 00:03:52.020
The Professor
is going to be furious

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.853
and he'll take his fury out
on me!

00:03:53.853 --> 00:03:56.820
He ordered us to carry out
his plans without pause,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.753
you slackers,
and that's just what we'll do.

00:03:58.753 --> 00:04:00.926
Do it, do it, do it!

00:04:00.926 --> 00:04:02.893
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Huh!

00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:05.726
I'm known for my
100% efficiency rating,

00:04:05.726 --> 00:04:08.593
and that's a reputation
I will not relinquish.

00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:09.793
I'm only behind schedule

00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:12.460
because my head enforcer
is slacking off again‐‐

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.360
where is he?

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.093
♪♪♪

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.493
You can't elude me forever...

00:04:28.493 --> 00:04:30.593
and when I do find you...

00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:33.326
you'll pay most dearly.

00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:35.993
♪♪♪

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:39.426
He's wrong!
I don't believe it!

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:42.460
My dad never abandons anyone
in trouble‐‐ never!

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.026
Not even a cat stuck in a tree!

00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:46.160
If he had to leave,
he had his reason.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.893
I just wish I knew what it was,
and where he went.

00:04:50.893 --> 00:04:52.993
You agree with me,
right, Yuto?

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:55.326
You met my dad.

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:56.493
Actually, I did not.

00:04:56.493 --> 00:04:58.293
You must have.

00:04:58.293 --> 00:05:00.293
Remember what you said...

00:05:00.293 --> 00:05:02.700
Use your power...

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.933
to keep the world
entertained and smiling.

00:05:05.933 --> 00:05:08.966
My father used to say that..

00:05:08.966 --> 00:05:11.266
I don't know why
you're lying to me, Yuto.

00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:13.666
Yuya, I'm not lying.

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:15.966
It was something Lulu said‐‐

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.500
before Duel Academy came
and took her away.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.400
(people shouting)

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.733
(growling)

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:29.300
(Lulu)
This is wrong‐‐
teacher always said

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.333
dueling's about keeping the
world entertained and smiling.

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:34.366
It should make people happy...

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:37.366
bring smiles to kids' faces
and hope for their futures.

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:39.166
Isn't that right, Saya?!

00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:43.700
(Yuto, VO)
It must have been
hard on Saya too,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.033
because she was
your dad's number one fan.

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.566
She took personal lessons
and everything.

00:05:48.566 --> 00:05:50.033
So when he disappeared

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:52.533
right when everyone
needed him the most...

00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:53.666
it really hit home.

00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:55.266
I get it...

00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:57.866
no wonder everyone's
so upset with him.

00:05:57.866 --> 00:05:58.033
Yeah.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.740
All that's left are the memories
of better times.

00:06:04.973 --> 00:06:07.706
Hey Yuto, have you noticed that
talking to you

00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:11.106
has gotten easier
since I got to this dimension?

00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:12.540
Yes, but it started earlier‐‐

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.806
back in
the Synchro Dimension.

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:15.506
When we were with
Yugo and Yuri.

00:06:15.506 --> 00:06:19.273
When the four of us got
together, things got so crazy.

00:06:19.273 --> 00:06:20.773
I couldn't think straight,

00:06:20.773 --> 00:06:22.673
and our dragons
started acting up

00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:24.873
like nothing I've ever
seen before,

00:06:24.873 --> 00:06:27.206
like they were
calling to each other.

00:06:27.206 --> 00:06:30.840
I didn't know if I should be
scared, excited, or worried.

00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:35.640
I felt the same way,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.173
like I was myself but I wasn't
really in control of myself.

00:06:38.173 --> 00:06:40.073
Know what I mean?

00:06:40.073 --> 00:06:42.706
Yeah, I do know what you mean
because I felt the same way‐‐

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:44.606
and what I felt
was not good.

00:06:44.606 --> 00:06:48.040
Yuto, I'm glad I have someone
to talk to about all this,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.873
instead of having to
dwell on it all on my own.

00:06:52.173 --> 00:06:53.573
Hey, I wonder if‐‐

00:06:53.573 --> 00:06:55.406
(Aster)
Well what do we
have here?

00:06:58.806 --> 00:07:02.546
Oh... hey there.
I'm looking for my dad.

00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:03.513
(yelping)

00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:05.580
Well maybe I can help you.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.280
I'm kinda of an expert on
hunting people down.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.813
What's his name?

00:07:14.213 --> 00:07:17.880
Oh... hey there.
I'm looking for my dad.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.780
(yelping)

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.513
Well maybe I can help you.

00:07:22.513 --> 00:07:26.080
I'm kinda of an expert
on hunting people down.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.013
What's his name?

00:07:29.013 --> 00:07:30.313
Who... are you?

00:07:30.313 --> 00:07:32.046
His name!?

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.646
Well, uh,

00:07:34.646 --> 00:07:37.313
my father's name
is Yusho Sakaki and‐‐
Yusho!?

00:07:37.313 --> 00:07:39.813
Yusho Sakaki.

00:07:39.813 --> 00:07:43.380
You are the son of...
Yusho Sakaki!?

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.380
You know him too?

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.580
I guess he really was
a hero 'round here.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.113
Hero?

00:07:49.113 --> 00:07:51.346
More like a zero!

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:55.046
Huh?
You would know that already
wouldn't you?

00:07:55.046 --> 00:08:00.853
But what you don't know
is that you just made my day.

00:08:00.853 --> 00:08:03.253
Yusho won't hesitate
to come out of hiding

00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:04.820
if I use his own kid as bait.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.920
That Duel Disk is‐‐
It's Duel Academy's!

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.286
Why do you have
a beef with my dad?

00:08:10.286 --> 00:08:12.086
He's friends
with everybody.

00:08:12.086 --> 00:08:13.886
Not with me.

00:08:13.886 --> 00:08:16.186
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding.

00:08:16.186 --> 00:08:18.753
There isn't!
Now let's battle!

00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:26.286
(computer)
Generating Action Field
CROSSOVER.

00:08:30.453 --> 00:08:32.086
I don't know who you are,

00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:34.286
but I never back down
from a challenge!

00:08:34.286 --> 00:08:35.720
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.786
I'm making the first move!

00:08:37.786 --> 00:08:40.686
But it's nothing compared to
the moves this guy's got!

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.986
Show 'em...
PERFORMAPAL FLIP HIPPO!

00:08:46.353 --> 00:08:48.120
A PERFORMAPAL, huh?

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.753
That's right and I got plenty
more pals where that came from!

00:08:51.753 --> 00:08:54.253
Check it out!
PERFORMAPAL HIP HIPPO!

00:08:54.253 --> 00:08:55.486
Hop to it!

00:08:58.953 --> 00:09:01.726
And because of
FLIP HIPPO's special ability,

00:09:01.726 --> 00:09:03.660
these two get flipped into
defense mode.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.926
And now, I place one card
facedown and end my turn!

00:09:10.126 --> 00:09:13.293
Now... let's see what
you're made of.

00:09:13.293 --> 00:09:15.026
You must
be careful, Yuya.

00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:18.560
I sense that he's unlike any
duelist we've faced so far.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.560
I know.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.626
But, Yuto, maybe I can get
some info out of him.

00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:26.526
And if I do,
maybe I'll find my dad.

00:09:26.526 --> 00:09:30.893
So you're dueltaining
just like your dad, huh?

00:09:30.893 --> 00:09:34.460
Well, I'll show you the same
thing I showed him‐‐

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.893
that dueltaining
only leads to defeat!

00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:40.660
I summon
DESTINY HERO DRILLDARK!

00:09:43.393 --> 00:09:45.426
(drill whirring)

00:09:46.893 --> 00:09:48.893
But I'm not stopping there!

00:09:48.893 --> 00:09:51.726
I'm activating the spell
D‐PRESSURE!

00:09:51.726 --> 00:09:53.693
It lets me summon
a second DRILLDARK.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.633
(drill whirring)

00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:06.733
When my DRILLDARKS attack

00:10:06.733 --> 00:10:08.666
they can bore right through
your defenses

00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:11.100
and drill away
at your life points!

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.666
Piercing Peril!

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:14.633
(grunting)

00:10:23.233 --> 00:10:25.166
(grunting and screaming)

00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:32.633
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.733
(grunting)
Yuya... are you all right?!

00:10:37.733 --> 00:10:39.833
For him this isn't a duel,
it's a vendetta!

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.233
But that won't stop me
from dueltaining.

00:10:43.233 --> 00:10:45.066
Because that's
the only way to teach him

00:10:45.066 --> 00:10:46.833
that dueling should
only be for fun!

00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:53.233
I activate the spell card
SMILE WORLD!

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:56.233
SMILE WORLD?

00:10:56.233 --> 00:10:58.300
All monsters gain
100 attack points

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.400
for every monster
on the field.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.640
You don't need to tell me
what this card does.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.940
I know it well‐‐
too well.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.873
We'll see about that,
'cause I'm activating the trap

00:11:07.873 --> 00:11:09.873
SMILE POTION!

00:11:09.873 --> 00:11:11.706
And it'll have me
grinning from ear to ear,

00:11:11.706 --> 00:11:13.506
'cause I can draw
two new cards!

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.040
This'll flip that smile
upside down.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.606
Go D‐FUSION!

00:11:17.606 --> 00:11:19.606
It's a fun little trap card

00:11:19.606 --> 00:11:21.973
'cause I can use it
during your turn.

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:25.440
Now, by sending my
two DRILLDARKS
to the graveyard...

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.173
I can Fusion Summon!

00:11:28.173 --> 00:11:31.506
(Yuto)
Brace yourself, Yuya!

00:11:31.506 --> 00:11:34.040
I'm using the thrill
of the drill

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.040
to unearth a mighty new menace!

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.940
I Fusion Summon!

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.806
DESTINY HERO DYSTOPIA!

00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:48.106
(growling)

00:11:49.706 --> 00:11:52.706
And I'm putting its power
to use right away!

00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:54.906
So your life points are about
to get drilled

00:11:54.906 --> 00:11:57.773
by the attack points
of one of my DRILLDARKS.

00:11:57.773 --> 00:11:59.780
Pummeling Palm!

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.946
(screaming)

00:12:03.946 --> 00:12:06.246
(grunting)

00:12:08.713 --> 00:12:10.213
You've seen
what he's like.

00:12:10.213 --> 00:12:11.913
He duels to destroy Yuya.

00:12:12.813 --> 00:12:14.480
I can...
change him.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.146
Duel Academy's
the worst of the worst.

00:12:17.146 --> 00:12:19.046
You can't reason
with those jerks.

00:12:19.046 --> 00:12:20.946
Maybe you're right,
but maybe I can.

00:12:20.946 --> 00:12:22.580
(gasping)

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.780
Just because something is hard
doesn't mean you give you up.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.213
(grunting)

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:27.746
You just try even harder.

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:31.380
Besides, he might have a clue
to where my dad is.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.246
He might be your only lead,
but look at him.

00:12:34.246 --> 00:12:36.413
He's not gonna
give up that info.

00:12:36.413 --> 00:12:38.546
Your dueltaining isn't gonna
magically turn him

00:12:38.546 --> 00:12:40.513
into your best friend.

00:12:40.513 --> 00:12:43.213
Your dad couldn't do it.
What makes you think you can?

00:12:43.213 --> 00:12:45.380
Let's get real.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.980
Yeah, we'll bring peace and
smiles to all the dimensions‐‐

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.080
but that's after we eliminate
everyone from Duel Academy,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.513
starting with him!

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.546
Face it Yuya,
there's no getting through

00:12:57.546 --> 00:12:59.480
to this agent of Duel Academy.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.820
If you're not ready to make
the hard decisions, then I will!

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.786
But Yuto...
(pulsing and grunting)

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:08.153
Ahh!

00:13:08.153 --> 00:13:12.486
(Yuto)
I set the Pendulum Scale with
Scale Three PERFORMAPAL SEAL EEL

00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:15.386
and Scale Five
PERFORMAPAL CHANGERAFFE.

00:13:15.386 --> 00:13:18.820
I'm taking control of this duel
starting now!

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.786
Now I can summon Level Four
monsters all at the same time!

00:13:23.786 --> 00:13:25.753
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:13:25.753 --> 00:13:28.653
Carve the arc of victory!

00:13:28.653 --> 00:13:33.186
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:13:35.286 --> 00:13:37.053
Pendulum!

00:13:37.053 --> 00:13:39.886
I Pendulum Summon
SKEETER SKIMMER and...

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:41.453
PERFORMAPAL HELPPRINCESS!

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.520
So this
is Pendulum Summoning!

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.220
I activate SEAL EEL's
Pendulum ability!

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.220
It negates
DYSTOPIA's special ability,

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.553
and I regain 1600 life points.

00:13:58.486 --> 00:14:01.160
I overlay my SKEETER SKIMMER
and HELPPRINCESS

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.193
to build the Overlay Network!

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.493
Cloaked in shadows
and relentless in its objective.

00:14:09.493 --> 00:14:12.626
I call upon the most dangerous
of DRAGONS!

00:14:12.626 --> 00:14:15.093
I Xyz Summon!

00:14:15.093 --> 00:14:17.393
DARK REBELLION XYZ DRAGON!

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.093
I activate DARK REBELLION XYZ
DRAGON's special ability!

00:14:26.093 --> 00:14:28.126
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:14:28.126 --> 00:14:31.026
the attack points of DYSTOPIA
are cut in half!

00:14:31.026 --> 00:14:34.693
Then DARK REBELLION XYZ DRAGON
gains those attack points.

00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:36.360
Treason Discharge!

00:14:40.026 --> 00:14:41.693
I had the upper hand,

00:14:41.693 --> 00:14:43.893
but now he's got
the advantage.

00:14:43.893 --> 00:14:45.460
I'm not done!

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.960
I'm using my other Overlay Unit
to do it again!

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.393
Treason Discharge!

00:14:52.293 --> 00:14:54.826
(growling)

00:14:54.826 --> 00:14:56.826
Time to attack!

00:14:56.826 --> 00:15:00.033
DARK REBELLION XYZ DRAGON,
take out DYSTOPIA!

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:01.866
Mauling Mandible Charge!

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.866
Don't think so!

00:15:04.866 --> 00:15:07.666
My trap card D‐FUSION
protects DYSTOPIA

00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:09.333
from destruction this turn.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.333
But you still take damage!

00:15:14.766 --> 00:15:16.300
(grunting)

00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:20.566
And now, I'll end my turn.

00:15:20.566 --> 00:15:22.233
And by ending my turn,

00:15:22.233 --> 00:15:24.233
my monster's special abilities
conclude as well.

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:31.600
(pulsing and gasping)

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.333
(grunting)

00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.400
Heh, nice hit.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.366
I didn't think
you could Xyz Summon,

00:15:39.366 --> 00:15:41.400
being from a different dimension
after all.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.133
But you won't
catch me off guard again!

00:15:44.133 --> 00:15:46.366
My turn!
I draw!

00:15:46.366 --> 00:15:50.200
DYSTOPIA attack
DARK REBELLION XYZ DRAGON!

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.300
Dystopian Destruction!

00:15:53.566 --> 00:15:55.333
(growling)

00:15:59.773 --> 00:16:02.506
(grunting)

00:16:02.506 --> 00:16:05.873
I activate PERFORMAPAL
CHANGERAFFE's Pendulum ability!

00:16:05.873 --> 00:16:07.406
In exchange for itself,

00:16:07.406 --> 00:16:10.373
I can get back
my DARK REBELLION XYZ DRAGON!

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:16.540
I guess seeing me destroy it
once wasn't enough for you.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.940
But I'll be more than happy
to oblige.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.640
First, by banishing
a DESTINY HERO
from my graveyard...

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.040
I can activate D‐DOOM DANCE!

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.440
Now DARK REBELLION XYZ DRAGON

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.806
loses attack points
equal to DRILLDARK'S.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.306
And it gets worse‐‐
much worse!

00:16:39.306 --> 00:16:43.873
My DESTINY HERO can attack
DARK REBELLION XYZ DRAGON twice!

00:16:43.873 --> 00:16:46.906
DESTINY HERO DYSTOPIA, attack!

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:49.806
Dystopian Destruction!

00:16:49.806 --> 00:16:51.473
Oh yeah?
So what!

00:16:51.473 --> 00:16:54.040
Thanks to CHANGERAFFE,
DARK REBELLION XYZ DRAGON

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.073
can't be destroyed this turn!

00:16:56.073 --> 00:16:58.073
But you'll still
take damage!

00:16:58.673 --> 00:17:00.213
Ahh!

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.913
I activate the spell
D‐FACEOFF and end my turn.

00:17:07.913 --> 00:17:10.846
So if you keep using
Xyz Monsters,

00:17:10.846 --> 00:17:12.646
I'll keep
delivering the pain.

00:17:12.646 --> 00:17:14.946
(grunting)

00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:17.446
Because at the end of our turns,

00:17:17.446 --> 00:17:20.913
D‐FACEOFF compares the total
Level of our monsters,

00:17:20.913 --> 00:17:22.880
and if my total is higher,

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.246
one DESTINY HERO
gains attack points

00:17:25.246 --> 00:17:29.246
equal to one hundred times
the difference in their Levels.

00:17:29.246 --> 00:17:32.246
Since Xyz Monsters
don't have Levels...

00:17:32.246 --> 00:17:34.946
Summoning them puts us
at a disadvantage.

00:17:34.946 --> 00:17:37.980
I've got the upper hand now!

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.246
Since DYSTOPIA is Level 8

00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:43.880
and your DARK REBELLION
XYZ DRAGON has no Level,

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.980
DYSTOPIA gains
800 attack points.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.580
Now I activate DYSTOPIA's
special ability!

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.180
When its attack points change,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.913
it destroys one card
on the field!

00:17:56.913 --> 00:17:59.146
So say goodbye
to that slithering,

00:17:59.146 --> 00:18:01.153
blithering PERFORMAPAL
SEAL EEL!

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.453
Without SEAL EEL,

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:10.820
you can't negate DYSTOPIA's
special abilities anymore!

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.220
And the pain
doesn't stop there!

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.986
Since DYSTOPIA gained
800 attack points,

00:18:15.986 --> 00:18:18.886
D‐FACEOFF deals you
800 points of damage!

00:18:21.253 --> 00:18:24.153
I activate the Action Spell
ACCELERATION!

00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:26.753
And accelerate myself
out of danger!

00:18:26.753 --> 00:18:29.220
What?

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:33.153
You may have escaped again,
but it's only a matter of time!

00:18:33.153 --> 00:18:35.520
Because D‐FACEOFF
will deal you damage

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.620
at the end of every turn until
you run out of life points.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.120
I bet this is how he
defeated all my friends...

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.953
slowly whittling down their life
points to prolong their torture.

00:18:46.953 --> 00:18:49.186
Yuto...!
Going to your dimension

00:18:49.186 --> 00:18:51.986
was the biggest mistake
I ever made, Yuya.

00:18:51.986 --> 00:18:54.853
If I'd stayed here
in Heartland City,

00:18:54.853 --> 00:18:57.486
I could've saved everyone.

00:18:57.486 --> 00:18:58.853
It's my fault!

00:18:58.853 --> 00:19:01.460
Yuto!
That's not true!

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.826
(pulsing and grunting)

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.360
(Yuto)
Payback time.

00:19:12.793 --> 00:19:14.093
(Yuto)
Payback time.

00:19:17.493 --> 00:19:19.026
I'm activating...

00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:23.226
THE PHANTOM KNIGHTS' RANK‐UP
MAGIC LAUNCH!

00:19:23.226 --> 00:19:26.760
I use this
and DARK REBELLION XYZ DRAGON

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.626
to Xyz Summon a monster
one Rank higher!

00:19:31.026 --> 00:19:33.726
Dragon from the bleak,
black pit!

00:19:33.726 --> 00:19:36.793
Fierce, fearless,
ferocious fighter!

00:19:36.793 --> 00:19:39.326
Rise and master the skies!

00:19:39.326 --> 00:19:42.093
Go Rank‐Up Xyz Evolution!

00:19:43.226 --> 00:19:47.093
Arise, DARK REQUIEM XYZ DRAGON!

00:19:50.126 --> 00:19:52.793
Now, by using one Overlay Unit,

00:19:52.793 --> 00:19:54.960
DARK REQUIEM XYZ DRAGON

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.793
absorbs all of your DYSTOPIA's
attack points!

00:19:57.793 --> 00:20:00.366
Requiem Retribution!

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:03.033
♪♪♪

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.566
(growling)

00:20:13.266 --> 00:20:14.733
You fool!

00:20:14.733 --> 00:20:16.833
When DYSTOPIA's
attack points change,

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:20.200
its special ability activates,
and destroys your DRAGON!

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.966
I use a second Overlay Unit
to activate

00:20:22.966 --> 00:20:26.300
DARK REQUIEM XYZ DRAGON's
other special ability!

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.133
Not only do I get to summon
DARK REBELLION XYZ DRAGON
from my graveyard,

00:20:30.133 --> 00:20:34.000
but DYSTOPIA's special ability
is also no more!

00:20:37.633 --> 00:20:39.400
I can't believe it!

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.500
This is unprecedented!

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.033
You'll pay!

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:43.966
No I won't!

00:20:43.966 --> 00:20:47.000
DARK REQUIEM XYZ DRAGON,
attack DYSTOPIA!

00:21:02.673 --> 00:21:05.273
Finish him!

00:21:05.273 --> 00:21:06.973
Dark Destruction!

00:21:13.173 --> 00:21:14.773
This won't help!

00:21:17.206 --> 00:21:19.106
But this will!

00:21:19.106 --> 00:21:22.706
I send DESTINY HERO ‐ DYNATAG
from my hand to the graveyard

00:21:22.706 --> 00:21:25.140
to activate its special ability.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.240
Since I have fewer life points
than you,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.106
I don't take damage
from your attack.

00:21:29.106 --> 00:21:32.573
Instead, we both take
1000 points of damage!

00:21:32.573 --> 00:21:33.940
No!

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.306
(grunting)

00:21:38.306 --> 00:21:40.206
Ahh!

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.440
(tires screeching)

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.340
(soldier)
This way!

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.106
(soldier 2)
Commander Phoenix,
are you okay?

00:21:53.106 --> 00:21:54.973
(Yuya, VO)
Commander Phoenix?

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.973
(soldier)
Hurry!
(soldier 3)
Commander, you all right?

00:21:58.973 --> 00:22:01.913
Do you need help,
Commander Phoenix?

00:22:01.913 --> 00:22:02.913
(Zuzu)
Who was he?

00:22:02.913 --> 00:22:04.546
(Yusho)
Aster Phoenix,

00:22:04.546 --> 00:22:07.380
leader of Duel Academy's
invasion squadron.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.713
He sent me here.

00:22:08.713 --> 00:22:10.846
He's one of the most exceptional

00:22:10.846 --> 00:22:13.646
and terrifying duelists
I've ever faced.
