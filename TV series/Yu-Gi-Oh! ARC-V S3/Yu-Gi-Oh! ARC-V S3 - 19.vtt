WEBVTT

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.300
(Yuya)
Previously
on Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V!

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.366
(Yugo)
I don't what's gotten into Rin,

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.900
but tossing me out a window
and dissing our runner,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.433
that's a whole new
level of mad.

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:14.166
(Doctor chuckles)

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.233
Once my Fusion Parasite
worms its way to the brain,

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:18.900
it attaches
and thoroughly dissects

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.633
every memory of its host.

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:23.000
I programmed the parasite
so that she would pledge

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.266
her eternal loyalty
to you, Professor.

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.133
I hacked
my father's computer

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.566
to investigate
his experiments

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.000
in the Arc Area Project

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.866
and found a folder labeled
"Revival Zero."

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.666
The folder contained
two files.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.466
If he has a file on Yuri,

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.033
then, Yuya, Revival Zero

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:42.200
must have something
to do with you too.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.000
In fact, all versions
of you, Yuya.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.100
And all versions of Zuzu.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.200
So, Lancers, let's rescue
those four girls!

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.400
(Rin)
Fusion Parasite equips
itself on to Crystal Bell.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.300
I bet it's that
Fusion Parasite

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.233
that's doing
a whack job on her!

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:03.240
The old Rin
would never use
that slippery slug.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.973
She hates bugs!

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:07.640
Crystal Bell's special
ability activates

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.973
to deal you
500 points of damage

00:01:09.973 --> 00:01:11.873
which will wipe out
all of your life points!

00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:13.273
No, wait!

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.806
Whoa!

00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:18.806
(grunting softly)

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:21.506
Celina!

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:24.940
You're supposed
to be on my side!

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.540
Get real!
Oh!

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.906
I'm working
for the Professor now.

(Sanders)
<i>Sir, I have news!</i>

00:02:35.213 --> 00:02:37.113
<i>We located</i>
<i>the enemy forces.</i>

00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:39.646
<i>Yuya and his squad</i>
<i>of scrubs are beachside.</i>

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:41.646
Understood.

00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:44.313
Proceed according
to plan, Sergeant.

00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:47.446
And make sure
you bring Yuya Sakaki
to me in one piece.

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:49.846
<i>It will be done.</i>
<i>Sanders, out!</i>

00:02:56.413 --> 00:03:00.780
(Sylvio groaning)

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.520
Gong, any chance
for a hair more help here?

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.586
Sylvio,
your size eights

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:09.220
are startin'
to irritate!

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.953
Ugh! Whew!

00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:16.020
Think we could find
a harder way up next time?

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.520
What do you mean
a harder way?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.520
That climb was
a piece o' cake!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520
(Sora)
Duel Academy!

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.120
Now stick close.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.120
You don't want to get lost
in there.

00:03:29.953 --> 00:03:32.053
(students)
Duel Academy for life!

00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:34.020
Duel Academy for life!

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.353
Cadets, you are
the elite students

00:03:36.353 --> 00:03:38.153
of this year's
graduating class.

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:41.053
But I want to know
which of you is
the elite of the elite.

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:43.120
And today's the day
to prove it!

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.953
Now listen up!

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:47.886
A team of enemy combatants
known as the Lancers

00:03:47.886 --> 00:03:50.520
have invaded our school.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.620
Their objective
is to destroy us!

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.286
Your objective
is to stop them.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:59.720
Because believe you me,
none of you will graduate

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.660
if you fail
to stop the Lancers!

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.393
Is that understood?!

00:04:03.393 --> 00:04:05.060
(all)
Yes, sir!

00:04:08.626 --> 00:04:10.993
Every goon posted
on this rock

00:04:10.993 --> 00:04:13.093
must know that
we're here by now.

00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:14.793
So where are they?

00:04:14.793 --> 00:04:17.760
Those wimps must've heard
that I was on the way.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.060
They'd rather hightail it
out of here

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.726
instead of scrap
with the king of combat.

00:04:22.726 --> 00:04:24.060
Nah, I doubt it.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.193
Huh?

00:04:25.193 --> 00:04:26.526
I sense company.

00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:28.526
On guard, guys!

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:37.426
Perfect timing!

00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:39.126
I was itching for a duel.

00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:41.493
Well, these guys are here
to scratch it.

00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:42.793
Let's run 'em
off the road!

00:04:42.793 --> 00:04:44.893
Yeah!
Huh!

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.560
(Yuya)
Time to roll into action!

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.093
You guys shoulda
steered clear!

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:57.293
Now you see me,
now you don't!

00:04:57.293 --> 00:04:58.293
Let's move, Sora.

00:04:58.293 --> 00:04:59.160
This way!

00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:05.366
(Sora)
Thanks for
the distraction, guys.

00:05:05.366 --> 00:05:07.000
After them!
Stop!

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.600
The only ones stopping
is youse lot.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.500
Thanks to the skills
of yours truly
leading the way.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.633
(both)
You ready to rumble?

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:19.266
Don't worry about us.

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:21.633
We can handle this bunch
of buffoons on our own.

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:24.333
Now you three scoot along
and we'll rendezvous later.

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:27.433
Will do.
Good luck, guys.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:29.600
So, are you guys
ready for some action?

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.266
Gong was born ready.

00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:33.233
It's party time, gents!

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.533
(all)
Let's duel!

00:05:35.533 --> 00:05:38.433
(student)
Commander, part of the enemy
force has broken away

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:40.000
and is heading this way!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.666
I vow to stop them sir,
just give me the go ahead.

00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:44.566
No need.
(students gasp)

00:05:44.566 --> 00:05:46.933
It's already taken care of.

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:48.733
This lot, however,
will serve perfectly

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:50.833
for your final exam.

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:54.066
The enemy force
consists of
five duelists.

00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:57.066
What would be
the optimal battle
strategy to defeat them?

00:05:57.066 --> 00:06:00.533
I'll launch
our troops at 'em,
every last one of 'em.

00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:02.940
I would pick them
all off one at a time.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.773
No, picking off
the strongest duelist
first is the way to go.

00:06:06.773 --> 00:06:08.873
You lousy louses
are all wrong!

00:06:08.873 --> 00:06:10.873
You haven't learned a thing!

00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:14.073
(all)
Sir! Pardon our stupidity!

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:16.073
Wise up, people.

00:06:16.073 --> 00:06:19.206
If you want to learn
the proper way to
foil your enemies,

00:06:19.206 --> 00:06:20.673
then watch closely.

00:06:20.673 --> 00:06:23.873
(students)
Yes, sir!

00:06:23.873 --> 00:06:25.373
Take this!

00:06:25.373 --> 00:06:27.806
Superheavy Samurai
Big Benkei...

00:06:27.806 --> 00:06:30.040
go on and send them hounds
back to their pounds!

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.940
(roaring)

00:06:40.106 --> 00:06:41.606
All righty, Raikiri,

00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:43.840
cut down those
pooches pronto.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.606
(roaring)

00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:51.940
(Yuya)
Odd‐Eyes, give those mutts
something to howl about!

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.440
Blast!

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.513
Hey, what about
me, guys?

00:07:01.513 --> 00:07:03.380
I want a shot at those
mangy mongrels!

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.480
(Gong)
Let's move!

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.446
Somebody put
a leash on them!

00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:08.480
I will not allow them
to escape.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.080
I will do
everything in my power

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.246
to put a stop to the enemy.

00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:17.613
Stay back!
I am sensing a trap!

00:07:17.613 --> 00:07:18.413
(student)
Too late!

00:07:18.413 --> 00:07:21.846
(student)
Gotcha!

00:07:21.846 --> 00:07:24.346
Just great!

00:07:24.346 --> 00:07:26.980
Rats!
We've been played.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.613
Yes, they were only
pretending to retreat,

00:07:30.613 --> 00:07:33.313
and we fell for their ruse
like a pack of amateurs.

00:07:33.313 --> 00:07:34.480
I am ashamed!

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:45.146
(student) <i>Mission</i>
<i>accomplished, sir!</i>

00:07:45.146 --> 00:07:47.913
<i>All five enemy combatants</i>
<i>have been captured!</i>

00:07:47.913 --> 00:07:50.046
Good job, cadets.

00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:53.780
(applause)

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.313
I said "good" job,
not excellent job.

00:07:57.313 --> 00:07:58.780
(students whimper)

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.153
I need five volunteers now!

00:08:01.153 --> 00:08:03.553
Come on!
Step up, who's in?

00:08:03.553 --> 00:08:05.153
(students)
Sir!
Well, looky here.

00:08:05.153 --> 00:08:07.620
These five have more guts
than the rest of you combined!

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.753
You scaredy cats
think about that

00:08:09.753 --> 00:08:11.220
as you turn on
your night lights

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.986
when get tucked in tonight.

00:08:12.986 --> 00:08:16.220
You five will now be sent
onto the battlefield

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.886
to face our five prisoners.

00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:22.553
Let me emphasize this is
not a training exercise.

00:08:22.553 --> 00:08:24.953
It is a duel to the finish!

00:08:24.953 --> 00:08:26.386
This is war!

00:08:26.386 --> 00:08:28.253
The best trainers
have forged you

00:08:28.253 --> 00:08:30.653
into the most fearsome
warriors ever known.

00:08:30.653 --> 00:08:33.686
Use what you have learned
to crush your foes!

00:08:33.686 --> 00:08:37.120
Your trainers expect nothing
less than total victory!

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.453
Duel Academy for life!

00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:42.086
(all)
Sir, Duel Academy for life!

00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:44.086
(Sanders)
Today marks the ultimate test

00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:45.453
of my training program.

00:08:45.453 --> 00:08:48.286
I've produced
the ultimate warrior

00:08:48.286 --> 00:08:50.420
and now I'll watch it
in action.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.220
(Yuya)
Whoa!

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.553
(Gong)
What is this?

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.553
This here's Duel Academy's
training ground.

00:08:59.553 --> 00:09:02.326
It has given rise to our
greatest duel warriors!

00:09:02.326 --> 00:09:04.526
You must be proud.

00:09:04.526 --> 00:09:05.926
The whole point
of dueling

00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:08.926
is to make people happy,
not make war!

00:09:08.926 --> 00:09:12.660
(Sanders)
Ha! Well, what's coming next
will make me very happy,

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.360
but I can't say
the same for you!

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.326
Just what are you up to?

00:09:16.326 --> 00:09:17.660
Yeah, spill it,
private!

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.860
Or get ready to be
court‐martialed!

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.660
If you really want those
to be your last words,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.860
that can 100% be arranged!

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.060
(all gasp)

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.393
You five Lancer losers

00:09:29.393 --> 00:09:31.593
will face off against
five of my elite

00:09:31.593 --> 00:09:34.493
in a no‐holds‐barred
Survival Duel

00:09:34.493 --> 00:09:37.260
until one of you
is left standing!

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.226
Just wait a second here.

00:09:39.226 --> 00:09:41.526
We didn't agree
to do anything.

00:09:41.526 --> 00:09:43.426
(Sanders)
This ain't no democracy!

00:09:43.426 --> 00:09:45.926
What I say goes!

00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:48.760
So the losers
are gonna be
turned into cards?

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.393
Exactly.

00:09:50.393 --> 00:09:53.026
Tough lessons to
toughen up my troops.

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:54.760
(all)
Huh?!

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.293
(Sanders)
That's right!

00:09:56.293 --> 00:09:57.360
Now, you soldiers,
listen up!

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.393
Duel Academy wants more

00:09:59.393 --> 00:10:00.600
than students
with perfect grades!

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.166
It wants focused fighters

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:04.400
who will stop at nothing
to win!

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.900
One great warrior
will achieve glory!

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.000
You others will fall
in defeat!

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.733
Duel Academy for life!

00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:14.033
(students)
Sir! Duel Academy for life!

00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:16.866
Now, warriors, get set!

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:21.266
I activate the field spell
Predaprimal Jungle!

00:10:22.933 --> 00:10:24.666
(all)
Oh! Huh?

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.600
(computer)
Generating Action
Field: Crossover.

00:10:31.166 --> 00:10:33.833
It's on!
Good luck, maggots!

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.366
You'll need it!

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.500
Well, we're
in for it now.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.300
We gotta battle
Duel Academy's
best in this jungle.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.566
And if we lose,
we're getting
turned into cards.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.966
Gong prefers to be
three‐dimensional,

00:10:51.966 --> 00:10:53.200
thank you very much.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.200
Yeah, me too, Gong.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.733
We'll figure something out,

00:10:56.733 --> 00:10:58.866
because, well,
we have no other choice.

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:01.040
Easy for you to say.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.440
But it'd be easier
if we never got caught
in the first place.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.306
(Theo)
Time to get those Lancers.

00:11:07.306 --> 00:11:10.773
(Emma)
That's only if I don't
get them all myself.

00:11:10.773 --> 00:11:12.573
(all grunt)

00:11:12.573 --> 00:11:15.540
Move it out now!

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.240
(Crow)
We gotta face
the facts, Yuya.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.073
If we wanna be able
to rescue Zuzu,

00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:23.573
then our first priority

00:11:23.573 --> 00:11:25.373
has to be making it
out of this jungle‐‐

00:11:25.373 --> 00:11:25.806
(all)
Huh?

00:11:25.806 --> 00:11:27.640
Hey, hold on!

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.440
I will survey
our enemy's maneuvers.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.740
I will be back soon.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.206
Moon Shadow, wait!

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.573
(Moon Shadow)
If I had been more alert,

00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:41.440
our team would have
avoided capture.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.873
The only way
to restore my honor

00:11:42.873 --> 00:11:44.506
is to defeat
our enemies,

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:47.640
which I shall do alone
so the others can go free.

00:11:54.106 --> 00:11:57.040
(Sanders)
So it begins!

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.873
An actual battle
is playing out

00:11:58.873 --> 00:12:01.480
in real time before our eyes.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.380
Any miscalculation or failure
will prove catastrophic.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.680
Remember all you see today
and learn from it!

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.246
(all)
Sir!

00:12:13.213 --> 00:12:14.680
They are tracking me,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.180
like a predator
shadowing its prey,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:23.380
but this prey bites back!

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.913
Hey, Lancer!

00:12:24.913 --> 00:12:28.246
Come on out!
Huh?

00:12:30.746 --> 00:12:34.846
Ahh, ahh, ahh!

00:12:34.846 --> 00:12:36.280
Whoa.
Gulp.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.380
That didn't
sound good.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.313
I hope it wasn't
Moon Shadow.

00:12:38.313 --> 00:12:38.980
Come on!

00:12:40.646 --> 00:12:43.346
Sounds like one of us
captured a Lancer already.

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:46.646
Already?
I got work to do.

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:48.713
Me too.

00:12:48.713 --> 00:12:50.713
Moon Shadow!

00:12:50.713 --> 00:12:52.913
I hope... he's okay.

00:12:52.913 --> 00:12:54.246
(Gong)
Hey, Yuya!

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.113
Wha‐‐ No way!

00:12:59.113 --> 00:13:01.286
(Crow)
That's one of
Duel Academy's cadets!

00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:02.886
(Sylvio)
You think Moon
Shadow did this?

00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:04.186
(Yuya)
Impossible!

00:13:04.186 --> 00:13:05.920
He can't turn people
into cards.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.120
(Gong)
Yuya's right.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.486
Which means this guy
was done in

00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:09.520
by someone
on his own team.

00:13:10.186 --> 00:13:11.453
Who's there!?

00:13:11.453 --> 00:13:14.020
Aah!
There's our culprit now!

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.653
I betcha he's
seen Moon Shadow!

00:13:15.653 --> 00:13:17.786
Hey! Wait up!

00:13:17.786 --> 00:13:19.653
We gotta stick
together, Yuya.

00:13:19.653 --> 00:13:20.653
(buzzer)

00:13:22.286 --> 00:13:24.320
(Sanders)
One of my team.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.186
How absolutely pathetic.

00:13:28.986 --> 00:13:30.720
Hey, the system said
it lost a signal.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.586
That can't be right.

00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:34.720
There hasn't even been
a single duel yet!

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.353
Must be a glitch.

00:13:36.353 --> 00:13:38.653
Yeah, there's still ten dots,

00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:40.286
so no one's gone down yet.

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:42.786
It must be a glitch.

00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:45.320
(Sanders)
Yes, ten dots.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.720
But this is no glitch.

00:13:53.753 --> 00:13:55.920
Hey, what's wrong?

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.820
Theo, we're only gonna
duel each other
at the end, right?

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.126
Of course.

00:14:01.126 --> 00:14:03.593
Our priority is
to beat the Lancers.

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.160
Oh, sweet,
I think I lost them.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.926
You lost them?

00:14:07.926 --> 00:14:11.160
You mean, you ran away
instead of fighting them?

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.093
Hey, I didn't
have any choice!

00:14:13.093 --> 00:14:15.493
It was four
against one.

00:14:15.493 --> 00:14:17.060
And they already
got one of us.

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:22.160
Where did that rat run to?

00:14:23.826 --> 00:14:25.193
Must be playing
hide and seek.

00:14:26.793 --> 00:14:29.160
Hey, Sylvio!

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.326
Where are you?

00:14:31.326 --> 00:14:34.593
Sylvio? Crow?

00:14:34.593 --> 00:14:36.326
You there?

00:14:36.326 --> 00:14:38.126
Runnin' off
was a bad idea.

00:14:39.993 --> 00:14:41.593
(Theo)
So... Burns already
checked out.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.293
Eh, he was weak anyway.

00:14:45.293 --> 00:14:47.226
What a loser!

00:14:47.226 --> 00:14:49.860
Four on one, five on one,
bring it all on!

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.726
They still wouldn't
have beaten me.

00:14:51.726 --> 00:14:54.226
Easy for you to say.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.726
You‐‐ you weren't there.

00:14:56.726 --> 00:14:58.760
You didn't see
what it was like.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.300
When he was turned
into a card,
I just lost it.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.566
I just had to
get outta there.

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:06.100
The duel just started

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.066
and you already
lost your nerve.

00:15:08.066 --> 00:15:10.866
You can sit there
and talk like some loser,

00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:13.133
but I'm taking down
some Lancers.

00:15:13.133 --> 00:15:14.533
Oh! Who's a loser?

00:15:14.533 --> 00:15:16.600
Yo, wait up!

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.633
Well, that cadet can run,

00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:21.233
but he can't hide from me.

00:15:21.233 --> 00:15:23.900
Sooner or later
I'll find you!

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.966
Your five senses
are no match for my ten!

00:15:26.966 --> 00:15:28.566
I can hear
and see everything!

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.600
Oh! Except maybe that!

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.400
Right about now,
I'm sensing I should run!

00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:41.600
All right, I might be

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.700
more used to
a concrete jungle

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.333
than this green leafy kind,

00:15:45.333 --> 00:15:47.866
but no matter what
this place throws at me,

00:15:47.866 --> 00:15:49.533
I'll be ready for it.

00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:52.266
Ah! Dirty sneak!

00:15:52.266 --> 00:15:53.700
Who hit me in the back
and ran?

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.100
Huh?

00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:00.073
Moon Shadow?!

00:16:00.073 --> 00:16:04.106
Where are... those Lancers?

00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:06.373
There they are.

00:16:06.373 --> 00:16:10.673
Huh... but who?

00:16:10.673 --> 00:16:13.340
Unh!

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.973
Uhh!

00:16:15.973 --> 00:16:17.273
Ah!

00:16:17.273 --> 00:16:19.673
This cadet from
the shadows fights well.

00:16:19.673 --> 00:16:21.973
His skills are unlike
any I have ever faced.

00:16:21.973 --> 00:16:23.406
But that matters not!

00:16:23.406 --> 00:16:25.673
Nichirin, attack!

00:16:29.806 --> 00:16:32.540
Success? Oh!

00:16:39.673 --> 00:16:40.973
Unh.

00:16:40.973 --> 00:16:42.706
To win, I must attack,

00:16:42.706 --> 00:16:44.473
but to survive,
I must defend!

00:16:44.473 --> 00:16:47.240
(Theo laughing)

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.173
Finally found you, Lancer.

00:16:50.173 --> 00:16:53.840
(computer)
Intrusion penalty:
2,000 life points.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.873
Great, another one.

00:16:55.873 --> 00:16:59.840
(roars)
Ahh!

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.480
Did the tides
of friendship turn?

00:17:07.946 --> 00:17:10.280
Where did he go?

00:17:14.813 --> 00:17:17.613
(roars)
Ah!

00:17:17.613 --> 00:17:19.513
(buzzer)

00:17:19.513 --> 00:17:20.880
Did you see that?

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.546
Theo's signal
just disappeared.

00:17:22.546 --> 00:17:23.913
How's that possible?

00:17:23.913 --> 00:17:25.613
He didn't even
start his duel yet.

00:17:25.613 --> 00:17:27.246
Must be just
another bug.

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.580
What if it's
not a bug?

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.046
What if something else

00:17:31.046 --> 00:17:33.613
is taking them each
down one by one?

00:17:33.613 --> 00:17:35.280
Seriously?

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.946
Yeah, just look
at the numbers.

00:17:36.946 --> 00:17:38.480
They aren't
adding up.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.280
You sleep through math
class or somethin'?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.380
Ah! Unh!

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.313
(breathing heavily)

00:17:50.313 --> 00:17:53.246
Yaah!

00:17:53.246 --> 00:17:57.880
I won't go down
without a fight

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.180
(Moon Shadow yells)

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.586
Did you hear that?
Moon Shadow!

00:18:01.586 --> 00:18:03.586
Hmm.
That way!

00:18:03.586 --> 00:18:05.586
Whoa!

00:18:05.586 --> 00:18:07.620
I don't like
the looks of that.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.320
Gong neither.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.220
Let's go!

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.486
(Yuya)
Moon Shadow!

00:18:18.486 --> 00:18:21.253
I can't believe it!

00:18:21.253 --> 00:18:23.286
Man, how could
this happen?

00:18:23.286 --> 00:18:25.986
He was the most skillful
duelist Gong ever knew.

00:18:25.986 --> 00:18:27.720
He's gone.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.053
Moon Shadow is
really gone.

00:18:31.053 --> 00:18:34.620
The other card is one of
the cadets we're battlin'.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.753
Do you really think they could
be turning against each other

00:18:36.753 --> 00:18:38.020
this early in the duel?

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.453
(sniffles)

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:42.353
Nah, I think
it's someone else.

00:18:42.353 --> 00:18:46.820
Why's that? Hmm?

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.686
Because Moon Shadow
left us a clue.

00:18:49.686 --> 00:18:52.053
If it's a clue,
Gong's clueless.

00:18:52.053 --> 00:18:55.253
Well, it says
ten plus one here.

00:18:55.253 --> 00:18:57.953
And the ten
must be referring
to us ten duelists.

00:18:57.953 --> 00:18:59.720
And I bet
the plus one means

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.826
there must be
someone else

00:19:00.826 --> 00:19:02.460
here in this
jungle with us.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.260
It makes sense.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.293
The extra duelist
is lurkin' around

00:19:06.293 --> 00:19:08.293
pickin' everybody
else off.

00:19:08.293 --> 00:19:11.360
That's gotta be what
Moon Shadow wanted
to warn us about.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.726
This rogue duelist is
taking us down one by one,

00:19:14.726 --> 00:19:16.826
whether it's Lancer
or cadet.

00:19:16.826 --> 00:19:19.093
Gong thinks we'd
be safer as a group.

00:19:19.093 --> 00:19:20.460
Yeah.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.960
Our first
piece of business

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.060
is to track down
Sylvio and Crow.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.260
If we stay split up
like this, we're
all toast.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.593
(Ethan)
Stay where you are!

00:19:29.593 --> 00:19:33.360
I'm warning you!
Take that!

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.160
Ahh!
Grr!

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.293
Ah! Oh!

00:19:37.293 --> 00:19:40.326
(Ethan screams)

00:19:40.326 --> 00:19:41.726
Huh!

00:19:41.726 --> 00:19:44.393
What's everybody...
screaming about!?

00:19:44.393 --> 00:19:46.093
No one's dueled me yet

00:19:46.093 --> 00:19:49.493
so what's everyone
so scared of?

00:19:49.493 --> 00:19:50.793
Grr!

00:19:50.793 --> 00:19:53.826
Who's out there?

00:19:57.293 --> 00:19:58.660
Quit hiding!

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.200
Come on out and fight!

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.900
Don't just gawk at me
with those gleamy eyes!

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.166
You're not the first to admire
my greatness from afar,

00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:07.700
but enough already!

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.633
Shed the shyness
and leave those leaves!

00:20:10.633 --> 00:20:13.233
(Sylvio screams)
Huh? I think that's Sylvio!

00:20:13.233 --> 00:20:14.766
Just great.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.733
(Yugo)
Rin, don't go.

00:20:22.733 --> 00:20:25.566
Duel Academy...
are a bunch of losers.

00:20:25.566 --> 00:20:26.900
(footsteps approach)
Huh?

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.966
You know, we're
not all losers.

00:20:29.966 --> 00:20:33.433
Uh, does that mean...
you're with Duel Academy?

00:20:33.433 --> 00:20:35.133
Relax, pal.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.000
The name's Aster Phoenix.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.233
I'm pals with Yuya.
You know him, right?

00:20:39.233 --> 00:20:40.600
Wait, Yuya?

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.400
Are you sayin'
that he's here?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.866
I don't know,
but if you know Yuya,

00:20:44.866 --> 00:20:47.033
then you must be the guy
I'm looking for.

00:20:47.033 --> 00:20:49.266
Your name's Yugo, right?

00:20:49.266 --> 00:20:51.033
Did you have any luck
finding that girl named‐‐

00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:52.833
What was it, Gin? Min?

00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:56.666
Rin, the name's Rin,
and, yeah, I found her.

00:20:56.666 --> 00:20:58.766
Except, it wasn't
really her.

00:21:01.706 --> 00:21:04.206
Rin had totally changed.

00:21:04.206 --> 00:21:07.373
She's not the same person
that I used to know.

00:21:07.373 --> 00:21:11.840
That's because she's
being... mind controlled.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.306
And she isn't the only one.

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:16.506
Shay's sister, Lulu too.

00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:18.506
Shay thinks he can
save her, but...

00:21:18.506 --> 00:21:20.540
You saw firsthand.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.873
It's hopeless.

00:21:24.873 --> 00:21:28.406
I heard the Professor's
right‐hand man
is behind this,

00:21:28.406 --> 00:21:31.006
so if we can track him down,
then we can find out

00:21:31.006 --> 00:21:33.040
how he's controlling them
and maybe how to cure them.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.240
I know how
he's doing it!

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.906
What?

00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:38.306
He's using some kind
of bug parasite

00:21:38.306 --> 00:21:39.673
to control their minds!

00:21:39.673 --> 00:21:42.040
I saw it with
my own eyes, Aster.

00:21:46.606 --> 00:21:48.473
We have to
destroy that thing,

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:52.306
or Rin will never
be free.

00:21:52.306 --> 00:21:54.240
But how can we do that?

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.706
I don't know if we can
even find her.
