WEBVTT

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.033
A nice hot lunch.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:08.933
"Stick to your ribs" food.

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.133
(chuckles)

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.933
Listen, Kite, no matter
what you do,

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.066
no matter what you've done,

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.866
you're still our friend and we
never leave a friend behind.

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.700
Never!

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.566
When I left this dimension I was
a loner like you, Kite.

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.566
But my travels taught me that
the greatest strength

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.500
you can have is true friends!

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.066
Oh!

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:30.966
Hey, are you okay, Saya?

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.066
(thinking)
Shay risked everything,

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.066
even his own life to save a
friend... unlike me.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.266
I didn't even try because I was
so scared.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.466
But that's gonna change!
Starting now!

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.066
By doing what even Shay
couldn't do...

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.666
bring Kite back home to us!

Find Saya?
Nothing.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.240
I don't know where she could
have gone.

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:01.413
Slow down there!

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:02.980
Get out of my way!

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.280
Not a chance, Alan.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.346
Together we can find Saya
faster.

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:08.180
So far, you're just
slowing me down!

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.613
Huh?

00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:11.413
Listen, Yuya,
when the going got tough,

00:02:11.413 --> 00:02:13.780
your dear old dad
got up and went...

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.013
and I'm betting the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

00:02:16.013 --> 00:02:17.446
I'm outta here.

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:18.913
Move it, sunflower!

00:02:18.913 --> 00:02:20.080
Watch it, bub!

00:02:23.446 --> 00:02:26.080
Alan still thinks my dad
abandoned everybody,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.980
and I don't know if I'll ever
change his mind.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.013
There's no time for
a pity party.

00:02:30.013 --> 00:02:33.880
We need to move out and find
Saya before trouble finds her.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.013
Sylvio, Gong!

00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:37.680
You check the factory!

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.313
Move it!

00:02:39.313 --> 00:02:41.013
Ever heard of
the word "please"?

00:02:41.013 --> 00:02:42.646
And who put you in charge
anyway?

00:02:42.646 --> 00:02:45.413
Yuya and I will
check the mall.

00:02:45.413 --> 00:02:47.680
Let's go track down
those rugrats.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.846
Sure thing, Shay.

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:55.646
My, oh, my.

00:02:55.646 --> 00:02:58.146
Do my eyes spy a Lancer, Grace?

00:02:58.146 --> 00:03:00.680
(Grace) And, like, she's all
by herself, Gloria.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.686
I've heard these Lancers
were brave,

00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:04.520
but they're not very smart

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.586
We just arrived and we've
already hit the jackpot.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.153
Yeah.
Yeah...

00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:11.186
Before we make our way to
headquarters,

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:13.620
what do you say we
bring a welcoming present
along with us...

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.053
in the form of a gift card?

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:17.220
Saya!

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.786
Alan?

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.920
You go, I'll handle these
giraffes!

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.686
How sweet. Her boyfriend's
got some spunk.

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:26.253
Spunk, yes.

00:03:26.253 --> 00:03:27.986
But the intellect is clearly
lacking.

00:03:27.986 --> 00:03:31.153
Know what's dumb?
Pickin' a fight with me!

00:03:31.153 --> 00:03:32.886
Saya, get the goin' in gear!

00:03:32.886 --> 00:03:34.353
And... leave you?

00:03:34.353 --> 00:03:36.486
I said go, Saya!

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:38.053
Too bad.

00:03:38.053 --> 00:03:39.986
My days of running are over!

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.420
It's too dangerous!

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.253
I say let her stay.

00:03:43.253 --> 00:03:45.453
You're, like, gonna need all the
help you can get.

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:46.686
Don't ya think, Gloria?

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:48.386
I do.

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:50.386
How about a tag‐team‐palooza?

00:03:50.386 --> 00:03:52.386
And we'll make it so that
each tag team

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:55.020
will share their fields,
life points and graveyards.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.553
That's fine with me!

00:03:56.553 --> 00:03:58.520
Why you gotta be so stubborn?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.320
Because there's a time
to fight and a time to run,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.993
and I'm never running again!

00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:04.693
Alan, until now,

00:04:04.693 --> 00:04:07.460
you always stood in front
of me to protect me.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.226
When I should've always been
standing next to you

00:04:10.226 --> 00:04:12.293
so that we can fight together.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:21.926
Then what are you waiting for?

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:24.593
Well, now that you two love
birds have reconciled...

00:04:24.593 --> 00:04:25.993
nothing!

00:04:28.026 --> 00:04:29.793
All right, this should be fun.

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:33.293
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:37.659
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.326
I'll start this off!

00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:41.093
And for my first move...

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:43.260
I'm summoning Ruffian Railcar!

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.360
Here comes the pain train,
ladies,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.993
'cause if I don't attack with
Ruffian Railcar,

00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:52.526
I can deal 500 points of damage
instead.

00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:59.560
Dealing damage on the first
turn? Very nice.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.500
I do like the way he's
conducting himself.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.466
Thanks!

00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:06.333
That boo‐boo from my choo‐choo
is just the beginning.

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:08.433
There's lots more just around
the bend.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.266
Heh, cute.

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:13.633
You carry on and play with your
little train set, little boy,

00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:15.933
while I demonstrate that us
ladies

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:17.833
are not to be trifled with!

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:21.266
Since there's an Amazoness card
in my hand...

00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:24.900
I can automatically summon
Amazoness Spy!

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.766
I tribute Amazoness Spy in order
to summon....

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:33.566
... Amazoness Queen!

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.200
Hyah!

00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:41.366
Now, my Queen,
slash his Railcar

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:43.900
and send it back to
the workshop for repairs!

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:47.166
No way!

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:49.800
I'm allowed to summon
Construction Train Signal Red

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.033
and your Queen's attack
detours to it!

00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:55.133
(sirens wailing)

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:58.933
No matter, one train
is as good as another.

00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:00.366
That's what you think!

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:02.373
Signal Red can't be destroyed
in battle!

00:06:02.373 --> 00:06:04.906
This little Lancer thinks
he's going to win.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.073
Yeah, so adorbs.

00:06:07.073 --> 00:06:08.840
But why hasn't he done that
Pendulum Summoning thing yet?

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.673
Good point.

00:06:10.673 --> 00:06:13.040
If he has any desire of
putting up a challenge,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.773
that little brat
better do it soon.

00:06:14.773 --> 00:06:16.173
See?

00:06:16.173 --> 00:06:18.473
They're quaking in their
duel disks.

00:06:18.473 --> 00:06:21.773
I softened them up for you, so
you can deal the finishing blow!

00:06:21.773 --> 00:06:23.573
Remember, that in
this tag duel,

00:06:23.573 --> 00:06:26.506
you're allowed to use my
monsters if you need 'em, Saya.

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:28.073
Right!
Thanks!

00:06:28.073 --> 00:06:31.040
Okay, now tenderize
those twins!

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.673
(thinking)
Easy for you to say.

00:06:32.673 --> 00:06:35.406
Amazoness Queen has
2,400 attack points.

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:39.240
This won't be easy,
but I know I can defeat her!

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.706
Now it's my turn!

00:06:41.706 --> 00:06:43.706
(thinking)
The spell card Fairy Dust?

00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:45.373
This is perfect!

00:06:45.373 --> 00:06:48.273
First, I summon Little Fairy!

00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:50.140
(laughing)

00:06:52.873 --> 00:06:55.740
And by sending one card in my
hand to the graveyard,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.140
she gains one Level.

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:03.013
This powder changes Signal Red
from a Machine

00:07:03.013 --> 00:07:06.546
into a Fairy and raises
its Level by 1!

00:07:10.146 --> 00:07:12.780
Now we've got two
Level 4 monsters!

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.580
I overlay Little Fairy and
Signal Red

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.546
to build the Overlay Network!

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.580
This next monster's got the
pompoms that pummel!

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.646
I Xyz Summon!

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:29.546
Fairy Cheer Girl!

00:07:32.446 --> 00:07:36.780
And since I used Fairy Dust to
change Signal Red into a Fairy,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.246
it gives Fairy Cheer Girl

00:07:38.246 --> 00:07:41.213
500 more attack points
to cheer about!

00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:42.946
Way to go!

00:07:42.946 --> 00:07:44.780
You're off to an awesome start,
Saya!

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.313
Um, like, whatever?

00:07:47.313 --> 00:07:50.146
So she now has the same attack
points as our Queen.

00:07:50.146 --> 00:07:54.080
All that rah, rah, rah for
something so blah, blah, blah.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.013
She didn't Pendulum Summon
either.

00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:58.246
How strange?

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:00.580
Maybe they, like, forgot?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.286
That would be most unfortunate,
for them.

00:08:04.286 --> 00:08:06.653
(thinking) Okay, I think my
plan's gonna work.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.253
Those two don't realize that
due to Fairy Dust,

00:08:09.253 --> 00:08:12.086
Fairy Cheer Girl can't be
destroyed in battle.

00:08:12.086 --> 00:08:14.586
So while my monsters
stays safe and sound,

00:08:14.586 --> 00:08:16.553
their Queen will be dethroned!

00:08:16.553 --> 00:08:18.153
It's on!

00:08:18.153 --> 00:08:22.820
Fairy Cheer Girl, attack
Amazoness Queen!

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.253
Do you think we'd let a little
girl destroy a Queen?

00:08:26.253 --> 00:08:28.686
Our Queen can't be destroyed
in battle either!

00:08:28.686 --> 00:08:29.020
(both gasp)

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.220
What a disappointment these
Lancers turned out to be.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.953
For realsies.

00:08:34.953 --> 00:08:37.020
Why would the Professor
waste our skills

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.153
on such, like,
embarrassing amateurs?

00:08:39.153 --> 00:08:40.886
It's like an insult to our
excellence.

00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:43.620
All that yapping's
giving me a headache!

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.086
Well, that's surprising.

00:08:45.086 --> 00:08:46.686
To get a headache,

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:49.086
I thought you had to
have something inside your head.

00:08:49.086 --> 00:08:51.020
And, like, speaking of brains,

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.953
your girlfriend
doesn't have one either.

00:08:53.953 --> 00:08:55.553
Like, did she really
believe that

00:08:55.553 --> 00:08:57.953
we had no idea what her cards
could do?

00:08:57.953 --> 00:09:00.020
Like, duhh!

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.560
Saya, don't listen
to her, okay?

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.560
Just tune her out
and make your move.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.560
Okay, gotcha.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.493
I'm gonna... place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:09:10.493 --> 00:09:12.093
What?
Are you crazy?

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.026
You're not supposed to
end your turn yet!

00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:17.326
You're supposed to use
Fairy Cheer Girl's

00:09:17.326 --> 00:09:19.126
special ability to
draw a card!

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:20.893
A card that could help us!

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.660
You might've thrown away
our only chance

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.926
to turn this duel around!

00:09:23.926 --> 00:09:25.426
I'm sorry.

00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:27.226
Hey, don't worry!

00:09:27.226 --> 00:09:29.693
When it's my turn, they'll be
the ones sorry!

00:09:29.693 --> 00:09:31.860
If there is a next turn.
Say what?

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.993
You talk big
for a little boy,

00:09:33.993 --> 00:09:36.260
and little boys need to be
taught a lesson

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.726
when they get
out of line.

00:09:38.726 --> 00:09:40.993
Or maybe he needs a timeout,
Grace.

00:09:40.993 --> 00:09:43.993
(sinister laugh)
Yes, a permanent time out.

00:09:43.993 --> 00:09:45.993
When you mess with
the Tyler sisters...

00:09:47.693 --> 00:09:50.160
(both)
You're gonna get slammed
with glam!

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.960
Oh, no.
Not the Tyler sisters!

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.500
The Tyler sisters.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.066
These two are bad news.

00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:07.300
I heard they wiped out the
entire Spade School

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.466
all by themselves.

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:09.600
That's awful.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.633
It's, like, my turn!

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:14.366
I activate the spell card...

00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:16.800
The Warrior Returning Alive.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.000
It lets me return
Amazoness Spy

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.200
from my graveyard
back to my hand.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.033
Now, I activate the spell card
Polymerization...

00:10:25.033 --> 00:10:27.466
to fuse my Amazoness Tiger...

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:29.833
and the sneaky Amazoness Spy.

00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:33.033
This is, like, totally gonna be
amazing,

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.366
but not for you two!

00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:37.500
I Fusion Summon!

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.333
Amazoness Pet Liger!

00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:42.566
(roaring)

00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:44.366
Feeding time!

00:10:44.366 --> 00:10:47.900
Okay, Amazoness Pet Liger,
pounce on Fairy Cheer Girl

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.900
and turn her
cheers to fears!

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.500
(roaring)

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.800
Fairy Dust's effect stops Fairy
Cheer Girl from being destroyed!

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.840
(Gloria)
But you still take damage!

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.706
And my Pet Liger's still got
some scratch left in it!

00:11:08.706 --> 00:11:12.940
So, like, say buh‐bye to 800 of
your Fairy's attack points.

00:11:17.406 --> 00:11:21.606
After the attack, Liger's attack
points return to normal.

00:11:21.606 --> 00:11:23.406
But my sister's far from
finished.

00:11:23.406 --> 00:11:25.040
Amazoness Queen...

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.173
give Fairy Cheer Girl
the royal treatment!

00:11:28.173 --> 00:11:30.673
Don't worry,
Fairy Cheer Girl!

00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:32.406
You still won't be destroyed!

00:11:32.406 --> 00:11:33.840
Leaving all the pain for you.

00:11:38.273 --> 00:11:42.806
Liger's special ability claws
out 800 attack points again!

00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:49.340
Hey, why don't you two stop
picking on her already?

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.606
Why? Because it's so utterly
enjoyable.

00:11:51.606 --> 00:11:53.873
Her dumb moves are boring us.

00:11:53.873 --> 00:11:55.940
We have to have some way to
entertain ourselves.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.740
So, you think it's fun
to pick on her?

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.613
Well, just wait
'til it's my turn,

00:12:00.613 --> 00:12:02.680
'cause payback's gonna be ten
times worse

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.113
than what you're
doing to Saya!

00:12:04.113 --> 00:12:06.180
You've got a big mouth
for a little boy.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.580
But it's easier to talk tough
that to fight tough.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.846
Now, let's get back to the fun.

00:12:11.846 --> 00:12:14.480
I activate the spell
Amazoness Magic Mirror.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.980
It totally reflects the damage
from your monster's

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.213
special abilities and, like,
sends it straight back to you!

00:12:20.213 --> 00:12:24.246
So we put your Ruffian Railcar's
special ability out of service.

00:12:24.246 --> 00:12:27.713
I think you're going to have a
hard time paying us back now,

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:29.880
aren't you, little boy?

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.280
Ugghh!

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.113
It's your move, pipsqueak,
not that it really matters.

00:12:36.113 --> 00:12:38.380
Alan...

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.546
I'm sorry.

00:12:40.546 --> 00:12:42.313
I'm sorry I let you down.

00:12:42.313 --> 00:12:43.813
Don't say that.

00:12:43.813 --> 00:12:47.546
I promised I wouldn't
run away again,

00:12:47.546 --> 00:12:51.946
that I'd face my fears head
on, but maybe I should've.

00:12:51.946 --> 00:12:54.246
Because I put you
in danger, too.

00:12:54.246 --> 00:12:56.180
Danger shmanger!

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.580
You're acting like we've already
lost this duel.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.553
But I'm only getting started.

00:13:00.553 --> 00:13:02.153
I summon...

00:13:02.153 --> 00:13:04.220
Express Train Trolley Olley!

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.720
(horn honking)

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.486
Ruffian Railcar can't use its
special abilities.

00:13:10.486 --> 00:13:13.020
So what?
You see me cryin'?

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.153
You think I'm gonna let little
thing like that stop me?

00:13:15.153 --> 00:13:17.020
No way!

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.720
I overlay Express Train Trolley
Olley and Ruffian Railcar

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.720
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.486
I Xyz Summon!

00:13:37.486 --> 00:13:41.020
Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf!

00:13:42.453 --> 00:13:44.186
And there's more.

00:13:44.186 --> 00:13:47.486
Since I used my Railcar to Xyz
Summon, it's special ability

00:13:47.486 --> 00:13:51.086
gives Ironwolf 800 more
attack points.

00:13:51.086 --> 00:13:54.453
It appears to me that that you
do have a brain after all,

00:13:54.453 --> 00:13:56.020
and you've used it to learn

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.853
a little technique
from the two of us.

00:13:57.853 --> 00:13:59.620
Like, when you attack,

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.893
you can't destroy our Queen
but can deal us damage

00:14:01.893 --> 00:14:04.793
It appears we aren't so
different now.

00:14:04.793 --> 00:14:07.260
I'm not anything like you!

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.760
I might duel to win,

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.360
but I'm not going to bully my
opponent around

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.260
like you two grannies do!

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.026
Careful, little boy.

00:14:15.026 --> 00:14:17.893
If you don't zip your lip, I'll
have to do it for you.

00:14:17.893 --> 00:14:19.826
Well, how's about I have my
monster

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:21.360
do all the talking, then.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.560
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.660
Ironwolf can attack you
directly.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.393
I ought to applaud you.

00:14:33.393 --> 00:14:36.626
That is an excellent way to deal
us maximum damage.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.160
I never expected
a big scheme like that

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.060
to come from such a
teeny weeny brain.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.226
There's only one
little problem.

00:14:43.226 --> 00:14:45.926
(both)
Your attack's got zilch of a
chance of reaching us.

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:47.760
What?

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.360
You're only allowed to attack
Amazoness Pet Liger.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.860
So this attack is negated.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.193
But, like, totally feel free
to attack our Liger.

00:14:56.193 --> 00:14:58.360
Amazoness Queen's
special ability's

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.700
gonna protect it from
going kaboom.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.300
You had a good plan.
Just not a great one.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.733
They can't be right!

00:15:05.733 --> 00:15:07.966
There's gotta be a way
to beat 'em.

00:15:07.966 --> 00:15:10.700
There's just gotta!

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:17.933
(gasps)
Alan!

00:15:17.933 --> 00:15:20.100
Don't make the same
mistake that I did!

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.666
Huh? Oh, yeah!

00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:24.533
Thanks for the reminder!

00:15:24.533 --> 00:15:26.400
I use Fairy Cheer Girl's
Overlay Unit

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.633
to activate her
special ability!

00:15:28.633 --> 00:15:29.933
Nice one!

00:15:29.933 --> 00:15:31.500
Now you're allowed to draw a
card!

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.066
Look out!

00:15:36.233 --> 00:15:39.400
Here I go!
I draw!

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.600
Uhh!

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.433
Yes!

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:49.066
Okay!

00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:50.833
Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf!

00:15:50.833 --> 00:15:54.666
Go full speed ahead and attack
Amazoness Pet Liger!

00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:56.666
I activate...

00:15:56.666 --> 00:15:58.533
Amazoness Substitution!

00:15:58.533 --> 00:16:01.473
So I get to summon
an Amazoness,

00:16:01.473 --> 00:16:04.540
and your attack switches over
to her instead.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.573
Come forth,
Amazoness Swords Woman!

00:16:09.573 --> 00:16:11.773
Think that butter knife
can stop this train?

00:16:11.773 --> 00:16:14.106
Well, you better think again!

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:18.540
Especially not after I activate
my spell Limiter Removal!

00:16:22.973 --> 00:16:25.140
Nice one!

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.006
(Alan)
Comin' through!

00:16:29.006 --> 00:16:33.240
Amazoness Swords Woman's special
ability will detour that move!

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.340
My opponent takes the damage
I would've taken!

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.206
Her opponent?
That's me!

00:16:39.206 --> 00:16:40.706
I won't let that happen!

00:16:40.706 --> 00:16:43.273
I activate Fairy Rail!

00:16:43.273 --> 00:16:44.773
By using two Overlay Units,

00:16:44.773 --> 00:16:46.740
Alan doesn't take any damage,

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.540
and Fairy Cheer Girl gains
those points instead!

00:16:53.673 --> 00:16:56.473
She's now stronger
than their Pet Liger!

00:16:56.473 --> 00:16:58.006
Oh, yeah!

00:16:58.006 --> 00:17:02.380
Fairy Cheer Girl, attack
Amazoness Pet Liger!

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.880
Amazoness Queen's
special ability

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.480
protects Liger from
destruction!

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.513
Yeah, but you two
still take damage!

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.180
(Saya)
After Fairy Cheer Girl attacks,

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.246
she automatically switches to
defense mode.

00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:22.046
And since Fairy Cheer Girl can't
be destroyed in battle,

00:17:22.046 --> 00:17:25.913
she can keep protecting our life
points forever and ever!

00:17:25.913 --> 00:17:29.880
We got this, we're gonna take
you down and walk away winners!

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.080
I knew you had it in you.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.246
Thanks, Alan.

00:17:34.246 --> 00:17:36.213
If it wasn't for you, I would
have crumbled.

00:17:36.213 --> 00:17:38.680
Thanks for believing in me.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.146
And showing me that nothing's
over 'tll it's over.

00:17:41.146 --> 00:17:43.180
You're the awesome‐est!

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.980
Thanks, Saya.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.180
What do you say we get back to
kicking some Amazon butt!

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.246
Now that my turn is over,

00:17:50.246 --> 00:17:53.046
Limiter Removal
destroys my monster.

00:17:53.046 --> 00:17:56.346
I guess that's the penalty for
revving its engines to hard.

00:17:56.346 --> 00:17:59.013
Well, good riddance.

00:17:59.013 --> 00:18:01.353
Yo, Glo,
can we just end this?

00:18:01.353 --> 00:18:03.086
My pleasure!

00:18:03.086 --> 00:18:05.720
I'll eliminate them
with the same monster

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.053
I used against
Spade School

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:12.886
I fuse Amazoness Queen and
Amazoness Swords Woman!

00:18:12.886 --> 00:18:14.986
I Fusion Summon!

00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:17.786
Amazoness Empress!

00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:18.420
Hyah!

00:18:20.086 --> 00:18:21.886
Here I go!

00:18:21.886 --> 00:18:25.486
Amazoness Pet Liger, attack
Fairy Cheer Girl!

00:18:25.486 --> 00:18:27.620
(roaring)
And like before,

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.853
Liger gets 500 extra attack
points when it attacks!

00:18:30.853 --> 00:18:32.986
I don't think so!

00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:35.120
Since Fairy Cheer Girl
is in defense mode,

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.620
we won't take damage!

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.486
That's what you think!

00:18:38.486 --> 00:18:41.120
Due to Amazoness Empress'
special ability,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.753
my Liger deals you damage

00:18:42.753 --> 00:18:45.353
even if your monster is in
defense mode.

00:18:45.353 --> 00:18:46.320
Blast away!

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.886
(roaring)

00:18:51.353 --> 00:18:52.620
Blast away!

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.420
(roaring)
Oh, no!

00:18:57.853 --> 00:18:59.826
(yelling)

00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:04.860
Now we'll shave away those last
remaining points!

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.660
You're finished!

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.626
Aah!

00:19:10.626 --> 00:19:12.360
(yelling)

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.126
(yelling in distance)

00:19:16.126 --> 00:19:17.526
Huh?
Did you just hear that?

00:19:17.526 --> 00:19:19.626
(moaning)

00:19:26.226 --> 00:19:30.626
So, like, are you ready to
make some gift cards, Sister?

00:19:30.626 --> 00:19:31.926
Yes, lets.

00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:34.360
Alan!
Saya!

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.993
Hey!
You responsible for this?

00:19:36.993 --> 00:19:39.226
Hands off our Lancers.

00:19:39.226 --> 00:19:42.093
There not Lancers,
we're Lancers!

00:19:42.093 --> 00:19:45.026
Ah, I knew it was too easy.

00:19:45.026 --> 00:19:46.426
Yeah, you're right.

00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:48.360
But isn't it, like,
totes so convenient

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.826
that the prey comes to us?

00:19:50.826 --> 00:19:53.326
(sinister laugh)

00:19:55.693 --> 00:19:58.826
Don't worry.
They'll be here.

00:19:58.826 --> 00:20:01.633
Keep calm, Noro.

00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:03.733
Aagghh!

00:20:03.733 --> 00:20:06.633
It's already 28 minutes
and 57 seconds

00:20:06.633 --> 00:20:08.333
past their scheduled
arrival!

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.633
Why aren't the Tyler sisters
here on time!?

00:20:10.633 --> 00:20:11.400
Sir!

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.900
I received word the Tyler
sisters are dueling the Lancers.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.833
They're what?!

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:18.533
Here.

00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:21.100
We tapped into the city's
surveillance system.

00:20:22.666 --> 00:20:24.466
Agghh!

00:20:24.466 --> 00:20:26.500
I'll inform Commander Phoenix
immediately.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.766
No, please don't!

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.433
(clears throat)
That won't be necessary.

00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:34.866
I asked the Professor to send
reinforcements

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:37.800
since Commander Phoenix,
in my humble opinion,

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.066
isn't getting the job done.

00:20:39.066 --> 00:20:40.733
We're behind schedule!

00:20:40.733 --> 00:20:42.700
He's too proud to ask for help.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.366
So I don't think the Commander
would appreciate this gesture,

00:20:45.366 --> 00:20:47.233
so keep this hush hush.

00:20:47.233 --> 00:20:48.600
Understood?

00:20:51.233 --> 00:20:53.166
Finish him!

00:20:53.166 --> 00:20:56.766
There's gotta be a reason
I couldn't beat that kid!

00:21:04.706 --> 00:21:07.906
Yuya Sakaki,

00:21:07.906 --> 00:21:11.206
we have business!
