WEBVTT

00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.666
(Yuya)
Previously
on <i>Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V...</i>

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:08.400
Who knew one little card
would cause such a reaction?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.700
(Yuya growls)

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.300
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.366
I Fusion Summon!

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:17.566
Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon!

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.833
(Yuya groaning)

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:21.533
His Dragon is
making Z‐ARC stronger!

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.000
I gotta hold him down,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.933
but I don't know
how long I can.

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:29.400
(laughing)
Get rid of that pest,
will you?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.200
(groaning)

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.933
I Xyz Summon...

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:37.933
Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.733
(Dragons roaring)

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:47.666
Aah!

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.466
It's incredible!

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.200
I can feel Z‐ARC trying
to take my soul...

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.833
like he did Yuto!

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:56.700
Gotta fight.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.733
I activate...
the trap card Dragonvine!

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:04.673
Your Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
is completely mine now!

00:01:07.173 --> 00:01:08.439
Ahh!

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.173
Thank you, Yuya!

00:01:10.173 --> 00:01:11.773
When I absorb you,

00:01:11.773 --> 00:01:14.140
we'll reunite as one!

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.773
(roaring)
Unh!

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:18.506
Don't give in!

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:20.973
(Technician)
Professor,
the Arc Five Reactor

00:01:20.973 --> 00:01:22.406
<i>is sufficiently charged!</i>

00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:26.806
<i>Transferring the</i>
<i>final girl.</i>

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:31.340
The unification
of the dimensions... begins.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.740
Nooo!

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.506

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.880
Yuya's just a little bit
further down this hallway.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.746
(both groan)

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.646
Huh?!

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:48.046
What's happening?

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:50.246
On second thought...

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:52.513
it might be
a lotta bit further.

00:02:52.513 --> 00:02:55.913
Shay!
Where are you?

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.346
What's happening?

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.520
What in this world
is happening?

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.753
Professor,
the Arc Five Reactor

00:03:04.753 --> 00:03:06.986
is fully operational.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.953
The four dimensions have
started the merging process.

00:03:08.953 --> 00:03:11.186
It's about time.

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:13.486
Soon the Reactor will unite

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:16.820
the Fusion, Synchro, Xyz,
and Standard Dimensions

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.620
back into one,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.953
a singular dimension
from where it all began.

00:03:20.953 --> 00:03:24.120
Everything that was once
lost to me will be born anew,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.653
including the apple of my eye,

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:29.453
my beloved daughter...
my Ray!

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.520
You don't know
how long I've missed you,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.186
how empty my heart has been
without you.

00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:40.486
But I will not allow Z‐ARC
to resurrect

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:43.553
and threaten
the world again.

00:03:43.553 --> 00:03:47.453
This time...
I will be prepared.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.720
Prepare the Isolation Dome
at once!

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.986
(Technician)
Yes, sir!

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.253
This is not good, Riley.

00:03:58.253 --> 00:04:00.486
Leo must have begun
to unify the dimensions.

00:04:00.486 --> 00:04:02.626
We don't have much time
left to stop him.

00:04:02.626 --> 00:04:03.460
Wha?!

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.360
You do know your chances
of beating me

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.893
were always slim to none.

00:04:08.893 --> 00:04:10.460
And guess what, Yuya?

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.660
Slim just left the building.
(laughing)

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.760
Well, that...
doesn't mean..

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.060
I'm giving up!

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.760
(Dragons roaring)

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.826
Unh! No! Z‐ARC!

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:29.560
You don't look so good.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.360
But then again, I was
always the handsome one.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.959
Worry not, all your
troubles will go away

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:36.493
when I absorb you
into me.

00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:40.226
And when I do,
your powers will be mine!

00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:42.426
This duel's as good
as done, Yuya.

00:04:42.426 --> 00:04:46.226
So let's cut to the chase
and reunite as one!

00:04:46.226 --> 00:04:48.260
No way... Never!

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.326
It is time...
to reunite...

00:04:51.326 --> 00:04:54.093
Reunite...
Reunite as one.

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:57.193
Yes, Yuya!
Reunite as one!

00:04:57.193 --> 00:04:59.193
(Yuto, Yugo and Yuri)
Reunite as one!

00:04:59.193 --> 00:05:01.166
Reunite as one!

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.400
Reunite as one!

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.633
Reunite... as one...

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:09.100
Yuya!
Aah!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.600
Now, now, Yuya,
you're way too old

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.166
to be throwing a temper
tantrum, aren't you?

00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:16.433
Now, let's not waste
any more time.

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:18.066
You can't resist
your destiny.

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:20.500
Don't listen
to him, Yuya!

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.100
Keep fighting!

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.900
For the sake
of all our dimensions,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.600
keep fighting!

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.333
But it's so... hard!

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:32.200
I know!
But keep fighting!

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.900
Never give up!
Just fight!

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.700
Like your father did
to the very end!

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.666
Never give up.

00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:43.866
Like my dad.

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:45.766
(Yuri laughs)

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:48.100
Yeah, keep fighting
like your pops!

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.533
All the good that did him.

00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:52.333
He ended up like his skills‐‐
two dimensional.

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:54.133
Don't speak bad
about my dad!

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:55.766
I'm not.

00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:57.533
So please don't be mad
just because

00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:59.966
I'm being honest
and speaking the truth.

00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:02.740
And the truth of the matter
is your father failed.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.906
Failed as you have.

00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:05.273
But don't worry.

00:06:05.273 --> 00:06:07.273
I'll use
your powers wisely...

00:06:07.273 --> 00:06:09.940
once I absorb
your essence into me.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.740
Reunite as one.
Reunite as one.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.806
Reunite as one.
Reunite as one.

00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:18.940
And I'll be the one...
to rule you all!

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.073
Unh!
Reunite as one.

00:06:21.073 --> 00:06:23.706
Come on, Yuya!
Keep it together!

00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:25.873
It's time.
No, Yuya!

00:06:25.873 --> 00:06:28.873
It's time... to play
one card facedown

00:06:28.873 --> 00:06:30.673
and I end my turn!

00:06:30.673 --> 00:06:32.140
Ohh.
Yuya.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.106
By ending my turn,
my Starlight Force

00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:36.940
is now destroyed.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.073
So Clear Wing
and Starving Venom's Levels

00:06:39.073 --> 00:06:40.940
return to normal,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.040
and they can use
their special abilities again.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.173
So you want to
continue dueling.

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:48.473
I already told you
that you can't win.

00:06:48.473 --> 00:06:50.006
Must I repeat myself?

00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:51.906
Don't waste your breath.

00:06:51.906 --> 00:06:54.573
You can talk the talk,
but... not walk the walk.

00:06:54.573 --> 00:06:56.640
Oh, well.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.706
I tried to be nice
and give you the easy way out,

00:06:58.706 --> 00:07:01.180
but fools always like
to take the arduous path,

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.080
as if they're trying
to prove something,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.113
when all they're proving
is how smart they aren't.

00:07:05.113 --> 00:07:07.980
Guess I'll just have to
walk the walk as you said.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.613
Let's do this!

00:07:09.613 --> 00:07:13.046
Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon, go!

00:07:13.046 --> 00:07:16.280
Destroy Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.413
Unh! Oh!

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.546
Ahh! Oof!

00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:24.013
Grr!

00:07:24.013 --> 00:07:27.246
(chuckles)

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:29.480
Let's see if whatever
you picked up

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.246
can save you from Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon's attack!

00:07:32.246 --> 00:07:33.946
You better believe it can.

00:07:33.946 --> 00:07:36.713
Evasion lets me
avoid your attack!

00:07:36.713 --> 00:07:39.146
That's what you think!

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:42.280
I activate
the Action Spell No Action,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.980
which stops your
Action Spell from working,

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.646
so you aren't
avoiding anything!

00:07:47.646 --> 00:07:50.080
Now you have nothing left
to protect you, Yuya.

00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:55.380
Power levels are stable.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.813
All circuits
fully functioning.

00:07:57.813 --> 00:08:00.180
The Isolation Dome
is ready to go.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.586
We're ready to deploy
any time you wish, Professor.

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:05.453
<i>On your command.</i>

00:08:05.453 --> 00:08:07.520
Ready, Yuya?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.586
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon,
attack him directly!

00:08:11.586 --> 00:08:15.486
(Yuya yelling)

00:08:15.486 --> 00:08:17.986
Yuya!
(both gasp)

00:08:17.986 --> 00:08:20.453
With one final attack,
you're finished!

00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:22.653
And your delicious powers
will be mine

00:08:22.653 --> 00:08:24.653
as we reunite as one!

00:08:24.653 --> 00:08:27.386
Deploy the Isolation Dome.

00:08:30.753 --> 00:08:34.486
Aah!

00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:37.353
(Yuri laughing)

00:08:37.353 --> 00:08:39.786
Ah! What happened?
Huh?!

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:42.153
What is this place?
Huh?

00:08:42.153 --> 00:08:44.120
I don't know, Aster,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.320
but this is the largest
snow globe I've ever seen.

00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:53.353
As I reunite the dimensions
and revive my daughter,

00:08:53.353 --> 00:08:56.620
I cannot allow Yuya
to reunite into Z‐ARC.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.860
My Isolation Dome shields him
from the Reactor's energies.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.393
Yuya!

00:09:01.393 --> 00:09:04.560
(groaning)

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.960
Yuya, are you okay?

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.126
Ohh.. I gotta feeling

00:09:09.126 --> 00:09:11.526
things are gonna get
a whole lot worse, Declan.

00:09:11.526 --> 00:09:13.760
How so?
Yuya!

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.460
Are you okay
there, pal?

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.726
(Professor growls)

00:09:17.726 --> 00:09:20.860
Ray should've revived by now.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.693
Have you detected
her life signs yet?

00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:25.626
<i>Nothing yet, Professor.</i>

00:09:25.626 --> 00:09:27.660
This can't be.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.493
Not after everything
I've done.

00:09:31.493 --> 00:09:32.893
Yuri beat your dad?

00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:34.593
I won't let him
get away with that!

00:09:34.593 --> 00:09:36.160
That's a promise.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.360
Then get in line.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.626
I'm still dueling with Yuya.

00:09:40.626 --> 00:09:42.126
But once I'm through
with him,

00:09:42.126 --> 00:09:44.793
I'll make time to
polish you off for dessert.

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:47.126
Grr!
Fat chance, Yuri.

00:09:47.126 --> 00:09:50.926
There's no way
you'll beat me!

00:09:50.926 --> 00:09:52.926
Careful.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.826
As long as I have
a single life point,

00:09:55.826 --> 00:09:57.860
I'll fight
with all my heart!

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.160
Such wonderful news!

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.466
Because you'll lose
that point with this attack!

00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:04.966
Grr!
Yuya.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.133
Settle down.

00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:11.800
This battle is strictly
between Yuya and me.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.466
So the peanut gallery
can stay out of this!

00:10:14.466 --> 00:10:17.400
(all shouting)

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.966
(all moaning)

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.466
I think it's only fitting
that I finally defeat you

00:10:24.466 --> 00:10:26.466
with the monster
I stole from you,

00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:30.233
your formerly very own
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:31.333
(Dragons roar)

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:34.133
Ahh! Unh!

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:37.433
There's gotta be a way
Yuya can get out of this!

00:10:37.433 --> 00:10:39.533
He's still has
one facedown card.

00:10:39.533 --> 00:10:41.666
Let's hope it's
something that helps,

00:10:41.666 --> 00:10:43.900
because if it's not,
it's over!

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:47.566
All right then.

00:10:47.566 --> 00:10:50.233
(Yuri laughing)

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.633
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon...

00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:55.900
put Yuya out of his misery!

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.600
Unh.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.366
Going for an Action Card?!

00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:00.840
Then so will I!

00:11:06.473 --> 00:11:08.606
I send this Action Spell
from my hand

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:11.140
to the graveyard to‐‐
Stop right there!

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.906
I activate
Crush Action!

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:17.140
You were hoping
to save yourself
with that Action Card,

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.673
but Crush Action
destroys it!

00:11:19.673 --> 00:11:22.140
Ta‐ta!

00:11:24.206 --> 00:11:27.306
Then I'll discard
my other spell card instead.

00:11:27.306 --> 00:11:29.806
Unh... Bye, Dad!

00:11:29.806 --> 00:11:32.240
That activates
my trap, Break Away!

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.940
All your monsters lose
their special abilities,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.206
but more importantly,
you're no longer allowed

00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:38.906
to attack me this turn!

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:41.273
You sure are good

00:11:41.273 --> 00:11:43.206
at escaping by the skin
of your teeth.

00:11:43.206 --> 00:11:45.840
But surviving and winning are
different matters entirely.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.773
I place two cards facedown

00:11:48.773 --> 00:11:50.040
and end my turn.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.740
You're up.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.140
I'm sorry.

00:11:57.773 --> 00:11:59.306
No, Dad!

00:11:59.306 --> 00:12:01.213
Please don't go!

00:12:01.213 --> 00:12:04.113
Dad! Dad!

00:12:04.113 --> 00:12:05.613
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:12:05.613 --> 00:12:07.880
But I had no choice.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.513
Yuya, what's wrong?

00:12:09.513 --> 00:12:11.080
Until now, I had...

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.246
my dad's
Smile World with me.

00:12:14.246 --> 00:12:16.680
So it was like he was
watching over me,

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.846
helping me out,
keeping me strong.

00:12:19.846 --> 00:12:23.013
But in order to survive,
I had to destroy it.

00:12:23.013 --> 00:12:24.913
I destroyed my own dad!

00:12:24.913 --> 00:12:27.680
How could I destroy
my own dad?!

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.413
I got rid of my own dad.

00:12:30.413 --> 00:12:33.546
It's like this duel
is costing me everything.

00:12:39.046 --> 00:12:40.813
This is crazy.

00:12:40.813 --> 00:12:43.080
It's like my mind
is playing tricks on me.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.480
Kite!
Hey, Shay!

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.046
I'm glad you're okay.

00:12:46.046 --> 00:12:48.013
Yeah, but I can't
say the same

00:12:48.013 --> 00:12:50.080
for whatever's happening
to this world.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.513
Let's hope our friends
can put a stop to it.

00:12:52.513 --> 00:12:55.546
When I gave up Smile World,

00:12:55.546 --> 00:12:59.180
it's like
I gave up on my dad.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.420
How could I... give up?

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.220
Snap out of it, Yuya!

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.953
You didn't give up
on your father.

00:13:04.953 --> 00:13:06.820
in fact, you did exactly

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.586
what your father would
have wanted you to do.

00:13:08.586 --> 00:13:10.686
He would have wanted you
to keep fighting,

00:13:10.686 --> 00:13:12.520
no matter what the cost.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.853
No matter... what the cost.

00:13:14.853 --> 00:13:16.320
That's right!

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.886
Remember, when things
get tough,

00:13:17.886 --> 00:13:19.620
respond with a smile.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.253
And if you believe
in yourself,

00:13:21.253 --> 00:13:22.786
your cards
will believe in you!

00:13:22.786 --> 00:13:24.553
Now win this duel!

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:26.653
It's what your dad
would have wanted.
Ohh!

00:13:26.653 --> 00:13:28.486
I know it's not easy.

00:13:28.486 --> 00:13:31.320
But we all
believe in you.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.186
And we won't ever stop.

00:13:33.186 --> 00:13:35.686
I know you can
defeat Yuri

00:13:35.686 --> 00:13:37.720
and stop Z‐ARC's
resurrection.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.686
But, Declan...
No buts!

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:42.453
Just get off
your butt right now!

00:13:42.453 --> 00:13:43.753
That's right!

00:13:43.753 --> 00:13:45.620
I know you can do it!
Yeah, Yuya!

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.286
Bury Yuri!

00:13:47.286 --> 00:13:48.986
(Declan)
Now get up, and prove

00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:50.620
that I'm not wrong.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.620
Show us what
you're capable of.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.453
Win this duel, Yuya!

00:13:54.453 --> 00:13:56.886
Okay, Declan.
I'm gonna try.

00:13:56.886 --> 00:14:00.160
(chuckling)
I love it!

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.826
Such passion!

00:14:01.826 --> 00:14:04.560
If I had a heart, I'm sure
that would've warmed it.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.193
But really you might wanna
turn it down a skosh.

00:14:07.193 --> 00:14:09.460
I mean, how embarrassing
would it be

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.293
to lose
after that display.

00:14:11.293 --> 00:14:14.460
Because it's your cards,
not your words,

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.260
that truly do
the talking.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.660
Then you'll find...

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.526
that my cards
have a lot to say.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.693
So get ready, Yuri

00:14:22.693 --> 00:14:24.393
You go get 'em, Yuya!

00:14:24.393 --> 00:14:26.226
Do it, Yuya, kick this guy
to the curb!

00:14:26.226 --> 00:14:30.260
Focus, just concentrate
on winning this duel.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.160
Concentrate on winning.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.560
Right! Got it!

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.460
Hyah!

00:14:39.593 --> 00:14:42.060
If I gotta focus
on winning this duel,

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:46.260
I already got
everything I need.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.026
I'm gonna use
the Pendulum Scale

00:14:48.026 --> 00:14:50.060
that's already been set

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.193
to Pendulum Summon!

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.293
Performapal Trap Mimic!

00:14:57.293 --> 00:14:59.600
And Performapal Flatrat!

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.333
And from my Extra Deck,
I summon...

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:09.733
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:15:09.733 --> 00:15:12.333
Ahh! Unh!

00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:14.866
Ah, good old
Odd‐Eyes again.

00:15:14.866 --> 00:15:17.666
Back just to be destroyed.
(chuckling)

00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:19.366
Unh!

00:15:19.366 --> 00:15:20.800
(Yuya's voice)
Just gotta hold on.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.566
Just gotta focus
on winning!

00:15:23.566 --> 00:15:27.533
My Trap Mimic can destroy
one of your trap cards!

00:15:27.533 --> 00:15:30.066
It destroys Dragonvine

00:15:30.066 --> 00:15:33.300
and frees Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.333
(roars)

00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:37.100
Yuya got
Dark Rebellion back!

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.433
Hmph!

00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:41.100
And then Trap Mimic
mimics the card it ate

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.833
and gains its effect!

00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:46.533
(roaring)

00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:48.800
Dragonvine's effect
lets me take control

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.233
of Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:51.966
(roars)

00:15:51.966 --> 00:15:54.666
Now I'm the one who has
more Dragons than you!

00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:56.466
Yeah!
Show him you're boss!

00:15:56.466 --> 00:15:57.866
Nicely done.

00:15:57.866 --> 00:15:59.840
Yuya's one step away
from victory.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.740
Yeah, he's so close!

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.273
If Dark Rebellion
uses an Overlay Unit

00:16:04.273 --> 00:16:06.073
to activate
its special ability,

00:16:06.073 --> 00:16:07.873
it can steal half
of Starving Venom's

00:16:07.873 --> 00:16:10.473
attack points
for itself.

00:16:10.473 --> 00:16:13.240
And Yuya can use that ability
twice to win the duel!

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.040
He's so got this!

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.740
Not a chance!
This'll stop you.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.606
Predator Plant Reborn!

00:16:19.606 --> 00:16:22.106
This card lets me summon
a Predator Plant

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.006
from my graveyard!

00:16:24.006 --> 00:16:27.073
Stapeliaworm,
return in defense mode!

00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:30.306
And thanks to Stapeliaworm's
special ability,

00:16:30.306 --> 00:16:32.373
if your monster's
attack points change,

00:16:32.373 --> 00:16:34.673
it is
instantly destroyed!

00:16:34.673 --> 00:16:37.806
So go ahead, use your
Dark Rebellion's ability!

00:16:37.806 --> 00:16:40.540
If you want to see it explode
before your very eyes!

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:49.173
Nothing you do will
stop me from winning, Yuri!

00:16:49.173 --> 00:16:51.373
First, when you summon
a monster,

00:16:51.373 --> 00:16:54.940
it becomes the same level
as Flat Rat‐‐ Five!

00:16:56.773 --> 00:17:00.580
Next, I still use one of
Dark Rebellion's Overlay Units

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.880
to activate
its special ability!

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.880
Stubborn to the end,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.446
and this is the end!

00:17:07.446 --> 00:17:09.446
Stapeliaworm,
destroy his Dragon!

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:11.013
That's what you think!

00:17:11.013 --> 00:17:13.613
Since your Stapeliaworm
is now Level Five,

00:17:13.613 --> 00:17:16.813
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon's
special ability

00:17:16.813 --> 00:17:19.146
automatically destroys it!

00:17:19.146 --> 00:17:21.846
And Clear Wing
gains Stapeliaworm's
attack points!

00:17:23.013 --> 00:17:24.546
(roars)

00:17:24.546 --> 00:17:25.713
Hmph!

00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:28.613
Now Dark Rebellion can
use its special ability

00:17:28.613 --> 00:17:31.313
and your monster won't
be able to stop it!

00:17:31.313 --> 00:17:33.380
Dark Rebellion
steals half

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.446
of Starving Venom's
attack points...

00:17:35.446 --> 00:17:37.180
and takes them
for itself!

00:17:38.946 --> 00:17:41.313
(Aster)
Yuto's gotta be
loving this.

00:17:41.313 --> 00:17:42.913
(Sora)
So's Yugo.

00:17:42.913 --> 00:17:44.280
They both came back,

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.146
and they brought
their Dragons, too!

00:17:46.146 --> 00:17:47.713
They're on
our side now!

00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:48.946
Do it, Yuya!

00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:52.246
(Yuya)
Dark Rebellion uses
its second Overlay Unit

00:17:52.246 --> 00:17:54.980
to steal even more of Starving
Venom's attack points!

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.946
(roaring)

00:17:59.446 --> 00:18:01.720
Just one last attack!
Yuri's done for!

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.420
Excellent, Yuya!

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.220
We'll see about that!

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.886
I activate the trap
Ridiculing World!

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:11.553
It gives all your monsters
100 extra attack points.

00:18:11.553 --> 00:18:13.620
That should put a smile
on your face.

00:18:18.453 --> 00:18:20.753
Or maybe a frown,
because any monster

00:18:20.753 --> 00:18:24.353
that gained attack points
can't attack at all this turn.

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.286
So, Yuya,
you can't do anything!

00:18:27.286 --> 00:18:29.253
(laughing maniacally)

00:18:29.253 --> 00:18:31.020
Oh, yes, I can!

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.720
I can tribute
Flat Rat to return

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.420
one of my monster's
attack points
back to normal,

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.586
allowing it to
attack once again!

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:41.486
So what, Yuya?

00:18:41.486 --> 00:18:43.686
If you destroy
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon,

00:18:43.686 --> 00:18:45.353
its special ability
will activate

00:18:45.353 --> 00:18:46.953
and destroy
all your Dragons,

00:18:46.953 --> 00:18:49.986
and you'll take damage equal
to their attack points!

00:18:49.986 --> 00:18:52.486
Which is more...
much, much more than enough...

00:18:52.486 --> 00:18:54.586
to erase
all your life points!

00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:57.753
That's true, but you can't
use that special ability

00:18:57.753 --> 00:18:59.793
if I defeat you first!
Huh?

00:18:59.793 --> 00:19:03.226
So get yourself
ready to attack...

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:04.293
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:19:04.293 --> 00:19:07.993
(roaring)

00:19:07.993 --> 00:19:10.260
Yuri, this is it!

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.860
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon...

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.793
destroy Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon!

00:19:14.793 --> 00:19:18.660
(roaring)
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.693
When Odd‐Eyes
battles a monster

00:19:23.693 --> 00:19:25.093
that's at least Level Five,

00:19:25.093 --> 00:19:27.326
you take double the damage.

00:19:27.326 --> 00:19:29.360
I win, Yuri!

00:19:32.926 --> 00:19:35.860
So then... I lose.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.693
(laughing maniacally)

00:19:44.293 --> 00:19:45.960
All right!
He did it!

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.393
Yuya won!

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.560
All that's left to do
is stop the reactor.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.060
(moaning)

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.793
So this...

00:19:56.793 --> 00:19:59.326
is what being a loser
feels like.

00:19:59.326 --> 00:20:02.366
I bet this is
just how Yugo must feel

00:20:02.366 --> 00:20:03.900
every single day.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.733
Well, I had a good run.

00:20:06.733 --> 00:20:08.466
(chuckles)

00:20:08.466 --> 00:20:09.933
Take this, Yuya.

00:20:09.933 --> 00:20:12.100
It's what you wanted.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.733
Unh!

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:15.800
I don't need it
in my collection anymore

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.533
since you're gonna
absorb me anyway.

00:20:17.533 --> 00:20:20.000
He's not going
to absorb you.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.900
There's zero chance
of that happening.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.933
So Z‐ARC isn't
gonna be making

00:20:23.933 --> 00:20:25.600
any kind of comeback!

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.600
Not today, not tomorrow,
not ever!

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.000
'Cause Yuya's a winner,
not a loser like you.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.066
Right, Yuya?
Yuya?

00:20:35.866 --> 00:20:38.000
I won, Declan.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.633
You wanted me to focus
on winning... and I won.

00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:43.633
(all gasp)
Yuya?!

00:20:43.633 --> 00:20:46.300
I won...

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.600
(deeper voice)
Just like you wanted!

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.766
(all gasp)

00:20:49.766 --> 00:20:51.466
And from now...

00:20:51.466 --> 00:20:53.800
there's isn't
anymore dueltaining!

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.266
Only winning!

00:20:55.266 --> 00:20:57.233
You wanted
a more brutal duel,

00:20:57.233 --> 00:20:58.873
so I gave it to you!

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:23.240
Yaah!

00:21:27.506 --> 00:21:29.406
What have I unleashed?

00:21:29.406 --> 00:21:33.306
Astrograph Sorcerer,
master of time and space,

00:21:33.306 --> 00:21:35.906
I call on you to use
your mystical powers

00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:39.106
to reshape us into
a single unstoppable force!

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.680
What's going on?

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.313
Nothing good.

00:22:04.313 --> 00:22:07.180
(Declan)
Those are
the other dimensions!

00:22:10.213 --> 00:22:13.580
Ohh!
Look there!

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.346
(roaring)
