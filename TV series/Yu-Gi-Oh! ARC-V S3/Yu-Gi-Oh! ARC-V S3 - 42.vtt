WEBVTT

00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:05.866
(Yuya)
Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.666
If I can't defeat Z‐ARC,
then it's hopeless.

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.933
(Declan)
You're wrong.

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.666
We wouldn't all
be here fighting

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.300
if we didn't know
we can stop Z‐ARC.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.566
To stop Z‐ARC
you have to
free Yuya first!

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.866
Yes, that's precisely
what I plan to do.

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.766
You said that Yuya Sakaki
inspired you

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.033
when he discovered
Pendulum Summoning,

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.466
but you are so wrong!

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.500
For your information,
it was I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.100
who gave birth
to Pendulum Summoning!

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.033
That can't... be true!

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.366
I finish you off
once and for all!

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.300
Declan, no!

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.000
(Tate)
It's Riley!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.833
I'm not Riley.

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.500
It's me... Ray!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.066
No!

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.766
(Riley/Ray)
Yuya, set yourself free!

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.606
You heard the lady!

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:02.906
(Yuya's voice)
That's right!

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:05.640
It's my... turn!

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.306
I activate Smile Universe!

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:10.073
Now's your chance, Riley!

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:13.040
I destroy
both of your monsters,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.440
and you take 600 points
of damage for each one!

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.773
You win... for now...

00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:22.040
But I'll return!

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.506
I'm going to seal Z‐ARC
away for good!

00:01:24.506 --> 00:01:27.773
(Z‐ARC roaring)

00:01:27.773 --> 00:01:30.673
Aah!

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:32.773
Huh? What happened?

00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:34.440

Oh, no!
Unh! Ahh!

00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:44.313
Mom, why'd you let me
sleep in?

00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:46.746
Relax, Yuya, it's Sunday.
Huh?!

00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:48.313
You don't have school today,

00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:50.080
so you have nothing
to be late for.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.013
(chomping)

00:02:52.013 --> 00:02:53.780
I got duel practice,
and if I miss it,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.080
Principal Boyle
will have a cow!

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.380
Well, that's
certainly no excuse

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.013
for you to eat
like a cow, mister!

00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:00.653
(meow)

00:03:00.653 --> 00:03:03.086
Bye, Mom, gotta roll!

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.320
Made it!
With time to spare!

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.586
(Skip)
Wrong!

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:38.320
Hey, what was that for?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.253
You're late, hotshot!

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.786
By three‐hundredths
of a second!

00:03:41.786 --> 00:03:44.153
Aww c'mon, you were just
slow on the stopwatch!

00:03:44.153 --> 00:03:46.486
(Allie)
‐ No excuses, Yuya!

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:48.420
Maybe if you had set
your alarm clock,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.586
you wouldn't have
gotten clocked!

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:52.520
Anyway, where did you
get that?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.620
Huh, the fan?

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.286
Oh, I don't know I just
found it lying around

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.520
the gym this morning.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.560
Hmm, weird thing is,
I don't remember buying it.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.660
Hmm?
Fabulat!

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.060
Huh?
Zose boots are so boss!

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.960
(chuckles)
You like 'em?

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.393
Mmm, I vant
a pair!

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:12.826
You buy them
in town?

00:04:12.826 --> 00:04:15.126
Nuh‐uh, these Roller Boots
were a gift.

00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:16.893
From who?
Wha?

00:04:16.893 --> 00:04:20.693
From, uh... I forget.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:23.026
Sounds like you're suffering
from a case of amnesia.

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:25.726
Shpooky!

00:04:25.726 --> 00:04:27.893
(Skip)
Enough squawkin'
and more duelin'!

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:30.260
C'mon, chop chop!
Let's go!

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.659
Now hit the gym, stat!
Time to get down and duelly!

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.093
(kids)
Sir, yessir!

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:38.793
Hmm.

00:04:41.393 --> 00:04:43.293
Allrighty then!

00:04:43.293 --> 00:04:44.826
Principal Boyle wants me
to take on

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.160
all three of you at once!

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.260
Well I say the more,
the merrier!

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.960
I'm always up
for a challenge!

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.160
(Skip)
<i>That's the spirit!</i>

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.360
It's that kind of
can‐do attitude

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.693
that made your dear old dad
the number one dueltainer ever!

00:04:57.693 --> 00:04:59.860
I wanna see every student
at the You Show Duel School

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.066
follow in his footsteps!

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:04.000
<i>Keep it up and soon</i>
<i>you'll be globe‐hoppin'</i>

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.233
<i>on the pro dueling circuit</i>
<i>just like him!</i>

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:08.366
Duelists, get set!

00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:12.566
I'm activating...
the field spell Plain Plain!

00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:16.566
(computer voice)
Augmented Reality Combat
system energized.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.666
Generating Action Field.

00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:21.766
Our disks are all ready!

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:24.566
Und our nerves
are steady...

00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:26.733
'Cause once
the fun starts...

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:29.700
We'll all be duelin
with our hearts! Ha ha ha!

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.766
It's showtime!

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:33.266
(all)
Let's duel!

00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:37.366
(all)
Let's duel!

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:41.133
I'll start off by using
Scale 1 Stargazer Magician

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:42.966
and Scale 8
Timegazer Magician

00:05:42.966 --> 00:05:45.200
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.700
I'm taking control
of this starting now!

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.400
(beeping)

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.533
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:56.900
all at the same time!

00:05:58.133 --> 00:06:00.373
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:06:00.373 --> 00:06:03.806
Carve the arc of victory!

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:07.140
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:06:10.073 --> 00:06:12.840
Slice and dice,
Performapal Sword Fish!

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.306
Snap to it,
Performapal Whip Snake!

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.173
And last
but certainly not least,

00:06:18.173 --> 00:06:21.406
turn up the heat
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:06:21.406 --> 00:06:23.340
Take it away, Tate!

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.240
You betcha!
I draw!

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.240
I'll also set
the Pendulum Scale

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.840
using Scale 1 Deskbot 008

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.773
and Scale 10 Deskbot 007.

00:06:34.773 --> 00:06:36.740
That will let me
summon monsters

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.706
from Level 2 through 9
all at the same time!

00:06:40.706 --> 00:06:45.906
I Pendulum Summon!

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.540
Deskbot 005!

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.806
And Deskbot 006!

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:57.673
(Declan)
The world... has changed.

00:06:57.673 --> 00:07:00.773
The Standard Dimension
no longer exists.

00:07:00.773 --> 00:07:03.513
With Z‐ARC's defeat,
the world has been reborn

00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:05.546
as the Pendulum Dimension,
and as a result,

00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:07.046
all of the duelists here
have developed

00:07:07.046 --> 00:07:08.813
the ability
to Pendulum Summon.

00:07:08.813 --> 00:07:12.746
That day...
transformed everything.

00:07:12.746 --> 00:07:14.513
Ohh!

00:07:14.513 --> 00:07:16.580
Including a child.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.746
‐ Don't worry, Mother.

00:07:18.746 --> 00:07:21.080
My staff is a better
babysitter than a bodyguard.

00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:31.513
Here comes some razzle!

00:07:31.513 --> 00:07:33.580
And now hit 'em
with some dazzle!

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.846
(beeping)

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:38.446
What this?

00:07:40.746 --> 00:07:41.913
No way!

00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:48.546
Now... Odd‐Eyes, drop
their life points to zero!

00:07:48.546 --> 00:07:51.646
Huh?!
Whoa!

00:07:51.646 --> 00:07:53.613
Unh!

00:07:53.613 --> 00:07:56.880
I said drop their
life points, not me!

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.680
Hey, Yuya!
You're not gonna believe it!

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.253
Look for yourself,
but try not to faint!

00:08:02.253 --> 00:08:04.886
Wha‐‐ It's from
the Leo Institute?

00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:06.653
They invited you

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.720
to the Junior ARC
League Championship!

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.286
Win this and you'll move up
to the Senior division.

00:08:11.286 --> 00:08:13.020
And then you'll be
one step closer

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.386
to becoming a pro
like your old man.

00:08:15.386 --> 00:08:17.720
Just like you
always dreamed!

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.853
Zat's uber
fantastiche!

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:22.053
Well, what're you
waiting for?

00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:24.053
Get over there before
they change their minds!

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:26.020
Right! On my way!

00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:32.253
(receptionist)
Sakaki... Sakaki...

00:08:32.253 --> 00:08:35.120
Ah, here you are!
Yuya Sakaki.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.653
Good luck
in the tournament!

00:08:36.653 --> 00:08:39.520
You, too!
I mean, thank you!

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.086
(Gong)
Yuya!
Huh?

00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:43.853
Gong had a hunch Gong
would be seein' you here.

00:08:43.853 --> 00:08:45.753
It wouldn't be
much of a championship

00:08:45.753 --> 00:08:47.253
without you in it.

00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:49.486
You got that right, Gong!

00:08:49.486 --> 00:08:51.353
(Sylvio)
But neither of you will win
as long as I'm dueling!

00:08:51.353 --> 00:08:53.620
Sylvio?!

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.753
Of all the people,
they invited you?

00:08:56.753 --> 00:08:59.286
Well they certainly
couldn't have left me out!

00:08:59.286 --> 00:09:01.693
Ha! I mean after all,
it's my talents

00:09:01.693 --> 00:09:03.526
that put the Leo Institute
on the map!

00:09:03.526 --> 00:09:05.760
Everyone knows
one duelist reigns supreme

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.493
in the hearts and minds
of fans!

00:09:07.493 --> 00:09:09.993
And the name of that super
duelist happens to be‐‐

00:09:09.993 --> 00:09:11.226
(Yuya and Gong)
Declan Akaba!

00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:15.026
Right! Declan Akaba!
Say what?!

00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:16.993
(Declan) I'm glad
you all made it,

00:09:16.993 --> 00:09:18.826
because I've changed
the format

00:09:18.826 --> 00:09:20.893
of this year's
championship,

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.360
and it will involve
all three of you.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.526
(all)
Huh?

00:09:23.526 --> 00:09:25.126
You'll be part
of a four‐way duel.

00:09:25.126 --> 00:09:27.293
A battle royal.

00:09:27.293 --> 00:09:29.026
(Sylvio and Gong gasp)
We're all dueling at once?

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.093
Okay, dueling fanatics,
the wait is over!

00:09:38.093 --> 00:09:40.026
It's finally time
to kick off

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.460
the Junior Arc League
Championship!

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.693
(all cheering)

00:09:45.693 --> 00:09:48.160
Give it up for...
our four competitors,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.226
the most amazing duelists...

00:09:50.226 --> 00:09:53.160
Huh?
There's only four?

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.026
Huh. Looks legit.

00:09:56.026 --> 00:09:58.826
Once more, give our duelists
a warm welcome!

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:02.166
<i>Our first contender takes</i>
<i>after his dear old dad,</i>

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:06.566
<i>the You Show Duel School's</i>
<i>own Yuya Sakaki!</i>

00:10:06.566 --> 00:10:08.433
<i>And next,</i>
<i>he's strong like oak</i>

00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:11.400
<i>and flexible like oak,</i>
<i>it's Gong Strong!</i>

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.500
<i>They're joined by your most</i>
<i>favorite duelist,</i>

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.833
<i>or so he claims,</i>
<i>Sylvio Sawatari!</i>

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:19.433
So... who's
the fourth duelist?

00:10:19.433 --> 00:10:21.566
<i>And last but not least,</i>
<i>we have...</i>

00:10:21.566 --> 00:10:24.666
<i>a mystery duelist?</i>

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.800
<i>(nervous chuckle)</i>
<i>Must be the shy type!</i>

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.500
Hey, where'd
Principal Boyle run off to?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.100
Hopefully not the bathroom,
'cause those lines were long!

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.133
(Yoko)
You can't be serious!

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.233
What could be
more important
than Yuya's big duel?

00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:37.300
Unreal.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.866
What could that
sweat suit be thinking?

00:10:38.866 --> 00:10:41.666
I don't know,
I'm just a kid!

00:10:41.666 --> 00:10:46.466
Ahh! Looks like ze duelfest
is about to start!

00:10:46.466 --> 00:10:49.200
<i>Folks, our challengers</i>
<i>are ready.</i>

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.800
All we need to do now
is to pick out...

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.966
a field spell!

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:57.333
<i>I activate</i>
<i>Quartet of Quandry!</i>

00:10:57.333 --> 00:11:00.606
<i>Now, fire up the city's</i>
<i>ARC system!</i>

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.573
Ohh...
Why do I feel...

00:11:18.573 --> 00:11:20.273
like I've been here before?

00:11:20.273 --> 00:11:22.240
Guys!
Huh?

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.240
Moustache said there were
four of us competing, right?

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.040
Yeah.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.673
It doesn't take a math major
to see someone's missing.

00:11:28.673 --> 00:11:31.173
Gong don't like folks
who show up late.

00:11:31.173 --> 00:11:33.140
(Moon Shadow)
Good thing I'm already here.
(all gasp)

00:11:35.673 --> 00:11:38.673
I am Moon Shadow.
Prepare to duel!

00:11:38.673 --> 00:11:40.206
Moon Shadow?

00:11:40.206 --> 00:11:42.273
(Sylvio)
Good, now we can
get started.

00:11:42.273 --> 00:11:44.373
I have a date
with the first place trophy

00:11:44.373 --> 00:11:46.140
and I don't wanna miss it!

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.173
Ugh.
Listen, Yuya...

00:11:49.173 --> 00:11:51.773
We may be friends,
but don't you cut
Gong no slack,

00:11:51.773 --> 00:11:53.940
'cause Gong's goin'
full Gong on ya!

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.840
Right!
Let's set a record

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.806
for the most awesomest duel
the city's ever seen!

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:02.046
Folks, the moment
has arrived

00:12:02.046 --> 00:12:04.913
for this fierce and fiery
foursome to finally face‐off!

00:12:04.913 --> 00:12:07.746
They're bursting to battle
as we kick off this championship

00:12:07.746 --> 00:12:10.880
in a dizzying display
of monster madness
and attacks galore!

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.980
Who will rise to be
king of the mountain?

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.113
We're about to find out!

00:12:15.113 --> 00:12:18.680
(all)
Let's do this!

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.280
Here goes!
I'm charging right in!

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.513
And charging right alongside me
will be Performpal Hip Hippo!

00:12:25.513 --> 00:12:28.813
Ahh!

00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:31.580
Then I'll place
these two cards facedown.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.513
And that's that!

00:12:34.513 --> 00:12:38.380
Let's ride, Hip Hippo!
Hyah!

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.080
‐ Wow! I never
would've guessed

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.380
a hippo could be
that helpful!

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.780
Yuya and his pink pal
are already on the prowl

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.680
for some Action cards!

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.513
The other duelists are
gonna have their hands full

00:12:48.513 --> 00:12:50.580
if they wanna keep up.
Sylvio Sawatari is up next!

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.880
So strange.
Why do I have this fan

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.480
and why do I care so much?

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.846
It's just a fan... right?

00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:01.820
‐ It's my turn!
So get your cameras ready!

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.586
I draw!

00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:05.586
And I'll start by summoning
one of my faves,

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:07.620
Abyss Actor, Curtain Raiser!

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.453
(laughing)

00:13:12.453 --> 00:13:14.386
Let's do this!

00:13:14.386 --> 00:13:17.720
Curtain Raiser, bring down
the curtain on Yuya's Hippo!

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.686
There's more!

00:13:22.686 --> 00:13:25.220
Curtain Raiser, activate
your special ability!

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.053
Since Curtain Raiser's
the only monster on my field,

00:13:28.053 --> 00:13:29.520
its attack points double!

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.453
Faster!

00:13:35.453 --> 00:13:37.753
Do y' smell somethin', pal?

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.853
Unh! I activate
the Action Spell Evasion!

00:13:47.853 --> 00:13:49.786
Ha ha, yeah!

00:13:49.786 --> 00:13:51.353
Lucky punk.

00:13:51.353 --> 00:13:53.220
But you won't be
so lucky next time.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.486
Who's up next?

00:13:55.486 --> 00:13:58.653
That would be Gong!
Mrah!

00:13:58.653 --> 00:14:00.426
And Gong's
starting by summoning

00:14:00.426 --> 00:14:02.426
Superheavy Samurai Flutist!

00:14:02.426 --> 00:14:04.493
(Flutist intoning)

00:14:06.993 --> 00:14:10.093
But Gong's Flutist
won't be sticking
around for long!

00:14:10.093 --> 00:14:12.426
Because by tributin' it,
Gong can summon

00:14:12.426 --> 00:14:15.526
Superheavy Samurai
Big Benkei in defense mode!

00:14:15.526 --> 00:14:18.393
(grunts)

00:14:18.393 --> 00:14:22.160
(grunting)

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.826
Big Benkei can attack even
when it's in defense mode,

00:14:25.826 --> 00:14:28.160
so now it's gonna
plaster your pachyderm!

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.193
(roaring)

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.693
That's what you think!

00:14:36.693 --> 00:14:39.893
I activate the spell
Hippo Carnival

00:14:39.893 --> 00:14:42.360
to bring out a herd of hippos
with some pep in their step!

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.760
(Hippos cheering)

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.293
Your monster has to
redirect its attack

00:14:48.293 --> 00:14:52.360
to my dancing damsels.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.660
Heh!
Not too shabby, Yuya!

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.960
Gong'll end Gong's turn!

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.860
Wow!
What an escape artiste!

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.566
(Moon Shadow)
Enough of this!
Oh!

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:05.400
This is no time
for fun and games.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.966
The fate of the world
is at stake.

00:15:12.266 --> 00:15:13.733
(Moon Shadow)
This is not the first time

00:15:13.733 --> 00:15:16.166
you have dueled
each other like this.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.633
It was, in fact, during
the ARC League Championship!

00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:20.900
You must remember
or all will be lost.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.766
Oh!

00:15:25.766 --> 00:15:27.400
The Arc League?

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.600
Championship?
Oh, yeah.

00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:34.066
Hey. that does ring
a bell, doesn't it?

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.300
Yeah, I remember
something like that.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.800
There was a tournament
now that I think of it.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.133
Jah! It's all schtarting to
flow back to my noggin.

00:15:42.133 --> 00:15:43.733
(Yoko)
How could I ever forget?

00:15:43.733 --> 00:15:45.566
My little hot sauce,

00:15:45.566 --> 00:15:48.366
Reed Pepper, dueled up
a feast for the ages!

00:15:48.366 --> 00:15:51.566
And, Yuya, like,
beat him.

00:15:51.566 --> 00:15:53.866
Ah, yes!

00:15:53.866 --> 00:15:57.600
How could I ever forget
such incredible duels!

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.740
And such exquisite play‐by‐play
commentary by moi!

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.940
I recall...
I dueled Yuya.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.606
And what a duel it was!

00:16:06.606 --> 00:16:09.473
The crowd was on the edge
of their seats!

00:16:09.473 --> 00:16:14.140
A rip‐roaring climax
where... I lost!

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.173
Now I know why
I forgot about it.

00:16:16.173 --> 00:16:18.573
That's why
this place looks familiar.

00:16:18.573 --> 00:16:20.673
I've been here before!

00:16:20.673 --> 00:16:23.206
It's all starting to
come back to me now...

00:16:23.206 --> 00:16:24.906
There was a duel going on...

00:16:24.906 --> 00:16:28.640
Some kid named... Sora!

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.473
Yes, Sora.

00:16:30.473 --> 00:16:33.106
He defeated Sun Shadow,
my brother.

00:16:33.106 --> 00:16:34.840
Yeah, yeah,
enough about you.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.340
Let's get back to me.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.473
I remember dueling
some freaky freaks

00:16:38.473 --> 00:16:40.006
around here myself.

00:16:40.006 --> 00:16:41.773
(Gong)
Same here.

00:16:41.773 --> 00:16:44.040
You and Gong and you dueled
against Obelisk Force.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.206
That's right!

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:49.040
Some rough and tumbles
from the Fusion Dimension.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.473
They were sent
by Declan's dad,
the Professor,

00:16:51.473 --> 00:16:53.440
to conquer
our dimension!

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.973
Yup! They sure did
a number on us.

00:16:56.973 --> 00:16:59.440
But you and Gong certainly
didn't back down.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.480
No way, no how!

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.346
Wasn't there someone else
dueling with us too?

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.913
Shay!

00:17:09.913 --> 00:17:11.613
Oh, yeah!

00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:14.013
Declan selfishly was using
the championship

00:17:14.013 --> 00:17:15.980
to put together his own
fighting force...

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.613
The Lancers!

00:17:17.613 --> 00:17:19.913
But there's gotta be more
to this story.

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:22.646
I just can't remember!

00:17:22.646 --> 00:17:25.580
(Moon Shadow)
But you must, Yuya.
For all our sakes.

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.080
(Declan)
<i>Listen up, Moon Shadow.</i>

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.680
Continue the battle.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.780
It may jog
more of their memories.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:32.980
Now duel.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.513
Understood.

00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:36.680
My turn!

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.280
I draw!

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.113
It's hopeless.

00:17:41.113 --> 00:17:44.313
Even if this duel
helps them
remember everything,

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:46.580
what difference
will it make?

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:51.413
How can they save
my dear, precious Riley?

00:17:51.413 --> 00:17:53.846
Trust me.
Yuya can.

00:17:53.846 --> 00:17:56.480
(Yusho)
Let's hope so.

00:18:00.253 --> 00:18:03.953
I now use... Scale 1
Twilight Ninja Jogen

00:18:03.953 --> 00:18:06.320
and my Scale 10
Twilight Ninja Kagen

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.753
to set the Pendulum Scale.

00:18:14.686 --> 00:18:18.053
Now I can summon Monsters
between Levels 2 and 9

00:18:18.053 --> 00:18:20.386
all at the same time.

00:18:20.386 --> 00:18:21.753
I Pendulum Summon!

00:18:21.753 --> 00:18:23.986
Appear!

00:18:23.986 --> 00:18:26.853
Twilight Ninja Shingetsu!

00:18:26.853 --> 00:18:30.120
And Twilight Ninja
Getsuga, The Shogun!

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.920
Then I shall activate
the spell card

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.820
Illusion Ninjitsu
Art Of Hazy Shuriken!

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:42.520
Shingetsu,
attack Yuya's Hippo‐‐ Go!

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.220
Hey, Hip Hippo!
You smell another Action Card?

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.253
Nice! It's all mine!

00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:50.453
Huh?!

00:18:50.453 --> 00:18:52.753
Wrong, it is mine!

00:18:52.753 --> 00:18:56.520
You cannot outspeed
a ninja, my friend.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.453
By sending this Action Card
to my graveyard,

00:18:59.453 --> 00:19:01.060
Illusion Ninjitsu
Art Of Hazy Shuriken

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.826
throws 300 points
of damage at you.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.193
Unh!

00:19:10.193 --> 00:19:13.193
(ninja yells, hippo coos)

00:19:16.326 --> 00:19:18.793
And I will use
Jogen's Pendulum ability

00:19:18.793 --> 00:19:20.660
to weaken you even more!

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.993
When my Ninja
destroys your monster,

00:19:22.993 --> 00:19:24.426
you still take damage

00:19:24.426 --> 00:19:28.593
even if your monster
is in defense mode!

00:19:28.593 --> 00:19:31.060
Yuya's Hippo has
no defense points.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.526
And Shingetsu has
1,500 attack points!

00:19:33.526 --> 00:19:35.860
Bad news, 'cause
this one's gonna sting.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.693
(Yuya telling)

00:19:39.693 --> 00:19:42.160
Ouchie!
Poor Yuya!

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.593
Keep fighting,
Moon Shadow!

00:19:44.593 --> 00:19:47.726
Do not show Yuya
any mercy.

00:19:47.726 --> 00:19:49.760
(Henrietta)
Declan!

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.160
I thought you were
only trying to
make him remember.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.026
(Yusho)
On the contrary.

00:19:55.026 --> 00:19:57.460
If Yuya can't
win this duel,

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.766
then he will not
be able to save Riley.

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:03.600
And not just
Riley, Mother.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.633
The entire world
will fall.

00:20:05.633 --> 00:20:08.066
Ohh!

00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:10.866
I am not
finished yet Yuya.

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:14.266
I activate...
Kagen's Pendulum ability.

00:20:14.266 --> 00:20:18.133
It gains Jogen's
Pendulum ability.

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:20.400
Aww, no, not again!

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.433
Why don't you pick on
the others, huh?

00:20:22.433 --> 00:20:25.566
Getsuga, take out Yuya's....
remaining Hippo Token!

00:20:25.566 --> 00:20:27.733
(roaring)

00:20:27.733 --> 00:20:30.033
It's like I stole
his lunch money
or something!

00:20:30.033 --> 00:20:33.366
Oh no, Yuya's gonna take
2,000 points of damage!

00:20:33.366 --> 00:20:35.633
But he'll still have
200 life points
left when it's over.

00:20:35.633 --> 00:20:37.533
Isn't that peachy?

00:20:37.533 --> 00:20:40.333
I activate Kagen's
other special ability!

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:43.300
It raises Getsuga's attack
points by 500!

00:20:47.033 --> 00:20:49.000
No way!

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.100
Folks, if this attack hits,
Yuya will be one and done!

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.833
And will be kissing his hopes

00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:56.533
for a pro dueling career
goodbye!
