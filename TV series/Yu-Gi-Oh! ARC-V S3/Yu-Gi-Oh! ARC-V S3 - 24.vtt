00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:04.966
(Yuya)
Previously on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh!
ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.166
Whoa...

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.633
He'’’s toast!

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.833
Sander'’’s pushed him too far.

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:16.400
Aagh!

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.966
Listen,
I know you're mad,

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.066
but you can'’’t let it
control you!

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.400
I know that deep in your heart,
you really don'’’t want to fight.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.900
You wrong!

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.766
The only way
you'll truly be free

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.433
is if you defeat
your enemy Yuya!

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:32.666
Me must destroy Yuya!

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.266
Stop!
What doing?

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.933
Hey!
Unhand me!

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:36.966
Me take that back!

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.766
No laughing!
Paint not funny!

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.166
Chill out.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.366
Life'’’s too short
to be grumpy all the time.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.966
There's a whole world of fun
outside your fort,

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.966
and your monsters are waiting
for you to join the party!

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.766
Colors make me no want to hurt
people anymore.

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:59.000
(Yuya)
Now all our monsters bid
a fond farewell!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.573
Me lose!

00:01:04.173 --> 00:01:07.040
Sorry for pain me cause.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.040
Now you can show the world
your true nature.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.040
Curse you, Yuya!

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.940
You've tamed my beast
and turned my students

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.873
into a bunch of starry‐eyed
turncoats!

00:01:16.873 --> 00:01:18.973
I hope you've had time to
realize

00:01:18.973 --> 00:01:21.340
that there's only one way to get
through to my father,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.140
and that'’’s with force.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.740
If we are to stop him, we must
bring the fight to him.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.540
Or to me!

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.640
Unless you'’’re too scared to have
some fun!

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.280
You'’’re going to destroy
Duel Academy?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.613
(chuckles)

00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:42.446
How can you, when I'’’m turning
all of you into cards?

00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:43.846
Is that Yuya?

00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:45.213
Oh, no, you won'’’t!

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.380
Alexis, no!

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.713
Sora!
The wall!

00:02:49.713 --> 00:02:52.413
Oh yeah, right!

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.886
Stop gawking like geese
and get outta here!

00:03:01.886 --> 00:03:03.420
Like, today!

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.120
Uhh!
Riley!

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.853
Huh?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.653
Uhh! Uhh!

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.686
Huh?

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:24.020
Hmph!

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.720
Look what we have here!

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.653
Two traitorous rats
have hit the stage,

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:33.886
one stuck in a cage,
the other will feel my rage.

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:37.286
Looks like it'’’s just
you and me, Lexie.

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:38.753
(sinister laugh)

00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:40.986
And guess who did their
homework?

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:43.886
Oh, that'’’s right,
I know all about you.

00:03:43.886 --> 00:03:47.420
You faced and defeated every
duelist at Duel Academy

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.853
to reach the top of the class.

00:03:49.853 --> 00:03:51.786
Story around school was you
could beat the elite

00:03:51.786 --> 00:03:53.720
without skipping a beat.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.620
But here'’’s what
you haven'’’t done.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.120
You'’’ve never faced
someone like me.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.160
(manic laughter)

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.426
That'’’s not Yuya.

00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:03.926
No, he might look like him,

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.660
but his name'’’s Yuri
and he'’’s bad news.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.760
Yuri?

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.826
Mr. Sakaki, go!

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.193
I'’’ll take care of Yuri.

00:04:11.193 --> 00:04:12.493
You keep moving!

00:04:12.493 --> 00:04:15.060
Find the Professor and stop him!

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.660
Now go!

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.526
All right,
but please be careful!

00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:25.960
(Yuri)
Ta‐ta!
I'll be seeing you.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.693
But first things first.

00:04:27.693 --> 00:04:29.760
I need to take down
the cream of the crop,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.760
but that shouldn'’’t be
too challenging.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.859
I wouldn'’’t be
so sure about that.

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:35.359
Yeah, thanks for warning me.

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:37.826
Oh! Check this out.

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:39.159
Look familiar?

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.460
An honor deck!

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.093
Right you are!

00:04:42.093 --> 00:04:44.493
Only the top Duel Academy
students get one,

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:46.826
so naturally, I have one
in my possession.

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:49.926
But I have never, ever dueled
with it before.

00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:53.460
I mean, why would I when I have
my Predaplant deck?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.760
But...
You know what?

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.426
I'’’ll let you choose which deck
I play.

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:00.226
I don'’’t need a handicap!

00:05:00.226 --> 00:05:02.300
Play your usual deck.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.433
Duel me with your Predaplants!

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:06.133
I knew you would say that.

00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:07.833
But...

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:12.533
I'’’d rather challenge myself by
winging it!

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.033
I'’’m ready when you are.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.733
Let'’’s duel!
Let's duel!

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:27.900
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.566
I'’’ll start things off.

00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:31.500
First up, I'm activating
the spell

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.666
Machine Angel Absolute Ritual!

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:44.466
And then I can Ritual Summon
a monster

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:47.900
by tributing this card here,
my Cyber Tutubon!

00:06:05.173 --> 00:06:08.973
Descend from the heavens,
Cyber Angel Natasha!

00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:11.806
Aaah!

00:06:11.806 --> 00:06:15.706
Since I tributed Cyber Tutubon
in order to Ritual Summon,

00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:19.906
I can add a Ritual Spell
from my graveyard to my hand!

00:06:19.906 --> 00:06:24.573
So I get my spell Machine Angel
Absolute Ritual back!

00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:27.006
And now I activate its second
effect!

00:06:27.006 --> 00:06:28.673
So get ready!

00:06:28.673 --> 00:06:31.440
All I have to do is
return Cyber Tutubon

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.406
to my deck to Ritual Summon
again!

00:06:33.406 --> 00:06:37.040
Say hello to Natasha number two!

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.206
And my Cyber Angels will make it
even harder for you to beat me

00:06:41.206 --> 00:06:43.240
because they infuse
my life points

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.973
with half their attack points!

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:49.506
That'’’s it?

00:06:49.506 --> 00:06:51.773
I'm supposed to be
shaking in my duel disk

00:06:51.773 --> 00:06:54.973
because you gained a measly
1,000 life points?

00:06:54.973 --> 00:06:58.106
Yeah, you should be because
Cyber Angel Natasha stops you

00:06:58.106 --> 00:06:59.740
from attacking me directly

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.213
as long as I have another
Cyber monster on my field.

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.580
Since Alexis has
two Cyber Angels

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.346
with that special ability,

00:07:06.346 --> 00:07:07.880
that means Yuri
can'’’t attack her at all.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.413
Exactly!

00:07:09.413 --> 00:07:12.513
And that ends my turn.

00:07:12.513 --> 00:07:15.946
Well, that'’’s certainly
not the worst defense
strategy I'’’ve seen.

00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:18.213
But unfortunately for you...

00:07:18.213 --> 00:07:21.313
you happen to be facing

00:07:21.313 --> 00:07:23.880
a tactical genius
extraordinaire!

00:07:28.913 --> 00:07:31.546
Hmm. Which card to choose?

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:33.513
Uh, wait.

00:07:33.513 --> 00:07:34.446
You'’’re really making this up
as you go?

00:07:34.446 --> 00:07:36.180
Mm‐hmm.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.446
But I think...
this card should do nicely.

00:07:39.446 --> 00:07:41.613
I'll kick off my turn
by activating

00:07:41.613 --> 00:07:43.546
the spell card
Ancient Gear Fortress.

00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:47.780
Hmm, hmm.
What next?

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.580
I guess I'’’ll try out
Ancient Gear Catapult.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.346
Voila!

00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:55.580
Now let me see,
what does this card do?

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.713
When I have no monsters,
this Ancient Gear Catapult

00:07:58.713 --> 00:08:00.853
destroys one card on my field.

00:08:00.853 --> 00:08:04.886
Then I guess it's good‐bye
to my Ancient Gear Fortress.

00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:06.886
Talk about stepping
on your own toes!

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:09.553
That'’’s what this wing nut gets
for trying to wing it.

00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:12.420
Actually, I knew exactly
what I was doing.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.186
Because when Ancient Gear
Catapult destroys a card,

00:08:15.186 --> 00:08:17.486
I'’’m allowed to summon
Ancient Gear Gadget.

00:08:17.486 --> 00:08:19.653
La‐di‐da‐da‐da.
Like so!

00:08:22.453 --> 00:08:25.986
And by intentionally destroying
my Ancient Gear Fortress,

00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:28.920
I can summon this card directly
from my hand,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.353
Ancient Gear Wyvern!

00:08:33.286 --> 00:08:35.453
Ancient Gear Wyvern
lets me draw

00:08:35.453 --> 00:08:37.320
another Ancient Gear
from my deck.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.120
Whoa! That'’’s pretty nice!

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.053
I certainly am glad
that I played this!

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:43.853
It'’’s like I'’’m getting two cards
for the price of one!

00:08:43.853 --> 00:08:45.820
What to choose?
There's so many.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.520
Hmm.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.653
Decisions, decisions!

00:08:50.653 --> 00:08:53.720
You know, why don't I just
grab one at random!

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.053
At random?

00:08:55.053 --> 00:08:56.820
He can'’’t be serious!

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.186
Yes!
I'm going for it!

00:08:59.186 --> 00:09:00.993
Hmm.
(chuckles)

00:09:00.993 --> 00:09:02.693
Looks like I drew a doozy!

00:09:02.693 --> 00:09:04.893
Now I just have to figure out
how to summon it.

00:09:04.893 --> 00:09:06.560
Oh, wait, I know.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.993
I'm allowed to treat
Ancient Gear Gadget

00:09:08.993 --> 00:09:10.593
as another Gadget monster.

00:09:10.593 --> 00:09:13.060
So what do you say I turn
it into Red Gadget!

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.493
And then I tribute Red Gadget

00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:18.926
and Ancient Gear Wyvern to
summon the monster...

00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:20.893
that I just got!

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.526
(gasp)
(gasp)

00:09:22.526 --> 00:09:27.260
Say hello to Ancient Gear
Reactor Dragon!

00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:36.460
Say hello to Ancient Gear
Reactor Dragon!

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.293
For someone who's
making it up as he goes,

00:09:39.293 --> 00:09:41.326
I'’’d say I'’’m acing
this turn!

00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:43.093
What a snake!

00:09:43.093 --> 00:09:45.260
Yuri isn'’’t making it up
as he goes along!

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.926
He knows that deck inside out!

00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:49.260
Ready, Lexie?

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.293
Reactor Dragon,
attack Natasha!

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:56.226
Did you forget something?

00:09:56.226 --> 00:10:01.433
Natasha'’’s special abilities
stop you from attacking me!

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.800
Oh! That'’’s not good!

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.800
But it seems that when Ancient
Gear Reactor Dragon attacks,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.466
your monsters can'’’t use their
special abilities.

00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:12.033
So it appears that
I can attack after all,

00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:13.600
and attack you I shall!

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.066
(sighs)

00:10:15.466 --> 00:10:18.400
And wait, there'’’s more,
so much more.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.000
Since I used an Ancient Gear
monster to summon it,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.333
my Reactor Dragon can
deal you damage

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:25.333
even when your monster is in
defense mode.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.433
This deck is simply amazing!

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.866
I mastered this deck
on my very first try.

00:10:34.866 --> 00:10:36.633
Am I a genius or what?

00:10:36.633 --> 00:10:38.566
(grunts)

00:10:38.566 --> 00:10:41.633
I accept that grunt as your
confirmation of my genius.

00:10:41.633 --> 00:10:44.900
Now, since I tributed
a Gadget to summon my Dragon,

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.233
my Dragon can attack twice
in a single turn.

00:10:48.233 --> 00:10:50.933
Oh, but you know that
already, right?

00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:53.666
I forgot you were one of the
brightest cadets here

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:55.266
before your betrayal.

00:10:55.266 --> 00:10:57.833
Of course, you know what
the punishment is

00:10:57.833 --> 00:11:00.000
for deserters like you.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.940
It'’’s permanent expulsion!

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.340
Aah!

00:11:06.506 --> 00:11:08.073
Uhh!

00:11:08.073 --> 00:11:10.473
Of all the terrible luck!

00:11:10.473 --> 00:11:13.906
If I only had one more attack,
I could'’’ve beaten you.

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.506
But come to think of it,

00:11:15.506 --> 00:11:17.740
maybe that'’’s not the worst thing
in the world.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.540
I do enjoy tormenting you so,
but I am on the clock.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.273
So make your moves
quick, dear.

00:11:23.273 --> 00:11:25.206
The faster we finish this,

00:11:25.206 --> 00:11:27.006
the sooner I can catch up with
the rest of your friends.

00:11:27.006 --> 00:11:30.140
Hurry up now!
Make it snappy!

00:11:33.806 --> 00:11:35.773
I'’’m coming, Zuzu!

00:11:35.773 --> 00:11:37.173
Hey, pal!

00:11:37.173 --> 00:11:39.040
Hold up.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.373
A friend of mine'’’s being held
prisoner here.

00:11:41.373 --> 00:11:43.440
She'’’s got pink hair.
Name's Zuzu.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.906
You know where she might be?

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:48.506
Poor, poor Alexis.

00:11:48.506 --> 00:11:51.406
Try as you might to defeat me,
it'’’s all for naught.

00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:53.140
In the end,
I'll just be adding you

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.306
to my ever growing card
collection.

00:11:55.306 --> 00:11:57.406
You sure do like the sound
of your own voice.

00:11:57.406 --> 00:11:59.813
It'’’s time for me
to silence it!

00:11:59.813 --> 00:12:01.880
Now I... draw!

00:12:04.813 --> 00:12:08.446
I activate Natasha'’’s special
ability from my graveyard.

00:12:08.446 --> 00:12:11.613
I banish one Natasha so that I
can resurrect the other one!

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.480
Plus...

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.746
I gain control of your Ancient
Gear Reactor Dragon!

00:12:20.746 --> 00:12:21.846
You did what?

00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:27.580
All right! Now Yuri'’’s gonna get
a taste of his own medicine!

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.446
No way!

00:12:29.446 --> 00:12:32.013
Luring cadets away from
Duel Academy is bad enough,

00:12:32.013 --> 00:12:35.246
but now you'’’re snatching
our monsters away, too?

00:12:35.246 --> 00:12:38.213
How do you think I felt
when you turned my friends
into cards!?

00:12:38.213 --> 00:12:40.113
Maybe now you'll understand
what it's like

00:12:40.113 --> 00:12:42.046
to lose something
important to you.

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:43.680
Something important to you?

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.946
I activate Natasha'’’s
special ability!

00:12:46.946 --> 00:12:51.280
I regain life points equal to
half my monster's attack points.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.180
So, it looks like your
Reactor Dragon's

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.413
gonna be helping me
instead of you!

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.286
And Reactor Dragon
will help even more

00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:03.253
because it can attack
twice in one turn!

00:13:03.253 --> 00:13:05.120
Dealing enough damage
to beat Yuri!

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.353
Time to bring this duel
to a close!

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.686
Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon,
attack Yuri‐‐

00:13:09.686 --> 00:13:11.353
I don't think so, Lexie.

00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:13.653
For you see, I'm activating
the trap card

00:13:13.653 --> 00:13:15.753
Unfinished Ancient Gear!

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.520
This precious little trap card

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.453
allows me summon Ancient Gear
Golem in defense mode

00:13:20.453 --> 00:13:24.053
to intercept and block
Reactor Dragon'’’s attack.

00:13:26.486 --> 00:13:29.786
Unfortunately, Gear Golem's
attack and defense points

00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:31.086
will be cut in half.

00:13:33.153 --> 00:13:35.186
It is unfortunate.

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:39.253
Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon,
disassemble that Gear Golem.

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:42.686
You aren'’’t disassembling
anything!

00:13:42.686 --> 00:13:46.053
When I use Unfinished Ancient
Gear to summon a monster,

00:13:46.053 --> 00:13:48.186
it can'’’t be destroyed
this turn!

00:13:48.186 --> 00:13:51.553
But you'’’re still
gonna take damage!

00:13:51.553 --> 00:13:53.053
Uhh!

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.553
And now, my Reactor Dragon
can attack you again!

00:14:01.093 --> 00:14:02.793
Aah!

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.226
Outstanding move.

00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:11.026
But I still haven'’’t played
my key card yet.

00:14:11.026 --> 00:14:12.960
If you mean Polymerization,
forget it!

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.993
Huh?

00:14:13.993 --> 00:14:15.726
Looks like I hit
the bull'’’s eye.

00:14:15.726 --> 00:14:17.426
But it wasn'’’t that hard
to figure out.

00:14:17.426 --> 00:14:20.293
Everyone knows that Duel Academy
plus Fusion Dimension

00:14:20.293 --> 00:14:22.760
equals summoning monsters
with Polymerization.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.826
But I'’’m gonna put
the kibosh to that

00:14:24.826 --> 00:14:26.626
and defeat you
and Duel Academy

00:14:26.626 --> 00:14:29.626
so that you'’’ll never turn any
of my friends into cards again!

00:14:29.626 --> 00:14:32.193
So if this card
is your key to victory,

00:14:32.193 --> 00:14:34.426
I'’’ll make sure
you never use it!

00:14:34.426 --> 00:14:38.193
I'’’m sending this Polymerization
to the graveyard.

00:14:38.193 --> 00:14:42.560
That lets me activate the spell
Fusion Destruction!

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.260
Fusion Destruction?

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.060
It lets me banish
three Polymerization cards

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.660
from your deck,

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.193
and you take 300 points of
damage for each one.

00:14:50.193 --> 00:14:52.493
So not only do your
life points take a hit,

00:14:52.493 --> 00:14:54.793
but you can'’’t fuse your
monsters together anymore.

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.360
Oh! This is madness!

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.426
You haven't played
Polymerization in this duel yet,

00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:02.366
so that means all three copies
are still in your deck.

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:06.700
And now, I'’’m getting rid of...
all three of them!

00:15:11.566 --> 00:15:16.400
And that means you'’’re about to
take 900 points of damage.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.733
Uhh!

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:23.100
Oh, Yuri,
it'’’s your turn again.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.333
My, my, Lexie, I never knew you
were so heartless.

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:29.033
First you take my monster.

00:15:29.033 --> 00:15:31.066
Then you take my
Polymerization cards.

00:15:31.066 --> 00:15:33.400
That'’’s nothing compared
to what you did.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.066
You turned my closest friends
into cards.

00:15:36.066 --> 00:15:38.533
You did it without
even blinking.

00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:43.000
You and Duel Academy
took them all away.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
But there's one thing
that Duel Academy

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.800
could never
take from me, Yuri.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.133
And what'’’s that, Lexie?

00:15:51.133 --> 00:15:54.766
They could never
take away my hope.

00:15:54.766 --> 00:15:57.300
Well, there'’’s no hope for me.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.706
I'’’ve done too many... things.

00:15:59.706 --> 00:16:01.706
But you'’’re wrong.

00:16:01.706 --> 00:16:03.473
It'’’s never too late.

00:16:03.473 --> 00:16:05.140
You have to believe
what I'’’m saying, Yuri.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.806
I...

00:16:06.806 --> 00:16:10.006
You can walk away from here,
just like I did.

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:11.540
And you'’’ll be free!

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.706
Walk away?
From Duel Academy?

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.340
But I'’’m a champion here.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.506
And this place is the only
home I'’’ve ever known.

00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:23.040
The only home I'’’ve ever known?

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.140
I'’’ve never thought
about that.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.140
I'’’ve been here all my life,
groomed to be the best.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.140
But with every win, I felt like
I lost a friend.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.840
Until one day I realized I was
all alone,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.273
always looking on from
the outside.

00:16:38.273 --> 00:16:41.106
Never part of the crowd.

00:16:41.106 --> 00:16:43.973
But that'’’s when the Professor
showed me the way.

00:16:43.973 --> 00:16:47.273
He was the only one who
appreciated my talent.

00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:50.873
My talent to... hurt people.

00:16:50.873 --> 00:16:52.806
He used me.

00:16:52.806 --> 00:16:54.906
How could I have been
so blind?

00:16:54.906 --> 00:16:56.840
What have I done?

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.546
I regret falling for his lies.

00:16:59.546 --> 00:17:01.546
He ruined my life.

00:17:01.546 --> 00:17:03.180
And now it'’’s too late!

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.680
But, Yuri,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.380
you might think
it's too late,

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.980
but I know you can change,
believe me.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.180
Because once you realize your
mistakes and hit rock bottom,

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.146
there'’’s only one way to go
and that'’’s up.

00:17:14.146 --> 00:17:14.780
Up?

00:17:15.846 --> 00:17:19.580
I'’’ve got a better idea, Lexie.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.913
Why don'’’t I drag you
all the way down with me!

00:17:22.913 --> 00:17:27.246
Now that our little chit chat'’’s
all done, let'’’s continue!

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:30.780
This Ancient Gear Workshop
will get me primed

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.246
and back into gear!

00:17:33.246 --> 00:17:35.080
The spell allows me to return

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.246
one Ancient Gear in my graveyard
back to my hand.

00:17:38.246 --> 00:17:41.746
I retrieve Ancient Gear Wyvern
and then summon it!

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.246
And like before,
summoning Wyvern means

00:17:46.246 --> 00:17:51.046
I can add another Ancient Gear
to my hand from my deck.

00:17:51.046 --> 00:17:54.813
And I know the perfect card
to choose.

00:17:54.813 --> 00:17:58.813
Just like me, this Ancient Gear
Box is full of surprises!

00:17:58.813 --> 00:18:03.520
By sending it to the graveyard,
I can activate a spell...

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.386
Super Polymerization!

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:09.486
Super Polymerization?

00:18:09.486 --> 00:18:11.586
But that'’’s impossible.

00:18:11.586 --> 00:18:13.220
Honor decks shouldn'’’t
have that card!

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.220
(laughing)

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.953
My deck does because I added
Super Polymerization to it!

00:18:19.953 --> 00:18:23.053
You didn't really think
I'd rush into a duel blindly

00:18:23.053 --> 00:18:25.753
with a deck I hadn'’’t prepared
ahead of time, did you?

00:18:25.753 --> 00:18:29.220
Oh, wait!
You actually did!

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.553
(manic laughter)

00:18:30.553 --> 00:18:32.953
You are so gullible!

00:18:32.953 --> 00:18:37.453
So all along,
you were lying to me.

00:18:37.453 --> 00:18:39.986
Don'’’t think of it as lying,
Lexie,

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:43.453
I was just bending
the truth a widdle bit!

00:18:47.553 --> 00:18:49.586
This battle is over!

00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:53.286
I use Super Polymerization to
fuse a monster

00:18:53.286 --> 00:18:55.220
that'’’s on my field with a
monster that is on yours!

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.153
Oh, no!

00:18:57.153 --> 00:18:59.220
You took something
that belongs to me,

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.760
and now I'’’m going
to take it back.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.326
Hold on!

00:19:02.326 --> 00:19:04.026
My Fusion Destruction
shouldn't let you

00:19:04.026 --> 00:19:06.626
activate any
Polymerization spells.

00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:10.726
True, but that's why this card
is Super Polymerization!

00:19:10.726 --> 00:19:12.860
Your pathetic little spell
can'’’t affect it!

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.993
Shocking, isn'’’t it?

00:19:16.993 --> 00:19:20.893
Now watch and weep as I fuse my
mighty Ancient Gear Golem,

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:25.893
Ancient Gear Wyvern, and Ancient
Gear Reactor Dragon!

00:19:25.893 --> 00:19:28.093
Using my superior skills,

00:19:28.093 --> 00:19:32.293
I'll unite all the wisdom and
savagery of past ages

00:19:32.293 --> 00:19:35.626
into a brutal behemoth!

00:19:35.626 --> 00:19:37.726
I Fusion Summon!

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.626
Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem!

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:48.293
There'’’s no way
I can stop that thing.

00:19:48.293 --> 00:19:50.160
(sinister laugh)

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.860
I must admit,

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.293
I'’’m almost sorry I have
to turn you into a card.

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:56.326
Almost.

00:19:56.326 --> 00:19:58.993
I thought you could change,
but I was wrong.

00:19:58.993 --> 00:20:02.266
(laughs)
So sorry to disappoint.

00:20:02.266 --> 00:20:06.633
Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem,
flatten Cyber Angel Natasha!

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.633
And eliminate the rest of
Lexie'’’s life points!

00:20:14.966 --> 00:20:16.766
Aah!

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.666
You said that there was hope
for me, Alexis.

00:20:27.666 --> 00:20:30.100
But you couldn'’’t
have been more wrong.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.266
I'’’ll never change because
I'’’m perfect just the way I am!

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:36.833
The Professor was so right
to pick me out of everyone

00:20:36.833 --> 00:20:38.433
to do his bidding.

00:20:38.433 --> 00:20:41.566
With the power I possess,
all will fall to me.

00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:44.533
All will be turned into cards
until there is no more threat!

00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:45.966
It'’’s over.

00:20:45.966 --> 00:20:48.000
Ya think?
(sinister laugh)

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.566
(groans)

00:20:54.466 --> 00:20:58.033
(Yuri)
One down, one to go.

00:20:58.033 --> 00:21:00.240
Oh, Sora.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.240
You'’’re up next.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.673
(rumbling)
The gate's rising!

00:21:05.673 --> 00:21:07.873
You'’’re not as dumb
as you look.

00:21:07.873 --> 00:21:11.873
My Duel Disk is programmed to
control the security system.

00:21:11.873 --> 00:21:14.640
I could have opened those bars
during my duel with Alexis.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.473
But then again...

00:21:16.473 --> 00:21:20.206
I prefer to card my victims
one at a time.

00:21:20.206 --> 00:21:22.073
(sinister laugh)

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:23.340
You'’’re sick!

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.740
Maybe so, but you're the one

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.140
who'’’s going to be in critical
condition soon!

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.040
That way.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.006
They'’’re holding Zuzu
up there in the lab.

00:21:33.006 --> 00:21:34.773
Thank you!

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.706
Zuzu!
