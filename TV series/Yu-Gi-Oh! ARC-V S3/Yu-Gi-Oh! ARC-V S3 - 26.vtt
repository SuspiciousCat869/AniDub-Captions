WEBVTT

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.566
Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V!"

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.333
(Professor giggling)

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.400
(Lulu gasps)

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.533
Prepare to duel!

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.433
I'll bet you
hundred to one

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:16.633
that Duel Academy
scrambled her brain.

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.033
(Lulu and Yuya)
Let's duel!

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:20.233
Here's one card
you've never seen!

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:20.500
(both gasp)

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.800
My spell card
Parasite Discharge

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.900
allows me to summon
a Fusion Parasite
from my deck!

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.833
Then my pretty Parasite
attaches on to my Nightingale!

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.666
Let's crush that gnat!

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.533
And Lulu will be
back to normal!

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.400
Time to put the pest
to rest!

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.400
(Shay)
It won't work.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.300
Destroying Fusion Parasite
isn't enough to save her.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.666
(Yuya and Yuto gasp)

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.766
The Professor
must hold the cure.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.033
It's our only chance.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.700
Let's fight!

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.633
It's only fair to
even up the sides.

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:55.500
My royal highness,
say a quick good night

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.900
to his Phantom Knight!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.533
Unh!

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.640
You see those?
Huh?

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.106
Those eggs were created
by The Professor's

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.640
right‐hand man.
The Doctor.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.406
And they'll all hatch
into lovely parasites.

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:13.306
I got one right here.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.940
And, Yuya?
Zuzu's been infected too.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.840
What kind of monster
would harm Zuzu?!

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.506
(shouting angrily)

00:01:23.506 --> 00:01:27.040
(Lulu and Celina gasp)

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.140
Yuto?!

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.273
I didn't travel through
dimensions

00:01:31.273 --> 00:01:32.540
to leave empty‐handed.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.473
Lulu, Celina, Rin...
And Zuzu!

00:01:35.473 --> 00:01:37.373
(both)
They're coming with us!

00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:39.806
The only thing coming
is your defeat, Yuya.

00:01:39.806 --> 00:01:42.640

00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:49.180
Yuri's wrecking
my life points,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.813
but I can't give up!

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.980
I'm activating
the spell Frightfur Fusion

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.780
to turn this duel around!

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.513
By banishing two
Edge Imp Frightfuloids

00:02:58.513 --> 00:03:00.446
and my Frightfur Bear
from the graveyard

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.520
I can Fusion Summon!

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.920
Fury of bear
and stuffings of pain...

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.920
When the three come together,
my comeback will be attained!

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.320
I Fusion Summon!

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.453
Here comes the hairy...
scary...

00:03:13.453 --> 00:03:15.986
bear‐y...
Frightfur Chimera!

00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:18.353
(heads laughing)

00:03:20.753 --> 00:03:24.353
Frightfur Chimera,
attack Ancient Gear Hydra!

00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:33.786
I finally got
the upper hand now, Yuri!

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:36.853
Because when my
Frightfur Chimera
destroys your monster,

00:03:36.853 --> 00:03:39.253
it's summoned on
to my field!

00:03:39.253 --> 00:03:43.320
And your Hydra does more
than join my side.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.453
It gives Chimera 300
additional attack points!

00:03:47.453 --> 00:03:50.120
Now you know that
messing with my monsters

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.053
is a major mistake!

00:03:52.053 --> 00:03:55.486
Maybe so, but I've never
been one to play nice.

00:03:55.486 --> 00:03:58.253
And I'm not starting now.

00:03:58.253 --> 00:04:01.926
Hydra, attack!

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:08.226
(roars)

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.493
Go ahead and try
anything you want.

00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:17.060
You'll never defeat
my Parasite Queen.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.293
Be careful, Yuto.

00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:20.926
We don't know
what it can do.

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:22.460
In that case,
I'll just swat it down

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.760
before it gets a chance
to do anything!

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.893
Huh!

00:04:26.893 --> 00:04:30.093
I activate the Action Spell
Single Destruction!

00:04:30.093 --> 00:04:35.359
So now I can exterminate
your one and only monster!

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:37.159
This guy's starting
to bug me.

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.093
Say your goodbyes
to Parasite Queen!

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:42.060
Not happening!

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.093
I activate Fusion Parasite's
special ability!

00:04:45.093 --> 00:04:46.860
By sending it
to the graveyard,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.660
my Queen stays safe
and sound!

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.826
Sorry, but destroying
my Queen

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:52.560
isn't going to be
that easy.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.426
By getting rid
of that Fusion Parasite,

00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:57.726
your Queen lost
300 attack points.

00:04:57.726 --> 00:05:00.593
You weakened her up.
Good job, Yuto.

00:05:00.593 --> 00:05:03.800
Mm‐hmm, and when I destroy
the other Fusion Parasite,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800
she'll be even weaker!

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.966
Dark Rebellion...

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:08.200
(Yuya)
Attack!

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.333
Take out Parasite Queen!

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:13.866
(Yuya and Yuto)
Mauling Mandible Charge!

00:05:13.866 --> 00:05:16.533
I said this wasn't
going to be easy!

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:19.333
Parasite Queen releases
her Parasite Fusion

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:22.600
and equips it
on to your dragon.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.700
And once it's nestled in,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.266
Fusion Parasite sucks
800 attack points

00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:28.333
out of your dragon!

00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:31.766
(roars)

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:33.800
Man! I never
would have guessed

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.800
that getting rid of
that thing would be harder

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.333
than getting
rid of than a leech.

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:40.000
That thing's not
going away anytime soon!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.333
Now for the payoff!

00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:43.600
I activate the trap
Power Parasite!

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.400
Now I can take a Fusion
Parasite from the graveyard

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.300
and equip it
on to Parasite Queen,

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.766
raising her attack points
by 300!

00:05:53.933 --> 00:05:56.266
(Yuya)
We need to dethrone her!

00:05:56.266 --> 00:05:58.000
I activate the spell card

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.633
The Phantom Knights'
Round Blaze!

00:06:00.633 --> 00:06:03.773
By banishing
two Phantom Knights
from my graveyard,

00:06:03.773 --> 00:06:05.540
it triggers
total destruction

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.040
by burning up
both of our monsters.

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:11.706
Whatever!

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:14.040
By sending Fusion Parasite
to the graveyard,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.840
my Queen isn't destroyed!

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.573
Well, what works for you,
works for me.

00:06:18.573 --> 00:06:21.573
I send my Fusion Parasite
to the graveyard too,

00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:24.440
to save my Dragon!

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.040
(Celina chuckles)

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.406
All that flash and pizazz

00:06:27.406 --> 00:06:30.140
amounted to a whole lot
of nothing, Yuto!

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.073
(Yuto)
But I'm not done.

00:06:31.073 --> 00:06:33.140
Not even close.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.940
Because my spell
The Phantom Knights
of Round Blaze

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.373
has another effect!

00:06:37.373 --> 00:06:39.806
I can hit you with
800 points of damage

00:06:39.806 --> 00:06:42.006
for each monster
that was just sent
to the graveyard!

00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:43.773
(both groaning)

00:06:46.673 --> 00:06:49.940
I place one card facedown
and end my turn!

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.373
Then, it's my move!

00:06:52.373 --> 00:06:55.406
I'll start by activating
Parasite Factory!

00:06:55.406 --> 00:06:57.973
I can take a Fusion
Parasite in my deck

00:06:57.973 --> 00:06:59.973
and equip it on
Celina's Parasite Queen

00:06:59.973 --> 00:07:02.446
to take control of her!

00:07:02.446 --> 00:07:05.846
And now my Queen has even
more sting than before!

00:07:05.846 --> 00:07:07.346
I'll follow that up

00:07:07.346 --> 00:07:10.580
by activating the spell
Parasite Discharge!

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.146
Celina and I infect your
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:17.746
with two Fusion Parasites
from both our graveyards!

00:07:17.746 --> 00:07:19.313
Unh! Again?

00:07:19.313 --> 00:07:22.080
Thanks to Parasite Queen's
special ability,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.113
each Fusion
Parasite drains

00:07:24.113 --> 00:07:27.680
your Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon's attack points!

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.246
Not only that, but with
two Fusion Parasites

00:07:30.246 --> 00:07:31.846
back on the field,

00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:35.713
Parasite Queen gains
600 attack points.

00:07:35.713 --> 00:07:39.346
Parasite Queen,
give his Xyz Dragon
the royal treatment!

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.780
Huh?

00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:48.946
Unh!
I activate Evasion!

00:07:48.946 --> 00:07:51.780
So Dark Rebellion
dodges the attack!

00:07:54.246 --> 00:07:57.213
Nice try, but I'll still
hit my target

00:07:57.213 --> 00:07:58.813
with Parasite Maneuver!

00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:00.786
This spell card will
allow Parasite Queen

00:08:00.786 --> 00:08:02.220
to attack once again!

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.086
Seriously!?
You better believe it!

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:07.520
Parasite Queen, attack!

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.853
(grunts)

00:08:11.853 --> 00:08:14.420
Unh! I activate Miracle!

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.153
It saves Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon from destruction

00:08:18.153 --> 00:08:20.253
and cuts any damage
I take in half!

00:08:20.253 --> 00:08:22.120
Aah!

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.620
(Lulu)
But I bet it still stings!

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.553
(Yuto and Yuya shouting)

00:08:28.686 --> 00:08:30.086
Unh!

00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:37.186
(moaning)

00:08:37.186 --> 00:08:38.720
Yuto?

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.553
Oh no!
I can't feel him anymore?

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:42.253
Yuto!

00:08:42.253 --> 00:08:43.820
Too easy!

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.453
Go ahead, Celina!

00:08:45.453 --> 00:08:47.353
Make your move.

00:08:47.353 --> 00:08:49.053
With pleasure!

00:08:49.053 --> 00:08:52.186
I'll start by activating
Parasite Factory!

00:08:52.186 --> 00:08:54.820
I equip my Fusion Parasite
on Parasite Queen

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.686
to regain control of her

00:08:56.686 --> 00:08:59.386
and raise her
attack points by 300!

00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:06.560
Oh, man!
3,000 attack points!

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.460
Only way to survive this
is with an Action Card!

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.160
You have to get one first!

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.360
Oh! A parasite!

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.693
Yes! Yes!

00:09:27.693 --> 00:09:31.926
My parasite will now
infect his brain!

00:09:31.926 --> 00:09:33.860
Unh!

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.226
At last... he's mine!

00:09:36.226 --> 00:09:39.226
Yuya Sakaki is now under
my complete control!

00:09:39.226 --> 00:09:41.193
(giggles)

00:09:41.193 --> 00:09:44.793
He will say and do
whatever I tell him to!

00:09:49.393 --> 00:09:52.393
(moaning)

00:09:52.393 --> 00:09:53.860
(chuckles)

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.160
Looks like Yuya is
about to join our side!

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.366
Never!

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:04.366
(both)
Huh?!

00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:06.166
Why would I ever
join your side?!

00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:09.200
(Lulu and Celina gasp)

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.966
No way!

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:13.700
No one ever resisted
my parasite!

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.833
(groaning)

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:21.700
Quickly!
Parasite Queen, attack!

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.333
Destroy his Dragon!

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.833
I activate The Phantom
Knights of Wrong Magnetring!

00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:30.633
By discarding
a card from my hand

00:10:30.633 --> 00:10:33.266
that's identical
to one in my graveyard,

00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:35.733
this trap will bring
the curtain down
on our battle.

00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:39.400
And then Wrong Magnetring
transforms into a monster!

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.366
So now you've gotta
deal with it too!

00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:44.433
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:46.100
But that's fine.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.200
I can prolong the pain
and suffering.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.700
(Yuri giggling)

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.100
You ready?

00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:58.366
I activate the spell
Ancient Gear Inspection.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:01.306
By returning
one Ancient Gear
monster on the field

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:03.606
to my hand,
I get to draw one card.

00:11:03.606 --> 00:11:06.940
So I'm taking my Hydra back.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.773
Can't stand
getting it sticky

00:11:08.773 --> 00:11:12.340
with your
lollypop fingers.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.106
(giggling)

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:15.806
Merci!

00:11:15.806 --> 00:11:18.006
Since I lost
Ancient Gear Hydra,

00:11:18.006 --> 00:11:19.706
Frightfur Chimera's
attack points

00:11:19.706 --> 00:11:21.540
are now gonna drop by 300.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.573
But it still has enough power
to be a major threat!

00:11:24.573 --> 00:11:26.740
I'm still in control
of this duel!

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.340
(giggles)
Huh?!

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.973
Not after I activate...
this Polymerization!

00:11:31.973 --> 00:11:35.240
Once I fuse together
my Ancient Gear Golem,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.240
Ancient Gear Gadget,
and my Ancient Gear Wyvern,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.373
I'll dominate this duel!

00:11:40.373 --> 00:11:42.606
I Fusion Summon...

00:11:42.606 --> 00:11:46.073
Ultimate Ancient
Gear Golem!

00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:49.040
(roars)

00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:57.040
(Yuri)
I Fusion Summon
Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem!

00:11:59.073 --> 00:12:02.346
Now, Sora... Ultimate
Ancient Gear Golem

00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:04.380
will crush your Chimera

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.080
and the rest
of your life points!

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.180
(Sora yelling)

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.346
Unh! Oof!

00:12:21.646 --> 00:12:23.246
Game over, Sora.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.813
(Yugo)
Don't even think about it!

00:12:34.113 --> 00:12:35.513
(groans)

00:12:35.513 --> 00:12:37.813
Hey, Yuya, are you okay?
Yuto!

00:12:37.813 --> 00:12:41.146
I'm fine.
I draw!

00:12:41.146 --> 00:12:43.313
You know, there's
nothing wrong

00:12:43.313 --> 00:12:45.113
about my
Wrong Magnetring

00:12:45.113 --> 00:12:47.780
'cause it attracts all your
Fusion Parasites to him!

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.846
And by tributing
Wrong Magnetring

00:12:49.846 --> 00:12:52.146
along with those four
creepy crawling Parasites,

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:54.746
I get to draw two cards!

00:12:54.746 --> 00:12:56.613
And since they're gone,

00:12:56.613 --> 00:12:58.746
so are 1,200 of your
Queen's attack points.

00:13:02.653 --> 00:13:04.620
I can't believe that
he was actually able

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.486
to get rid of
all our Parasites!

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:08.686
Grr!
That won't keep us down!

00:13:08.686 --> 00:13:10.386
I'm activating

00:13:10.386 --> 00:13:12.753
the spell card
Odd‐Eyes Accel

00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:15.953
to summon Odd‐eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:13:15.953 --> 00:13:18.086
So now you've got
a double dose of Dragons

00:13:18.086 --> 00:13:19.420
you have to deal with!

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.620
(Dragons roaring)

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.320
Yuya has summoned
two of his strongest monsters.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.553
But... they're still
no match

00:13:27.553 --> 00:13:30.853
for my parasites!

00:13:30.853 --> 00:13:34.686
I activate the trap
Parasite Spell!

00:13:34.686 --> 00:13:37.053
Since there's a Parasite
Monster on the field,

00:13:37.053 --> 00:13:40.020
I can activate one spell
from any graveyard!

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.853
So I activate a spell
from Lulu's graveyard‐‐

00:13:42.853 --> 00:13:45.386
Parasite Discharge!

00:13:45.386 --> 00:13:49.086
It lets me summon a Fusion
Parasite from my deck!

00:13:49.086 --> 00:13:52.986
And I'll use a trap too...
Parasite Generator!

00:13:52.986 --> 00:13:55.520
Since Celina summoned
a Fusion Parasite,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.486
I get to summon one too.

00:13:59.486 --> 00:14:00.726
And there's more.

00:14:00.726 --> 00:14:02.626
Celina and I
get to resurrect

00:14:02.626 --> 00:14:04.693
all our other Parasites
from our graveyards!

00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:08.760
And they're tougher
than before

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.293
because your
special abilities
can't destroy them!

00:14:11.293 --> 00:14:13.026
They'll keep
coming and coming

00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:15.126
because each Parasite
now counts as two,

00:14:15.126 --> 00:14:17.860
meaning there are
12 Parasites on our field!

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.793
And since Parasite Queen
gains 300 attack points

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:22.726
for every Parasite
you see here,

00:14:22.726 --> 00:14:25.426
this brood has made
our Queen unstoppable!

00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:28.460
Those attack points
are insane!

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.360
You look so frightened.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.693
So scared of what's
staring you down, Yuya.

00:14:32.693 --> 00:14:34.226
It's almost unfair.

00:14:34.226 --> 00:14:35.593
Mmph!

00:14:35.593 --> 00:14:37.260
(Doctor laughing)

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.860
How splendid!

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.493
I just knew my parasites
were the best!

00:14:41.493 --> 00:14:43.093
That's the Doctor!

00:14:43.093 --> 00:14:44.760
So you're the one
behind this!

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.260
Yes, my boy.
I am responsible.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.060
Impressive, isn't it?

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.493
Where is Zuzu?

00:14:51.493 --> 00:14:53.026
(chuckles)

00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:56.426
Rescuing your friend Zuzu
will not prove possible.

00:14:56.426 --> 00:14:58.026
You'll never make it
to my lab.

00:14:58.026 --> 00:14:59.793
Besides, you're too late.

00:14:59.793 --> 00:15:01.366
Zuzu's already
under my control.

00:15:01.366 --> 00:15:04.133
She makes a lovely
addition to my collection,

00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:05.666
don't you agree?

00:15:05.666 --> 00:15:07.833
(Yuya)
You leave Zuzu alone!

00:15:07.833 --> 00:15:09.466
(both)
Huh?

00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:13.633
(Yuya grunting)

00:15:13.633 --> 00:15:15.466
(Parasites squeaking)

00:15:17.966 --> 00:15:19.733
Grr!

00:15:19.733 --> 00:15:22.333
Our Parasites look like
they're scared.

00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:24.500
Yeah, like they want
to run and hide.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.233
I wonder why.

00:15:26.233 --> 00:15:27.966
It's all because of me!

00:15:27.966 --> 00:15:30.266
They realize
they're in danger!

00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:31.800
A lot of danger!

00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:36.966
Huh!
Huh!

00:15:36.966 --> 00:15:40.233
I activate The Phantom
Knights' Possession!

00:15:40.233 --> 00:15:43.566
My Xyz Monster can now have
a Level equal

00:15:43.566 --> 00:15:46.300
to another one of my monsters
on my field!

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.866
So just like Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon,

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:53.000
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
is now Level 7!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.700
So now I have two monsters
with the same Level!

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.266
I overlay Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon

00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:00.773
and Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon

00:16:00.773 --> 00:16:02.973
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.806
By joining together

00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:11.473
two of the strongest
Dragons in the universe,

00:16:11.473 --> 00:16:14.340
I'll create a Dragon
that's all the rage!

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.573
(Yuto and Yuya)
I Xyz Summon...

00:16:16.573 --> 00:16:20.240
Odd‐Eyes Raging Dragon!

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.273
(roaring)

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.773
(Yuya)
I Xyz Summon...

00:16:31.773 --> 00:16:34.740
Odd‐Eyes Raging Dragon!

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.640
Unbelievable.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.040
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.473
I activate Raging Dragon's
special ability.

00:16:44.473 --> 00:16:46.606
By using all of its
Overlay Units,

00:16:46.606 --> 00:16:49.473
it destroys all other cards
on the field

00:16:49.473 --> 00:16:52.740
and gains 200 attack points
for each one!

00:16:55.206 --> 00:16:57.140
(roars)

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.173
Hmph! So what?
That can't harm us.

00:17:00.173 --> 00:17:03.113
That's right, because due
to Parasite Generator,

00:17:03.113 --> 00:17:05.880
our Parasites
can't be destroyed
by special abilities!

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.580
(Celina chuckling)
All that effort for nothing.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.813
You're still going to lose.

00:17:10.813 --> 00:17:13.480
All that Raging Dragon
is going to rage about

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.280
is how pathetically
you played him.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.480
Yes, but Raging Dragon
negates the effects

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.713
of all Spell
and Trap cards!

00:17:19.713 --> 00:17:22.580
So all your Parasites
will still be destroyed

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.980
No, this can't be!
This is bad!

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.746
(roaring)

00:17:33.846 --> 00:17:36.713
(Yuto)
Your entire swarm
is destroyed,

00:17:36.713 --> 00:17:40.680
and their demise fuels
my Raging Dragon's strength!

00:17:44.613 --> 00:17:47.113
I can't believe
we lost everything!

00:17:47.113 --> 00:17:49.313
It's over.

00:17:49.313 --> 00:17:52.413
No, it's not over yet!

00:17:52.413 --> 00:17:54.713
You can only attack
and defeat one of us!

00:17:54.713 --> 00:17:57.113
So the other still
has a chance next turn!

00:17:57.113 --> 00:17:58.946
There is no next turn!

00:17:58.946 --> 00:18:00.186
Huh?!
Huh?!

00:18:00.186 --> 00:18:02.820
(Yuya)
Because Odd‐Eyes
Raging Dragon...

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.720
(Yuto)
...can attack twice this turn!

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.453
(roars)

00:18:15.453 --> 00:18:19.753
Now Odd‐Eyes
Raging Dragon, attack!

00:18:19.753 --> 00:18:22.886
(Yuya and Yuto)
Infernal Fury Strike!

00:18:22.886 --> 00:18:25.620
(roars)

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.820
(both yelling)

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.686
(breathing heavily)

00:18:42.953 --> 00:18:44.220
Huh?

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.820
(Celina moaning)

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.620
(Lulu moaning)

00:18:54.986 --> 00:18:56.620
Huh?

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.320
Celina!
Are you all right?

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.360
(moaning weakly)

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.560
(both)
Lulu, say something please!

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.893
Lulu...

00:19:07.893 --> 00:19:10.726
Oh!
Shay... you're awake!?

00:19:10.726 --> 00:19:13.860
Whaa! Unh! Grr!

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.726
Celina! Lulu! Wait!

00:19:16.726 --> 00:19:17.860
(Shay)
Stop them, Yuya!

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.126
What about you?

00:19:19.126 --> 00:19:21.426
I'll be all right.

00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:22.926
Hurry, before
it's too late!

00:19:22.926 --> 00:19:24.793
Okay.

00:19:28.493 --> 00:19:31.026
(Duel Academy student)
Well, well, well!

00:19:31.026 --> 00:19:33.693
Yusho Sakaki, I presume?

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:42.293
The Professor's
expecting you.

00:19:42.293 --> 00:19:44.560
This way, if you please.

00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:46.960
Yuya!

00:19:47.926 --> 00:19:48.826
(Yuya)
Hold up!

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.493
Ah, Yuya Sakaki.

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:57.426
We finally meet in person.

00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:58.960
I brought
several of your friends

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.566
that you were dying to meet,

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:03.566
but I don't know
if they're dying to meet you.

00:20:03.566 --> 00:20:07.200
Zuzu‐‐ Ah?!

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.233
(Doctor chuckling)

00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:11.533
You maniac!
Let me outa here!

00:20:11.533 --> 00:20:13.166
I think not.

00:20:13.166 --> 00:20:15.300
I prefer you
exactly where you are.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.033
Zuzu, it's me!
It's Yuya!

00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:19.733
You just have to
snap out of it!

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:21.333
You just have to!

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:22.933
She doesn't have to
do anything,

00:20:22.933 --> 00:20:24.933
except my bidding,
of course.

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:26.133
(giggling)

00:20:26.133 --> 00:20:27.900
I'm pleased to report

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.200
<i>that Yuya Sakaki</i>
<i>is safely in custody.</i>

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.300
<i>Wake up!</i>
<i>Please!</i>
<i>Zuzu!</i>

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:35.500
Now come along, girls.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.400
Leave this nice young man
alone to stew in his misery.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.600
Grr, you won't get
away with this!

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.600
Don't go, Zuzu!

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.133
Listen to me, please!

00:20:44.133 --> 00:20:45.600
Zuzu!

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.866
(growling)

00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:52.800
We brought them, sir,
per your orders!

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.000
Well done.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.466
You may go now.

00:20:56.466 --> 00:20:59.840
At long last... Yusho.

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:07.806
My dad?!
