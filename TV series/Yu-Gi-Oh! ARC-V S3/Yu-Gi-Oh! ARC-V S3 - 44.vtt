WEBVTT

00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.900
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:07.266
Gong and Yuya joining forces

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.200
to take down Sylvio
and Moon Shadow!

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.433
Get set, Yuya,

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:14.033
because the second act
is where the real fun kicks in!

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:15.800
Ha!
Here goes...

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.433
Looks like your ship
has sailed.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:21.433
(Yuya)
Yeah, we all went
to the Fusion Dimension

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:24.300
to invade Duel Academy
and rescue our friends!

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.166
One friend in particular...

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.333
But who was it?

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:32.633
Listen!
It's about Zuzu!

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.333
(gasps)

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.400
That's who I was looking for!

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400
Zuzu!

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.300
She was my best friend.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.400
How could I ever
forget her?!

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.500
Get to attacking,
Big Benkei!

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.200
Aah!
(grunting)

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.366
Now that Sylvio's
out of the way,

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.500
you're next,
Moon Shadow!

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.133
(gasping, grunting)

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.906
Yeah, I lost it.

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:04.206
Completely.

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:09.206
You wanted a more brutal duel,
so I gave it to you!

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:11.506
Astrograph Sorcerer,
I call on you

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:13.573
to use your mystical powers

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.573
to reshape us into
a single unstoppable force!

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.706
(gasps)
No!

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:22.440
I'm Z‐ARC!

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:29.740

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.213
I remember...

00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:32.480
I totally lost control
and turned into Z‐ARC

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.613
and threatened the world!

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:37.380
Until Zuzu saved me.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.380
I believe in you, Yuya.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.013
You've never given up
ever in your life,

00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:44.680
and you're not
going to start now.

00:02:46.513 --> 00:02:49.713
Zuzu, how could I have
ever forgotten you?

00:02:49.713 --> 00:02:53.046
(screaming)

00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:57.046
Now's your chance, Riley!
End this duel!

00:02:58.313 --> 00:03:00.286
(screaming)

00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:04.286
Aah!

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:08.886
And where's Riley?

00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:10.453
(Henrietta) Riley is
here with me. Huh?

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:15.720
That baby's Riley?
Whoa!

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.153
How'd Riley go
from dueling to diapers?

00:03:18.153 --> 00:03:20.453
When Riley defeated Z‐ARC,

00:03:20.453 --> 00:03:23.353
Riley absorbed
all of Z‐ARC's evil essence.

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:26.520
Who knows how the universe
truly works?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.253
But what I do know
is that sealing Z‐ARC

00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:32.053
caused Riley
to revert to a baby.

00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:34.086
(Sylvio)
Oh, I see the resemblance now.

00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:36.986
Same unblinking eyes.

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:39.520
(Declan) <i>Riley wanted</i>
<i>to make sure Z‐ARC</i>

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.120
<i>could never resurrect ever</i>
<i>again, and Riley succeeded.</i>

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.520
Well, in part.
Huh?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.520
<i>Riley's sacrifice was only</i>
<i>a temporary reprieve.</i>

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.053
<i>Given time,</i>
<i>Z‐ARC will resurrect again.</i>

00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:53.353
Say what?

00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:55.486
<i>But this time,</i>
<i>when he does,</i>

00:03:55.486 --> 00:03:58.320
<i>we will be unable</i>
<i>to put a stop to him.</i>

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.260
Oh!
That sounds schnizeldingers!

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.093
If that means bad,
you're right!

00:04:03.093 --> 00:04:04.626
(gasps)

00:04:04.626 --> 00:04:06.360
Come on, get real.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.293
We beat him once,
we'll do it again!

00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:12.493
Unfortunately, things aren't
quite that simple.
Huh?

00:04:12.493 --> 00:04:15.026
<i>Not only did we barely</i>
<i>defeat him last time,</i>

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:17.660
<i>but we no longer have the</i>
<i>cards that sealed him away.</i>

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.160
<i>And without those cards,</i>
<i>well...</i>

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.293
<i>I'm never one</i>
<i>to give up, but...</i>

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:26.960
Z‐ARC's evil
will continue to grow,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.460
eventually robbing Riley
of all happiness and joy.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.593
Yes, even now I can tell.

00:04:34.593 --> 00:04:37.693
(Henrietta)
Because this baby
has never smiled.

00:04:37.693 --> 00:04:40.226
<i>There's gotta be something</i>
<i>we can do.</i>

00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:42.526
<i>There's always</i>
<i>something we can do!</i>

00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:44.160
<i>I had a pretty good nap</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.893
<i>so I have plenty</i>
<i>of energy to fight!</i>

00:04:45.893 --> 00:04:48.126
<i>So what are we gonna do?</i>

00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:50.726
(Declan) <i>Not "we."</i>
<i>You.</i>

00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:54.160
Wait, it all depends on me?
<i>Yes, Yuya.</i>

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.093
<i>The fate of the world rests</i>
<i>solely on your shoulders.</i>

00:04:57.093 --> 00:04:58.826
Seriously?

00:04:58.826 --> 00:04:59.993
Come on, if you're looking
for a hero,

00:04:59.993 --> 00:05:01.733
I'm standing right here!

00:05:01.733 --> 00:05:04.900
So? Who's keister
do I gotta kick?

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.733
<i>Nobody's.</i>

00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:09.900
<i>Our one mission</i>
<i>is to make Riley smile.</i>

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.600
Make Riley smile?

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.866
Why don't we just buy Riley
a squeaky toy?

00:05:13.866 --> 00:05:16.100
That would put
a smile on my face.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.166
<i>I'm sure it would,</i>
<i>but if Z‐ARC</i>

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:22.100
<i>is darkening Riley's heart,</i>
<i>then the only way to conquer</i>
<i>it</i>

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.333
<i>is to make Riley</i>
<i>feel joy again,</i>

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.966
<i>not with gimmicks,</i>
<i>but true happiness.</i>

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:28.766
<i>And I believe only the best</i>
<i>dueltaining</i>

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:30.700
<i>can bring a smile</i>
<i>to Riley's face.</i>

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.666
The best dueltaining?

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:38.000
Then I gotta give it my all,
like I never have before!

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.866
<i>That's correct,</i>
<i>even better than my best!</i>

00:05:40.866 --> 00:05:42.200
Whoa! Dad?

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.066
It's Yusho!

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:44.700
Darling!

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.466
<i>I taught you how</i>
<i>to dueltain,</i>

00:05:46.466 --> 00:05:49.433
<i>but now is the time</i>
<i>for the student to graduate</i>

00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:51.233
<i>and come into his own.</i>

00:05:51.233 --> 00:05:53.766
<i>Take what you learned from me</i>
<i>and add your own flair.</i>

00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:55.900
<i>Not only may you be able to</i>
<i>save Riley,</i>

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.866
but Zuzu as well.
Zuzu?

00:05:57.866 --> 00:06:00.033
Zuzu?
(all gasp)

00:06:00.033 --> 00:06:02.273
Wait, you know where Zuzu is?

00:06:02.273 --> 00:06:04.640
Point me in the direction
and I'm there!

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.906
<i>Don't get sidetracked.</i>

00:06:05.906 --> 00:06:07.740
<i>Your priority</i>
<i>is to win this duel.</i>

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.840
<i>And not just win,</i>
<i>but win with style.</i>

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.506
Talk about pressure.

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.940
Yeah, I hope his shoulders
can handle it.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.840
All this has
my brain scrambled.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.173
Come on...

00:06:19.173 --> 00:06:22.240
Okay!
I draw!

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.806
(grunts)
Aww, man.

00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:26.706
I can't do anything
with this.

00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:28.973
Well, gotta make
the most of it.

00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:31.740
I switch Odd‐Eyes
to defense mode.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.540
You too, Hip Hippo.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.473
Then I'm gonna put this card
facedown and end my turn.

00:06:39.473 --> 00:06:41.106
You're up, Gong!

00:06:41.106 --> 00:06:44.906
And Gong, don't you dare
go easy on me!

00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:46.740
Well, Gong wasn't planning to!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.906
'Cause us two gotta get
Riley smilin'!

00:06:48.906 --> 00:06:51.006
(shouting)

00:06:51.006 --> 00:06:53.140
Gong summons the Tuner Monster,

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.306
Superheavy Samurai Fist
in attack mode!

00:06:58.773 --> 00:07:01.180
I bet that fist
never lost at roshambo!

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.680
Superheavy Samurai Fist,
sock Yuya's Hippo

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.080
right in the noodle!

00:07:08.813 --> 00:07:12.046
Aaaahhhh!
(grunting)

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.280
One down, one to go!

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.780
Now, Big Benkei's
gonna take down Odd‐Eyes!

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.046
'Cause Big Benkei can attack
even when it's in defense mode!

00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:24.080
(roaring)

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.846
Bullseye!
But Gong's not done yet

00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:30.713
'cause Superheavy
Samurai Soulhorn's

00:07:30.713 --> 00:07:33.013
special ability activates!

00:07:33.013 --> 00:07:36.680
So, Big Benkei
can attack again!

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.513
And this attack's heading
straight for Yuya!

00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:45.413
(Gong)
Attack Yuya!

00:07:45.413 --> 00:07:46.246
(gasps)

00:07:49.613 --> 00:07:51.080
Huh?

00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:55.680
Uhh...
(grunting)

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.413
I activate Evasion!

00:07:57.413 --> 00:07:59.546
Phew, that was a close one!

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:01.486
You're not escaping!

00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:05.053
Since my Superheavy Samurai Fist
destroyed a monster earlier,

00:08:05.053 --> 00:08:08.720
I can Synchro Summon
in the middle of battle!

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.553
Level 2 Superheavy Samurai Fist

00:08:11.553 --> 00:08:15.153
tunes Level 8
Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei

00:08:15.153 --> 00:08:18.820
and Level 2 Superheavy
Samurai Preservation!

00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:24.253
I Synchro Summon!

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:26.320
Make way for the pain train!

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.653
Superheavy Samura
Steam Train King!

00:08:33.253 --> 00:08:35.620
That's one loco
locomotive!

00:08:37.753 --> 00:08:40.053
Hey, you're no conductor!

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:43.153
Gong's gonna steam
right over you, Yuya!

00:08:43.153 --> 00:08:44.986
And you don't got
the life points

00:08:44.986 --> 00:08:46.686
to stay in the game!

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:48.820
Rev up your engines,
Steam Train King,

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.686
'cause the next station
is Yuyaville!

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:55.353
This is the end of the line!

00:08:55.353 --> 00:08:57.553
Aah!

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.893
You ain't skating
to your to victory, Yuya!

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.426
I activate another Evasion!

00:09:09.426 --> 00:09:10.426
(Gong)
Don't think so!

00:09:13.093 --> 00:09:14.793
No way!

00:09:14.793 --> 00:09:17.093
(both)
Gong actually moved!

00:09:17.093 --> 00:09:20.326
By playing No Action,
your Action Card is X'd out!

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.193
Gong's taking it to him!

00:09:22.193 --> 00:09:25.293
That's a shoe‐in for the most
awesome move ever!

00:09:25.293 --> 00:09:27.426
Hm? Huh?

00:09:27.426 --> 00:09:29.126
Uh‐oh!

00:09:29.126 --> 00:09:31.493
(Gong)
There's nowhere
left to run, Yuya!

00:09:31.493 --> 00:09:33.993
I activate my trap
Performapal Signal!

00:09:36.093 --> 00:09:38.293
I draw a card and send it
to the graveyard.

00:09:38.293 --> 00:09:40.226
And if the card's
a Performapal,

00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:42.226
then you have to stop
your attack!

00:09:42.226 --> 00:09:45.760
Well, let's see
if luck's on my son's side.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.326
If Yuya draws a card
that's not a Performapal,

00:09:48.326 --> 00:09:49.960
he loses the duel.

00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:53.960
I draw!

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.726
Yes!

00:09:57.726 --> 00:10:00.126
I'm sending this Performapal
Sword Fish to the graveyard,

00:10:00.126 --> 00:10:02.900
and Gong has to slam
the brakes on his attack!

00:10:07.966 --> 00:10:09.466
(all)
Hooray!

00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:10.900
Whoa!
Oh, my!

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.866
(both groan)

00:10:11.866 --> 00:10:13.266
(sighs)

00:10:13.266 --> 00:10:15.833
(Gong)
Don't get your hopes up yet!

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:18.966
Once per turn, by banishing
all the Spell and Trap Cards

00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:21.833
in Gong's graveyard,
Steam Train King deals you

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:24.000
200 points of damage
for each one!

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
No way!
This ain't enough
to beat you,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.866
but you'll still
be bruised like a peach!

00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:29.900
Blast away!

00:10:31.266 --> 00:10:33.033
(grunting)

00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:37.600
Oh!

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.200
This duel has more
twists and turns

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.400
than a bowl of macaroni!

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.300
<i>Gong's abandoned his patented</i>
<i>Heavystrong Style</i>

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.633
<i>that he's been</i>
<i>using for years</i>

00:10:44.633 --> 00:10:46.166
<i>and is jetting</i>
<i>around the field!</i>

00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:47.700
<i>But I can't say</i>
<i>it hasn't worked for him,</i>

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.766
<i>because he has Yuya</i>
<i>on the ropes!</i>

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:52.733
Frankly ladies and gentlemen,
as shocking as it might seem,

00:10:52.733 --> 00:10:54.366
Yuya's been out‐dueled

00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:56.466
<i>and even more,</i>
<i>out dueltained!</i>

00:10:56.466 --> 00:10:58.500
This the best you got?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.500
Gong expected more
from you, Yuya,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.740
but I guess Gong was wrong.
What do you mean?

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.840
How long has Gong
known you, Yuya?

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.440
We've been dueling
against each other

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.973
since our Duel Disks
were twice our size.

00:11:08.973 --> 00:11:11.173
And Gong knows when
his best bud's not focused

00:11:11.173 --> 00:11:13.540
100% on the duel 'cause he got
too much on his mind.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.306
Yeah, I got a lot on my mind!
You heard Declan, didn't you?

00:11:17.306 --> 00:11:19.873
It's like the whole weight
of the world's on my shoulders,

00:11:19.873 --> 00:11:22.140
like literally!

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.573
<i>It never used to be</i>
<i>about winning or losing,</i>

00:11:24.573 --> 00:11:26.973
<i>it was about just dueling</i>
<i>to have lots of fun.</i>

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:30.006
<i>But if I fail this time,</i>
<i>it's not just me that loses.</i>

00:11:30.006 --> 00:11:33.240
<i>Riley loses!</i>
<i>Zuzu loses!</i>

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.206
Zuzu...

00:11:35.206 --> 00:11:39.173
(Gong)
That only sounds
like excuses to Gong.

00:11:39.173 --> 00:11:42.473
Yeah, you're right.
But guess what, Gong?

00:11:42.473 --> 00:11:44.340
I never said I was giving up!

00:11:53.273 --> 00:11:55.040
It's my turn!

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.573
And since my Pendulum Scale
is already set,

00:11:58.573 --> 00:12:02.480
my monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.080
Come on back,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.780
(roaring)

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.713
And I'll follow that up

00:12:08.713 --> 00:12:10.780
by activating
Pendulum Illusion!

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.013
It's showtime!

00:12:15.046 --> 00:12:18.080
Odd‐Eyes, what do you say
you get your giddyup in gear

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.713
and attack Gong's
Steam Train King?

00:12:21.713 --> 00:12:24.180
<i>I've seen a lot of strange</i>
<i>things in this league,</i>

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.713
<i>but I've never seen a dragon</i>
<i>chase down a choo‐choo!</i>

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:32.313
<i>Now, let's see if Yuya's able</i>
<i>to kick that caboose's</i>
<i>caboose!</i>

00:12:32.313 --> 00:12:34.680
Thanks to my Pendulum Illusion,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.780
I can discard a Spell
or Trap Card from my hand

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.213
and send it to the graveyard
to activate its effect.

00:12:41.213 --> 00:12:43.213
Damage Banish
is just what I need

00:12:43.213 --> 00:12:45.013
to give you some engine trouble!

00:12:45.013 --> 00:12:46.813
Better hang on tight, Gong,

00:12:46.813 --> 00:12:49.246
'cause your Steam Train's
attack and defense points

00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:50.780
are cut in half!

00:12:52.446 --> 00:12:55.246
Gong's train is now weaker
than Odd‐Eyes!

00:12:55.246 --> 00:12:56.213
Oh, ya!
Awesome!

00:12:56.213 --> 00:12:57.680
Go, Yuya!

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.280
Blast 'em, Odd Eyes!

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.953
(roaring)

00:13:00.953 --> 00:13:03.586
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:05.520
Since I used
Pendulum Illusion

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.353
on your Monster,
it can't be destroyed,

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.153
but you'll still lose
life points!

00:13:09.153 --> 00:13:10.420
(grunting)

00:13:12.953 --> 00:13:14.453
(all)
Yuya!

00:13:14.453 --> 00:13:16.486
He didn't do
all that much damage.

00:13:16.486 --> 00:13:19.386
Yeah, more like "dull pain"
instead of "dueltain."

00:13:19.386 --> 00:13:21.320
I feel all tingly‐wingly!

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.020
Yuya's finally starting
to get his groove back.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.686
It's a good start,
I hope he keeps it up!

00:13:26.686 --> 00:13:28.753
(Yuya)
Now that my turn's done,

00:13:28.753 --> 00:13:31.386
your Steam Train
regains its defense points.

00:13:31.386 --> 00:13:33.453
But while you're still
chugging along,

00:13:33.453 --> 00:13:35.786
I'm firing on all cylinders!

00:13:35.786 --> 00:13:38.653
It's my turn!
I draw!

00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:42.153
Yuya, you can't hijack
Gong's train!

00:13:42.153 --> 00:13:45.220
And Gong's not gonna let you
hijack this duel either!

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.853
Gong's turning
this Steam Train around

00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:48.853
so that it can attack

00:13:48.853 --> 00:13:52.086
and plow right over
your Odd‐Eyes Pendulm Dragon!

00:13:52.086 --> 00:13:54.853
(Nico Smiley)
Uh‐oh! He'll flatten
that dragon like a flapjack!

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.886
I'm sending Flame Guard
to the graveyard

00:13:58.886 --> 00:14:01.493
to activate
Pendulum Illusion again

00:14:01.493 --> 00:14:03.493
and lower your monster's
defense points!

00:14:03.493 --> 00:14:05.560
<i>That means Odd‐Eyes</i>

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.593
<i>is stronger than Gong's</i>
<i>Steam Train once again!</i>

00:14:12.626 --> 00:14:14.860
Yuya's surviving
by the skin of his teeth,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.793
but he's got some
pretty tough skin!

00:14:16.793 --> 00:14:19.060
Gong's going to take damage!

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.493
(both)
200 points!

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.726
(growling)

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.860
(shouting)

00:14:29.226 --> 00:14:33.126
By sending two cards
in Gong's hand to the graveyard,

00:14:33.126 --> 00:14:35.560
Steam Train's special ability
activates!

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.593
By tossing away
the Action Spell Tenacity

00:14:38.593 --> 00:14:40.726
and Superheavy Samurai
Big Waraji,

00:14:40.726 --> 00:14:44.460
Steam Train
disintegrates your Odd‐Eyes.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.260
Ahh!

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.093
And by banishing Tenacity
from Gong's graveyard,

00:14:49.093 --> 00:14:52.393
this train's cannon blasts you
with 200 points of damage!

00:14:52.393 --> 00:14:54.426
(grunting)

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.460
Your dueltaining
is coming up

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.760
shorter than a hamster
with no legs!

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.400
Come on, now,
you can do better than this!

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.600
All right,
it's your turn, Yuya!

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.133
Yuya doesn't have much room
for error.

00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:13.766
Then let's hope
he's up to the challenge.

00:15:13.766 --> 00:15:17.833
Hmm, I bet the only one
more nervous than me is Yoko.

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:20.333
I bet the only one more
confident in Yuya than me

00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:21.900
is Yusho.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.233
Kick Gong's can to Loserland!

00:15:24.233 --> 00:15:25.766
Woohoo!

00:15:28.933 --> 00:15:30.433
It's my turn!

00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:32.466
Since I played
my Pendulum Illusion,

00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:34.333
I'm not allowed
to draw a card.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.300
But I can do this!

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.600
I Pendulum Summon
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:45.600
(roaring)

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.766
And when I get
an Action Card,

00:15:48.766 --> 00:15:50.966
I'm gonna knock your strategy
off its tracks!

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:53.000
Not if Gong gets it first!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.900
(both)
Gong just leapt off the train?

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.600
Unreal!
Gong's moving!

00:15:57.033 --> 00:15:57.566
Huh?

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.273
Gong's totally changed
his dueling style,

00:16:01.273 --> 00:16:03.206
and it's totally
working for him!

00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:05.340
He's taking his dueling
to a new level.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.873
So, if Gong's gonna up his game,
I have to up my dueltaining too!

00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:11.140
(both shouting)

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.706
(both shouting)

00:16:17.706 --> 00:16:20.573
Ah!
Yeah!

00:16:20.573 --> 00:16:22.740
I'll send this Action Card
to the graveyard

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.573
to activate
Pendulum Illusion's effect!

00:16:25.573 --> 00:16:28.373
Your Steam Train
will be running on fumes!

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.040
Attack, Odd‐Eyes!

00:16:34.273 --> 00:16:36.406
(panicked grunting)

00:16:39.806 --> 00:16:42.573
(Yuya)
Looks like I took the steam
out of your strategy.

00:16:42.573 --> 00:16:45.240
You're up, Gong!

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.706
It ain't over yet!

00:16:48.706 --> 00:16:52.040
Gong'll be the one getting
an Action Card this time!

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.840
Is this a duel
or a track meet?

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.073
I wonder who will get it
this time?

00:16:55.073 --> 00:16:55.540
(both grunting)

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.040
(Yuya)
Beat you to it again, Gong!

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.613
<i>And your Steam Train's</i>
<i>gonna pay the price again!</i>

00:17:02.613 --> 00:17:05.080
That Yuya, he's a quick one!

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.313
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:17:07.313 --> 00:17:09.780
(grunting)

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.180
But Gong snagged
an Action Card of Gong's own!

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.213
Gong sends it and Superheavy
Samurai Soulhorns

00:17:16.213 --> 00:17:18.480
to the graveyard
to destroy your dragon!

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.813
And by banishing
that Action Card,

00:17:20.813 --> 00:17:23.480
Steam Train deals you
200 more points of damage!

00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:29.613
(grunting and groaning)

00:17:29.613 --> 00:17:32.080
This duel's turning out
better than I expected.

00:17:35.913 --> 00:17:39.046
(Yuya)
Huh, looks like
this duel's heating up.

00:17:39.046 --> 00:17:41.880
All right then,
I'll set things on fire

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.213
by summoning Odd‐Eyes again!

00:17:43.213 --> 00:17:45.246
(roaring)

00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:50.180
It's time for me
to end this!

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.546
<i>Okay, listen up, Gong!</i>

00:17:51.546 --> 00:17:53.513
<i>Whoever grabs</i>
<i>the next Action Card</i>

00:17:53.513 --> 00:17:55.146
<i>will win this duel!</i>

00:17:55.146 --> 00:17:57.146
And that's gonna be me!

00:17:57.146 --> 00:17:58.280
Gong don't think so!

00:18:11.986 --> 00:18:13.486
(panting)

00:18:13.486 --> 00:18:14.853
(shouting)

00:18:14.853 --> 00:18:16.420
(shouting)

00:18:17.953 --> 00:18:19.486
Yeah!

00:18:19.486 --> 00:18:21.220
Dagnabbit!

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.220
I send this Action Card
to the graveyard

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.386
to activate
Pendulum Illusion's effect

00:18:26.386 --> 00:18:29.020
one last time and weaken
your monster!

00:18:35.653 --> 00:18:37.220
You ready, Gong?

00:18:41.886 --> 00:18:44.720
Well, what are you
waiting for, Yuya?

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.620
Just do it!

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.786
Odd‐Eyes,
attack Steam Train!

00:18:49.786 --> 00:18:51.553
(roaring)

00:18:53.886 --> 00:18:56.020
Bring it on!

00:19:11.726 --> 00:19:13.293
Gong!

00:19:14.793 --> 00:19:18.160
You may have won,
but you call that dueltaining?

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.860
That was amateur hour.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.060
Gong Knows you could have
dueled better than this!

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:27.126
You've gotta try harder,
if you wanna make Riley smile.

00:19:27.126 --> 00:19:29.526
But I am trying.

00:19:29.526 --> 00:19:31.460
(Nico Smiley)
<i>Yuya Sakaki wins</i>

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.993
<i>the Junior Arc League</i>
<i>Championship!</i>

00:19:34.993 --> 00:19:36.760
(cheers and applause)

00:19:39.093 --> 00:19:41.593
(sobbing)

00:19:41.593 --> 00:19:44.560
So now, Yuya's bidding
the Junior Division goodbye

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.793
and advancing
to the upper leagues!

00:19:46.793 --> 00:19:48.526
(Declan)
No, he's not.
Huh?

00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:56.293
With more memories regained,
you should now remember

00:19:56.293 --> 00:19:58.560
that I postponed
the original tournament

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.333
when Duel Academy attacked
this dimension.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:04.300
Yuya, you may have defeated
these three competitors,

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.400
but there's still one opponent
remaining in this tournament.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.266
In fact, this duelist
was one of the Lancers.

00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:13.966
And if you don't
defeat this opponent,

00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:15.766
then you haven't won,
have you?

00:20:15.766 --> 00:20:18.800
Well, bring 'em on.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.966
(Declan)
No, not bring.

00:20:20.966 --> 00:20:22.666
You must go to them...

00:20:22.666 --> 00:20:25.666
through this dimensional portal.

00:20:25.666 --> 00:20:27.700
Uh, you sure it's safe?

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.433
Do not insult my company's
technological capabilities.

00:20:31.433 --> 00:20:33.900
The ARC‐V Reactor
has created wormholes

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.633
to connect our dimension with
the other three dimensions.

00:20:37.633 --> 00:20:41.566
This will enable you to travel
between dimensions with ease.

00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:44.866
And that is where you will
find your opponent waiting.

00:20:44.866 --> 00:20:48.166
Yuya, go to the Xyz Dimension.

00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:50.566
To Xyz?

00:20:50.566 --> 00:20:52.866
Who's gonna be waiting
for me there, Declan?

00:20:52.866 --> 00:20:54.900
No hint?
None?

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.333
You're really not
gonna tell me, are you?

00:20:57.333 --> 00:21:00.506
Well, I guess there's only
one way to find out.

00:21:00.506 --> 00:21:03.606
(thinking)
Okay, Yuya.
This is for all the marbles.

00:21:03.606 --> 00:21:06.973
If I win this duel,
I just might save Zuzu.

00:21:06.973 --> 00:21:11.106
And not just Zuzu, but also
Celina, Lulu and Rin.

00:21:11.106 --> 00:21:13.340
So I can't fail
no matter what!

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.673
No pressure or anything.

00:21:15.673 --> 00:21:17.840
Well, here goes.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.573
It's showtime!

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.906
Huh?

00:21:29.906 --> 00:21:31.906
I see somebody!

00:21:31.906 --> 00:21:33.473
No way!
