00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.666
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:08.533
Super Polymerization
wasn't my key to victory!

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.600
What do you mean?

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.700
Welcome back Predaplants
Cephalotusnail and Lilizard!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.000
And now I can fuse them together
with my true key card!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.733
Not Super
but Ultra Polymerization!

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.066
(all)
Huh?
No! This can't be!

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.266
I Fusion Summon...

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:31.833
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:36.000
You are caught in an endless
cycle of pain and suffering

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.833
where you take damage every
single loop!

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:41.566
And the only thing that
will end it is your defeat!

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.800
Dad, no!

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:49.166
One final transfer, and I will
finally have my daughter back.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.133
While it seems your time,
Yusho, is at an end.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.866
I blast you... again!

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.200
Yuya!

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.806
Attack!

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:05.773
No!

00:01:05.773 --> 00:01:08.140
Dad, no!

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.440
(thinking)
Yuya, it's your time to shine.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.306
(sinister laugh)

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.440
Aah!

00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:34.080
Uugghh!

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.480
(Yuri)
What a surprise.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.280
(chuckles)

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.880
Who knew one little card
would cause such a reaction?

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.880
Uugghh!

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.946
Yuri!

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:46.780
Yuya, you have to
keep your cool!

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.780
Uhh!

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.180
Declan!

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.146
(chuckles)
Temper, temper.

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:57.446
If you're this mad now,

00:02:57.446 --> 00:03:00.446
I wonder how angry you'll be
when I rip it in half.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.486
Your dad will have
a splitting headache.

00:03:02.486 --> 00:03:04.986
Don't you dare!
I mean it!

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:08.386
You're messing with
the wrong guy!

00:03:08.386 --> 00:03:11.453
Yuya, calm down.
You're not thinking straight.

00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:12.953
Uugghh!

00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:14.620
I'll never forgive you
for this!

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.320
I don't recall asking
for forgiveness.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.286
But you'll be begging me
for mercy...

00:03:21.286 --> 00:03:24.220
when I defeat you!

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.620
Not a chance!
Let's do this!

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:32.120
(computer voice)
Generating Action Field
Crossover.

00:03:34.353 --> 00:03:36.186
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:03:36.186 --> 00:03:39.220
If you learned all your
techniques from your dad,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.220
I don't know how
you'll defeat me,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.286
considering he was
such a dud.

00:03:43.286 --> 00:03:45.720
So I guess it's up to me
to bring both

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.220
the razzle and the dazzle.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.286
And Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio's
going to help me do just that!

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:55.086
So you see, when Predaplant
Ophrys Scorpio

00:03:55.086 --> 00:03:57.253
is successfully summoned,
I'm able to send

00:03:57.253 --> 00:03:59.086
one of the Predaplants
in my hand

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:00.620
straight to the graveyard
to summon

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.860
a different Predaplant
from my deck!

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.726
So now I'm going to discard

00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:07.526
my Predaplant Stapeliaworm,
like so,

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:09.693
so I can summon...

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:13.060
Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra!

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:19.060
And fortunately, when
Darlingtonia Cobra is summoned,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.560
I'm allowed to add the spell
card Polymerization to my hand.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.726
(chuckles)

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:27.393
Which I'll use to summon
the very monster

00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:30.560
that brought the curtain...
down on your dad.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.560
It's a showstopper!

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.026
I fuse my two
Predaplants together!

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:39.259
Now, the luscious leaves
and succulent stems

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.160
of these two precious plants
will give birth to a vicious,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.793
vengeful, diabolical botanical!

00:04:47.793 --> 00:04:50.493
I Fusion Summon!

00:04:50.493 --> 00:04:54.160
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.060
(roaring)

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.860
Aagghh!

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.400
(thinking)
His dragon is making Z‐Arc
stronger!

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.166
I gotta hold him down, but I
don't know how long I can.

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:06.733
Ha ha!
What's wrong?

00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:10.100
You're not looking so good.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.466
And we've only just begun
to have fun.

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:14.800
I end my turn.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.266
(growling)

00:05:21.033 --> 00:05:22.700
It's my turn!

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.333
Smile World.
Dad...

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:31.900
(Yusho)
Yuya, it's your time to shine.

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:44.033
What are you waiting for?

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:46.433
Are you going to
make a move or not, friend?

00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:49.400
Ha! Come on.
Just a second ago,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.966
you were huffing and puffing,
full steam ahead.

00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:53.466
But now look at you.

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:57.533
All sad about your
dear old dad. Whaaa!

00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:58.866
(laughs)

00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:01.573
Aah!

00:06:01.573 --> 00:06:05.473
(roaring)

00:06:05.473 --> 00:06:06.806
Ugh!

00:06:06.806 --> 00:06:09.640
(sighs)

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.106
(thinking)
Odd‐Eyes. I can feel it.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:16.706
It wants to fight Yuri, too,
and I can sure use its help.

00:06:16.706 --> 00:06:19.773
But I don't know if I should
summon it.

00:06:19.773 --> 00:06:21.840
Because when the dragons get
together,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.940
I lose even more control.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.906
What would Dad do?

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:28.273
When things get tough,

00:06:28.273 --> 00:06:30.906
respond with a smile.

00:06:30.906 --> 00:06:33.440
It will give you the strength
to keep moving forward.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.306
Huh?

00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:38.973
(Yusho)
The key to dueling is to believe
in your deck...

00:06:38.973 --> 00:06:41.006
and yourself.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.440
(thinking)
Thanks, Dad.

00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:50.073
I set the Pendulum Scale with
Scale 1 Stargazer Magician

00:06:50.073 --> 00:06:52.306
and Scale 8 Timegazer
Magician!

00:06:52.306 --> 00:06:55.540
I'm taking control of
this duel, starting now!

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.746
(Yuya)
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:07:02.746 --> 00:07:04.680
all at the same time!

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.713
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:07:07.713 --> 00:07:10.680
Carve the arc of victory!

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.713
My monsters are ready...

00:07:12.713 --> 00:07:15.146
to swing into action!

00:07:16.513 --> 00:07:21.013
Ka‐ching and do your thing,
Performapal Coin Dragon!

00:07:21.013 --> 00:07:24.080
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.313
(roaring)

00:07:28.313 --> 00:07:31.913
(Yuri)
Ah, there it is,
your precious dragon.

00:07:31.913 --> 00:07:35.813
But I wonder which one of our
dragons is mightier.

00:07:35.813 --> 00:07:38.913
(roaring)
(roaring)

00:07:38.913 --> 00:07:40.513
Ugh! Uhh!

00:07:40.513 --> 00:07:43.080
Let's find out.

00:07:46.746 --> 00:07:50.580
(growling, groaning)

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.146
Is he okay?

00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:53.613
I hope so.

00:07:53.613 --> 00:07:55.180
With these two dragons
on the field,

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.680
Z‐Arc's will becomes that much
stronger.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.546
(growling, groaning)

00:08:05.753 --> 00:08:08.886
It'll take everything he has
to hold Z‐Arc down.

00:08:08.886 --> 00:08:10.853
But what if he can't?

00:08:10.853 --> 00:08:12.253
I mean...

00:08:12.253 --> 00:08:13.720
look at him.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.153
He's barely holding it
together.

00:08:15.153 --> 00:08:17.220
I don't know if he can
hold Z‐Arc back,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.586
much less win this duel.

00:08:19.586 --> 00:08:22.686
Then let's hope that Yuya is as
strong as we believe he is,

00:08:22.686 --> 00:08:24.853
or believe that he can be.

00:08:24.853 --> 00:08:29.886
(Yuri)
You know, you shouldn't scrunch
up your face like that.

00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:32.920
Didn't Daddy tell you it might
get stuck that way?

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.086
(growling)
Don't talk about my dad!

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:41.020
Coin Dragons, power up
my dragons by 500!

00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:45.420
(roaring)

00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:52.620
Now Odd‐Eye is stronger than
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon!

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.720
Go! Spiral Flame Strike!

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.253
How naive that you think that
will actually work.

00:09:00.253 --> 00:09:02.960
I now activate my trap
Predaprouting!

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.926
Not only does it protect

00:09:04.926 --> 00:09:07.226
my Starving Venom Fusion Dragon
from destruction,

00:09:07.226 --> 00:09:10.560
but your Odd‐Eyes
is destroyed instead!

00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:16.760
Not if I activate
Coin Dragon's other ability!

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.593
It saves my Odd‐Eyes
as well!

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:21.626
That's not all!

00:09:21.626 --> 00:09:24.426
Since Starving Venom Fusion
Dragon is above Level 5,

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:28.293
Odd‐Eyes deals...
double the damage!

00:09:28.293 --> 00:09:30.426
(groans)

00:09:30.426 --> 00:09:34.793
(chuckles)
Doubled to deal just
400 points of damage?

00:09:34.793 --> 00:09:37.593
How can I ever recover?

00:09:37.593 --> 00:09:40.826
Oh, I know! I'll just grow
some greenness!

00:09:40.826 --> 00:09:42.893
You see, thanks to
Predaprouting,

00:09:42.893 --> 00:09:45.326
I can sprout three
Predaplant tokens.

00:09:50.193 --> 00:09:52.060
(groans)
All right.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.393
I still have one monster left
to attack with.

00:09:55.393 --> 00:09:58.960
Coin Dragon, zap that token!

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:04.466
All right, Yuto,
that's one token down,

00:10:04.466 --> 00:10:06.766
but Yuri's still got two left.

00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:09.233
And knowing the way this guy
likes to duel,

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:11.133
he'll use 'em for
something bad.

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:14.133
We have to be ready for anything
this guy throws at us.

00:10:14.133 --> 00:10:14.900
Yeah.

00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:19.833
Maybe this card's
the ticket to stop him.

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:21.900
Possibly.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.466
Let's hope it works because
we gotta keep fighting.

00:10:24.466 --> 00:10:26.366
I place one card
face down...

00:10:26.366 --> 00:10:28.133
and end my turn.

00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:31.666
You're giving it your all,

00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:33.800
but will that be enough?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.966
I don't think so!

00:10:35.966 --> 00:10:39.000
Because I have new tricks
up my sleeve!

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.900
Like tributing one Predaplant
token to summon

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.633
the Tuner Monster,
Predaplant Banksiogre!

00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:47.066
A Tuner?

00:10:47.066 --> 00:10:49.033
That's right!

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:52.066
By absorbing Yugo's powers,
I can now Synchro Summon!

00:10:52.066 --> 00:10:57.033
I tune Bankshia Ogre with my
Predatplant token!

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:07.040
What was once Yugo's go‐to
dragon is now mine!

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.540
I Synchro Summon!

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.640
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:11:15.206 --> 00:11:18.306
(groaning)

00:11:18.306 --> 00:11:19.806
(both groaning)

00:11:19.806 --> 00:11:21.640
Oh, no!

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.173
With a third dragon,
Z‐Arc grows even stronger!

00:11:24.173 --> 00:11:26.273
(roaring)
(roaring)

00:11:26.273 --> 00:11:28.273
(roaring)

00:11:28.273 --> 00:11:31.306
Hey, Yuya!
It looks like...

00:11:31.306 --> 00:11:33.906
you're outnumbered,
two dragons to one!

00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:37.173
(groaning)

00:11:37.173 --> 00:11:39.273
Aah!

00:11:39.273 --> 00:11:41.440
(groaning)

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.040
Keep cool! We can't let
Z‐Arc overwhelm us!

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.873
Remember what my dad said.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.673
We gotta keep smiling!

00:11:48.673 --> 00:11:50.940
But it's so hard!

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.173
How can I fight Z‐Arc and Yuri
at the same time?

00:11:54.173 --> 00:11:55.940
Aah!

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.440
I thought I'd get tired
of hearing you scream.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.080
But I don't.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.813
It's actually music
to my ears.

00:12:02.813 --> 00:12:06.846
Oh! Now that Yuri has both
dragons, he can use

00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:09.380
the same combo that he used
to beat Yuya's dad!

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.113
And you should thank me for
letting you lose...

00:12:12.113 --> 00:12:14.146
in the same way as your father.

00:12:14.146 --> 00:12:16.346
But your losing
is thanks enough.

00:12:16.346 --> 00:12:20.946
This unbelievably incredible
combo will seal your defeat!

00:12:20.946 --> 00:12:24.446
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon
will use its special ability

00:12:24.446 --> 00:12:27.213
to steal your Odd‐Eyes'
special abilities!

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:31.613
And once this combo gets rocking
and rolling, it's unstoppable.

00:12:31.613 --> 00:12:34.346
Nothing's unstoppable!
Huh?

00:12:34.346 --> 00:12:37.813
I activate the trap card
Starlight Force!

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.613
It negates Starving Venom Fusion
Dragon's special ability!

00:12:43.613 --> 00:12:46.446
So that means...
That means...

00:12:46.446 --> 00:12:48.713
Your combo's over,
just like that!

00:12:48.713 --> 00:12:50.480
But as for me,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.480
I still got a little
something else to share!

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.346
Now both your
dragons' levels...

00:12:54.346 --> 00:12:57.246
drop down to four.

00:12:57.246 --> 00:12:59.213
That was, like,
so awesome, Yuya!

00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:00.486
Indeed.

00:13:00.486 --> 00:13:02.486
That changes nothing!

00:13:02.486 --> 00:13:05.520
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon,
attack Coin Dragon!

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:09.386
(groans)

00:13:15.886 --> 00:13:19.320
Oh, no! Odd‐Eyes Pendulum
Dragon's attack points dropped!

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.086
(Yuri)
Starving Venom Fusion Dragon,
get rid of that pest, will you?

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.420
(groaning)
This isn't over yet, Yuri!

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.520
(Yuri laughs)
Huh?

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.620
I think it's time
to face facts, Yuya.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.920
Your monsters are gone.
All gone.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.220
You may not think it's over,
but it's over!

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.820
(thinking)
I can't afford to lose.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.386
But I don't know how
I can win.

00:13:54.386 --> 00:13:57.520
But that doesn't mean
I'm giving up.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.626
We must finish our mission
before they finish their duel.

00:14:06.626 --> 00:14:09.093
Why is the final step
taking so long?

00:14:09.093 --> 00:14:11.226
<i>What is the delay?</i>

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.293
Sir, we need to completely
charge the Arc‐V reactor

00:14:13.293 --> 00:14:14.760
before the final step,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.426
and the energy required
is off the scales‐‐

00:14:16.426 --> 00:14:19.560
I didn't ask for excuses,
I asked for results.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.693
(man)
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

00:14:23.293 --> 00:14:26.593
(thinking)
As long as I have
a single life point,

00:14:26.593 --> 00:14:28.660
that means I still
have a chance.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.893
Okay.

00:14:30.893 --> 00:14:34.626
He's got us outnumbered in both
monsters and life points.

00:14:34.626 --> 00:14:39.326
But since I played Starlight
Force, Yuri's two dragons

00:14:39.326 --> 00:14:42.726
can't use their special
abilities against us.

00:14:42.726 --> 00:14:45.426
We can use that
to our advantage.

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:48.193
If we summon Dark Rebellion
XYZ Dragon,

00:14:48.193 --> 00:14:51.360
Yuri can't stop us from using
its special ability

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.226
to turn this duel around.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.060
But you'll need two
Level 4 monsters

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.626
to summon Dark Rebellion.

00:14:57.626 --> 00:15:00.100
(Yuya)
I have Odd‐Eyes and Coin Dragon
in my Extra Deck.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.600
And Coin Dragon is Level 4.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.533
So if I'm able to draw another
Level 4 monster this turn...

00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:08.933
You can Pendulum Summon
Coin Dragon

00:15:08.933 --> 00:15:11.300
and combine them to
summon Dark Rebellion!

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.900
(Yuya)
But we barely held down
Z‐Arc last time

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.200
we had three dragons on
the field.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.866
Let's hope we can again.

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:22.566
Deck, don't fail me now!

00:15:22.566 --> 00:15:26.400
Argh! It's Level 5.
However...

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.433
Due to Starlight Force's
effect,

00:15:29.433 --> 00:15:31.433
your monsters will now
gain one level.

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:37.633
But they still can't use
their special ability.

00:15:37.633 --> 00:15:41.000
So they can't interfere
with my strategy!

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.733
(thinking)
I still have a way to
summon Dark Rebellion.

00:15:43.733 --> 00:15:45.300
But do I dare?

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.533
What are you waiting for?

00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:49.000
You know what you
have to do.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.166
If you summon Odd‐Eyes,

00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:53.133
Drop Gallop can use
its special ability

00:15:53.133 --> 00:15:55.966
to change its Level to 4 so you
can summon Dark Rebellion!

00:15:55.966 --> 00:15:58.333
Yeah, I know that, Yuto.

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:00.573
But if we do this,
all four dragons

00:16:00.573 --> 00:16:02.306
will be on the field.

00:16:02.306 --> 00:16:04.106
And that scares me.

00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:06.406
We barely maintained
control with three.

00:16:06.406 --> 00:16:08.773
I don't know how we'll
hold down Z‐Arc with all four.

00:16:08.773 --> 00:16:10.673
Yeah, I don't know either.

00:16:10.673 --> 00:16:12.840
But some risks
are worth taking.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.506
Because all our friends and
family helped us get this far.

00:16:16.506 --> 00:16:18.273
We can't let them down.

00:16:18.273 --> 00:16:20.473
I believe in you,
and I believe in us.

00:16:20.473 --> 00:16:22.940
I believe we can
fight off Z‐Arc.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.873
I'm scared, too, Yuya,
but I'll face it with a smile.

00:16:26.873 --> 00:16:30.506
Yuto...

00:16:30.506 --> 00:16:32.273
(thinking)
Okay.

00:16:32.273 --> 00:16:35.206
I won't let my fear of
Z‐Arc stop me.

00:16:35.206 --> 00:16:36.973
I use...

00:16:36.973 --> 00:16:38.740
the Pendulum Scale that's
already been set

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.340
to Pendulum Summon!

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:45.306
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:48.573
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:48.573 --> 00:16:51.440
(roaring)

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.106
Ka‐ching,
Performapal Coin Dragon!

00:16:55.106 --> 00:16:59.846
Drop in, Performapal Drop
Gallop!

00:16:59.846 --> 00:17:01.780
(roaring)

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.746
(roaring)

00:17:03.746 --> 00:17:04.680
(roaring)

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.280
I can feel them
calling for a fourth!

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.380
(sinister laugh)

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.046
(groaning)

00:17:12.046 --> 00:17:14.213
Drop Gallop lets me
draw a card

00:17:14.213 --> 00:17:18.946
for every Performapal
I Pendulum Summoned!

00:17:18.946 --> 00:17:21.013
And you'll be unhappy to know

00:17:21.013 --> 00:17:23.846
that since I have Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon on my field,

00:17:23.846 --> 00:17:27.446
I can change Drop Gallop's
level from 5 to 4,

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:29.780
which is the same as
Coin Dragon's level!

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.946
So, that means I can I use
Drop Gallop and Coin Dragon

00:17:32.946 --> 00:17:35.313
to build the Overlay Network!

00:17:39.413 --> 00:17:42.580
(Yuya)
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective,

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.313
I call upon the most dangerous
of dragons!

00:17:47.313 --> 00:17:49.480
I XYZ Summon!

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.446
Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon!

00:17:57.413 --> 00:17:59.653
(roaring)

00:17:59.653 --> 00:18:01.653
(roaring)

00:18:01.653 --> 00:18:03.653
(roaring)

00:18:03.653 --> 00:18:05.686
(roaring)

00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:08.853
Aah!

00:18:08.853 --> 00:18:10.920
Aaaahhhh!

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.920
Aaaahhh!

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.953
Ugh! Yuto!

00:18:15.953 --> 00:18:17.420
(Yuto)
Don't worry about me!

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.120
Just focus on the duel!

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.620
Yes! I can feel the power!

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.353
It's incredible!

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:26.186
Too incredible!

00:18:31.753 --> 00:18:33.553
So much power!

00:18:33.553 --> 00:18:36.120
I can feel Z‐Arc trying
to take my soul,

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.253
like he did Yuto!

00:18:38.253 --> 00:18:40.420
Gotta fight!
But it's so hard!

00:18:45.586 --> 00:18:48.586
(sinister laugh)

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.920
Aagghh!

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.553
It's no good!

00:18:52.553 --> 00:18:54.853
Yuya's completely
out of control!

00:18:54.853 --> 00:18:56.653
Ugh! Aah!

00:18:58.453 --> 00:19:00.226
Huh?
Not true.

00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:02.493
Trust me, Yuya's still
fighting for us, Riley.

00:19:02.493 --> 00:19:06.493
He's our only hope.
The hope for us all.

00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:09.360
♪♪♪

00:19:24.993 --> 00:19:26.860
(breathing heavily)

00:19:29.326 --> 00:19:31.660
That was fun.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.093
But that's one ride
I don't want to take again.

00:19:34.093 --> 00:19:36.593
Just when I was about to break,

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:39.660
I felt like my friends were
helping me hang on.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.826
(thinking)
Thanks, Dad.

00:19:41.826 --> 00:19:44.526
Get ready, Yuto!

00:19:44.526 --> 00:19:47.926
I activate Dark Rebellion's XYZ
Dragon's Special Ability!

00:19:47.926 --> 00:19:50.860
Stop right there!

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.293
(sinister laugh)

00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:55.293
You'll activate nothing!

00:19:55.293 --> 00:19:58.226
You didn't think I'd go down
that easily, did you?

00:19:58.226 --> 00:20:02.733
I activate the trap card
Dragonville!

00:20:02.733 --> 00:20:05.833
And what a vinetacular card
it is!

00:20:05.833 --> 00:20:08.800
Because it lets me take control
of your dragon,

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.100
as long as it's not the one
with the highest level.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.966
No!

00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:18.066
So your Dark Rebellion XYZ
Dragon is completely mine now!

00:20:19.866 --> 00:20:22.666
(roaring)

00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:28.900
(gasps)

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.333
You thought you were
going to win,

00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:33.900
but you actually
did me a favor.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.700
So thank you, Yuya.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.333
When I absorb you,

00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:40.733
we'll reunite as one.

00:20:40.733 --> 00:20:42.300
(roaring)

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.733
Reunite as one.

00:20:44.733 --> 00:20:46.133
(roaring)

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:48.700
Reunite as one.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.666
No, Yuto! Not you, too!

00:20:51.666 --> 00:20:53.133
(roaring)

00:20:53.133 --> 00:20:55.800
Don't give in!

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.066
Oh, no! Yuya!

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.973
(man))
Professor! The Arc‐V reactor
is sufficiently charged!

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:08.573
<i>Transferring the</i>
<i>final girl!</i>

00:21:17.873 --> 00:21:20.540
<i>The reactor is fully</i>
<i>functional.</i>

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:25.640
And now, the unification of
the dimensions... begins.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.406
No!
