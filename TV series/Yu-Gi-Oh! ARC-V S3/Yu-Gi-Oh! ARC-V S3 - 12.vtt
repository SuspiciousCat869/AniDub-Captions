00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.466
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:07.333
Hope you're ready to
be blown away...

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.033
'cause...
it's showtime!

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.600
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.966
(Aster)
Yuya Sakaki, I'm bringing
the curtain down on you

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.966
and your dad's dueltaining.

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.066
(Yuya)
This is my second chance
to show him he's wrong.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.700
I gotta do it this time

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.166
'cause I don't
think I'll get a third.

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.000
I fuse
Performapal Dag Daggerman

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.100
with my Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.333
What?

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.933
You know how to
Fusion Summon?

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.333
(growling)

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.900
Brave‐Eyes!

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.700
(grumbling)
Sweet!

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.333
(Yuto)
He never learned that someone
from another dimension

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.966
can Fusion summon.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.833
So maybe...

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:44.466
he'll question everything
he's learned from Duel Academy.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.833
(Aster)
Your Dragon's going to pay
the price for your foolishness.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:52.866
Brave‐Eyes!

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.033
Did Aster drop a card?

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:56.833
Hey, that's
Smile World!

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.866
What are you doing with
my dad's card?

00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.733
I...

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.606
dueled him right when
I got to this dimension.

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:05.673
Your father may have
eluded me,

00:01:05.673 --> 00:01:07.273
but you won't!

00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:08.873
With everything I learned
from Duel Academy,

00:01:08.873 --> 00:01:10.840
I will end you!

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.940
Aster kept half of
my dad's card.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.173
That means he's
always thinking of him.

00:01:15.173 --> 00:01:17.140
I don't think it's
just for revenge.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.406
I think my dad
got through to him.

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:20.940
Now, Dystopia,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.640
wipe that grin away,
once and for all!

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.173
Finish Yuya off!

And you've
blown your cover...

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.080
as his fan.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.180
Ahh!

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.980
Please,
you're mistaken.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.213
And if you don't
get unmistaken,

00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:42.680
you're going to have to
deal with me, got it?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.780
So... I could beat you
with my eyes closed.

♪♪♪

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.046
And where do you
think you're going?

00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:51.213
You're not getting that
Action Card!

00:02:53.213 --> 00:02:54.546
Yes... I...

00:02:54.546 --> 00:02:56.213
am!

00:02:58.913 --> 00:03:00.520
And now, time to
twist and turn

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.120
outta of the way

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.786
with... Evasion!

00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:09.920
So you got lucky...

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.120
but those circus moves aren't
gonna save you forever.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.820
'Cause you are
destined for defeat, Yuya!

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.053
And it's a defeat I can't
wait to deliver!

00:03:18.053 --> 00:03:20.153
No matter what kind of
razzle‐dazzle

00:03:20.153 --> 00:03:21.620
Yuya musters up,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.986
the Commander can't be
taken down

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:26.053
as long as Dystopia is
equipped with Delay Armor.

00:03:26.053 --> 00:03:28.920
(Grace)
But like, that's what's
so thrilling.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.686
Yuya can't
destroy Dystopia,

00:03:30.686 --> 00:03:32.753
and if he like tries,

00:03:32.753 --> 00:03:35.386
Urban Demise
destroys his monster.

00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:37.553
Yuya, I, like,
can't wait...

00:03:37.553 --> 00:03:39.420
for the wow!

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.820
(Noro)
Me either, cause if Aster wins,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.386
he'll certainly have me
demoted or worse!

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:46.053
All that time I spent groveling
and backbiting will be wasted!

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.553
You're in heaps of
trouble, Yuya.

00:03:49.553 --> 00:03:51.820
Now listen up.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.086
Aster has one focus only,
to finish you off.

00:03:56.086 --> 00:03:57.686
You have to accept
that there's no changing

00:03:57.686 --> 00:03:58.920
his Duel Academy ways.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.986
No, Yuto.

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:03.293
My gut's telling me I can
help Aster see things my way.

00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:05.660
Why do you
have to be so stubborn?

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.493
If your dad couldn't
get through to him,

00:04:07.493 --> 00:04:08.926
then what
chance do you have?

00:04:08.926 --> 00:04:10.660
That's where
you're wrong.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.426
My dad did get through
to him.

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:13.893
I'm sure of it!

00:04:13.893 --> 00:04:16.326
Don't let
that face fool you.

00:04:16.326 --> 00:04:19.360
I know deep down, Aster's got
a smile that wants to shine.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.993
And I'm going to do whatever
it takes to make that happen!

00:04:23.493 --> 00:04:25.926
It's my turn!

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:28.560
I can tell that your
emotions are wiggle‐wagging

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.193
back and forth like
this pendulum.

00:04:31.193 --> 00:04:32.693
Like a pendulum?

00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:34.826
Ridiculous!

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:36.659
The Professor
taught you that

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.526
dueling is for power
and control,

00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:41.626
but my dad told you that
it's for fun and smiles!

00:04:41.626 --> 00:04:43.426
So which of the two
is right?

00:04:43.426 --> 00:04:44.793
For me it's a no‐brainer,

00:04:44.793 --> 00:04:46.860
but I bet you're
having doubts.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.360
Not in the slightest!

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.293
Come on, admit it.

00:04:50.293 --> 00:04:52.560
You had a blast
dueling against my dad,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.060
didn't you, Aster?

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.560
I don't know what
you're talking about!

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.326
I'll jog your memory...

00:04:57.326 --> 00:04:59.660
with a Pendulum Summon!

Performapal Laugh Maker!

I doubt it!

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.933
Laugh Maker,
attack Dystopia!

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.366
Why's he attacking when he
has the weaker monster?

00:05:40.366 --> 00:05:42.200
Chillax,
wait and see.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.666
I'm sure his monster's
packin' some pop

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:46.933
that'll knock
Aster for a loop!

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:50.100
(Aster)
You're just dueltaining
your way to defeat.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.533
Now we're about to
see who gets the last laugh.

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:54.866
Thanks to Urban Demise,

00:05:54.866 --> 00:05:57.533
Dystopia's attack points
increase by 100!

00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:59.166
That's fine with me,

00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:01.106
because whenever your
monster gains attack points,

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:04.406
Laugh Maker's attack points
increase by 1,000!

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.306
Perfect!

00:06:10.306 --> 00:06:12.773
Now Yuya's monster
is stronger than Aster's!

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:14.873
Think you outsmarted me?

00:06:14.873 --> 00:06:17.206
Well, believe me,
Yuya, you haven't!

00:06:17.206 --> 00:06:19.906
When your monster's attack
points change,

00:06:19.906 --> 00:06:23.473
Dystopia can
automatically destroy it!

00:06:28.473 --> 00:06:29.840
That would be true,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.006
if I didn't have
this trap card handy!

00:06:32.006 --> 00:06:33.906
Thanks to Performing
Pal's Counterstrike

00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:36.106
instead of
destroying my monster,

00:06:36.106 --> 00:06:37.273
yours is destroyed!

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.840
You still haven't
outsmarted me yet!

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.873
Delay Armor takes
the blast instead,

00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:48.206
shielding Dystopia
from destruction!

00:06:48.206 --> 00:06:49.606
So Dystopia's safe!

00:06:53.506 --> 00:06:54.873
But Laugh Maker
can still attack!

00:06:56.173 --> 00:06:57.473
Chuckle Charge!

00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:04.813
(Yuya)
Chuckle Charge!

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.080
Way to add some sparks to
this duel, Laugh Maker!

00:07:19.613 --> 00:07:21.413
Looks like
Laugh Maker...

00:07:21.413 --> 00:07:22.780
got the last laugh.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.746
There's plenty of
duel left.

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:26.713
Then that means there's
plenty of time for you

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:28.413
to dig deep
and find the fun.

00:07:28.413 --> 00:07:30.213
What do you got to lose?

00:07:30.213 --> 00:07:33.146
Only my patience
with all this fun talk.

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:34.613
I'm a soldier, Yuya.

00:07:34.613 --> 00:07:36.680
I'm not a clown
in some circus.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.080
Are you sure about that?

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.446
'Cause it seems
like you're putting on

00:07:39.446 --> 00:07:40.613
quite the performance.

00:07:40.613 --> 00:07:42.380
Trying to
convince me...

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.213
that you're only down
to destroy.

00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:46.113
You sure you didn't keep

00:07:46.113 --> 00:07:47.480
that half of my dad's card
to remind you

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.313
how much fun
it was to duel him?

00:07:49.313 --> 00:07:50.213
(Aster)
Fun?

00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:51.880
Losing is never fun.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.813
How could I have let
a dueltainer defeat me?

00:07:55.213 --> 00:07:57.146
Now, Dystopia,
unleash your fury!

00:07:57.146 --> 00:07:58.546
Attack!

00:08:00.586 --> 00:08:01.586
(groaning)

00:08:03.986 --> 00:08:05.753
It seems that
I've broken you already.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.620
Y'know, Yusho...

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.320
I heard in show business

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.353
that it's good
to break a leg,

00:08:18.353 --> 00:08:19.786
but you don't
seem so good.

00:08:19.786 --> 00:08:22.120
Maybe now you'll
drop all this fun talk.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.686
No chance.

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:25.886
For even when things
are darker than dark,

00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:28.086
they can always be brightened
with a smile.

00:08:28.086 --> 00:08:29.220
A smile?

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.920
Enough already!

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.386
I'll prove it to you.

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:33.920
Now you just
pry those peepers

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.886
and let your gaze
be amazed.

00:08:35.886 --> 00:08:38.786
I promise that you'll
be smiling in no time!

00:08:38.786 --> 00:08:41.620
So you're still...
gonna keep fighting?

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.186
Well, of course.

00:08:43.186 --> 00:08:44.586
Just because
I got knocked down

00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:45.986
doesn't mean I'm
gonna give up

00:08:45.986 --> 00:08:47.453
getting through to you.

00:08:47.453 --> 00:08:49.220
Yeah, well,
maybe you should.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.253
Look where dueltaining
got you,

00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:53.586
laying in the mud
with a hurt leg.

00:08:53.586 --> 00:08:55.886
You expect me to wanna
learn to duel from you?

00:08:55.886 --> 00:08:57.520
Please.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.353
You can't teach me
anything worth learning.

00:08:59.353 --> 00:09:01.626
Well, let's just see...

00:09:01.626 --> 00:09:04.660
if I can
prove you wrong.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.860
Now then, I believe
it's my turn.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.193
♪♪♪

00:09:08.193 --> 00:09:09.993
I activate...

00:09:09.993 --> 00:09:11.693
the spell card
Smile World!

00:09:14.593 --> 00:09:17.493
Now, it's certainly true
that I cannot undo the bad

00:09:17.493 --> 00:09:19.693
that Duel Academy has
already done,

00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:21.926
but I can help you
have a change of heart.

00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:24.126
Now let's have some
fun, shall we?

00:09:24.126 --> 00:09:25.426
Whatever!

00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:27.193
Your dueltaining philosophy

00:09:27.193 --> 00:09:28.526
doesn't have
a leg to stand on,

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.160
and I mean that
literally!

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.660
My dear boy,

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.226
who needs
a leg to stand on

00:09:33.226 --> 00:09:36.026
when I'm about to fly
high into the sky!

00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:36.693
Ha.

00:09:42.226 --> 00:09:43.626
(laughing)

00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:45.160
I'm taking this
duel to new heights!

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.693
Looking good
down there, my boy!

00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:52.760
Now what do you say we add
some light to the night?

00:09:55.293 --> 00:09:57.526
Ahh, that's much better.

00:09:57.526 --> 00:09:59.593
Aster, did you know
the shortest distance

00:09:59.593 --> 00:10:01.633
between two people
is a smile?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.600
No matter what I did,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.700
no matter how
many monsters attacked,

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.566
your dad never stopped
smiling for a sec.

00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:12.033
I've never
seen anything so dumb

00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:13.833
and pathetic in my life.

00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:16.766
Your dueltaininig might work
in imagination land

00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:18.533
with fairytales and gumdrops

00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:20.000
but out here
in the real world,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.733
it's duel or doom.

00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:24.233
So why don't you and your
dad take your dueltaining,

00:10:24.233 --> 00:10:26.166
your smiles and your fun

00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:28.300
and share it with
someone who cares?

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.433
Just get it
through your brain,

00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:31.966
I'm Duel Academy
to the core!

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:33.966
I draw!

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:37.633
Now, Dystopia, muzzle that
Laugh Maker once and for all!

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.633
(grunting)

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.100
Hold it right there!

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.100
(yelling)

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.466
Like that was
an epic fail.

00:10:57.466 --> 00:11:00.100
He totes
needs like a miracle.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.940
Yuya will need
more than that.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.106
Aster has this one
in the bag.

00:11:04.106 --> 00:11:06.640
(Noro)
I just hope that bag
has a hole in it,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.340
because if that twerp loses,
I'm through!

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.306
I place
one card facedown.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.573
With that I end my turn.

00:11:15.573 --> 00:11:17.906
Bet you don't feel
like smiling now!

00:11:17.906 --> 00:11:19.306
Get up off
your knees and fight!

00:11:23.573 --> 00:11:25.006
I'll fight you all right,

00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:27.640
because my dad taught me
to never give up.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.006
So I'm not givin' up

00:11:29.006 --> 00:11:31.006
gettin' you
to duel for fun.

00:11:31.006 --> 00:11:32.506
But, Yuya, if you fail,

00:11:32.506 --> 00:11:34.773
Aster will
turn you into a card!

00:11:34.773 --> 00:11:36.540
(Yuya)
I know.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.140
I'm laying it all on the line,
just like my dad did!

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.840
Get set to
scream...

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.306
to the extreme!

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:48.440
Here I go.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.940
It's showtime!

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.273
Smile World?

00:11:55.273 --> 00:11:57.140
Awesome!

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.373
No matter
how far apart we are,

00:11:58.373 --> 00:12:00.580
my dad's always
by my side.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.480
Hello, dueling fans!

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.780
Oh, boy!

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.846
(laughing)

00:12:09.846 --> 00:12:11.213
Oh!

00:12:11.213 --> 00:12:14.346
That glee was
a yippee for Aster.

00:12:14.346 --> 00:12:17.280
I'll let HQ know there
isn't need for woe.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.513
How pathetic.

00:12:19.513 --> 00:12:22.146
I can't wait 'til I put an
end to this duel debacle.

00:12:22.146 --> 00:12:23.513
Well, in the meantime,

00:12:23.513 --> 00:12:25.580
I'm going to reset my
Pendulum Scale

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.313
with the help of

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:30.613
Timegazer Magician
and the spell Scale Up!

00:12:30.613 --> 00:12:33.413
Now I can raise Timegazer's
Scale by two,

00:12:33.413 --> 00:12:35.513
so it jumps
from eight to ten!

00:12:38.713 --> 00:12:39.580
All the way to ten?

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.946
Yes, sirree!

00:12:43.946 --> 00:12:45.380
Now I can summon monsters

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.146
from Levels
five through nine

00:12:47.146 --> 00:12:49.180
all at the same time!

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.180
Swing far, pendulum!

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.513
Carve the arc of
victory!

00:12:55.313 --> 00:12:57.680
That means you can bring back
any of your monsters.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.180
Yeah!

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.786
And I just know deep down,

00:13:00.786 --> 00:13:03.353
they're going to be
so happy to see you!

00:13:03.353 --> 00:13:05.253
Get set for their
grand entrance.

00:13:05.253 --> 00:13:07.286
And there swift departure,

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:08.520
when I get through
with them!

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.153
My monsters are ready...

00:13:10.153 --> 00:13:12.686
to swing into
action!

00:13:15.353 --> 00:13:18.586
In an encore performance,
it's Dag Daggerman!

00:13:18.586 --> 00:13:20.153
And reprising its role,

00:13:20.153 --> 00:13:21.853
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.653
And last but certainly
not least...

00:13:25.653 --> 00:13:27.353
Laugh Maker!

00:13:27.353 --> 00:13:28.453
Yeah!

00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:33.253
I admit, bringing those
three back is laughable.

00:13:33.253 --> 00:13:35.120
You'll like them
a lot better

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.653
once you get to know them!

00:13:36.653 --> 00:13:38.820
Which is why
I'm activating the spell

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.820
Performance Exchange!

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.220
And the first thing
I've got to do

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.186
is pick
a pal on my field.

00:13:44.186 --> 00:13:45.886
Then I'm giving you control

00:13:45.886 --> 00:13:47.653
of all my other
monsters that have

00:13:47.653 --> 00:13:51.086
lower Levels by sending them
over to your field!

00:13:51.086 --> 00:13:53.186
I choose Laugh Maker.

00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:55.086
So that means I'm saying
see ya to

00:13:55.086 --> 00:13:57.420
Dag Daggerman
and Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:13:59.986 --> 00:14:02.226
Listen, I don't want
these lame‐os of yours.

00:14:02.226 --> 00:14:04.426
Especially this bowtie bozo!

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:07.626
Just think of it
as a gift from me to you.

00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:09.793
Hope you didn't lose
the receipt!

00:14:09.793 --> 00:14:11.426
Easy there, buddy!

00:14:11.426 --> 00:14:14.426
Is your anger meter
always in the red?

00:14:14.426 --> 00:14:16.960
Well, good thing
I've got the perfect spell

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.493
to turn that burn!

00:14:18.493 --> 00:14:20.360
And I know that
it's a card

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.360
that you're
pretty familiar with!

00:14:25.226 --> 00:14:26.626
Yusho used that card...

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.960
Whoa!

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.160
It's Smile World!

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.326
That card
could sweeten up

00:14:34.326 --> 00:14:36.726
even the most sour
of sourpusses!

00:14:36.726 --> 00:14:38.860
Yeah, but not Aster.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.126
(grumbling)

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.326
Since there are
four monsters on the field,

00:14:44.326 --> 00:14:45.960
Smile World gives
every monster

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.893
400 attack points!

00:14:47.893 --> 00:14:50.726
That's sure to bring
a smile to all their faces,

00:14:50.726 --> 00:14:52.360
right, Laugh Maker?

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.393
(laughing)

00:14:55.093 --> 00:14:57.460
These monsters may be
amused but I'm not!

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.266
I'm gonna wipe those
smiles off their faces!

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.366
You know,
you're a tough cookie!

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:04.266
I guess I'll just have to
come up with

00:15:04.266 --> 00:15:06.800
another way to
create some fun!

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.433
Like maybe this!

00:15:08.433 --> 00:15:11.200
Laugh Maker turns into
a super‐powered jokester

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.700
by activating its
special ability!

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.466
In a flash, it'll gain

00:15:15.466 --> 00:15:18.000
1,000 attack points for
each and every monster

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.866
that has already
gained attack points

00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:21.033
during this turn!

00:15:21.033 --> 00:15:23.133
That's 4,000 life points!

00:15:23.133 --> 00:15:24.333
(all laughing)

00:15:28.766 --> 00:15:30.066
(laughing)

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.433
Now it's got
6,900 attack points!

00:15:35.433 --> 00:15:37.233
Before you know it,
Laugh Maker will have

00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:39.133
Commander Phoenix
in stitches!

00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:41.233
Don't be so sure.

00:15:41.233 --> 00:15:44.866
Yuya still has to contend
with Aster's Dystopia combo.

00:15:44.866 --> 00:15:46.400
You just blew it

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.433
by changing Dystopia's
attack points

00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:49.833
with Smile World!

00:15:49.833 --> 00:15:51.566
Now it can use its
special ability

00:15:51.566 --> 00:15:52.800
to destroy Laugh Maker!

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.166
When are you
going to learn, Yuya?

00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:59.273
I said, no more
Action Cards!

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.273
Ahh!

00:16:06.406 --> 00:16:08.106
I'm taking you down!

00:16:08.106 --> 00:16:09.973
By discarding one card
from my hand,

00:16:09.973 --> 00:16:11.740
I destroy this steel cage,

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.873
and the chain that
binds us together!

00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:15.273
So your swing is swung!

00:16:20.773 --> 00:16:22.240
Happy landing!

00:16:23.706 --> 00:16:24.273
(yelling)

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.273
(yelling)

00:16:41.006 --> 00:16:42.273
Is this what you
were trying to get?

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.906
There's nowhere left
to run, Yuya!

00:16:51.206 --> 00:16:54.073
You no longer
have any monsters.

00:16:54.073 --> 00:16:56.173
Looks like Duel Academy's
techniques

00:16:56.173 --> 00:16:58.773
are superior to
your duel‐laming!

00:16:58.773 --> 00:17:00.913
Oh, sick burn!

00:17:00.913 --> 00:17:02.113
Sounds like you're actually
getting into

00:17:02.113 --> 00:17:03.813
the dueltaining spirit.

00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:06.146
I think you're mistaken.

00:17:06.146 --> 00:17:08.380
Well, that's
what your brain says

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.680
but your heart is telling
me something different.

00:17:12.346 --> 00:17:14.713
Come on, Aster, I know you
love dueltaining,

00:17:14.713 --> 00:17:15.413
just admit it.

00:17:16.213 --> 00:17:17.913
Just make your move!

00:17:17.913 --> 00:17:20.280
Okay, then let's
get back to the duel!

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.246
Since you destroyed
Laugh Maker...

00:17:22.246 --> 00:17:24.780
I can summon
Brave‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.280
back from my graveyard,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.780
and all of your monsters
on your field have their

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.213
attack points
zapped to zero!

00:17:35.646 --> 00:17:38.213
(roaring)

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.613
You brought that
monster out earlier

00:17:42.613 --> 00:17:44.046
and it didn't fair
too well.

00:17:44.046 --> 00:17:45.413
And it still won't!

00:17:45.413 --> 00:17:47.180
Actually,
if I remember correctly,

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.013
Brave‐Eyes showed that
Fusion Monsters

00:17:49.013 --> 00:17:50.946
can be used for
dueltaining too!

00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:54.746
But I destroyed it
in a flash.

00:17:54.746 --> 00:17:57.313
True if you
focus on the negatives,

00:17:57.313 --> 00:17:59.946
but Brave‐Eyes put on a show
so spectacular

00:17:59.946 --> 00:18:02.053
it had you
scrambling for a strategy.

00:18:02.053 --> 00:18:03.153
And it's about to
start again!

00:18:04.786 --> 00:18:06.286
Brace yourself, Aster!

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:08.753
'Cause my
Brave‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon...

00:18:08.753 --> 00:18:10.420
is taking out Dystopia!

00:18:11.586 --> 00:18:12.686
(roaring)

00:18:13.486 --> 00:18:14.820
Amazing.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.353
What a performance!

00:18:16.353 --> 00:18:18.353
I wish I could
say the same thing

00:18:18.353 --> 00:18:20.220
about the Commander.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.253
But I can't, so I'm just
going to zip my lip.

00:18:25.053 --> 00:18:27.820
(Yusho)
You know when two monsters
are evenly matched,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.386
the winner's
going to be the one

00:18:29.386 --> 00:18:32.020
who can best scramble
for a strategy.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.553
And that, my boy,

00:18:33.553 --> 00:18:35.620
is what makes a show
so spectacular!

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.420
Don't you agree?

00:18:37.953 --> 00:18:39.853
No, they're wrong.

00:18:39.853 --> 00:18:43.320
Yuya, I'll start by using
Urban Demise to increase

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.453
Dystopia's attack points!

00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:49.153
And next I'm gonna
activate the trap D‐Soul!

00:18:50.986 --> 00:18:54.186
By banishing one Destiny Hero
from my graveyard,

00:18:54.186 --> 00:18:56.153
Dystopia gains
its attack points.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.460
But that's still not strong
enough to best Brave‐Eyes!

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.260
Oh, I'm not done!

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.760
You think you can impress
using Fusion Monsters,

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.193
well, I can too
using action cards!

00:19:08.193 --> 00:19:11.260
I activate the Action Spell
Double Attack!

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.993
Making Dystopia
stronger than your Brave‐Eyes!

00:19:14.993 --> 00:19:16.093
(roaring)

00:19:18.926 --> 00:19:20.326
Commander Phoenix
has the upper hand!

00:19:23.993 --> 00:19:25.493
(Yusho)
Don't you know
the show's not over

00:19:25.493 --> 00:19:27.593
'til the final card
gets played?

00:19:27.593 --> 00:19:28.926
And if you
don't believe that,

00:19:28.926 --> 00:19:30.393
you just might
get played!

00:19:31.526 --> 00:19:32.493
(shouting)

00:19:33.526 --> 00:19:34.826
(roaring)

00:19:39.793 --> 00:19:41.260
Way to stick the landing.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.226
I activate the Action Spell
Miracle Fire!

00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:45.793
Huh?

00:19:45.793 --> 00:19:48.693
It copies the effect of
another Action Spell!

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.960
And copying Double Attack
is just the ticket,

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.293
'cause it doubles

00:19:55.293 --> 00:19:58.093
Brave‐Eyes's attack points
to 6,600!

00:19:59.733 --> 00:20:01.733
Let's finish big,
Brave‐Eyes!

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:03.666
Now heat things up!

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:06.000
Searing Flame Strike!

00:20:27.766 --> 00:20:29.000
That's gorge.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.033
Wha...

00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:42.400
A dueltainer
beat me again.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.766
(Aster)
How lame.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.306
Yuya won!

00:21:01.306 --> 00:21:03.173
How 'bout a hugzies?

00:21:03.173 --> 00:21:06.506
Ha, looks like I won't be on
toilet patrol after all.

00:21:06.506 --> 00:21:08.640
Enough with
the celebrating!

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.006
If the Professor hears how
the Lancers outdueled us,

00:21:11.006 --> 00:21:13.540
he's going to make
us pay for failing him.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.440
(clearing throat)

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.606
Don't worry.

00:21:15.606 --> 00:21:16.640
You won't be punished.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.606
Because
Noro has a plan.

00:21:22.273 --> 00:21:23.940
(tires screeching)
