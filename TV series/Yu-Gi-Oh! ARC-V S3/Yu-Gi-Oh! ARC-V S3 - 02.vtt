00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.033
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh ARC‐V"...

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:08.233
(groaning)

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:11.400
Whoa, it looks like New Domino
City got totally blown away!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.966
We're not
in New Domino City.

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.866
This is my home.

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.700
Or what's left of it.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.966
We're in the Xyz Dimension.

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.666
Don't do it! No!

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.966
(trilling sound)

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.100
(gasping)

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.666
No way!

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.966
He turned him into a card!

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.566
We're looking
for a friend of ours.

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.800
Her name is Zuzu Boyle.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.933
If she was here, she's probably
been turned into a card by now.

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.433
There's not many of us left.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.000
Six targets found
and soon to be acquired.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.466
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.766
You might think
we're just following

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.400
the Professor's orders.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.133
But we'd carry out his plan even
if he didn't order us to

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.400
because we believe
in his project!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.866
Yeah, it's a mindblower
he calls the ARC Project.

00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:01.106
It'll merge all four dimensions
into a single, perfect world!

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:04.140
(all)
Our monsters are ready...

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.906
... to swing into action!

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:13.906
(screaming)

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:17.440
(man)
Come on!

00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:19.940
(explosion)

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.706
What was that?

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:27.106
Looks like this
is my lucky day.

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:29.906
I love it when the prey
comes to me.

I can't believe you
turned them into cards.

00:02:40.113 --> 00:02:41.546
They got what they deserved.

00:02:41.546 --> 00:02:42.946
They're from Duel Academy!

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:44.813
My sworn enemies.

00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:47.846
But not even my worst enemy
deserves anything so awful!

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:49.646
Imagine being trapped
inside a card?

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:50.880
That's horrible!

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.080
That's right!

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.213
By doing what
you just did,

00:02:53.213 --> 00:02:55.280
you proved you're just
as twisted as they are!

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.713
But, um...

00:02:56.713 --> 00:02:59.313
You tried to do the exact same
thing a little while ago.

00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:01.486
Are you with the Resistance?

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:05.420
We've been looking
all over for you guys!

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.220
I don't know who you
are and I don't care.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.686
I'm getting rid of you
all right here, right now.

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:13.953
So say goodbye to Blondie over
there and your pathetically

00:03:13.953 --> 00:03:15.853
coiffed pal
with the pompadour.

00:03:15.853 --> 00:03:18.086
No! We're on
the same side!

00:03:18.086 --> 00:03:19.586
I'll be the judge
of that.

00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:23.253
Just listen
to me first!

00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:27.420
Anyone can claim to be against
Duel Academy or to be my ally.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.486
But words can deceive.

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:32.820
Lies have cost me too much
and now I trust no one,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.786
so let's duel!

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:35.253
Sure thing.

00:03:35.253 --> 00:03:36.853
Won't take a minute
to ice this guy.

00:03:36.853 --> 00:03:38.353
Hold on!

00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:39.986
Gong's thinking it might
be best to chill!

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.586
I'm chill!

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:43.153
In fact, I'm as cool
as a cucumber

00:03:43.153 --> 00:03:44.586
and I'm betting
this bigmouth

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:46.720
is all talk
and absolutely no walk!

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.053
By the time
I'm through with him

00:03:48.053 --> 00:03:49.486
he'll be begging
for a second chance

00:03:49.486 --> 00:03:51.353
to make
a first impression.

00:03:51.353 --> 00:03:53.520
You didn't have us
as enemies before...

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.653
But you do now!

00:03:55.653 --> 00:03:57.153
By challenging us
to a duel,

00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.553
you just ordered
yourself a Sylvio slamdown

00:04:00.553 --> 00:04:04.260
and I'll be serving it up,
compliments of the house!

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.626
Your order's up!

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:09.726
(computerized voice)
Generating Action
Field Crossover.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.726
Action Field?

00:04:14.726 --> 00:04:16.493
Impressive, huh?

00:04:16.493 --> 00:04:19.426
Action duels are a new type
of dueling I invented!

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:22.526
Oh, really?
You invented
Action Duels?

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:24.860
Only thing you invent are new
ways to bend the truth.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.893
Are you two
done interrupting?

00:04:26.893 --> 00:04:28.726
Pardon my two minions.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.726
Now let's get started,
shall we?

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:32.160
Two minions?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.459
Sylvio...

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:34.659
That's me!

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.859
The first name
in Action Dueling!

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:39.960
It's times like these I wish
Sylvio had an off switch.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.193
Or at least a mute button.

00:04:42.193 --> 00:04:43.393
Let's duel!

00:04:43.393 --> 00:04:45.526
The first turn is mine!

00:04:45.526 --> 00:04:47.026
And I'm using it
to set the stage

00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:49.860
with Abyss Actor Wild Hope!

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.526
(grunts)

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:55.826
Then I'll place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:57.426
Then it's my move.

00:04:57.426 --> 00:04:58.926
(Gong)
Hold that draw!

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:01.000
Gong ain't gonna sit back and
let you get away

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.700
with dissing his do.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.400
(computerized voice)
<i>Intrusion penalty.</i>

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.200
<i>2,000 life points.</i>

00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:13.466
Gong summons Superheavy Samurai
Swordsman in attack mode!

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.800
Wow, a monster in attack mode
is not Gong's style

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.100
but I like the fact

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.133
that he's changing things up
and coming out swinging!

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:25.800
He must really hate it
when someone pokes fun

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.633
at his pompadour.

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:29.333
Let's double‐team
this punk!

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:31.533
We'll attack on my mark!

00:05:31.533 --> 00:05:32.600
Sorry.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.400
Not happening.
Huh?

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.333
Gong thinks this clown show
has gone on long enough.

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:40.800
Gong equips Superheavy Samurai
Soulpeacemaker

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.266
on to Gong's Swordsman!

00:05:44.266 --> 00:05:46.100
So now Gong's Swordsman
is the only monster

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.066
that can be attacked!

00:05:48.066 --> 00:05:50.000
What a smart move.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.500
Gong's opponents can only attack
Swordsman, but Swordsman has its

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.966
own special ability
that zeroes out

00:05:55.966 --> 00:05:57.900
it's opponent's attack points.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.700
So if anyone attacks Gong,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.906
it's like running headlong
into defeat.

00:06:01.906 --> 00:06:04.106
That means no one can attack,

00:06:04.106 --> 00:06:07.106
not Gong, not Sylvio,
not anyone!

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:09.440
(Gong)
Now that no one can attack,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.006
everyone can take a moment
to chill and talk this out.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.873
(Yuya)
This guy might not be
with the Resistance,

00:06:15.873 --> 00:06:18.873
but he's definitely
not a fan of Duel Academy.

00:06:18.873 --> 00:06:20.840
He might be a good ally to have,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.840
if he doesn't turn us all
into cards first.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.406
That was quick thinking!

00:06:26.406 --> 00:06:29.073
I knew you were smart
but that was downright genius!

00:06:29.073 --> 00:06:30.673
Gong's got brains
and the brawn!

00:06:30.673 --> 00:06:33.306
If you two are through,
there's a duel over here

00:06:33.306 --> 00:06:35.206
that needs to be won!

00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:38.340
And I'm about to make sure
that happens!

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.373
I'm now activating
the Action Spell, Broken Ruin!

00:06:42.373 --> 00:06:44.740
If you're holding a different
number of cards than me,

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.206
then you take 300
points of damage

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:50.106
for each extra card
you have in your hand!

00:06:50.106 --> 00:06:52.406
I'm holding three cards
to your five.

00:06:52.406 --> 00:06:56.140
Your two extra cards will
cost you 600 life points!

00:07:00.113 --> 00:07:01.780
Dagnabbit!

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.780
Since Blondie over there
took damage, my Soulpeacemaker

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.213
is automatically destroyed.

00:07:06.213 --> 00:07:07.580
(giggling)

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.913
Exactly as I had planned!

00:07:09.913 --> 00:07:12.146
Now we can attack each other
again, 'cause what's an action

00:07:12.146 --> 00:07:13.380
duel with no action!

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.980
Hey, you big dummy!

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.480
Gong was just tryin' to buy some
time so that we can all talk

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.080
and hash things out!

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.580
Why would I ever want
to do that, Gong?

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.613
Try putting a few
brain cells to work!

00:07:23.613 --> 00:07:26.013
Anybody who claims to be
an enemy of Duel Academy

00:07:26.013 --> 00:07:27.746
is a friend to us!

00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:28.646
I'm not
your friend.

00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:30.280
I have no friends.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.313
They've all been taken away

00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:35.080
and I'm going to relish making
you pay for their pain!

00:07:39.946 --> 00:07:41.913
I can see
right through you!

00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:44.413
Action Field,
Action Spells...

00:07:44.413 --> 00:07:47.446
I've spent my whole life in
Heartland and I guarantee nobody

00:07:47.446 --> 00:07:49.613
around here duels
the way you do.

00:07:49.613 --> 00:07:53.313
You're clearly
not from around here,

00:07:53.313 --> 00:07:54.913
and if you're not
from here,

00:07:54.913 --> 00:07:56.280
then I don't know you.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.480
And if I don't know you,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.380
you will be hunted down
like the enemy!

00:07:59.953 --> 00:08:01.120
I draw!

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:08.353
And I'll start by summoning
Cipher Wing!

00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:09.353
(gasps)

00:08:09.353 --> 00:08:11.220
Cipher?

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.720
When I have one Cipher Wing on
my field, I can summon another

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.720
one from my hand
to double the threat!

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.486
Gong knows what's next!

00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:21.053
Two Level 4's...

00:08:21.053 --> 00:08:23.953
Can only mean he's
gonna Xyz Summon!

00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:25.553
Not on my watch!

00:08:25.553 --> 00:08:29.686
Because I'm activating the trap,
Abyss Actor's Injury!

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:32.620
In the acting world,
breaking a leg means good luck.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.853
But it won't be good luck
if I break a wing,

00:08:34.853 --> 00:08:37.220
a Cipher Wing
to be exact!

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:42.720
You can no longer use it to
summon another monster!

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.020
So now any Xyz Summoning
you were planning is a no‐go.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.886
You had that trap
ready to activate

00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:50.953
from the start
o' this duel.

00:08:50.953 --> 00:08:53.386
(Sylvio)
Look at him admiring my genius!

00:08:53.386 --> 00:08:55.153
The second we ran into
this hotshot,

00:08:55.153 --> 00:08:57.553
my eyes zeroed in
on his dragon.

00:08:57.553 --> 00:08:59.253
I'd never seen one like it.

00:08:59.253 --> 00:09:02.160
I could sense right away it was
his monster of choice.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.726
With Duel Academy hunting down
everyone in sight,

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:06.393
the fact this guy has survived

00:09:06.393 --> 00:09:09.193
means his dragon must be
amazingly powerful,

00:09:09.193 --> 00:09:12.193
So I had to make sure that he
couldn't Xyz Summon it!

00:09:12.193 --> 00:09:14.493
Only thing tough about him
is his talk.

00:09:14.493 --> 00:09:15.493
I can read him like book.

00:09:17.026 --> 00:09:19.493
Gong can appreciate your
strategy, but you're trying to

00:09:19.493 --> 00:09:21.926
put out a fire
with kerosene!
Huh?

00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:24.160
Can't you get it through
that eggshell on your neck

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.026
that you're just
making things worse?

00:09:27.026 --> 00:09:28.226
It's hopeless.

00:09:28.226 --> 00:09:29.593
(surprised groans)

00:09:29.593 --> 00:09:32.426
You have no clue
the true skills Kite possesses.

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:34.760
But how...?

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.160
(Yuya)
How did I know his name?

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.426
Only someone from the Xyz
Dimension would know...

00:09:41.426 --> 00:09:42.893
Like you, Yuto!

00:09:44.093 --> 00:09:46.660
Kite... Kite Tenjo.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.760
One of the best, if not
the best, in all of
Heartland.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.526
But he's acting differently
than before...

00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:58.260
The Kite I knew always
had a smile on his face.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.026
You can't stop
the unstoppable!

00:10:00.026 --> 00:10:04.233
I activate the spell
Cipher Interference!

00:10:04.233 --> 00:10:07.166
When I have at least two Cipher
Wings, one of them has their

00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:11.366
attack points
doubled during battle.

00:10:11.366 --> 00:10:12.633
Cipher Wing!

00:10:12.633 --> 00:10:14.900
Take out Abyss Actor Wild Hope!

00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:19.833
You may have ended
Wild Hope's career,

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:22.266
but it has one grand
finale in store.

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:25.366
Its special ability allows me to
add one Abyss Actor in my deck

00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:27.066
to my hand!!

00:10:27.066 --> 00:10:29.233
That won't help you
when my other Cipher Wing

00:10:29.233 --> 00:10:32.066
attacks you directly!

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:33.000
(screams)

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:36.800
Sylvio!

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.666
I've had my fun with you
for now, but know this.

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:43.866
I like to toy with my prey
before I strike the final blow.

00:10:43.866 --> 00:10:46.333
I end my turn
with two facedowns.

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:48.266
(growling)

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:53.200
Gong bets your back wishes you
hadn't jumpstarted this duel

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.333
(Yuto)
Kite may be full of anger now,

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:57.633
but I'll never forget
those moves.

00:10:57.633 --> 00:10:59.833
Moves that only Kite can do.

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:01.640
Moves that made him
a champion.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.506
(Yuya)
But he's changed?

00:11:03.506 --> 00:11:06.673
He has.
Kite used to duel with joy.

00:11:06.673 --> 00:11:10.740
Now all I sense is rage,
a rage so intense

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.440
that it's consumed
him completely.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.373
(Yuya)
Rage?

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:16.873
Yes.

00:11:16.873 --> 00:11:18.873
Whatever happened to Kite
transformed him

00:11:18.873 --> 00:11:21.673
into an engine
of destruction.

00:11:21.673 --> 00:11:23.206
Your friends
are finished!

00:11:28.606 --> 00:11:31.140
I've had enough of this, Kite!

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.773
I figured it would be a kind
gesture to go easy on you

00:11:33.773 --> 00:11:35.606
since you've
been through so much

00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:38.940
but I'm having a change of
heart, so no more Mr. Nice Guy!

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.773
I'm setting the Pendulum Scale
with Scale 1

00:11:41.773 --> 00:11:44.606
Abyss Actor ‐ Evil Heel
and Scale 8

00:11:44.606 --> 00:11:46.940
Abyss Actor ‐ Funky Comedian!

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.806
They'll put on a show
you'll never forget!

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.280
Now I can summon a medley of
monsters between Levels 2 and 7!

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.346
What's this?

00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:07.980
I Pendulum Summon!

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.813
It's time to take the stage!

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:13.046
Let's hear it for Abyss Actor ‐
Superstar,

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:17.880
and, in an encore performance,
Abyss Actor Wild Hope!

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.713
I already destroyed
that exact monster...

00:12:21.713 --> 00:12:24.413
How could he summon it back?

00:12:24.413 --> 00:12:26.846
Shay and I first met Kite
at a dueling tournament

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:29.746
that was being held between
our two schools.

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:32.380
Kite was Clover School's
star duelist.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.746
His instincts were
always on point.

00:12:34.746 --> 00:12:37.013
You make a move,
he had a spell ready.

00:12:37.013 --> 00:12:40.580
You make another move, he had
trap ready for that too.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.580
Now Superstar!
It's time!

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.813
Activate your special ability

00:12:45.813 --> 00:12:47.913
and get the script
for your next role!

00:12:47.913 --> 00:12:52.746
And this one's guaranteed
to be a scorcher!

00:12:52.746 --> 00:12:54.513
I'm gonna turn up the heat

00:12:54.513 --> 00:12:56.280
by activating
Abyss Script Fire

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.080
Dragon's Lair!

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.853
Now every time Abyss Actor
Superstar destroys your monster,

00:13:01.853 --> 00:13:04.353
you, my good man,
have to banish three cards

00:13:04.353 --> 00:13:06.520
from your Extra Deck!

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.520
If Sylvio's right and Kite's
go‐to dragon is an Xyz Monster,

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.286
then Sylvio
can now get rid of it!

00:13:12.286 --> 00:13:13.953
And there's more!

00:13:13.953 --> 00:13:17.253
I'm playing the spell Abyss
Actors' Costume Chest!

00:13:17.253 --> 00:13:19.820
Every time I open this chest,
I can pull out a new prop

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.653
for Superstar to hold.

00:13:21.653 --> 00:13:24.720
And first up
is my Hero's Sword!

00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:33.953
It gives Abyss Actor Superstar
300 more attack points.

00:13:33.953 --> 00:13:36.920
Next, Funky Comedian
will use his Pendulum ability!

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.053
Pendulum ability?

00:13:39.053 --> 00:13:41.720
I'm chock full of surprises,
Kite, and I can tell by the look

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.920
on your face that
you know that now.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.020
You see by returning one
Abyss Actor to my Extra Deck,

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.720
I can give its attack points to
another one of my monsters

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.486
until the end of the turn!

00:13:52.486 --> 00:13:54.953
So Wild Hope,
skedaddle on home

00:13:54.953 --> 00:13:58.720
but leave your 1,600
attack points with Superstar.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.226
Abyss Actor Superstar,
attack and destroy Cipher Wing!

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.393
No, I don't think so!

00:14:09.393 --> 00:14:12.393
Cipher Interference doubles
Cipher Wing's attack points!

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:16.193
Plus, I have another unpleasant
surprise for you!

00:14:16.193 --> 00:14:21.393
I'm activating
the trap Cipher Shield!

00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:24.093
When I have at last two Cipher
monsters on my field,

00:14:24.093 --> 00:14:27.126
my Cipher monsters can't
be destroyed in battle!

00:14:30.493 --> 00:14:32.360
I may have dealt him damage,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.460
but he still has a minute
chance to summon his Dragon.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.593
That's right and there's more
to come so just you wait!

00:14:39.593 --> 00:14:41.660
Since you foolishly
dealt me damage,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.393
I can activate
the trap Cipher Chain!

00:14:47.126 --> 00:14:48.026
(growling)

00:14:48.026 --> 00:14:48.660
What?

00:14:50.393 --> 00:14:53.726
(Kite)
Now if even one monster in this
chain gang is destroyed,

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.760
all other monsters will be
destroyed too!

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.066
And with their destruction we
will each take damage that is

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.966
equal to their attack points.

00:15:01.966 --> 00:15:05.066
That's a lot of damage I don't
think I can count that high!

00:15:05.066 --> 00:15:08.200
It seems you can summon
multiple monsters at once.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.566
So go ahead and do that.

00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:11.400
You'll only be taking
more damage.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.800
Notice how I said you'll
be taking damage, not me.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.900
That's because due to the power
of my Cipher Shield,

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.666
I won't be taking
any damage at all!

00:15:20.666 --> 00:15:25.233
Now Cipher Wing's attack points
drop back normal

00:15:25.233 --> 00:15:27.300
Man, he's relentless.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.933
Does anything faze him?

00:15:28.933 --> 00:15:31.033
No.

00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:34.866
Kite's always prepared, always
expecting the unexpected.

00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:37.233
(Sylvio)
I'm ending my turn.

00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:40.566
Which means my Funky Comedian's
special ability ends and my

00:15:40.566 --> 00:15:44.100
Superstar's attack points are
dropping back down to normal.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.066
Well, on a bright note
you guys,

00:15:46.066 --> 00:15:48.200
at least we'll
be taking less damage.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.166
Well, whoop‐dee‐doo!

00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:54.633
We're still gonna get hit with
over 6,000 points of damage!

00:15:54.633 --> 00:15:56.300
Unless, of course,
Gong tries something

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.000
he'll never see coming...

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.073
It's time for Gong
to have a go!

00:16:03.473 --> 00:16:06.106
Gong summons Superheavy Samurai
Flutist!

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.640
Next by sending Superheavy
Samurai Soulbeads

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.406
to the graveyard,

00:16:15.406 --> 00:16:18.306
Gong is allowed to summon
Gong's Tuner Monster,

00:16:18.306 --> 00:16:21.073
Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter!

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.040
Then Gong's Level 2 Trumpeter
tunes with Level 3 Flutist

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.673
and Swordsman!

00:16:29.673 --> 00:16:32.240
If we wanna free ourselves
from Kite's Chain

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.806
we're gonna need to
break it,

00:16:33.806 --> 00:16:35.706
and I've got the perfect Samurai

00:16:35.706 --> 00:16:37.640
for the job!

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.006
Gong Synchro Summons!

00:16:40.006 --> 00:16:43.973
Superheavy Samurai Ninja
Sarutobi!

00:16:43.973 --> 00:16:47.840
I activate its special ability!

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.106
Since there are no spell or trap
cards in Gong's graveyard,

00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:53.540
it destroys one of Kite's spell
or trap cards,

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.740
and deals him 500
points of damage!

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.606
Go on and break
that Cipher Chain!

00:16:58.606 --> 00:17:00.480
Blast it to smithereens!

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.646
Fortunately, Cipher Shield
protects me from any damage.

00:17:09.646 --> 00:17:13.346
I'm reaching into my Costume
Chest to grab Abyss Costume

00:17:13.346 --> 00:17:16.680
Dwarf's Shield so that my old
pal Gong here is sure to look

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.413
his very best.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:20.313
After all, he really
saved my bacon

00:17:20.313 --> 00:17:22.080
so here's a thank you
present!

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.846
Wear it in good health.

00:17:23.846 --> 00:17:26.113
Might be a little tight, but
I think Sarutobi will find it

00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:29.446
a perfect fit, especially 'cause
Dwarf Shield boosts its defense

00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:30.746
points by 300!

00:17:30.746 --> 00:17:32.046
Thanks, pal!

00:17:32.046 --> 00:17:34.746
Sarutobi, attack Cipher Wing!

00:17:34.746 --> 00:17:37.413
My monster can attack even
when it's in defense mode!

00:17:37.413 --> 00:17:41.213
Hang on!
It's gonna get gusty!

00:17:41.213 --> 00:17:42.480
(Kite)
Maybe for you!

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.480
My spell Cypher Interphere

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.413
doubles Cipher Wing's
attack points.

00:17:47.413 --> 00:17:49.613
And since Cipher Shield
protects it,

00:17:49.613 --> 00:17:53.513
your Sarutobi
can't destroy it!

00:17:53.513 --> 00:17:57.213
You're still gonna
take damage, though!

00:17:57.213 --> 00:18:02.720
My Cipher Interference spell's
effect will come to an end.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.220
The same is true of Gong's turn.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.320
Since Gong destroyed
Cipher Chain,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.753
his life points
are safe and sound

00:18:09.753 --> 00:18:13.053
For now, but they still have
to worry about Kite's dragon

00:18:13.053 --> 00:18:14.020
waiting in the wings.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.720
Yeah...

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.520
As long as Kite has that dragon,
they can't let their guard down,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.886
not even for a moment.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.520
As long as Kite has that dragon,
they can't let their guard down,

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.353
not even for a moment.

00:18:30.353 --> 00:18:32.786
(Sylvio)
Oh, Yuya,
you worry too much!

00:18:32.786 --> 00:18:36.720
My Abyss Actor's Injury is still
in effect so him Xyz Summoning

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.253
his Level 4 monsters
isn't going to happen,

00:18:39.253 --> 00:18:41.986
no way, no how!

00:18:41.986 --> 00:18:43.820
So Mark my words!

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.386
Kite's precious little dragon
will never make an appearance

00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:47.420
in this duel!

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.886
No you're wrong.

00:18:48.886 --> 00:18:50.520
What's that?

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.320
It's my turn.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.686
And I'll start off by summoning
a third Cipher Wing!

00:18:57.686 --> 00:19:00.993
All those Level 4's still
won't help you Xyz Summon.

00:19:00.993 --> 00:19:03.326
Who says they're
staying Level Four?

00:19:03.326 --> 00:19:05.793
By tributing my third
Cipher Wing,

00:19:05.793 --> 00:19:08.560
its special ability
activates!

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.393
And the Levels of all Cipher
monsters on my field

00:19:11.393 --> 00:19:12.826
increase by four.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.926
Gong didn't see
that one comin'!

00:19:16.926 --> 00:19:19.960
I overlay my Level 8 Cipher
Wings to build

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.826
the Overlay Network!

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.793
I Xyz Summon!

00:19:38.793 --> 00:19:42.326
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon!

00:19:42.326 --> 00:19:44.826
(roaring)

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.693
That dragon's
super powerful!

00:19:48.693 --> 00:19:51.460
I sense unnatural rage
in that monster.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.160
As if Kite had transferred his
own anger to his Cipher Dragon.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.293
You tried to stop my dragon,
but what you failed to learn

00:19:58.293 --> 00:20:00.633
was that my dragon's
unstoppable.

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:04.333
That is definitely a sight to
behold ‐ and was certainly

00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:07.466
worth the wait, but one dragon
doesn't rattle this guy,

00:20:07.466 --> 00:20:11.033
'cause I got plenty of tricks
to take you down next turn.

00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:14.600
There won't be a next turn!

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.300
Galaxy‐Eyes use one of your
Overlay Units

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.866
and activate your
special ability!

00:20:19.866 --> 00:20:21.733
Cypher Subjection!

00:20:21.733 --> 00:20:24.033
(roaring)

00:20:24.033 --> 00:20:27.000
I gain control of your monster!

00:20:32.633 --> 00:20:34.666
Sarutobi!

00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:38.300
(Kite)
And now it transforms
into a Galaxy‐Eyes!

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.333
Oh no, he's
got them cornered!

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:49.466
Get set!

00:20:49.466 --> 00:20:55.100
Galaxy‐Eyes Cipher Dragon,
attack Abyss Actor Superstar!

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.033
And now my Cipher Interference
doubles the attack points

00:20:58.033 --> 00:21:00.406
of Galaxy Eyes Cypher Dragon

00:21:00.406 --> 00:21:03.973
making this unstoppable
force even more powerful!

00:21:03.973 --> 00:21:06.706
(roaring)

00:21:07.873 --> 00:21:11.006
Are you ready to lose?

00:21:11.006 --> 00:21:14.240
Cipher Stream of Destruction!

00:21:15.673 --> 00:21:20.706
(gasping)

00:21:20.706 --> 00:21:22.206
And now for you!

00:21:22.206 --> 00:21:24.973
Galaxy‐Eyes,
strike my enemy down!

00:21:28.006 --> 00:21:30.240
(screaming)

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.606
Sylvio!

00:21:33.606 --> 00:21:34.606
Gong!
No!

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:37.440
Stop right there!

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.240
Unless you want to be turned
into a card as well.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.706
Enough!

00:21:41.706 --> 00:21:45.706
You and I are both
on the same side.

00:21:45.706 --> 00:21:47.606
We're here to put
an end to this war

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:50.806
and we can't
stop it unless
we work together!

00:21:50.806 --> 00:21:51.740
Save your breath.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.473
It's useless.

00:21:53.473 --> 00:21:55.506
He doesn't
want to listen.

00:21:55.506 --> 00:21:58.606
Then I guess I'll have to let
my cards do the talking for me!
