[MIKO]
No, ma'am.

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:40.245 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE]
Any kind of unusual occurrences?

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:41.454 position:50% align:center
--[MIKO] No, ma'am!

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
--[HANA] Hey, hold on!
--[MIKO] No, ma'am!

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
[HANA]
What's she mean?!

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Nothing.

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE] She's doing her best
to pretend she can't see it.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
This little girl is tough
as nails and her friend--

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center
her spiritual aura
is far more powerful

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
than I would've expected.

00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
Exceptionally powerful in fact.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
Miko! Have you been
seeing scary stuff?

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
No way. I only see normal stuff.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
You swear?

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
I swear.

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.190 position:50% align:center
On your mom's life?

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Now hold on a sec.

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE] She can't see
the horrors herself.

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
But the things must be drawn
to her like moths to a flame.

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
So why's she asking you

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
if you've seen things
you can't explain?

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
I think she meant
does my eyesight

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
make things look weird to me.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.205 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
Floaters or whatever.

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE]
Her aura's protective.

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
It should stop anything
that comes for her.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
'Scuse me.

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
Do you have other beads?

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:35.008 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE]
Ah, yes.

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center
Just one moment please.

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE] It's clear enough the
long-haired one has the sight.

00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:47.020 position:50% align:center
I may be a con artist, but the
girl's my granddaughter's age!

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
Finally time to break these out.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.401 position:50% align:center
Never thought
that day would come.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE] You've got nothing
to fret over now, cupcake.

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
What I'm about to give you

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
is the most powerful
article in my collection.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.294 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
[HANA]
They're... girthy!

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE] Compared to
the ones you just tried on,

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:20.095 position:50% align:center
these are on
a whole other level.

00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
Take them. No charge.

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Seriously?

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:27.227 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE exhales]
Yes.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
You've already more
than repaid me

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.856 position:50% align:center
by opening my eyes to the truth.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Huh?

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.241 position:50% align:center
[MIKO gasps]

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE]
In my prime,

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.787 position:50% align:center
I loaded those beads with
concentrated spiritual power.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
No more cheap street
illusions for me!

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
As of today,
the Godmother is back!

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
[CHAIN MONSTER 03A]
Itchy!

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
[CHAIN MONSTER 03A groans]

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:04.389 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
[MITSUE groans]

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
[HANA yelps] Oh, my gosh,
ma'am! Are you okay?

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.826 position:50% align:center
[HANA] I guess all prayer
beads are cheap, huh?

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
Even the ones I had on
went flying apart back there!

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
After today, I think
I'm over prayer beads.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
I am, too.

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
That big freaky one...

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
I guess it stopped following me.

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
[MONSTERS groaning]

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
[CHAIN MONSTER 03A]
Itchy...

00:23:22.777 --> 00:23:25.405 position:50% align:center
Uh! Mom?

00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:29.117 position:50% align:center
Hey, son.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.244 position:50% align:center
I'm startin' over.

00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:38.209 position:50% align:center
[JUNJI] Matter of fact,
I've got the sight, too.

00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:40.003 position:50% align:center
I can see a monster right now.

00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:42.339 position:50% align:center
It's behind you,
watchin' this very show!

00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:44.716 position:50% align:center
Next time, "Yep. She Sees Them."

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.760 position:50% align:center
It's an episode about family!

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:50.013 position:50% align:center
A haunted home life?
Boy, that's rough.
