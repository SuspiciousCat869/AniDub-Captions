Hey! I spy Miko!

Please keep your voice down.
It's a hospital, not a rave.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.714
[MIKO] Wait. What're
you guys doing here?

00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:15.238
Hana thought we should
come check up on Mr. Toono.

00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:16.805
Yes, ma'am!

00:03:16.848 --> 00:03:19.024
So, are you feeling
all right now, sir?

so why'd you come?

What do you have
against us helping?

Wait! Miko, have
you been crying?!

Don't hide your tears!
We're all friends!

The accident freaked her out.

Seriously, she's messed up.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.755
She could be traumatized

00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:56.671
just for being in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

00:03:56.714 --> 00:03:59.543
[MIKO] I definitely
wasn't there by chance.

00:03:59.587 --> 00:04:01.850
But it is sweet
she's worried about me.

are fine, but be careful!

if you act so recklessly!

Um, Hana.

You're supposed to be
here to check on him,

00:04:11.163 --> 00:04:12.295
not chew him out.

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.471

Yeah, but he made you cry!

Trust me, he's not the reason.

Gosh! Why are you defending him?

00:04:18.823 --> 00:04:21.391
Could you chill out for a sec?

The spirits. They're...

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:52.857
[MIKO]
They're vanishing.

00:04:53.902 --> 00:04:56.208
[MIKO]
Is it because his mother's gone?

00:04:56.252 --> 00:04:59.690
Or is Hana's spiritual aura
somehow cleansing them?

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.048
Huh?

00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:24.149

Bet'cha I could eat
the whole thing!

Spirits haunt those who
sympathize with their pain.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.768
I wonder if that's why he had so
many around him.

00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:36.336
I think they might be
drawn to him somehow,

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:39.426
but in a different way
than they are to Hana.

[YULIA gasps] I forgot
that Hana isn't in on this!

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.308
[YULIA] Hana doesn't
know you have the sight.

aren't you?

from the clouds?

Yup!

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:22.659
because the place he's been
living doesn't allow any pets.

Aww, that's so sweet!

all warm and fuzzy over a cat.

[MIKO] An actual friend,
believe it or not.

[HANA] That's good.
He's super awkward and quiet

in, like, a serial
killer-y kinda way,

so I wasn't sure.

You want some stew?
I ended up with leftovers again.

seem to make too much.

how clean their kitchens are.

there's hair in the food.

started on containers.

So, the day's finally here.

I'm psyched for <i>Tororo Two</i>.

00:09:31.353 --> 00:09:33.224
You told Yulia about it, right?

00:09:33.268 --> 00:09:35.444
I decided not to invite her.

Why not?

Because she's never seen the
original <i>My Nearby Tororo</i>, duh.

What a weird thing to
get hung up on. Jeez.

<i>Tororo</i>is a modern masterpiece.

experience it properly.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.376
I can't breathe.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.291
Yes, "again, Hana"! Though

00:20:49.335 --> 00:20:52.076
now that I think about it, we
could do another butt bun run.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.817
We went home empty-handed
the other day.

00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.863
I'm fine with whatever--
dealer's choice.

00:20:55.906 --> 00:20:58.213
Oh. Thanks.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:00.868
Aww, just thinking
about it makes me hungry.

00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.304
Emergency melon bread time!

00:21:02.348 --> 00:21:03.740
[MIKO]
Did you miss breakfast?

00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:05.394
[HANA]
Nope! I had both of 'em!

00:21:05.438 --> 00:21:06.830
[MIKO]
You're a literal vacuum.

00:21:06.874 --> 00:21:09.355
[HANA] I'm a growing girl
with a healthy appetite,

00:21:09.398 --> 00:21:11.226
and you are being hurtful.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.229
Good. Next reader.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.665
Yamamoto please.

00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:16.884
She's not here.

00:21:16.927 --> 00:21:19.060
Maybe pick one of
your actual students?

00:21:19.103 --> 00:21:22.455
[ZEN]
Right, Yurikawa?

00:21:22.498 --> 00:21:23.586
[MIKO grunts]

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:25.501
[MIKO]
Hana. He called on you!

00:21:25.545 --> 00:21:27.503
[HANA mumbles]

00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:30.854
I heard they're
playing that show

00:21:30.898 --> 00:21:33.379
with the head in the
locker again tonight.

00:21:33.422 --> 00:21:35.337
[MIKO]
You mean <i>Danger Scare</i>?

00:21:35.381 --> 00:21:36.599
You gonna watch?

00:21:36.643 --> 00:21:38.471
Not even if you paid me.

00:21:38.514 --> 00:21:41.735
Horror on borscht night
is the worst idea.

00:21:41.778 --> 00:21:44.868
[MIKO] Okay, so borscht is,
like, a whole event for you.

00:21:44.912 --> 00:21:48.655
[MIKO panting]

00:21:52.702 --> 00:21:54.922
[YULIA] I'm no match for her
spiritual power, sure,

00:21:54.965 --> 00:21:58.055
but when it comes to
physical prowess, watch out!

00:21:59.448 --> 00:22:00.623
[YULIA]
Got her!

00:22:00.667 --> 00:22:01.363
[YULIA groans]

00:22:01.407 --> 00:22:03.147
[MIKO gasps]
Yulia!

00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:04.671
You okay?

00:22:04.714 --> 00:22:07.064
[YULIA groans]
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:22:07.108 --> 00:22:08.283
[STUDENT 12H]
Are you sure?

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:09.458
[STUDENT 12I]
You hurt?

00:22:09.502 --> 00:22:10.807
Don't worry.

00:22:10.851 --> 00:22:14.507
Guys! I can't run any faster!

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.771
Ooh! Those little
wieners look so good!

00:22:17.814 --> 00:22:18.902
[YULIA grunts]
You want one?

00:22:18.946 --> 00:22:20.643
Wow! Do you mean it?

00:22:20.687 --> 00:22:21.992
[YULIA]
Mmhm.

00:22:22.036 --> 00:22:23.385
[HANA]
Check it out!

00:22:23.429 --> 00:22:26.345
Normal bread plus tiny
wiener equals, wiener roll!

00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:28.695
Except that's not even a roll.

00:22:32.438 --> 00:22:34.048
So this is a butt bun.

00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:35.528
It's super squishy, right?

00:22:35.571 --> 00:22:37.660
Glad we made it there
in time today!

00:22:37.704 --> 00:22:41.229
And what about that new donut?
I was pretty into it.

00:22:41.272 --> 00:22:42.361
[HANA]
What did they call that?

00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:44.275
A Screaming Cruller, I think?

00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:46.887
Oh! I saw the first <i>
My Nearby Tororo</i>.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.715
[HANA]
Sweet! We gotta go watch Two!

00:22:48.758 --> 00:22:50.760
I planned on seeing
it again anyway.

00:22:50.804 --> 00:22:52.022
[YULIA]
Uh, cool.

00:22:52.066 --> 00:22:54.808
[HANA] So yeah. That
one scene, crazy right?

00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:56.331
[YULIA]
You mean, where he eats her?

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.812
[HANA] Ugh! The first time
I saw that it destroyed me!

00:22:58.855 --> 00:23:01.118
Like, I literally melted.

00:23:01.162 --> 00:23:02.903
[MIKO] You getting
another giant tub of popcorn?

00:23:02.946 --> 00:23:04.295
[HANA]
Um, hi?

00:23:04.339 --> 00:23:06.036
You want your bestie to
waste away in the theater?

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.560
I need calories!

00:23:07.603 --> 00:23:10.345
[YULIA] How many can you
actually burn watching a movie?

00:23:26.448 --> 00:23:28.407
[ANNOUNCER 12A] We hope
you enjoyed this program!

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.801
It was brought to you
by the following sponsors.

00:23:33.934 --> 00:23:39.592
[FOX SPIRIT 06A speaking
unknown language]

00:23:52.953 --> 00:23:59.263
[MONSTER 01A groaning]

00:24:01.135 --> 00:24:03.485
[BOY MONSTER 12A]
Can you see me?
