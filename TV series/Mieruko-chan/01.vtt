up at three in the morning

[MIKO chuckles]

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.093 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
Aw, man.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
Where'd it fall off?

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
This is the most logical place,
least I hope so.

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.100 position:50% align:center

[MIKO grunts]
Come on.

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
This sucks.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:58.778 position:50% align:center
I really should've listened to
Mom and brought an umbrella.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Lesson learned,
always prepare for the worst.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Hopefully
the next bus'll be soon.

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:14.002 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Please tell me my
phone isn't waterlogged.

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Hm?

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
[MIKO chuckles]

[MIKO] "Lost my keychain,
then got soaked.

Huh? Okay. Kinda weird.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
Mm?

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.153 position:50% align:center
Um, what?

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
[SIRI]
Sorry. I didn't quite get that.

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.240 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Huh?

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:48.119 position:50% align:center

[sighs]

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
Wow. Clearly, I need a nap.

Can you see me? Hey.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
Can you see me?

[MONSTER 01A wheezing]

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Any day now, bus.
Please and thank you.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.230 position:50% align:center
[MONSTER 01A groans]
Hey, can you see me?

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:42.442 position:50% align:center
Uh... Shouldn't leave her
hanging on "read."

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.540 position:50% align:center
[MONSTER 01A]
Can't see.

00:15:57.624 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
Doesn't see. Sees nothing.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Holy crap!
What the heck was that?

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
'Cause for the record...
I saw everything!

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Today was bad.
Straight up nightmare fuel.

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Hm?

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Kyousuke.

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Kid's getting chewed out.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
That's the second hand print
since this morning.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center
[MIKO grunts]

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:08.111 position:50% align:center

I should try and get some sleep.

[MONSTER 01B groans]

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.223 position:50% align:center
Hey, girl. You see me?

00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center
Great. Just what I need.
Something in my eye.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
Thanks, universe.

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Oh, crap. Oh, crap.
Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap. Oh, crap.
Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.155 position:50% align:center
You can do this!

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
Keep acting like it's not there.

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
Keep telling
yourself it's not real,

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
'cause it's not, obviously.

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. Everything is fine.

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
Just follow standard
horror movie protocol

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.921 position:50% align:center
and when you
look up, it'll be--

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
--[MIKO] Oh, jeebus.
--[MONSTER 01B] Hey, you. Girl.

Ah. Eyelashes are the worst.

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
Hey, little girl.
You see me? Girl?

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Why isn't it going away?

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Has to be in here.

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
The salt has been deployed.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.998 position:50% align:center
Even the scary ones
go away eventually.

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
I just have to ignore
them long enough.

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
Bargain bin Candy Man held
on for almost 20 minutes.

[MIKO sighs]

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
Prayer beads?

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
Those could maybe work.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:13.111 position:50% align:center
Eh, whatever. I'm tired.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center

Mama. Mama.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:50.065 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Okay. Salt wasn't the way to go.

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
--[MONSTER 01C] Mama.

Morning!

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 01C] I thought
the rain would never end!

[MIKO]
What was up with yesterday?

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
Was I just tired? Stressed out?

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
Meh. Who knows? Probably just--

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
[HANA]
Good morning!

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
You ready to kick
today's butt, Miko?

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
There's no rain in the forecast!

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:55.714 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
[MIKO sighs]
You scared me half to death.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
[HANA]
What are you talking about?

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:02.887 position:50% align:center
You always know it's me
when I try to be sneaky!

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
I'm overreacting.

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
[HANA]
Uh, hey, you good?

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
Perfectly good.

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Yep. Hundred percent normal.

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:21.364 position:50% align:center
Just confirm for me
we're on the third floor.

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
[HANA]
Um, of course we are.

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center
You hit your head or something?

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:29.998 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] No, I'm fine, really.
I just thought I saw--

Miko?

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:04.949 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
I totally see them.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.251 position:50% align:center
[JUNJI] Hoo, boy!
She definitely saw all that.

00:23:38.335 --> 00:23:40.920 position:50% align:center
In her head she's sayin', "I
don't need to be seein' this!"

00:23:41.004 --> 00:23:42.839 position:50% align:center
But darned if she's
not seein' it anyway.

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:45.425 position:50% align:center
Next time,
"She Totally Sees Them!"

00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:47.469 position:50% align:center
And maybe you're sayin', "I
don't need to be seein' that!"

00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:49.804 position:50% align:center
But we both know you're gonna.
