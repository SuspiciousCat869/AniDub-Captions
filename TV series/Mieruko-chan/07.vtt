[MIKO] What? When did
you eat the second box?

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
[YULIA]
No big deal.

00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:19.381 position:50% align:center
[HANA]
Mm!

00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:22.592 position:50% align:center
Man, that's good.

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:26.680 position:50% align:center
It's the best, right?
Mrs. D's doesn't miss!

[YULIA grunts]

00:22:28.223 --> 00:22:30.517 position:50% align:center
[YULIA] But I still can't
believe how many there were.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.561 position:50% align:center
Could there have been
something drawing them to us?

[TINY MAN MONSTER 07B]
Ah? Ahh...

[YULIA gasps]

00:22:39.526 --> 00:22:42.654 position:50% align:center
[sighs] That totally
hit the spot!

00:22:44.322 --> 00:22:45.699 position:50% align:center
Uh! Huh?

[YULIA stammers]
Is that...?

00:22:58.044 --> 00:23:02.007 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hana? How much do
you know about, um...?

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.841 position:50% align:center
Oh, Yulia!

00:23:02.924 --> 00:23:03.967 position:50% align:center
[YULIA gasps]

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.260 position:50% align:center
Want this one?

00:23:05.343 --> 00:23:07.429 position:50% align:center
[YULIA squeaks]

00:23:07.512 --> 00:23:11.266 position:50% align:center
[YULIA] Uhh, uh...
Is that a Bloody Old-Fashioned?

00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:14.269 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] I bet she'd love it--
seems like her style.

00:23:14.352 --> 00:23:15.437 position:50% align:center
[YULIA whimpers]

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.313 position:50% align:center
[YULIA]
As in "one more word

00:23:17.397 --> 00:23:20.859 position:50% align:center
and I'm gonna beat you bloody,
the old-fashioned way"?

00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:23.111 position:50% align:center
Sure. Thanks, Miko.

00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:29.034 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Uhh...

00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:33.455 position:50% align:center
Nice! I could eat
two more, at least!

[JUNJI]
Tunnels are like that.

00:23:37.125 --> 00:23:39.544 position:50% align:center
Dark and damp,
no matter where you go,

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:41.338 position:50% align:center
and that's probably
why so many creatures

00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:43.506 position:50% align:center
from the other side
always hang out in there.
