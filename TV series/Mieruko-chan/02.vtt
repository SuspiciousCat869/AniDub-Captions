Good morning.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:26.067 position:50% align:center

[GIRL MONSTER 01A]
Good morning.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Everything's fine.
Nothing to see here.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
Nothing whatsoever.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
Um, hey. Not, like, to
judge you or whatever,

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:46.796 position:50% align:center
but what's with the staring?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
Hello?

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center
Do you see me?

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.432 position:50% align:center
Aw, no.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Whew. Okay, then.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.610 position:50% align:center
[HANA]
Hey, awkward question.

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:11.404 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.782 position:50% align:center
Is this your way
of asking me out?

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.117 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Please.

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.953 position:50% align:center
[MIKO sighs]
I can't keep this up.

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
They're everywhere.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.926 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] You see
<i>Danger Scare</i> the other night?

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
[YAMAZAKI]
Do what?

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] The show with all
the real life scary stories.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.891 position:50% align:center
Yokota's in it,
so I had to watch.

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:04.851 position:50% align:center
So terrifying.

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.770 position:50% align:center
[YAMAZAKI]
Oh, yeah, I saw it.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50% align:center
[FUJITA] Makes me wanna
sleep with the light on.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.191 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Same. Total nightmare fuel.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
[YAMAZAKI]
Ugh! And that fridge scene!

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.277 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Oh, no doubt.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.279 position:50% align:center
But the one with the
severed head in the locker?

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
I died!

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50% align:center
[FUJITA, YAMAZAKI yelp]

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
[YAMAZAKI] I do not need that
image in my brain right now!

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Sorry, sorry.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
[FUJITA] I'm gonna have
nightmares for a week.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:28.249 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Hey. What's wrong?

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
A severed head in...

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
A severed head
in a freakin' locker!

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
That's, like,
12 levels beyond gross!

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.218 position:50% align:center
Can they even show that on TV?!

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Sounds like it, yeah.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
[HANA whimpers]
Well, I'm not a fan!

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.184 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Hm. So horror's not your thing.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
I turned on my TV the other day

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.647 position:50% align:center
and it was in the
middle of this scary scene.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
I got freaked out and spit up
my borscht everywhere.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
You were eating borscht?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:56.903 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
How do they get away
with airing stuff like that?

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Note to self:

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.244 position:50% align:center
never tell Hana about
otherworldly fan club.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
She'd choke on a bratwurst.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.205 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh...

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
Can you open my locker please?

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Why me?

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
'Cause what if there's
a severed head in there?

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
There isn't.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
You don't know! Come on. Please?

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
I need to change clothes!

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Remind me
which class is up next?

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center

[BOTH grunt]

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:40.113 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Don't be silly.
TV shows aren't real.

Yeah. There, see?

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center

that thing in movies

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
when a character opens
the door and nothing's there,

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
so you're all relieved, but then
they turn around and kuh-chow!

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center

I'm good, thanks.

Maybe I should, like, call
an ambulance or something.

[MIKO grunts]
What's up?

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
Is that your hungry dance?

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
Um, no. I mean,
that isn't the problem.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I noticed a
little breeze down south,

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
like maybe I accidentally
forgot my underwear

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center

Hey, now!

That's verbal abuse,
and I don't have to take it!

they're in the locker room.

poppin' with dead people.

But it's not like they
can do anything to me.

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center

provided I don't react.

back there by myself.

of the day commando

won't be that big a deal.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
Are you sure 'bout that?

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center

I am actually kinda hungry.

Oh. They've got like this half-
off deal going on at Mrs. D's.

Mm-hm.

[HANA] Why didn't I
think of that before?

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
Am I some kind of dummy-dumb?

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.463 position:50% align:center
Idea!

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
We'll hit them up after
school and stuff our faces.

[MIKO gasps]

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
Let's see. What all
should we get, do ya think?

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
Hmm. Maybe some of
those soft, squishy ones.

[MIKO]
How does she not notice?

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
It's wrapped around
her like a python!

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yeah!

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center

they have is super yummy, too.

She's completely oblivious.

Yep, sounds about right.
