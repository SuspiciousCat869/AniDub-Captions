1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,708
Whoa!
Who the hell is that?!

2
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,625
The hot math teacher,
Ririko Kagome!

3
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,083
You've never seen her?!

4
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,708
She was in the last
episode, dude!

5
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:53,333
Hold it pal, that kind of
commentary is my job, whee!

6
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,833
I wanna learn math under her!

7
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,583
Yeah, so do I!

8
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:02,083
Oh, no...! Pi r squared!

9
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:12,250
♪ opening song ♪

10
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,500
Right...

11
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,041
...now let's take our formula
for the area of a circle,

12
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,000
and use it to derive
the surface area

13
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,000
for this cone on
the board, 'okay?

14
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,666
'Kay!

15
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,750
I don't get it!

16
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,541
I don't understand how to
do this kind of math at all!

17
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,041
Why don't we get
an answer from...

18
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,333
Mr. Aono?

19
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,500
Yes, ma'am?!

20
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,583
Tell us how to do it...

21
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,916
Solve this problem.

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,833
Um...
I don't know how.

23
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,875
What an idiot!

24
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,333
Tsukune...

25
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,166
Bad boy, Tsukune;
you're supposed

26
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,750
to listen to your teacher...

27
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:27,791
Zone out again...
and I'll give you a spanking.

28
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,041
We're getting close
to finals, you know...

29
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,916
...and you need
to focus on those.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,041
Oh, no!

31
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,000
Crap, I forgot all about finals!

32
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,416
And at the rate I'm
going in this class,

33
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,291
I'm gonna get an
F and flunk out!

34
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,750
Tsukune...

35
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,000
What?! You want me to
tutor you in math?!

36
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,541
Exactly!

37
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,458
It's taken all my energy just
to get used to this school.

38
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,833
And on top of that, with
all these crazy mix-ups

39
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,125
I keep getting dragged into,

40
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,791
I've been way too
distracted to study.

41
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,916
Please help me, Moka!
I'm begging you here!

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,458
Okay, Tsukune...

43
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,291
I just hope that I can
be enough help.

44
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,916
Really?!

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,958
Yeah...

46
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,000
...and since we're
gonna do this...

47
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,041
Um...

48
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,416
Will you come
to my room tonight?

49
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,458
'Cause we need
a place to study...

50
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,708
And if we do it in my room,
I can help you with your

51
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,333
math and anything else you
might need help grasping.

52
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,666
What the?!
"Anything else?!"

53
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,125
If I go into Moka's room
after hearing her say that,

54
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,250
I won't get any studying done!

55
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,083
I'll have a nervous
breakdown instead!

56
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,583
Tsukune, I'll do everything
I can to help you!

57
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,375
You will...? Thank you...

58
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,375
You can always count
on me, Tsukune...

59
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,041
Because...

60
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,041
Oh, Moka...

61
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,541
I always count on you to
let me suck your blood...!

62
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,166
Not again!

63
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,375
Now wait just a minute!

64
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,458
I've got something to say...!
Sine, cosine, tangent...

65
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,416
I learned all that
in Math class...!

66
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,875
So I'm the one you
should be studying with!

67
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,458
No, don't listen to her!

68
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,291
If you need a math study buddy,
I know everything, Tsukune...!

69
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,375
Things like the cylindrical
shell method...!

70
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,875
And stuff such as
PV equals N R T...!

71
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,291
The final's comin' up soon
and you need help in math,

72
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,458
so come on, what do you say?!

73
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,166
Speaking of help...

74
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,291
I'm in the same boat 'cause
I've missed a lot of school,

75
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,500
so is it okay if I study
with you guys, too?

76
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,333
Um, yeah, sure!

77
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,708
Uh well I really
appreciate the offers but

78
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,916
Moka and I have already
decided to study together.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,791
Although all of us studying
together is a great idea!

80
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,375
Huh?!

81
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,375
Well, shall we get out of here
and start hitting the books?

82
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,625
Yeah...! You betcha!

83
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,250
And this is a derivative,
a measure of how

84
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,583
a function changes as
its input changes.

85
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,875
It allows us to compute a line
or plane tangent to that

86
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,916
function at that point.
In contrast, an integral,

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,916
geometrically
speaking, looks...

88
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,625
Well?
Do you get it now?

89
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,375
Yeah...! Thanks
to you, I do...!

90
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,708
You're a first-class tutor.

91
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,666
Please, I am not!

92
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,875
Well, it's great that
you understand it now,

93
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,458
but I still don't...!

94
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,083
Would you please be my special
private math tutor, Tsukune?!

95
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,291
So...

96
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,083
...all of these derivatives
and integrals...

97
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,916
...how exactly are
they any different

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,250
from addition and subtraction?

99
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,625
Incredible...

100
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,708
Huh?

101
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,375
Wow, you must take
the most thorough

102
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,333
notes in the world, Moka.

103
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,333
They're easy to follow,
your handwriting's great;

104
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,041
everything's organized
by topic, too.

105
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,166
Stop, you're embarrassing me...

106
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,583
If you'd like, I'd be
more than happy to copy

107
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,083
a set by hand for you.

108
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,291
Thanks...

109
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,250
...that's so incredibly
kind of you, Moka...

110
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,875
But making a photocopy
would be easier...

111
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,750
...wait, I forgot this
school probably doesn't

112
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,750
have anything useful like that.

113
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:48,041
Oh I don't mind; you're my
friend...! Anything for you!

114
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,500
Moka...

115
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,541
Oh, Tsukune...

116
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,333
Oh, Moka...

117
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,833
Tsukune...

118
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,125
Oh, Moka...

119
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,375
Tsukune...

120
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,625
Oh, brother, not all this
garbage again, whee!

121
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,416
Attention, the main
school building

122
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,125
will be closing in
ten minutes...

123
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,791
Ya know it's been a
really long time since

124
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,416
I've studied for a
test this hard...

125
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,750
I'm beat.

126
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,250
It was worth it if you
learned something, though.

127
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,166
Oh, Mr. Aono...

128
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,583
Miss Ririko...

129
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,416
Why are you here
so late; a club?

130
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,958
Uh...

131
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,750
...no, Moka and I were just
finishing up a study session.

132
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,958
A study session?

133
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,291
Well that's not good
I'm sorry to hear it...

134
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,708
Huh?!

135
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,208
Well, it is good you're putting
in some effort, but when

136
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,750
students get together to study,

137
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,666
they spend more time goofing off
than learning the material.

138
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,291
But we didn't!

139
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,458
We really studied!

140
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,208
Tsukune was actually beginning
to understand some--

141
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,750
I doubt it...

142
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,125
You're just a student, Miss
Akashiya; you're not a teacher.

143
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,666
Though you may be
good at schoolwork...

144
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,416
Teaching students
is a task that is

145
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,250
best left to
professional educators.

146
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,708
Huh?

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,541
Tsukune!

148
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,416
And that's why...

149
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,958
...tomorrow after class...

150
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,500
...you'll meet me
in the tutoring room.

151
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,416
You'll never forget the
lessons I'll teach you...

152
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,125
I'm looking forward to them...

153
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:14,875
I...

154
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:15,458
...can't...

155
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,083
...wait.

156
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,000
I bet you can't...!

157
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,041
It's the next day, and
it's tutoring time, whee!

158
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,083
Well...

159
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,166
I guess I'd better
get going, guys.

160
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,625
To get tutored by Miss Ririko,
huh...? I did talk to some

161
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,875
older students who took
Math from her before...

162
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,791
They said she's so
crazy about teaching

163
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,416
that she goes
overboard with it.

164
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,416
Yeah...? Anything else?

165
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,333
Well there are two
more problems...

166
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,083
...they just make me so angry...

167
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,333
...the boys won't stop
staring at her tits!

168
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,000
Um, really?

169
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,083
Aw, are you jealous that
your own huge honkers

170
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,375
aren't as massive as hers...?

171
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,500
You're acting like
a child, Kurumu.

172
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,416
Well actually, Yukari...

173
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,375
The only child
that's here is you...

174
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:01,625
And the proof is your
flat-as-a-pancake chest...!

175
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,916
I'd rather have mine than
your big, fat balloons!

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,875
Mine are big, but what
makes them really

177
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,958
nice is how squeezable
they are, unlike yours.

178
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,875
You're so superficial.

179
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,375
Guys prefer mine 'cause they
offer quality over quantity

180
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,500
and they're all wrapped up
in a cute, tiny package.

181
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,166
Yeah, they're still
flat as a board.

182
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,791
You shut up, Miss Milk Jugs!

183
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,250
What did you say, Little
Miss Flatty Flat Chest?!

184
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,666
Big ones start
sagging, you know!

185
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,375
Come on... why don't you
two just knock it off already?!

186
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,833
Hey, Tsukune...

187
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,000
I know you're not
really looking forward

188
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,583
to these tutoring sessions...

189
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,083
...but it's still better than
having to take make-up classes.

190
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,583
Moka's right.

191
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,916
If you get a 50 or less on your
final exam, then you flunk

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,375
the subject and you have to
take intensive make-up classes

193
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,333
before they'll let you
out for summer break.

194
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,791
Wait!

195
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,125
Tsukune?

196
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,416
Oh, man... I'd almost
forgotten about that...

197
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,750
Huh?

198
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,875
Yeah...! It's summer break
once finals are done!

199
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,083
I'm gonna do it, Moka...!

200
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,125
I'm gonna work hard
and pass Math...!

201
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,666
Then we can do
something together

202
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,583
for summer break, okay?!

203
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,791
Alright...

204
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,291
No... Go to the beach
with me instead and

205
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,083
we can play with
some beach balls!

206
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,791
Nuh-uh...! He's gonna
have a deliciously

207
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,000
sweet summer romance with
me, right, Tsukune?

208
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,583
No, have a snowcone with me...
As we watch the sunrise...

209
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,125
Hello?
Is anyone there?

210
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:43,666
I'm Tsukune Aono from Class
1-3 and was told to report here.

211
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,000
I've been expecting you...
Tsukune.

212
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,458
Holy crap!

213
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,625
Um, I mean, what are you
doing dressed up in

214
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,583
an outfit like
that, Ms. Ririko?!

215
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,500
I just thought it
might help you get up...

216
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,208
...the motivation
to study harder.

217
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,208
Are you nuts...?! The only
thing it'll motivate me

218
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,083
to do is to have
crazy fantasies!

219
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,625
This is just too weird...!

220
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,791
You're my teacher and
I'm your student!

221
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,083
"Weird?"...

222
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't find
this weird at all...

223
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,166
But your right ,
I am your teacher...

224
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,458
And when it comes to an
education, the teacher is

225
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,541
the master who must
be respected...

226
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,916
...while the student
is the submissive

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,458
who must obediantly obey.

228
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,416
Um, hold on, Ms. Ririko,
you're kind of scaring me...

229
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,000
I can smell that,

230
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,583
and you give off an
incredibly luscious scent...

231
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,166
It's almost like
that of a human's.

232
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,291
No...
I mean...

233
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,166
It must just be
your imagination!

234
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,291
Even so, you're the first
student I've taught

235
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,583
who's given off such a
delightful scent...

236
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,833
It makes teaching you all
the more yummy for me.

237
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,166
Let's get started, shall we?

238
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,291
I should warn you that my

239
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,791
private sessions are
very intensive.

240
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,708
Tsukune...

241
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,458
I hope that tutoring
session is helping you...

242
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:09,208
You're just a student, Miss
Akashiya; you're not a teacher.

243
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,875
Still...

244
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,250
As far as what I can
personally do to help you out...

245
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,541
I guess this is about it.

246
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,458
What a tough game today!

247
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,708
Are you guys ready
for final exams yet?

248
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,208
All of them except math...

249
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,500
I'm not, either,
so please be my tutor!

250
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,166
I'm gona have to refuse...

251
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,750
You can't take
me hostage...! No!

252
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,583
Tutor me in math
and I'll let you go!

253
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,708
I've just gotta pass that final!

254
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,625
Oh...! Tsukune.

255
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,000
If we say that alpha
equals the cosine of

256
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,416
one hundred twenty degrees
plus twenty degrees,

257
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,041
then alpha squared plus alpha

258
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,833
plus one takes on the following
value: alpha minus one...

259
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,208
Wait, I've heard of that!

260
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,583
He's reciting mathematic
formulas from memory!

261
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,541
Huh?!

262
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,666
They're advanced ones that

263
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,458
we haven't even
covered in class yet!

264
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,625
Awesome!

265
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,750
So that tutoring's
really paying off, huh?

266
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,458
Teach me...! You've got
to so that I can pass!

267
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,083
For an arithmetic sequence with
a first term of six and a

268
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,750
Oh, good morning, Tsukune!

269
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,166
Um... Listen...

270
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,125
I know what Miss Ririko said
about me not being a teacher...

271
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,125
...but still...

272
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,500
I really wanted to
do something to

273
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,541
help you understand
math better...

274
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,458
Okay...? So I
copied all my notes

275
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,916
and compiled them in
this notebook for you...

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,791
I know they're not much,
but maybe they'd...

277
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,333
...be helpful.

278
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,708
Tsukune?

279
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,791
What are you doing?!

280
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,833
Ohh... Well...

281
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,708
I see you're trying to
undermine me, aren't you...?

282
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,041
And trying to seduce
Mr. Aono with this drivel...

283
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,000
How dare you?!

284
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,750
I was just helping
him study--!

285
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,083
You've got some nerve...!
It's obvious to me that

286
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,333
Mr. Aono hasn't been able to

287
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,708
focus on his studies
because of you.

288
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,500
Come on Tsukune
let's go study...

289
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,958
Tsukune...

290
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,958
Is that true...? Tsukune can't
study because of me...?

291
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,250
Is it really all my fault?

292
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:41,375
♪ montage song ♪

Given f of x equals x cubed,
plus x squared minus

00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,625
My private sessions
with you have

295
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,916
really made a difference,
haven't they?

296
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,875
Little by little, you've
started to see how

297
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,958
wonderful it is to study.

298
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,625
Where's Moka?

299
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,583
Still having impure
thoughts, huh...?!

300
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:52,375
Get on your hands and
knees right now!

301
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,083
I love your scent!

302
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,791
it gets me so worked up
and puts me in the mood

303
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,625
for a night of
red-hot educating!

304
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,500
Go on, study for me, baby!

305
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,833
Do it harder;
do it like you mean it!

306
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:04,833
Oh, that's it!

307
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,166
Don't stop, Tsukune!

308
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,833
You do it so good that I'm
gonna give you another

309
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,750
one of my special sessions...

310
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,375
...so...

311
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,291
...here...

312
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,041
...we...

313
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,500
...go.

314
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,666
I'll pump you full
of learning again...

315
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,458
Yes...

316
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,041
I...

317
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,500
...will!

Tsukune!

319
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,166
Yes, that's it, right there...!

320
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,666
It feels so good,

321
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,416
Keep it up for me, please!

322
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,750
You want some more, don't you?!

323
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:43,000
It's okay; go on, suck in
as much as you want!

324
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,000
This is how I make it so you
don't think about anything

325
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:50,666
except for what you've
learned studying with me.

326
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,166
Estimate the...

327
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,458
...probability distribution
based on a parametric model!

328
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,250
Oh, yeah...! Keep talking
mathly to me, baby!

329
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,875
Let him go!

330
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,958
Miss Ririko, what are you
doing to poor Tsukune?!

331
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,375
Miss Akashiya...
your such a little pest...

332
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:10,458
If you must know, we're in the
middle of a learning session...

333
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,958
And you won't get
in my way again!

334
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,416
Known from the annals of Greek
mythology, this terrifying

335
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,375
monster has the torso of a human
and the tail of a snake...!

336
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,708
And it's Ms. Ririko's
monster form...

337
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,375
A lamia, whee!

338
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,958
My whole reason for being in
life is educating students...!

339
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,208
And if you think I'm gonna
let you come between me

340
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,583
and one of them, you've
got another thing coming!

341
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,166
Now... Tsukune...

342
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,000
...let's get back to
our studying, shall we?

343
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,583
You know you can trust me.

344
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,833
Everything that we do
here is for your own good.

345
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:44,333
No, don't...!
You have to resist her!

346
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,083
See how strong the
bond between teacher

347
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,916
and student is,
Miss Akashiya...

348
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,541
Ooh, isn't it wonderful the
things that education can do?

349
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,875
What's going on here?

350
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,750
Mizore!

351
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,125
What are you doing here?!

352
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,458
Since it looks like you've
gotten all hot and bothered...

353
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,708
I thought I should come
here and cool you off.

354
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,333
Go on, get Tsukune out of here.

355
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,833
Truant slacker!

356
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,625
I'm going to teach you a lesson
that you'll never forget!

357
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,083
Take this!

358
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,916
Mizore!

359
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,958
How dare you attack me,
you bad influence of a bitch!

360
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,333
I'm a teacher, so I
deserve to be treated

361
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,875
with the utmost respect...!

362
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,333
But what would an undermining
tramp know about that...?!

363
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,708
Nothing, that's what...!

364
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,958
Therefore I'm gonna have to
teach you some respect!

365
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,041
This handwriting...
It's one of Moka's notes...

366
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,000
I'd be more than happy to
copy a set by hand for you.

367
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:16,208
I don't mind; you're my
friend...! Anything for you!

368
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:20,041
Now suck on some
educational guidance!

369
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,791
You saved me...

370
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,583
It's the least I could do...

371
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,375
...after all you've done.

372
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,208
Oh, Tsukune...

373
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,541
Tsukune, no, what
are you doing...?!

374
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,208
You made a copy of your
notes for me, didn't you?

375
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,541
And you did it by hand...

376
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,625
That was so kind of you, and
look, I've got 'em right here.

377
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,125
Tsukune...

378
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,500
Then both of you get
educational guidance!

379
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,541
When the rosary seal over
her breast is removed...

380
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,000
...Moka's innocent
self vanishes...

381
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,375
...and her inner
vampire awakens!

382
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,083
You call what you do
"educational guidance?"

383
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,166
Don't make me laugh.

384
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,541
What...?! How dare you?!
I'm a teacher!

385
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,166
No, you're just a
poor excuse for one.

386
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,791
What did you say?!

387
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:16,041
All you are is a
small-minded narcissist...

388
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,541
You always hammer the importance
of learning into others,

389
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,875
so allow me to return the favor
and teach you your place.

390
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,708
Well, did you learn anything?

391
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:32,458
Yes, ma'am, and I appreciate the
guidance that you've given me.

392
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,291
This episode's big
showdown only took

393
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,333
a mere thirty-one
seconds, whee!

394
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:41,375
What can I say...? I just don't
seem to know how to hold back.

395
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,083
On the day of the math final,

396
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,458
Tsukune's stressing
out again, whee!

397
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,291
Crap!
I'm toast!

398
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,500
All the knowledge Ms. Ririko

399
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,083
pumped in me is
completely gone now!

400
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,208
Good luck, Tsukune...

401
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,166
Well, how do you think
you did on the final?

402
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,250
I dunno.
I did try my best, but still...

403
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,125
Oh, well, regardless
of what grade I get,

404
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,541
I've got no regrets.

405
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,791
Why?

406
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:09,875
Well, 'cause the best
thing about it is that

407
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,375
I got to study with you, Moka,

408
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,041
even if it was only
for a few days...

409
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,500
You never once gave up on me...

410
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,500
You kept tutoring me
right to the end,

411
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,083
and those notes you gave
me were a huge help, too.

412
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,916
I'm really lucky to have
someone like you in my life.

413
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,500
I don't know what I'd do without
you; you're the absolute best.

414
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,708
I really mean that,
Moka, and thanks again.

415
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,458
Hey, is something wrong?

416
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:34,916
Tsukune!

417
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,166
But I still have
another final today!

418
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,041
And finally, our
summer break began...

419
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,458
Well, at least
for most of us...

420
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:53,333
Ahh, crap, now I have to
take make-up classes!

421
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,875
And after all that
tutoring I gave you...

422
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:40,041
Yay, it's finally summer break!

423
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,833
Look at my bikini, Tsukune!

424
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,458
Look at mine, too!

425
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,416
Check mine out as well...

426
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,041
Next time...

427
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:51,125
"Summer Break and a Vampire"...
and another...
