1
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:26,083
Just the start of another school
day at Yokai Academy, whee!

2
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,125
Dear Mom, Dad,
and cousin Kyoko:

3
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,166
I hope all of you
are doing well.

4
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,000
Pretty soon, it'll be
a whole month since

5
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,291
I enrolled here at
Yokai Academy.

6
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,416
Time's really flown.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,958
I haven't had a
chance to mail them,

8
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,625
but I've written you
a bunch of letters.

9
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,666
There are so many piled up,
in fact, that I've lost count...

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,625
This school,
well, it's a little...

11
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,916
...no, make that a lot weird.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,958
At first I was pretty
unsure about this place,

13
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,583
but I've managed to
make some friends

14
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:54,125
and actually, to be honest,
I'm having a pretty good time.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,458
Even so...

16
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:03,625
Should I keep attending and
hide the fact that I'm human?

17
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:04,958
'Kay.

18
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,125
Well, now let's move onto
the next page, shall we?

19
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,833
Please read it out
loud for us, Mr. Aono.

20
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,000
Mr. Aono?

21
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,208
Tsukune!

22
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,583
What the hell am
I supposed to do?!

23
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:31,458
It's simple, just read
this page out loud for us.

24
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:37,291
♪ opening song ♪

25
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:13,125
What was wrong with you
in class today, Tsukune?

26
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:16,250
Uh, nothing, I just
wasn't totally awake yet...

27
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,375
Oh, okay, that's good
to know, but look,

28
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,541
if you're ever in trouble,

29
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,958
you can come talk
to me about anything.

30
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,750
Because...

31
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,916
...you and I...

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,375
Moka...?

33
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,791
Tsukune...

34
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,916
Moka...

35
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,750
Tsukune...

36
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,000
...you smell good.

37
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,541
Thanks...
Wait!

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,500
Just a little taste 'Kay?

39
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,041
No!

40
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,541
Look...!

41
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,708
You've been sucking Tsukune's
blood way too much, Moka!

42
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,041
And that's gotta
be why he was so

43
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,583
spaced out in class
this morning!

44
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,625
I didn't suck too much
from him yesterday...

45
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,958
Yeah right! You must have
if he's acting this way!

46
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,000
No that's not the reason.

47
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,833
Besides, Moka's a vampire
that drinks blood so I...

48
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,708
...don't mind meeting her needs.

49
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,500
Oh, Tsukune!

50
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,666
Oh, yeah, well
I have needs, too.

51
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,416
No!
Stop it!

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,875
You're a succubus,
Kurumu, so if you kiss him,

53
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,458
Tsukune will become your slave!

54
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,875
It's kinda weird we're friends.

55
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,458
Moka being a vampire,
and Kurumu being a succubus...

56
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,000
And me, being a human...

57
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,416
You're him, aren't you?
Tsukune Aono, right?

58
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,791
Yeah, and you're--

59
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,916
Fed up with you!

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,125
Why?

61
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,416
It's because you're
our number-one enemy!

62
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,083
Hold on, wait a second!
Your enemy?!

63
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,333
You don't know why?
Then allow us to explain...

64
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,375
...formation...

65
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,875
...set!

66
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,333
Start!

67
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,583
Gimme an "M," gimme
an "O," gimme a "K,

68
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,916
gimme an "A;" and
what does that spell?

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,333
Moka!

70
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,000
I've got a cheer for the girl
of my dreams, too, pal!

71
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,208
Kuru, kuru, she's my love, touch
her and you'll get a shove!

72
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:05,833
Yeah!

73
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:09,750
Y--U--K--A--R--I!

74
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,916
Yukari, yay!

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,333
I don't understand.

76
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,833
Why are you guys cheering
for the girls that way?

77
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,541
Wait, don't tell me--

78
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,291
Oh we will!

79
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,208
I'm the president of the
Moka Akashiya fan club.

80
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,750
Kozo Kasahara!

81
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,833
And me.

82
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,291
I'm the president
of the unofficial

83
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,250
Kurumu Kurono fan club,
Bosaburo Tye'ra!

84
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,125
And me.

85
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,916
I'm president of Yukari Sendo's

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,708
private fan club,
Kubisaku Nagai!

87
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,291
The three of us form...

88
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,000
The Cute Girl
Fan Club Coalition!

89
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,833
I'm drunk as a skunk!
Whee!

90
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,791
That's nice,
but I've got things to do!

91
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,000
Hold it!

92
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,416
The only thing you're
going to do is

93
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,750
face our fearsome
fan club wrath!

94
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,708
--Fearsome wrath...!
--Fearsome wrath...!

95
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,125
--Ow! Ow--ow--ow--ow!
--Fearsome wrath...!

96
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,166
What a wuss!

97
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,416
I know he's in human
form right now,

98
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,916
but this guy's a real crybaby!

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,458
Yeah, like he was an actual
human being or something!

100
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,083
A pathetic do--nothing weakling
like you isn't good enough

101
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,625
to be friends with
Moka, you pantywaist!

102
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,000
What the?

103
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,750
This guy's using
some kinda weird trick!

104
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,125
No, it's not a trick,
it's magic!

105
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,500
Hey, cut it out!

106
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,250
You buncha creeps stop
picking on Tsukune right now

107
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,291
or I'll kick your butt!

108
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,833
Oh, yes!
It's...

109
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,000
...my love!

110
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,125
Tsukune!

111
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,750
Are you alright?!

112
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,000
Look!
It's my sweet Kurumu!

113
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,416
And my Moka!

114
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,666
Hey!

115
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,208
What the hell are you
jerks doing to Tsukune?!

116
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,458
I'll tell you!

117
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,666
All three of 'em ganged
up on poor Tsukune there

118
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,541
and they were beating
the stuffing out of him!

119
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,083
Why?
That's mean!

120
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,250
I won't tolerate anyone
picking on Tsukune!

121
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,875
Magic Wand...

122
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,541
Clean up!

123
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,541
Wait... no I'm okay now...

124
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,416
...that's enough.

125
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,291
Oh, no, Tsukune!

126
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,958
You poor thing!

127
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,875
Guys!
This is our chance!

128
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,208
Right... but this isn't over!

129
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,375
Are you okay?

130
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,583
I'm so sorry I hit you!

131
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,458
Don't blame yourself;
it was their fault!

132
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,708
If it's me you're worried about,
don't be, because I'm fine.

133
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,625
Oh, man.

134
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,666
How did taking the trash
out become such a mess?

135
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,208
If only I'd been a little
stronger to begin with.

136
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,500
Then the girls wouldn't have
to have gotten involved.

137
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,541
A pathetic do--nothing weakling
like you isn't good enough

138
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,416
to be friends with
Moka, you pantywaist!

139
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,541
Maybe that guy's right...

140
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,791
Uh um, hello?

141
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,458
I doubt anyone can hear me,
but is anyone listening?

142
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,125
If there is, well, what do
you think I should do?

143
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,625
I'm a human and a weakling
and a pantywaist, too.

144
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,041
I rely on girls to protect me.

145
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,375
Is it really in everyone's best

146
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,125
interest that I stay
at this school?

147
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,000
The only thing standing between
us and the loves of our lives

148
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,541
is you, Tsukune Aono, so
come tomorrow we're going

149
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,916
to plant you right
into the ground!

150
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,041
I wish this was the real
Yukari, not just a picture.

151
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,250
If it was...

152
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,083
I'd be kissing that
gorgeous face of hers!

153
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,708
And I would do the same if
this was the real Kurumu!

154
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,083
Damn!

155
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,000
If it wasn't for that parasite
Aono, we wouldn't be

156
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,166
making out with photos of
our goddesses, but with the

157
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,000
real things; and this is why
we have to take him out!

158
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:57,208
If we do that--no, when we do
that--you'll belong to me

159
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,208
and nobody else, Moka!

160
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,666
You'll be mine!

161
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,541
--Yukari, you'll be mine, too!
--And you mine, Kurumu!

162
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,833
Yeah, right, guys, whee!

163
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,708
Hey, have any of you
noticed those three guys

164
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,583
from the other day
hanging around a lot?

165
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,875
Uh! Now that you
mention it, I have!

166
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,041
Wow, this AV equipment
is so heavy...

167
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,375
Hey, creep!
What the heck are you doing?!

168
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,750
Uhh...

169
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,166
Just taking pictures of
our ever--changing school!

170
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,125
See, I'm in the photography club
so this is part of my duties!

171
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,291
These photos are for
the yearbook and

172
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,125
not for my personal use at all!

173
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,250
Me, too!

174
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,833
Let's see.

175
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,583
I need vanilla extract, baking
powder, and a bottle of liqueur.

176
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,125
Great!

177
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,125
Ya--hoo--hoo!

178
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,583
I really hope Tsukune's
gonna like this!

179
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,041
Huh?

180
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,916
Wh--What the...?

181
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,000
Again?!

182
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,791
He's here, too?!

183
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,000
He's still staring!

184
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,375
Getting stared at is way worse!

185
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,416
I mean I'd rather get my
picture taken than have

186
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,166
some pervert gawking
at me like that!

187
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,416
Yeah...

188
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,666
...me, too...

189
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,208
Well, either way, those
guys give me the creeps!

190
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,750
We can kick their asses if
they try anything with us

191
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,916
but Tsukune is the
real problem.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,833
So what do we do?!

193
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,833
Maybe we should talk to
a teacher about all of this...

194
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,208
There's no need.

195
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,875
Instead, the three of us'll
be Tsukune's bodyguards.

196
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,333
You girls?

197
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,958
We'll not only protect you, but
take them out at the same time;

198
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,416
it'll be like killing two
turds with one bone!

199
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,583
Ya--hoo--hoo!

200
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,750
I think what you meant was

201
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,208
killing two birds
with one stone...

202
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,833
Thanks, but I'll be fine.

203
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,041
No, you won't!

204
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,250
If they attack you,
you're gonna get the

205
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,875
crap beaten out of you again!

206
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,750
Uh--huh.

207
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,166
You're just not strong enough.

208
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,666
It's because you're a hu--

209
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,125
I'm sorry!

210
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,333
What I meant to say is that it's
because you're not that strong

211
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,166
in your human form,
but you probably are

212
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,750
when you change into
your monster form!

213
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,208
I mean, I don't really know,
but I'm sure you are!

214
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,208
Right, yeah and I've gotta go.

215
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,125
So... see ya.

216
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,583
Wait up, Tsukune!

217
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,833
Tsukune, please!

218
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,083
I almost spilled the
beans about you

220
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,708
being human and for
that, I apologize.

221
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,041
No, it's not that.

222
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,541
It's that I'm really weak.

223
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,333
I should be the one
protecting all of you girls,

224
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,166
but you're the ones
protecting me.

225
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,333
Tsukune...

226
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,208
Maybe I should just--

227
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,375
Sorry!

228
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,375
No wait!
Tsukune...!

229
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,750
Sweeping up, sweeping up,
it's so fun when

230
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:42,166
sweeping up, sweeping up,
sweeping up, it's so--

231
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,041
Where's he going?

232
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,375
Tsukune...
are you still mad at me?

233
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,166
Moka, come quick!

234
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,125
Yukari, what is it?

235
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,000
Just now, as I was sweeping up,
Tsukune was walking away.

236
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,625
It looked like he was
leaving campus and

237
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,125
he had this really serious
look on his face!

238
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,958
But that's not the only thing he
was also carrying a bag, too!

239
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,000
Wait, he had a bag?

240
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,500
That new student.

241
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,791
I wonder how
he's been holding up?

242
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,375
If Tsukune had a bag that means

243
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,958
that he's planning
on leaving school!

244
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,958
4:44 pm...

245
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,208
It's almost time.

246
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,416
Well Moka?

247
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,875
Where do you get off
calling her "Moka?!"

248
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,791
She's one of our sacred
goddesses so how dare

249
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,791
you say her name so
lightly, you punk?!

250
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,041
We don't know where you're
planning on going, buddy...

251
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,208
...but you're off of
school grounds now!

252
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,916
That means the three
of us can do this!

253
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,666
Yeah!
Umbrella!

254
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,166
Ooh...
Ooh Ooh...

255
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,625
Neckie--neck!

256
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,708
Blob!

257
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,166
So... those...

258
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,250
...are your monster forms?!

259
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,333
What was that?

260
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,833
Wait no!
Even you're dissing us now?

261
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,041
Ah damn it!

262
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,500
Um, no, it's just that...

263
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,208
It's just that we're pretty
dorky--looking monsters, right?

264
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,458
We know!

265
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,958
And it sucks!

266
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,291
The chicks at this school
always go for the cool, flashy,

267
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,916
badass monsters that go here!

268
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,208
Looking like this,
we don't stand a chance!

269
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,583
And you!

270
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,458
You don't even try but
somehow you still get girls!

271
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:35,125
That's why we hate you
and why you're gonna die!

272
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,125
Struggle all you want,
but you won't squeeze

273
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,708
your way out of this situation!

274
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,083
Not after you've rained
on our parade by trying

275
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,458
to steal the women we love!

276
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,500
You'll never get
to sit down and

277
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,083
chew the fat with our
darlings ever again!

278
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,958
We won't stand by and let you
take them away from us!

279
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,791
Take your hands--
I mean neck--off of him!

280
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,458
It's them!

281
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,333
Girls!

282
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,958
Um, question?

283
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,583
Why do I always have to
carry you two everywhere?

284
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,583
I'm sorry, this is my fault.

285
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,666
I can't remember what magic
spells to use to make us fly.

286
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,166
Guys, this stuff can wait!

287
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,083
Tsukune can't!

288
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,750
Yeah you're right!

289
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,041
Magic Wand...

290
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,708
Love seat!

291
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,166
Tsukune!

292
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,041
See?

293
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,375
And once again I got
saved by you three girls.

294
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,208
Moron!
Why don't you get it, Tsukune?!

295
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,250
All of us...

296
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,916
...we're friends, aren't we?

297
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,791
We're supposed
to help each other.

298
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,791
That's what friends do.

299
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,000
You know that...

300
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,041
...so accept it.

301
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:58,583
Yeah, but again, why am
I the one always getting saved?

302
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,625
That's not true at all!

303
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,291
Nope! Just take
me for example;

304
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,583
you saved me through
your kind words.

305
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,958
It's the same with me, too.

306
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,291
You saved me
from that other Moka.

307
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,000
Yukari...

308
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,583
Kurumu...

309
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,583
See? Look, that
makes us even.

310
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,041
Yeah...

311
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,708
That guy!
He's so mean!

312
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,500
He's stealing all our women...

313
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,333
...and he's doing it
right in front of us, too!

314
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,500
He's hogging all the love!

315
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,291
Tsukune Aono, you're
in violation

316
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,583
of the Romance Antitrust Act!

317
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,458
I'm going to blob you
into a blob even

318
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,666
if it's the last
thing blobbing I do!

319
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,958
Heads up, guys!

320
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,958
Yukari, my love...

321
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm gonna wrap myself
so tight around that

322
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,500
smokin' hot little
body of yours!

323
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,250
You're a ripe fruit ready to
blossom and I want a taste!

324
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:49,375
Gross, no, get away!

325
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,541
Kurumu, I have an enormous
abundance of love for you,

326
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,958
so what say you and I gaze
lovingly at each other, huh?

327
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:56,958
Ughh...

328
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,458
...what am I
supposed to look at?

329
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,791
Your face? 'Cause you don't
have one you big, fat freak!

330
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,625
Oh, Moka!

331
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,875
No matter how hard the
rains fall, no matter how

332
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,583
fierce the rays of
the sun become--

333
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,083
which, by the way,
are the archenemies

334
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,958
of your lovely alabaster skin--

335
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,666
I will be your
umbrella of love!

336
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,208
Um, thanks, but I've
got an umbrella!

337
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,875
Ew, no, stop!

338
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,750
That's not good!
I've gotta end this now!

339
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,833
Hey!
You three!

340
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,083
Hm?

341
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,291
You call yourselves a
fan club, but all you

342
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,041
really are is a bunch
of creepy stalkers!

343
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,708
You're pathetic!

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,583
Wait, you're calling
us pathetic?

345
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,875
And not just that, but
also ugly, no-good,

346
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,375
disgusting pervert
monster trash, too?

347
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,250
I...

348
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,833
...didn't say that last part...

349
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,750
You think that, though, right?

350
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,583
You won't have to look
at us much longer

351
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,500
'cause we're gonna...

352
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,750
Destroy you!

353
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,166
Now it's time for the
Fan Club Coalition's...

354
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,291
...super secret...

355
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,208
...Angry Amalgam Attack!

356
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,208
Amalgam!

357
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,250
Amalgam!
Amalgam!

358
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,375
What the--?!
Holy crap!

359
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,375
Not so pathetic now, are we?

360
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:06,666
In fact, the only pathetic thing
around here is you, tiny!

361
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,958
Tsukune, no!

362
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,458
Oh, my gosh!

363
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,083
Please!
Please be alive!

364
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,750
I'm alright...

365
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,666
But I...

366
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,750
...have to protect all
of you from that thing!

367
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,041
No you can't!

368
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,208
Maybe not...

369
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,166
...but I have to try--

370
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,250
What the--?

371
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,041
Guys...

372
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,291
...what just happened?!

373
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,916
Where'd that weird,
bright light come from?!

374
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,708
When the rosary seal
over her breast is removed...

375
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:45,041
...Moka's innocent self vanishes
and her inner vampire awakens!

376
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,125
You three!
You woke me?

377
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,208
Look! Those cold,
yet beautiful eyes!

378
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,500
And that silky, silvery hair!

379
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,666
Those fangs!
It's her!

380
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,208
The one we've been waiting
to worship all this time!

381
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,958
Our true idol, the goddess

382
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,416
who descended from
the heavens above!

383
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,791
We adore you!

384
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,333
And we hope that
you'll return our love!

385
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,333
Never.

386
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,416
Not even if you were the last

387
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,291
amalgamated monster
trio on Earth.

388
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,750
Such cold--hearted words,
my goddess!

389
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,916
Yes!

390
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,583
Thank you, ma'am,
may we have another?!

391
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,500
Kurumu.

392
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,583
Yukari.

393
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,333
We love how you
torture us this way...

394
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,375
Yes, ma'am?

395
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,208
The two of you
have to help me out.

396
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,000
Roger that!

397
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,458
Sure thing!

398
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,541
Take this, dorks!

399
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,500
Magic Wand!
Let's rock!

400
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,541
Whoopsie! 

401
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,083
Oh, no! Watch it
or we're gonna fall!

402
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,250
Now get lost, losers!

403
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,708
Yes, ma'am, of course.
Right away.

404
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,875
But...
she was the one...

405
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,500
...the one we've
been waiting for...

406
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,375
...the true idol...

407
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:02,500
From this day forward we're
now the Vampire Fan Club, 'kay?

408
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,500
Aye.

409
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,958
Wow, what a long showdown!

410
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,791
This episode's
climactic fight came

411
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,000
in at a whopping
eighty seconds, whee!

412
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:14,291
Well, I guess I wound up getting
saved by you again, huh, Moka?

413
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,750
Tsukune.

414
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,875
Uh?!
Yes, ma'am?!

415
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,250
You leaving doesn't work for me.

416
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,708
Because if you weren't around
anymore that would mean

417
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,041
no more food for yours
truly now, wouldn't it?

418
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,791
And also it would make her cry.

419
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,916
The other Moka, that is;
it'd break her heart.

420
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,583
Uh what?

421
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,083
Moka not sinking her
fangs into you would be

422
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,708
a good thing, but
still, you can't go.

423
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,791
She's right, Tsukune,
please don't leave!

424
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,708
Leave?

425
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,583
I'm not leaving... what
made you think I was?

426
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,083
Eh...?!

427
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,250
But you had a packed bag!

428
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,833
Yeah, and it's to
carry all the letters

429
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,375
I'm mailing to the other side.

430
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,958
I came here to ask
the bus driver

431
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,125
if he wouldn't mind
mailing them for me.

432
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,833
Wait a minute, so then
that whole business

433
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,708
about you wanting
to leave school...

434
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,125
...it wasn't real,
but a matter of

435
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,958
Moka jumping to
conclusions instead?

436
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:17,625
...so if you don't mind,
I'd really appreciate it, sir.

437
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,125
Sure, no problem,
kid, I don't mind.

438
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,250
That all you need?

439
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,583
Yep!

440
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,541
Keeping in touch with
your folks is commendable.

441
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,208
Take care.

442
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,083
I swear.
You're so confusing.

443
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,458
I don't want you to
go anywhere Tsukune.

444
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,833
Please stay.

445
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,458
I will and I'm gonna find
a way to make myself

446
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,166
strong enough to protect
you and everyone else.

447
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,833
I promise, Moka?

448
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,541
But until that day, it's
time to say goodbye

449
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,500
to this useless phone.

450
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:08,083
That you chose this path on your
own makes it more worthwhile.

451
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,458
But, kid, you've picked a
long and twisted one, too.

452
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,333
Hang in there.

453
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,875
There were some construction
delays that took a little

454
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:20,166
longer than anticipated, but at
long last, class, I'm happy to

455
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,458
announce that there's now a
payphone in the campus store,

456
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,125
one that will connect to
you to the human world!

457
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,583
What?!

458
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,416
Additionally, the bus that used
to come here only once a month?

459
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,666
Well, due to
overwhelming demand,

460
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,958
it will now be coming
here once a day!

461
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,958
Isn't that great, Tsukune?

462
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,916
Moka...

463
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,291
Tsukune...

464
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,333
Ah!

465
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,291
You smell good!

466
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,166
--Huh?!
--Tsukune!

467
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,666
But we're in
the middle of class!

468
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,208
Owwwwww!

469
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:04,250
♪ closing song ♪

470
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,833
It's a pool, and swimsuits,
and swimming!

471
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,166
Hey, wait, your
skimpy swimsuit's

472
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,541
pretty risqué, Kurumu!

473
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,958
Ahh yours is cute, it looks
like a kindergartener's!

474
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,500
Shut it, titty pie!

475
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:52,458
Next time: "School Swimsuits
and a Vampire," and another...
