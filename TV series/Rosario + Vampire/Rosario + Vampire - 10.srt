Yes, we witches
are experts at healing!

But when people say that,
don't they mean adult witches?

Hey, Rubi. You up?

00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,250
Thirsty?

00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,791
We've got you some
tea if you want.

23
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,708
Oh, and don't worry,
everyone else already has one.

That's not what we're doing!
We just wanna hear your story.

27
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,583
You do?

28
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,041
Yeah.

29
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,250
Tell us about that hill.

30
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,708
Okay.

31
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,041
That hill's a place
where witches

32
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,083
have lived for a
very long time.

33
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,125
And we lived there in peace
together, never bothering

34
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,791
or hurting anybody, just
minding our own business.

35
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,541
Well at least until they
came barging in on us.

36
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,166
They destroyed
everything in sight.

37
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,333
They ripped the
place to shreds,

38
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,333
treating our home
like it was nothing!

39
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,041
Explain this to me!

40
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,291
The human scum!
Why should we trust them?

41
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,750
What possible good
could that do us now?!

42
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,875
We will never trust
the humans ever again!

43
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,375
Rubi.

44
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,750
Please, Yukari.

45
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,625
You of all people should
understand what I'm saying.

46
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,833
We witches called
this place home.

47
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,333
In order to keep
that place safe,

48
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,458
our only option is to destroy
every last one of them!

49
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,333
But I...
I don't feel that way...

50
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,500
But...

51
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,083
We've no choice.

52
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,250
We have to kill them!

53
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,458
Come on.

54
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,583
Do you really think
it's okay to kill off

55
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,375
everyone just to
protect a hill?

56
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,125
The only ones I kill are humans!

57
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,166
Whether you're
human or a monster.

58
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,291
There's no difference in
the value of someone's life.

59
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,875
What's so wrong
about killing humans?

60
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,375
So what if I kill them off?!

61
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,416
Who cares about stupid humans?

62
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,166
Isn't there something else?

63
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,291
Some other way to go about it?

64
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,791
A peaceful solution?

65
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:57,916
No way.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,250
There's no other
alternative for us.

67
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,708
Her Ladyship will
bring retribution.

68
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,875
Wait!
"Her Ladyship?"

69
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,833
Come on, you can't be serious.

70
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,750
That's pretty arrogant of you...

71
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,625
Saying that it's fine
to hurt other people

72
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,750
as long as it serves
your own purpose!

73
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,250
No kidding.
That's very selfish.

74
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,208
That makes you
no different than them.

75
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,375
I think that it's--

76
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,208
So?

77
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,583
That's the "witch way," huh?

78
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,291
You witches are a scary lot.

79
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,833
Hey, no, we're not!

80
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,208
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

81
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,625
sure you little "kiddie
witches" aren't... whatever!

82
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,875
There you go again!

83
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,125
All of you shut up!

84
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,750
If they take that
hill away from me,

85
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,583
I'll be left without
anywhere else to go!

86
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,791
Wait a second!

87
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,291
If that's what this
whole thing is about,

88
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,791
you should come with us.

89
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,125
He's right.

90
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,750

uprooted from the place

That's right!
We will!

Come on, knock it off, you guys!

Do you want me to
cool their heads off?

No, no!

No, don't, you'll end up
freezing everyone solid!

I know I'm up against
monsters, but still!

00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,791
Hey, look out!

167
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,958
I'll take blood over peace.

168
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,375
And this episode's showdown
was over in a mere--whee?

169
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:04,875
Rubi!

170
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,666
Rubi, please stop all of this!

171
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,041
No, I can't!

172
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,708
I'm gonna defend Witch Hill
because it's my wish.

173
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,250
Also, because
Her Ladyship demands it!

174
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,750
Huh?

175
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,958
Oh, no, they're even
bigger than before!

176
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,500
Tsukune!

177
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,375
I'm begging you.

178
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,041
Please, just let Tsukune go.

179
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,708
Don't do this!

180
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,291
Her Ladyship wants it,
so it must be done!

181
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,041
I must do everything
Her Ladyship desires.

182
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,666
My only purpose here is
to execute her every request!

183
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,750
Who is "Her Ladyship?"
Tell me...

184
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,541
A house?

185
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,916
Damn you little bitch!

186
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,250
Moka, hold on a sec!
Wait!

187
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,166
Listen up, guys.
Take care of Tsukune!

188
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,000
Tsukune!

189
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,375
The house.
Right!

190
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:29,875
Tsukune!

191
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,083
Hold on!
Where are you going?

192
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,583
To find "Her Ladyship!"

193
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,250
Yeah, but you...

194
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,083
Tsukune!

195
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,791
Wait! Kurumu!

196
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,333
"Her Ladyship."
She must be there.

197
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,750
Tsukune, it's really dangerous!

198
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,291
Dumb twit!
You're the one in danger!

199
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,541
Kids should stay outta the way!

200
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,416
Just give it a rest!

201
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,333
Tsukune, now's your chance,
hurry and go!

202
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,333
Alright.
Thanks, guys.

203
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,000
I'll be back!

204
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,000
Hey.
You did a good job.

205
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,333
For a snot-nosed brat.

206
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,250
You're not too shabby yourself.

207
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,083
I'm amazed you can
move so well,

208
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,458
having to lug those two
heavy honkers around.

209
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,458
Good point.

210
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,625
You know for just
a second there

211
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,583
I was actually envious
of your booblets.

212
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:26,083
We'll finish this later,
my big-titted rival.

213
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,166
You certainly don't
have to tell me

214
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,625
cause right now we've got
bigger fish to fry, don't we?

215
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,958
Mizore!
Thank you!

216
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,500
What the...?

217
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,041
I see.

218
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,750
These roots are
pulling the strings

219
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,791
that are driving
those monsters.

220
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,708
And worse...
Rubi, too!

221
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,875
What's this?

222
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,625
It's you.
You're the one...

223
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,375
"Her Ladyship," aren't you?

224
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,333
If so, I have a request.

225
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,583
Rubi.

226
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,666
Let her make her own choices.
Set her free.

227
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,583
How much longer
do we hafta keep

228
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,458
pounding away at
these damn things?

229
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,333
Until we kill all of them.

230
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,791
Compared to us
and what we can do...

231
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,458
These goons are like nothing.

232
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,708
Oh, come on,
you call this nothing?

233
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,666
We're just staying positive.

234
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,041
There's still so
many of them left...

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,500
Hey, everyone, look up there!

236
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,000
Moka.

237
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,833
Moka!

238
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,375
Rubi, don't!
Look, we've had enough!

239
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,375
We'll leave this hill right now
and never come back again!

240
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,791
You'll never hear
from us, we promise!

241
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,916
So please!

242
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,458
Just forgive us and
let us go our way!

243
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,583
You might as
well save your breath.

244
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,916
Just take a look at her,

245
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,083
there's no getting through
to her in that state.

246
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,541
DIE!!!!

247
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,333
This is payback
for defiling Witch Hill!

248
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,375
Now lap it up!

249
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,000
Stop it!

250
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,291
Rubi, stop this.
Let them go!

251
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,291
Tsukune!

252
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,291
Tsukune, no!

253
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,541
Get out of here!

254
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,791
Rubi! Doing this
won't help anyone.

255
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,250
Nobody will care anymore!

256
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,416
Shut up!

257
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,375
Everything I'm doing
is for Her Ladyship!

258
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,166
I do this to...

259
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,666
Just who are you kidding?!

260
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,541
I went to see "Her Ladyship"
and there's no one's there!

261
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,125
What are you talking about?!

262
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,750
Her Ladyship's inside the house!

263
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,041
No... look!

264
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,000
I went inside the
house just now to see her...

265
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,625
...and she's dead she's
been dead this whole time!

266
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,708
That can't be... No.

267
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,916
Rubi.

268
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,000
Rubi.

269
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,625
Your Ladyship?

270
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:36,541
I'm afraid that I...
I may have acted very foolishly.

271
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't you see?

272
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,041
All the things that
I set out to do

273
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,916
were no different
than the humans.

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,583
Your Ladyship!

275
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,083
Please forgive me.

276
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,333
I'm about to leave you
all by yourself again...

277
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,458
 But remember, Rubi...

278
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:59,291
I will always be by your side,
no matter what happens.

279
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,750
Forever.

280
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,166
Rubi, please.

281
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,791
Deep down, you must
know it's true.

282
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:08,875
Don't you see?

283
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,625
Her Ladyship's
no longer with us...

284
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,458
But you don't want to admit it.

285
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,791
You don't want
to accept it, do you?

286
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,791
And all those feelings
inside you created

287
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,500
a false image of Her Ladyship,

288
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:22,166
and it's been haunting you
ever since, hasn't it Rubi?!

289
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,416
No.

290
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,291
No!

291
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,000
No!!

292
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,166
No!!!!

293
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:37,875
No. Rubi...

294
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,458
...please don't do it!

295
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,708
Wait, what are
you talking about?

296
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,791
If she uses
that forbidden spell...

297
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,208
There'll be no hope for her,

298
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,791
and she'll never return to
her normal self again!

299
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,250
No way.

300
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,083
Rubi, no!

301
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,791
What the hell?!

302
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,666
Die, all of you!

303
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,791
Everyone!

304
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,875
Time for you to die!

305
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,583
Do you know you just went
off the deep end, Rubi?

306
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,041
What are you gonna do?

307
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,833
Don't you understand,
it's over for you now?

308
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,791
No one will be able
to help you anymore.

309
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,583
You don't want to do this!
Trust me!

310
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,250
Tsukune!

311
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,791
My wand!

312
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,250
Go get my magic wand
and throw it to me!

313
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,541
Oh, right!
Here you go!

314
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,916
I got it, thanks!

315
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,041
You ready, Kurumu?

316
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,625
Yeah go for it!

317
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,541
Kurumu, look!

318
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,125
Foolish girl!

319
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,583
Just 'cause you're giant now,
don't think you've defeated me!

320
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:05,458
There's much more
to this magic than size!

321
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,916
Don't you see?

322
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,291
In my current state, I can
absorb the powers of other

323
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,958
creatures and use them
as if they were my own!

324
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,333
That means...

325
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:19,125
Since you're a vampire,
I have vampire powers, too!

326
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,625
Please, just let her go!

327
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,208
Don't worry, guys, we're fine.

328
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,500
Yukari's here, so just leave
this problem up to me!

329
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,708
It's time to fly, cards.
Time to fly!

330
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,000
Mizore, you're up!

331
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,750
Now's your chance, Moka!
Grab her wand!

332
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,125
Without our wands, witches
are completely useless;

333
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,125
we can't even perform magic.

334
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,500
It's probably too late for her
to go back to her normal self.

335
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,750
But do what you can, Moka.
Please.

336
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,458
She needs help.

337
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,958
Please, save Rubi
by making her stop this!

338
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,291
I'll do my best.

339
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,125
But I have to
be honest with you,

340
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,583
this idiot is better off dead!

341
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,458
Stupid bitch!

342
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,666
All of you...

343
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,000
I want all of you to die!

344
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,291
I'll take blood over peace!

345
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,791
Rubi, what's your
favorite thing in the world?

346
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,958
My favorite thing?
Well, let me think.

347
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,291
Ooh, ice cream!

348
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,375
That's not all.

349
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,541
There's more?

350
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, yeah!
I like it here on Witch Hill.

351
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,125
And I like Your Ladyship!

352
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:44,000
Hey, guess what?
I love you!

353
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,833
In the end, we just couldn't
do anything else, could we?

354
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,333
If only I would've been
a little bit stronger.

355
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,291
Tsukune, what happened
wasn't your fault.

356
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,250
Meow-ha!
Meow-ha!

357
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,500
Meow-ha!

358
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,291
I'm sorry I kept you
waiting so long guys.

359
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:27,625
But look here, look at all the
yummy fish I managed to get!

360
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,166
It's time to go back already?

361
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,833
Sorry I'm late, everyone!

362
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,541
I know that voice.

363
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,208
Gin, it's you!

364
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,583
Whoa, you guys, what's up with
the "deer in headlights" look?

365
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,916
Your club prez just
miraculously freed himself

366
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,750
from summer school hell,
so try acting excited, will you?

367
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,291
What the hell's with you guys?

368
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,833
It's Rubi!

369
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,125
What, you guys know
her or somethin'?

370
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,208
Yeah.

371
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,208
Hmm...

372
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,583
...so there's a
story behind her.

373
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,708
Well, I found her
floating in the ocean...

374
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,291
Just floating along
like something was

375
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,625
keeping her safe from harm.

376
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:10,125
Oh, wow...
Keeping her safe, huh?

377
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:19,875
What's this?

378
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,958
Aww, man.
This is the wrong road...

379
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,000
Well let's head back.

380
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,458
Can you believe this?

381
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,250
It's the most beautiful
hill I've ever seen.

382
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,250
This sunflower field is special.

383
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,166
It's a place that
witches on this hill

384
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,541
have treasured for
many generations.

385
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,958
Well, then I'll take
real good care of it.

386
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,625
I swear, I'll watch over it.

387
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,291
Forever and ever!

388
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,291
Good.

389
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,625
Shall we go back
to the house now?

390
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:53,625
Back to our little home?

391
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,083
Yeah!

392
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:04,291
♪ closing song ♪

393
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,375
Oh, summer
break's over, you guys!

394
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,916
The moving scene from
this episode's all ruined now!

395
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,666
I could freeze you and then
it'll be summer break forever.

396
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,625
Please don't do that!

397
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,583
Next time: "New Term and
a Vampire" and another...
