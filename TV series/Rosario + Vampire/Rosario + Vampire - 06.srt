1
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,666
Who's there?!

2
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,166
Is there somebody out there?

3
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,541
Tsukune...?

4
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,833
Can I...? Please let
me suck your blood!

5
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,375
Wha?
Hold on...!

6
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,833
Moka, wait...

7
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,500
Owwwwww!

8
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,625
That hit the spot...!

9
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,875
I swear, Tsukune, your
blood is the sweetest...!

10
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,458
I think I might
be hooked on it!

11
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:06,458
If she keeps sucking my blood
like this, I'll die from anemia!

12
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,583
Maybe the Newspaper Club

13
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,041
we joined'll make
that a headline...

14
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:09,916
Tsukune!

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,083
Huh?

16
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,958
Today is our first day!

17
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,666
And I'm so happy
that I get to be in

18
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,875
the Newspaper Club with you.

19
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,166
Help...! Need air!

20
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,833
That isn't fair,
Kurumu; stop it!

21
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,958
I joined the club, too, so give
me a chance with Tsukune!

22
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,458
Sorry , no!

23
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:34,083
Seriously, I'm about
to suffocate here...

24
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,958
Tsukune's my destined
partner for life,

25
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,083
and our relationship's
gonna deepen by being

26
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,041
in the club together, and soon,
he'll be in love with me,

27
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:45,791
and you'll just be
an afterthought, Moka!

28
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,500
Oh, no...!
Tsukune's dead!

29
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,666
Tsukune!

30
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,500
Please don't die on us!

31
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,958
He was so young!

32
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,625
Did you guys hear that there's
a peeping tom on campus?

33
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,916
Yeah, isn't it creepy?

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,375
I can't even change
clothes without

35
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,291
looking over my shoulder.

36
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,500
Me, either!

37
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,458
My club's actually had
to post a lookout

38
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,708
whenever we change clothes.

39
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,250
--Good idea!
--Geez!

40
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,708
Let's get started!

41
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,333
I'd like to welcome
all of you to

42
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,541
the Yokai Academy
Newspaper Club!

43
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,958
Uh...?!
Wait...

44
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,875
...are we...

45
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,000
...the only members?

46
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,000
No, of course not, silly!

47
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,375
Sorry, I'm late.

48
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,541
You see...? There he is now.

49
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,291
I apologize for
bein'a little tardy,

50
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,041
but there were some
things I had to pick up.

51
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a pleasure to meet you.

52
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,416
I'm Ginei Morioka,
the club president.

53
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,291
But please, just call me Gin.

54
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,750
Oh...

55
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,041
I guess good things do
come in small packages...

56
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,291
Mmmm, those flowers
make you ladies

57
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,458
look even lovelier
than you already are.

58
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,583
Anyway, Ginei here
is the only other

59
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,666
member of the Newspaper Club,

60
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,416
and he's also a sophomore...

61
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,750
Since he's the oldest,
he'll be the club president...

62
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,541
So if you have any
questions about it,

63
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,666
please direct them to him.

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,833
Right, I'm here for all of you.

65
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,041
Oh! The faculty meeting
is about to start...!

66
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,708
Well, I'll leave the
rest up to you, Gin!

67
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,750
Sure!
I got it covered!

68
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,375
Let's get down to business...

69
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,666
For starters, lemme go
ahead and explain what

70
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,416
the Newspaper Club
is all about...

71
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,458
First and foremost, the
club writes, edits,

72
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,291
and publishes the school paper.

73
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,125
When something
happens on campus,

74
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,291
we're there to report it,

75
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,583
and we'll do
anything for a story.

76
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,208
That includes throwing ourselves
in harm's way if need be...

77
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,166
So you better prepare yourselves
now, guys, 'cause this club...

78
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,125
...it's not for the
faint of heart!

79
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,791
Wow... He sure sounds
like a hard-hitting

80
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,500
journalist committed
to the truth.

81
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,875
But of course...

82
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,833
...sometimes we just
report on the normal stuff.

83
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,250
With all that said,
do any of you have

84
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,791
any story ideas
you wanna share?

85
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,708
I've got an idea...!
How about that peeping tom?

86
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,166
Peeping tom?

87
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,083
You haven't heard?

88
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,583
There's this pervert
that's been going around

89
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,375
campus lately and
peeping on girls.

90
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,333
The freak's so quick
that no one's been able

91
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,250
to get a good
description of him yet.

92
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,875
A peeper's the
worst of the worst!

93
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,750
Yeah, that's for sure,
this guy's gotta be stopped!

94
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,625
Then let's use the
newspaper to stop him!

95
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,625
Well, then the first
thing we gotta do for

96
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,000
this story is find
ourselves some informants.

97
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,500
And how do we do that?

98
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,375
Through the first
rule of reporting...

99
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,666
Hit the pavement and
start asking questions...

100
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,875
Your average citizen
is the best resource.

101
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,333
Um, Gin?

102
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,416
You're sure you want us to
put the posters up this high?

103
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,375
No, I want 'em higher than that.

104
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,750
What...?! Did you say higher?!

105
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,958
Yeah, just a little bit more.

106
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,208
Like this?

107
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,458
How 'bout this?

108
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,541
Or even higher?

109
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,833
I can help put posters up, too!

110
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,125
Well...

111
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,416
Not till you get a little
bit bigger, okay...?

112
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,000
You're just too small
for this right now.

113
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,125
Sometimes he's flippant,
and other times, serious.

114
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,625
I wonder what kinda guy Gin
really is underneath it all?

115
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,833
Is this high enough?

116
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,083
Perfect, just hold
it right there!

117
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,500
Hey, what are they doing?

118
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,958
Moka, Kurumu, you guys
doing okay up there?

119
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,500
I'm good.
Kurumu?

120
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,458
I'd be better if my
boobs weren't in the way.

121
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,000
He's totally checking
out their panties!

122
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,750
Gin, what the hell do
you think you're doing?!

123
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,000
Cut it out!

124
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,458
Huh?
Whaddaya mean?

125
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,875
You know exactly what I mean!

126
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,875
You were totally looking
up their skirts just then!

127
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,333
Oh, please!

128
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,500
Now why would a classy,
flower-bringing guy

129
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,333
like myself stoop
to such levels?

130
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,333
Hey, what's going on?

131
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,666
Oh, nothin',
it's just Tsukune here...

132
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,916
He said somethin' or the other
'bout lookin' at your panties.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,458
What?!

134
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,500
Hey, you were looking
at 'em first, Gin!

135
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,666
Tsukune!

136
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,000
No, girls, wait, just
let me explain...!

137
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,833
Look, it's true that I
did see your panties,

138
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,000
but that's only because I--

139
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,625
They're not buyin' it, whee!

140
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,833
Sorry!

141
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,875
My hand came up like
a reflex or something!

142
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,958
If you ask me,
he deserved that for peeping!

143
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,625
If you really wanted
to see my underwear,

144
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,541
you could have just
asked me, you know!

145
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,125
Wait, I didn't mean to look
at your sexy underwear!

146
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,750
Moka, wait a second, please!

147
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,250
Tsukune...
I hate perverts!

148
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,750
Thanks a lot, Tsukune...

149
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,375
...our club meetings over for
today and it's all your fault

150
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,375
Moka...!

151
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,833
That's so gross...

152
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,916
...was Tsukune really peeping?

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,791
I feel so dirty...

154
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,500
But...

155
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,958
...which ones...

156
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,541
...did I wear today?

157
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,791
What are you doing?

158
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,708
You'd better be careful.

159
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,458
For some reason, I get a
dangerous vibe off of him...

160
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,166
I have the feeling
he's hiding some kind

161
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,000
of really strong power,

162
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,958
so you be extra careful
around that Gin, okay?

163
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,291
Well...

164
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,583
Another gorgeous full
moon tonight, huh?

165
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,333
In fact...

166
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,666
It's almost as
gorgeous as you...

167
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,583
...my little Moka.

168
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,083
Hey, wait up!

169
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,833
Like I said, I didn't
really mean to do it!

170
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:44,208
I don't care...
I don't wanna see you anymore.

171
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,750
You mean ever?

172
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,958
I don't really mean that, of
course, but a little dose of the

173
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,083
silent treatment will serve him
right for peeping at my panties.

174
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:55,125
Moka, please...!
Just hear me out...! Moka!

175
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,375
Go away.

176
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,833
So are Moka and Tsukune
going out or something?

177
00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,875
Huh?

178
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,458
I don't really
know them to well...

179
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,000
But then again, I did
hear something or

180
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,375
the other from somebody
who said that

181
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,250
they saw Moka kissing
Tsukune on the neck.

182
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,083
Whoa, seriously?

183
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,875
What?!
Kissing him on the neck?!

184
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,375
Oh, Tsukune...

185
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,541
No way!

186
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,833
You gotta be
friggin' kidding me!

187
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,458
Who's out there?!

188
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,833
Wrong place, wrong time, whee!

189
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,583
You were peeping on us,
weren't you, you slimeball?!

190
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,416
Me...?! No, I swear!
I was just passing by!

191
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,125
Looks like I better hurry and
strike while the iron's hot...

192
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,000
...especially since
now I know how to

193
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,791
drive a wedge between
Tsukune and Moka.

194
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,833
I hate perverts!

195
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,625
Look, it was all just
a big coincidence...

196
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,708
I was passing by right
when they looked out.

197
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,958
They don't buy it.

198
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,333
Why won't anyone believe me?

199
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,833
Well, I, for one,
believe you, Tsukune.

200
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,291
Really?

201
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,208
Yeah I've got your back, bro.

202
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,916
Thank you Gin.

203
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,750
So what's bothering you?

204
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,750
You're worried Moka doesn't
like you anymore, huh?

205
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,833
Exactly.

206
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,333
No matter what I say,
she's completely

207
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,833
convinced I'm a total perv.

208
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,208
Hey...
You see that?

209
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,250
Climb up and take a peek.

210
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,208
What for?

211
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,875
To change things with Moka...

212
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,333
Why else?

213
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,000
Use that drum over
there and climb on up.

214
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,583
Dude, I don't have to tell
you that Moka's smokin' hot...

215
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,791
I was howlin' the
first time I saw her...

216
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,375
And I said to myself...

217
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,541
I definitely want
her to join my pack.

218
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,833
Wait, Gin, what are
you talking about?

219
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,208
--Oh, yeah...
--What the hell?!

220
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,208
The girls' locker room?!

221
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,375
You know no one likes
a peeping tom, Tsukune.

222
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,625
Poor Moka...

223
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,208
Whaddaya think she'll
do when she gets

224
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,291
an eyeful of you
doing just that?

225
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,416
I told you this was gonna
change things with Moka.

226
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,833
Oh, my God!

227
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,666
Hey, you set me up, you scumbag!

228
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,666
That's a guy's voice!

229
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,583
The window!

230
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,791
It's that peeping tom!

231
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,250
Pervert!

232
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,166
Look...! That's him!

233
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,125
You creep!.
Let's kick his ass!

234
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,125
Hey, sicko!

235
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,541
You're not getting
away with this!

236
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,250
You're the peeping tom, huh?!

237
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,166
Fess up, you sleazeball!

238
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,958
No You've got it all wrong;
I'm not the peeper, I swear!

239
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,125
Oh?!

240
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,166
Then what were you
doing at the window?!

241
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,083
That sure looked
like peeping to me!

242
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,000
Well you see

243
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,458
Tsukune?

244
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,250
Moka!

245
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,416
Is that true...?
You peeped on them?

246
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,291
This is all just a
big misunderstanding...!

247
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,083
I did look at them...

248
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:37,791
...but that's 'cause--

249
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,250
He just confessed!

250
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,250
No, not again...! Oh, crap!

251
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,583
Wait, Moka!

252
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,875
So then you are
the peeper, aren't you?!

253
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:47,666
He even admitted it!

254
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,125
You filthy pervert!

255
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,458
What?!
Tsukune?!

256
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,875
Yeah, he was seen peeping
in the girl's locker room...

257
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,083
That's the big story
on campus right now.

258
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,208
But there's no way he'd do that!

259
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,666
I agree!

260
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,833
It's absurd...!

261
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,000
Tsukune leering at a
girl other than me?!

262
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,916
Uh... well...

263
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,333
I'm sure there's a perfectly
good reason for why he did it.

264
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,583
What kind of reason?

265
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,500
Well, that's what we
in the Newspaper Club

266
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,500
are gonna find out!

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Wassup?
What'cha doing up here?

268
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,666
It's kinda late.

269
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,250
But that sure is a gorgeous
full moon tonight, isn't it?

270
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,125
Oh hey Gin...

271
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,416
I just heard...

272
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,250
...about Tsukune, I mean.

273
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,541
I gotta say, though,
the guy really

274
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,375
didn't look the type to me...

275
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,208
I guess it's true about
some people having

276
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,166
second natures hidden
inside of 'em, isn't it?

277
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,875
But Gin...

278
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,083
Can it really be true that...

279
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,416
Tsukune's the peeping tom?

280
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,541
He can't...

281
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,708
I totally get that
you wanna trust him...

282
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,083
...but come on, Moka,

283
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,041
a whole bunch of girls
caught the dude in the act.

284
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,791
But still...

285
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,583
Moka, look...

286
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,625
...you just need to
forget about Tsukune.

287
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,750
Don't worry,
I can help you do that.

288
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,500
No!

289
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,166
You leave me no choice...

290
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,583
I was really hoping I
wouldn't have to do this, but...

291
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,250
Oh, well...

292
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,916
I dunno who in the
world took them,

293
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,875
but these pictures have been
floating all over campus.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,375
Tsukune?!

295
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,875
M-Moka...

296
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,833
Yee-owch...

297
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,750
They show the peeping
tom in action...

298
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,625
I'm sorry, Moka...

299
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,458
But Tsukune is actually
what you hate the most...

300
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,833
...a dirty-minded pervert.

301
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,375
But still...
I wanna trust him...

302
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,375
I don't know why...
but I have to.

303
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,416
Moka, come on!

304
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,791
Aren't you just lying
to yourself because

305
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,291
of how you feel for him?

306
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,750
Face facts;
your pal's a pervert...

307
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,083
Take another look...

308
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,625
Tsukune's peeping.

309
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,375
And not only that, he even
moved a drum to the window so

310
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,125
he could stand on it to
get a better look...

311
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,416
Pictures don't lie, Moka!

312
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,250
How do you know about
him moving the drum?

313
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,166
Well, that's easy;
just look at the pictures.

314
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,291
I will, Gin...! Hey, Moka, take
a closer look at these.

315
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,250
Just what am I looking for?

316
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,708
These shots only show
Tsukune from the legs up,

317
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,750
so how do we actually know
that he's standing on a drum?

318
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,875
Wow, you're right.

319
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,083
'cause...
I went there...

320
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,291
...umm...

321
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,333
After all the ruckus...

322
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,750
'Cause I'm such a newshound...

323
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:13,833
That's how.

324
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:14,916
See that was actually
the first time

325
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,333
I'd ever been to
that location...

326
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,000
...but I could tell
right away that he had

327
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,833
been using that
drum to stand on!

328
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,291
Oh? And how were you able
to ascertain that it was

329
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,000
Tsukune who moved the
drum under the window?

330
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,000
Simple...! It's
because those drums,

331
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,958
are never under the
window like that.

332
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,125
But didn't you just tell
us that was first time

333
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,875
you'd been to that location...?

334
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,500
And If that's true, how
would you know that

335
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,708
those drums are never
kept under the window?

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,416
You were already familiar
with the site, weren't you...?

337
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,000
And you knew that the
drum had been used

338
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,208
as a stand to peep into
the window, too...

339
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,000
Isn't that right...?
What's more...

340
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,791
...you were there when
this was taken, too!

341
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,541
Well, come to think of it, maybe
I have passed by there before,

342
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,958
and heard somethin' about
the peeper usin'a drum...

343
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,458
...but come on, even all that
doesn't mean that I was

344
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,500
ever at the actual
scene of the crime!

345
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,041
Hah...! No, that's exactly
what it means Ginei.

346
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,250
Huh...?! Wait-whadda you mean?!

347
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,041
After the incident
at the locker room,

348
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,416
those drums were removed by
the girls because they wanted

349
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,875
to prevent any possibility
of a repeat performance.

350
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,375
In other words...

351
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,416
...the only time those drums
were actually at the site...

352
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,083
...was immediately before and
immediately after the incident!

353
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,708
It would've been
impossible for anyone

354
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,958
who wasn't there to
know about them!

355
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,833
Furthermore, Gin,
we managed to obtain

356
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,250
several reports--all
from reliable witnesses--

357
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,291
who say that just
prior to today's incident,

358
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,500
they saw you moving the drums.

359
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,458
So then that means--!

360
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,708
Right.

361
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,375
The peeper is...

362
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,333
You!

363
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,208
Dammit, I wanted to do
this the easy way...!

364
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,041
Oh, well, I guess now
I'm just gonna have

365
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,250
to take you by force
then...! Sorry bout this!

366
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,750
If it wasn't already
obvious from all

367
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,458
the hints in this episode,
Ginei's a werewolf dummy...

368
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,250
They normally look like
humans, but whenever

369
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,375
there's a full moon, these
guys really wolf out...

370
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,458
And the stronger the
light of the moon,

371
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,875
the stronger their monster
powers become, whee!

372
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,500
Moka!

373
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,083
Tsukune, no!

374
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,083
Werewolves are S-class Monsters
on the same level as vampires!

375
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,583
You can't win!

376
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,291
I'm the alpha male here.

377
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,125
Tsukune!

378
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,875
Moka's mine, you hear...?!
So back off!

379
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,541
Got it, punk...?!
'Cause if you don't...

380
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,875
...you're wolf chow!

381
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,416
When the rosary seal
over her breast is removed...

382
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,083
...Moka's innocent
self vanishes...

383
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,500
...and her inner
vampire awakens!

384
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,083
No wa...! It can't be!

385
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,291
Those red eyes, she's--...!

386
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,958
A vampire!

387
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,208
So this is what you
turn out to be, Moka?

388
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,625
Well this is the friggin best...

389
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,625
...but if a vampire's
gonna be my woman,

390
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,250
then first I'm going to have to
show you who the pack leader is.

391
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,458
Get real, you fleabitten fool!

392
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,083
Hey, what are you aiming at?
I'm over here!

393
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,541
He's so fast!

394
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,833
I never even saw the guy move!

395
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,416
Vampires are known
for their strength,

396
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,458
but we werewolves are known
for our super-speed...!

397
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,791
We're fast to begin with,
and we get even faster

398
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,708
as the light of the
moon gets brighter...

399
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:11,625
And tonight's the brightest
night of all: the full moon!

400
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,208
And there's no one who
can beat a werewolf

401
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,083
on the night of a full moon!

402
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,791
C'mon, baby, try it!

403
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,666
Hmm...
So this is a werewolf...

404
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,916
Hope you're ready for an ass
whippin', 'cause as long as

405
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,041
the full moon's out, the
only winner's gonna be me!

406
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,500
Moka! No!

407
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,291
Wh-What the hell?

408
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,875
You blocked me...?
How did you--...?

409
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,166
Wait no, don't tell me!

410
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,666
Ah Dammit!

411
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,250
The stupid moon went behind
all those the stupid clouds,

412
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,375
and if the moon's not out,

413
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,500
then my powers don't
come out, neither!

414
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,833
Then again, it's not
the end of the world.

415
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,750
Even with no moon out,
a werewolf's still

416
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,583
a force to be reckoned with!

417
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,166
As you're about
to find out first-hand!

418
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,041
Now be my she-wolf or
I'm gonna have to hurt you...

419
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,375
You hear me?!

420
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,875
You stray mutt.

421
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,541
Do you really think you have
what it takes to be with me?

422
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,958
You should know your place!

423
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:16,541
I think I do!

424
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,083
This episode's fight...

425
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,958
...took a total of one hundred
and twelve seconds, whee!

426
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,166
Special edition!

427
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,625
Hot off the presses!

428
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,208
Who'da guessed our
first story would be

429
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,958
all about proving that
I'm not a peeping tom...

430
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,583
Crazy, huh--?

431
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,750
Don't look while I'm up here!

432
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,625
Get back here, you creep!

433
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,041
Gin, you pervert!

434
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,125
Oh, Tsukune, I'm so sorry!

435
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,125
You smell so good!

436
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,208
Don't do it, Moka!

437
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,000
Miss milk cow is right!

438
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:55,166
It's just...
I can't resist...! Sorry!

439
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,791
Huh...? Yeowwww!

440
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:04,375
♪ closing song ♪

441
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,375
Moka, I'm in trouble!

442
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,625
I have this creepy feeling
someone's watching me!

443
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,875
Like a stalker?

444
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,916
Stare...
at you...

445
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,958
Wait, it's just
Kurumu and Yukari?

446
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:48,875
Next time...

447
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,541
"Snow Girl and a Vampire,"...

448
