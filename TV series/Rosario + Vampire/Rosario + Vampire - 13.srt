1
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,875
What...?! You're telling me
not to do anything at all?!

2
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,833
But, Mr. Director...!

3
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,375
I've made my decision,
Miss Nekonome.

4
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,958
But, sir, what about
poor Mr. Aono?!

5
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,416
Assuming that he is indeed
put to death as it seems

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,125
he will be at this point...

7
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:46,166
It means that it was his
fate to die at this time.

8
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,916
Sir... you can't mean that!

9
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,625
He's the enemy of all monsters!

10
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,125
Don't let him off the hook!

11
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,375
Hey, hurry up and put
that damn human to death!

12
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,875
Oh, man...

13
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,250
How'd I get myself into this...?

14
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,583
Oh, right, by being
a human that enrolled

15
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,666
in a school for monsters...

16
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,958
Should I have left a long time
ago when I had the chance?

17
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,250
I could have tried to
go to a normal school...

18
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,916
...and made some normal
friends who are human like me...

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,375
But then...

20
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,708
...if I'd done that...

21
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,458
I never would have met Moka,

22
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,916
...or any of the others
for that matter.

23
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,708
Are you so afraid to die
that you're cracking up?

24
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,458
Promise me something.

25
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,750
And what's that?

26
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,583
That after you're
done killing me...

27
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,166
...you promise not
to hurt anyone else

28
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,583
in the Newspaper Club.

29
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,916
For a wretched human,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,833
that's a remarkably noble
sentiment, my friend.

31
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,166
Very well.

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,458
Never let it be said that
I'm not without mercy.

33
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,333
So, you'll mean you'll--...?

34
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,416
Yes...

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,750
You needn't worry
about your friends

36
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,208
in the Newspaper Club
suffering at all...

37
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,291
Their deaths will be
quick and painless.

38
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,458
Please, I'm begging you!
Please don't hurt my friends!

39
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,791
You can all meet on
the other side and

40
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,625
make a newspaper
no one'll read!

41
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,791
It was here...

42
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,333
This is where you
saved my life...

43
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,791
Tsukune.

44
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,500
Now it's your turn
to do the saving.

45
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,250
Who are you?

46
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,416
Kurumu please we
have to do something...

47
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,583
Hey, um, listen...

48
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,625
I didn't get the chance to
finish saying this last time...

49
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,458
But I do have an opinion...

50
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,916
I don't think it matters if
you're monster or human,

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,625
just if you're good or bad...

52
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:28,000
and I say this from
personal experience, too.

53
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,166
I mean, when I first
came to this school...

54
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,208
...the ones who picked
on me were monsters,

55
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,875
and the first person who
stood up for me was Tsukune,

56
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,666
and, he was a human,
the very thing that

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,791
I was taught to be afraid
of since I was little.

58
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,958
Yeah, I know...
and I get it.

59
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,083
'Kay, well, in that case-...!

60
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,500
But you don't get it...

61
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,291
I'm upset for another reason.

62
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,083
We're all friends...

63
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,000
...but Tsukune...

64
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,541
...and Moka, too...

65
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,416
They didn't trust us enough
to tell us what was going on.

66
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,875
But Kurumu...

67
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,583
I mean...
Come on!

68
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,833
It's frustrating!

69
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,958
If they'd just told us the
truth, think of all the

70
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,041
ways we could be helping
them out right now!

71
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,916
Idiots...! Tsukune
and Moka are idiots!

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,166
Why don't you come and tell
the both of them that in person?

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,583
I'm so sorry...
Tsukune...

74
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,250
Giving up already?

75
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,666
No, I'd do anything
to save Tsukune...

76
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,708
It's just, in this form, I don't
have the strength to do it.

77
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,958
Tell me.

78
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,208
You don't think you're
all alone in this, do you?

79
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,416
A crow?

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,083
Stand back.

81
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,875
It's been awhile.

82
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,458
Rubi!

83
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,708
What took you guys so long?

84
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,791
We got hung up
knocking out the guard...

85
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,708
Kicking his ass took awhile.

86
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,833
Yeah, that guard sure
put up one heck of a fight!

87
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,166
Wow, all you guys came, too!

88
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,000
What are you just
standing around for?

89
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,916
Shouldn't we be
off saving Tsukune?

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,166
Kurumu...

91
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,500
I'm still really mad at you.

92
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,666
You shouldn't have kept
Tsukune's secret from us.

93
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,416
Sorry.

94
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,291
Now's not the time
for apologizing.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,333
It's a new wand?!

96
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,166
You've got one...
How?

97
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,833
It's a long story...

98
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,750
However, it's gonna hafta wait!

99
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,208
Yeah!

100
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,125
We've gotta save Tsukune...!
There'll be plenty of time

101
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,875
for Moka to beg our
forgiveness after that.

102
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,333
Whether you're
human or a monster,

103
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,333
there's no difference in the
value of someone's life...

104
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,458
You said that, didn't you?

105
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,708
Sure did...

106
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,000
It's good to see you've
learned a few things.

107
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,833
Alright then let's go!

108
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,291
Come on!

109
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:33,625
Everyone...! The time has come
to put this human to death...!

110
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,291
Before you hangs the
mortal enemy of our kind...

111
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,916
Shall we send him
to meet his end...? Well?

112
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,458
Just hold on!

113
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,166
We've got you!

114
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,208
Rubi, Kurumu!

115
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,291
We can handle this;
get Tsukune out of here!

116
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,333
Well, well...

117
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,750
Those fools from
the Newspaper Club!

118
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,458
I'm warning you...

119
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,125
All of you are
committing a serious act

120
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,958
of treason against
Yokai Academy...

121
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,416
Don't you realize that?

122
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,041
Yes I do, but Yokai Academy
doesn't matter anymore!

123
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,958
The only thing that
does is our good friend!

124
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,291
He's more important than
this school, you creep!

125
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:22,250
You're making the same mistake
as last year's Newspaper Club.

126
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,375
Back then, Ginei Morioka said
something quite similar to me.

127
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,708
He said he couldn't tolerate
what we were doing

128
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,791
so he was going to
expose us in print.

129
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,208
He said the truth mattered
more than this school.

130
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,083
Gin said that?!

131
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,541
Really?!

132
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,916
 A mistake...

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,708
That's what allowing the
Newspaper Club to continue was,

134
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,291
and a grave one on my part,

135
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,583
but I plan on correcting
that with your deaths!

136
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,666
You three, wipe them out!

137
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,875
Our glorious leader
has given us an order!

138
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,083
Now you law-breakers
are gonna die!

139
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,583
Die, I don't think so!

140
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,916
Magic wand...

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,250
Golden washtub!

142
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,833
What can I say...

143
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,708
I just don't know
how to hold back!

144
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,291
Wow, they're beating
the Committee!

145
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,458
Man I'm so excited
I can't hold it in anymore!

146
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,208
Dude...

147
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,625
...calm down.

148
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,041
Hmph...
Go ahead, run.

149
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,416
It won't do you any good
against someone of my power!

150
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,500
Oh, no!

151
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,083
Hey... you guys...
Go help Tsukune!

152
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,416
Go on hurry!

153
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,875
...you sure?!

154
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,208
Let's just say that
you owe us one!

155
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,041
Okay then!

156
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,041
You're safe now.

157
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,083
Kurumu... Rubi...
Thank you.

158
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,541
Tsukune!

159
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,625
Tsukune!

160
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,708
Oh, Moka!

161
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,125
What's the big deal about her?!

162
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,916
I'm the one who
just saved your butt!

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,208
Oh shut up, Kurumu, and you get
away from my Tsukune right now!

164
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,000
Hey, the only one who
needs to get away is you!

165
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,000
Um... Ya know, I really thought
I was a goner back there...

166
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,916
Well, now you're
a goner up here.

167
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,833
Tsukune?

168
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,291
It's a real shame the
rest of the students

169
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,250
couldn't be here to see this...

170
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,083
...but the execution
was finally carried out.

171
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,041
As for "monster-human
coexistence"...

172
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,000
I hope that ridiculous
idea dies with that fool!

173
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:42,583
...please...
You can't do this, Tsukune!

174
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,541
You can't die on me like this!

175
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,833
Tsukune, please...
Life without you...

176
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,000
...isn't a life at all...

177
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,750
Moka...

178
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,250
I'm glad...

179
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:57,208
I really am,
and about everything I...

180
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:02,041
I'm glad I came to this
school and met everyone...

181
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,125
...and I'm glad I met you.

182
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,458
Don't talk like that!

183
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,708
I just have one last thing...
...to ask...

184
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,250
Protect the Newspaper Club...

185
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,583
...keep them...

186
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:20,000
...safe from Kuyo...?
Save our friends...

187
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,833
Tsukune...?

188
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:40,125
No...

189
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,708
Well, well...

190
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,833
So the "S" Class
Supermonster is upset

191
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,250
over the death of her
little human pal, eh?

192
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,708
You bastard!

193
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,375
I'm gonna kill you!

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,416
I'm sorry it took us so long.

195
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,083
We finally took out
all of his minions.

196
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,375
What happened?

197
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,583
I'm sorry...

198
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,875
We were with him but
then Kuyo showed up...

199
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,416
Move back.

200
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,125
Tsukune's lifelight
hasn't gone out yet.

201
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,041
He's still alive,
but just barely.

202
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,625
If I hurry, he might make it.

203
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,208
Wait, what are you
gonna do to him?!

204
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,250
Give him my blood...
Inject it in him.

205
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,958
Vampires have incredible
regenerating powers so if you

206
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,916
gave him some of your
blood, that might work.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,291
Does that mean Tsukune's
gonna be alright?!

208
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,666
His chances are slim...

209
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,416
But at this point,
it's the only option we--...

210
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,083
Is that monster Kuyo?

211
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,333
So he's...

212
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,333
...a fox demon?!

213
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,708
A demon?

214
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,291
Yes, a powerful one!

215
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,375
His kind were sometimes

216
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,083
worshipped as gods
in ancient times!

217
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,000
Your powers don't
disappoint, vampire!

218
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,583
But as you'll see, they pale
in comparison to my own!

219
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,750
He's channeling his
monster energy into his tails!

220
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,875
Have a taste...

221
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,041
...of my Fire Wheel!

222
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,166
--Oh-no!
--Mizore, put up an ice wall!

223
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,875
It won't be strong enough!

224
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,416
Yeah, well, standin'
around gawkin'

225
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,875
like that won't,
do anything either!

226
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,291
I was gonna call ya morons
for doing that, but honestly...

227
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,416
...there's a bigger one here...

228
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,166
That would be me...

229
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,208
But the thought of all

230
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,291
my clubmates getting
killed again...

231
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,625
...well, that was just...

232
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,083
...too much!

233
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,583
Gin!

234
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,625
He shielded us from the blast!

235
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,208
I guess he can really act like a
leader when he wants to, huh?

236
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,041
Well, yeah, I guess so...

237
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,583
...but what's the point if
he just winds up dead?!

238
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,875
Morioka.

239
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,333
Of all the people to step in.

240
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,541
Oh, well, he saved me the
trouble of killing him later.

241
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,416
You bastard!

242
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,291
Don't worry, Moka, you can
count on us to hold him off!

243
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,875
Do your thing and save Tsukune!

244
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,583
He could kill you all!

245
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,333
Don't you think we
already know that?

246
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,166
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,125
Tell me...
who wants to die next?

248
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,416
Everyone, listen:
we can't let him

249
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,625
step one foot past this point!

250
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,458
Gotcha, so how do we do that?

251
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,500
By working together
as a unified team.

252
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,625
We will; Tsukune's life
is on the line here,

253
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,041
so we'll use everything
we've got to protect him!

254
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,791
Tsukune...

255
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,125
I give you my blood...
Take it and live.

256
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,125
Tsukune...

257
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,958
Tsukune?

258
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,750
Damn...

259
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,916
I guess it's still
not enough yet.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,916
Hey, asshole...!
Just chill out!

261
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,833
I barely even feel that!

262
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,750
Give me a break with all this

263
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,791
"Friends" sticking
together bullshit?!

264
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,541
Monsters and humans are
enemies and always will be...

265
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,166
Mizore!

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,083
Oh, no!

267
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:15,916
Yukari I need you
to stay focused here!

268
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,125
Yeah! Right!

269
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,291
You're just a
close-minded bigot!

270
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,458
Monsters and humans can
be friends if they want...!

271
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,708
And we're living
proof of that fact!

272
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,750
Not for long!

273
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,416
Ready?!

274
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,166
Let's do it.

275
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,708
Our Unified Magic!

276
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,875
And the Dark Ring
of Containment!

277
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,458
Now!

278
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,708
Hmph!

279
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,666
You think you can hurt me
with a bunch of paper cards?!

280
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,208
No, but we can trap you
in a ring of spirit birds!

281
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,750
If you think you can
break free of that,

282
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,250
you're in for a
very big surprise!

283
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,916
The only one who'll be
surprised here is you, witch!

284
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,541
So much for your trap...!
It didn't work!

285
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh, yeah?

286
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,458
Wow...! It worked after all!

287
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,708
You bastards...

288
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,333
I can't believe some
weaklings like

289
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,833
you actually managed
to hurt me.

290
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,583
I think he's changing
back into human form.

291
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,625
That spell you guys used
must've really banged him up!

292
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,750
Wait, look...

293
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,833
You're wrong...

294
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,916
He's not changing back
into human form!

295
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It seems his monster
energy's transformed

296
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,166
him into another
one altogether!

297
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,166
You should all feel
quite flattered...

298
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,083
Not many foes are
ever fortunate

299
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,083
enough to see me in
my ultimate form.

300
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,166
Now die!

301
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,833
What the hell is
happening up there?!

302
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,333
Dunno, but that felt
like an earthquake!

303
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,333
Hey, get the line movin'
up there, would ya?!

304
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,166
It's jammed at the top,
you dumbass!

305
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,416
Oh, I really hope my kids
are alright...! Mee-ouch!

306
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,875
Someone's stepping on
my tail; please get off of it!

307
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,791
He's just...
too strong...

308
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,083
So much... power...

309
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You lived...
I'm impressed.

310
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,666
I see now...

311
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,875
Your little snow woman
friend saved you, eh...?

312
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,000
She used the last of her
strength to build an

313
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,541
ice wall to protect all of you.

314
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,958
And now...
You're defenseless.

315
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,791
Wrong...
They've still got me.

316
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,750
And I'm gonna kick your ass
from here to Kingdom Come.

317
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,916
Moka Akashiya?!

318
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,791
I see that your efforts
to revive the human

319
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,708
have been a complete and
utter waste of time.

320
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,791
Killing a vampire will boost
my reputation though,

321
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,541
so come and get me!

322
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,666
Once it's known I destroyed
an "S" Class monster...

323
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,791
...my position of power
on campus will be

324
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,708
stronger than ever, and I'll
have you to thank for it!

325
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,916
Moka...

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,458
Wait a minute...

327
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,250
What happened with Tsukune?!

328
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,166
There's nothing more I
can do for him at this point!

329
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,416
So then--...?

330
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,666
Does that mean that he's dead?!

331
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,916
No, this can't be happening!
He can't be dead!

332
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,208
Oh, please...! You're
supposed to be strong;

333
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,958
is that all that you've got?

334
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,791
This is child's play!

335
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,250
I guess I gave Tsukune
too much of my blood!

336
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,958
Aha... I see...

337
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,458
You shared your blood with
your pathetic human friend

338
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,083
and look what it did to you...!

339
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,958
It made you weak!

340
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,208
Humans are
petty-minded creatures.

341
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,708
They're selfish and lazy...

342
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,166
They betray...

343
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,541
They lie, cheat, and steal.

344
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:52,125
And they hurt other living
things without a second thought!

345
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:56,000
For fraternizing with that human
scum you deserve to die as well!

346
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,041
You're going to burn until
there's nothing left...!

347
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,291
And not just you, but your
dead human pet, too!

348
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,791
Good riddance.

349
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,375
Moka's dead...
So is Tsukune...

350
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,833
That can't be true...

351
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,916
You're right, it's not!

352
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
See, up there!

353
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:39,291
Um, Moka...?
How did I...?

354
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,958
You sure took your own sweet
time waking up, didn't you?

355
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,416
Huh?

356
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,083
You sleepy-head!

357
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,500
No...! He lives...?!
But that's impossible!

358
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,750
I saw what my flame did to him;
his body was burnt to a crisp!

359
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,875
Thank goodness
they're both alive!

360
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,875
Alright...! Her vampire
blood really did the trick!

361
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,333
What an outrage...!

362
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,125
There's no way I'm letting
you two get away with this!

363
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,541
Uh...
we should run!

364
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,333
Don't worry,
I'll take care of him.

365
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,791
Give me a break!

366
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,958
I preserve order and protect
the peace at this academy!

367
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,166
Your pathetic!

368
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,750
Do you really think
you can take me

369
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,708
out with your ridiculous
excuse for power?!

370
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,541
Damn right she can, ya prick!

371
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,083
Where the hell did
you come from?!

372
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,041
Don't'cha know anything
about werewolves...?!

373
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,291
We are quite famous
for our speed!

374
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,750
You've been swallowed up
by your own vile ambition,

375
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,416
and both you and your
Security Committee

376
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,791
goons are out of control,

377
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,458
Therefore you've
lost the right to preach

378
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,875
about "preserving order"
and "protecting the peace!"

379
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,750
Shutup!

380
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,625
So, Kuyo, I think it's time...
you learned your place!

381
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,500
Alright yeah!

382
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,500
Oh man, what happened up here?!

383
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,875
What's that huge hole?!

384
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,083
--Hey, look!
--What the?!

385
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,625
--Holy crap!
--Kuyo?!

386
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,500
--I don't believe it!
--Somebody kicked his ass!

387
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,541
--Who did it?!
--Yeah!

388
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,708
Who?
Well, you see...

389
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,291
it was, uh...

390
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,541
Tsukune...

391
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,041
Moka, hey what's wrong,
are you alright?!

392
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,916
Ohh, you're okay?!

393
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,958
Uh...
Yes, ma'am, we are.

394
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,666
I'm so glad to hear it,
and you certainly

395
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,916
showed that Kuyo a thing
or two, didn't you?

396
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,541
I'm not one to condone violence,
but it appears that you giving

397
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,625
Kuyo a thrashing has cleared
your name, wouldn't you agree?

398
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, actually the one
who beat him up was--

399
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,625
Cleared my name?!

400
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,708
Of course it did...

401
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,375
A human couldn't have
beaten Kuyo up,

402
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,375
only a monster could've!

403
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,875
We're all really sorry,
Tsukune...

404
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm so embarrassed that we
suspected you of being a human.

405
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,291
Yeah, you're awesome,

406
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,375
and you gave Kuyo a
much-deserved ass-kicking!

407
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,958
I guess I can finally
say this now,

408
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,750
that damn Security Committee
made my life a living hell!

409
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,083
Yeah, and mine, too!

410
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,041
You've made things better
for all of us, Tsukune!

411
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,291
Hey, guys, whad'ya say we hoist
our new school hero in the air!

412
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,500
Yeah!

413
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,041
No, hold on a second!
Guys, wait, hang on!

414
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,416
Hip-hip-hooray...!
Hip p-hip-hoo oray...!

415
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,916
Hey, guys...

416
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,416
Think you could come help me
before you start doin' that?

417
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,041
This episode's showdown took...

418
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,083
Ah...
Who cares, whee.

419
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,833
After all the
commotion died down,

420
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,541
I finally managed to talk to
a very reluctant Kurumu...

421
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,333
She told me
everything, about how

422
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,291
I got wounded and was
close to death...

423
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,041
...and how everyone stood
together and put their

424
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,291
lives on the line just
to protect me...

425
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,458
And yes...

426
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,500
...she even told
me what Moka did...

427
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,125
...and how she saved my life.

428
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,708
Tsukune...

429
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,750
Look, Moka...
I'm sorry.

430
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:44,541
Huh?

431
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,958
About what you did for me.

432
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,750
You had to use up all of your
power to save my life.

433
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:50,750
It was worth it.

434
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:51,875
Huh?

435
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,083
And I'd do it again
if it meant that

436
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,500
you came out of everything
safe and sound.

437
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,208
Oh, Moka.

438
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,375
Hey...
Please don't cry.

439
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,500
You sleepy-head!

440
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,416
What the...?! Hey,
what's the matter with me?

441
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,666
Why's my heart beating so fast?

442
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,291
Oh, man, don't tell me...

443
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,708
I'm not falling for
the other Moka, am I?

444
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,083
Stop it...

445
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,875
When you look like that...

446
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,666
It makes me want to say...

447
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,750
Oh... Tsuku... ...ne...

448
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,541
Oh, Moka...

449
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,666
Hey Tsukune sup...!

450
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,000
I knew they'd be doing
something behind our backs!

451
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:45,791
Nasty boy.

452
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:46,875
Hi, everyone!

453
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,916
What was that we
interrupted just now?!

454
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,625
Um, it was nothing, I swear!

455
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,208
--You can finish it on me.
--No, finish on me!

456
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,208
--I was here first!
--No...! Me!

457
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,750
No, me!

458
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,791
Not them, Tsukune...!
Just kiss me!

459
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,708
All five of you?!

460
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,333
Yeah, me, too,
so pucker up, baby whee!

461
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:12,375
