1
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:23,000
Dear Mom and Dad,
I hope this finds you well.

2
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,833
I'm here at Yokai Academy.

3
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,291
It's just like any
normal human school.

4
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,125
We still have stupid exams.

5
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,416
But for some reason, they
happen earlier here,

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,166
so I wasn't exactly prepared...

7
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,541
Check it out, guys,
I came in 201st!

8
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,458
I'm 222nd, alright all dueces!

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,583
Ah man, I'm so jealous
I can't stand it!

10
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,416
W-Well, I suppose
it could've been worse.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,333
But compared to her...

12
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,083
She's so much smarter,
it's ridiculous! Whee!

13
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,708
Moka sure is something!

14
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,791
Not only is she smart
she's the hottest girl

15
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,625
I've ever seen in my life!

16
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,875
Yeah, she's got
brains and beauty, huh?

17
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,333
Tsukune!

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,875
Wow, Moka, you're so smart!

19
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,000
Ah, it was just a fluke.

20
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,250
Hey, maybe next time,
if you want we could um...

21
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,208
We could what?

22
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,666
You and I could study
together, if you'd like to.

23
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,791
Thanks Moka,
that sounds really great.

24
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,208
Oh, Moka.

25
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,833
Oh, Tsukune.

26
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,250
Oh, Moka.

27
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, Tsukune.

28
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,041
Moka.

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,708
♪ opening song ♪

30
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,458
Wow.

31
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,416
She's amazing.

32
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,958
Congratulations
are in order, Yukari.

33
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,666
It's the guys from my class!

34
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,625
As expected, you're
the undisputed

35
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,875
number one student this year.

36
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,500
I guess somebody knew what
they were doing when

37
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,166
they let you skip all
those grades, huh?

38
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,541
But you hear this.

39
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,416
Don't press your luck or
you're gonna pay the price!

40
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,458
Press my luck?
Huh?

41
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,708
Yeah, that's right!

42
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,000
For example, that stupid
witch costume of yours!

43
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,666
Hmmm...
It's against school rules.

44
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,041
You'd better take it off.

45
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,666
Yeah, but this is my--

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,250
As your class president,
the fact that you're even here

47
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,958
is enough to give me a headache,
so spare me the sob story.

48
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,375
It serves you right,
you stupid jerks!

49
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,916
Why, you little brat!

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Don't you know who I am?

51
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,458
I'll teach you,
you prepubescent piss-ant!

52
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,958
Hey, stop it!

53
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,875
Who the hell are you?

54
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,583
Back off!

55
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,416
You shouldn't go
around hitting girls.

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,875
Moka?

57
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,041
Huh?

58
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,208
What the--?

59
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,500
They're from class 2.

60
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,833
What the hell's going
on over there?

61
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,708
Whaddaya say we leave it
at this for the time being?

62
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,791
C'mon guys, let's go!

63
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,458
Disgusting witch!

64
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,583
I swear, just being in the same
class as one of your filthy

65
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,333
kind is enough to make me wanna
puke all over the place!

66
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,083
Thank you so much, Moka!

67
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,958
You really saved
my neck back there!

68
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,333
I should introduce myself.

69
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,333
I'm Yukari Sendo.

70
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,333
Yeah, I've heard of you.

71
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,708
You're in the same
grade as we are,

72
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,333
but you're four years
younger, right?

73
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,500
Four years younger, huh?

74
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,083
So wait, did you skip a few
grades or something?

75
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,583
Whoa!

76
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,958
I guess that means you're
like super smart, aren't you?

77
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,625
And your outfit rocks!

78
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,666
Well...

79
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,541
...that's very nice
of you to say,

80
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,166
but I'm not the impressive one.

81
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,083
You're by far the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen, Moka.

82
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,791
And you're kind hearted,
and smart, and cool...

83
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,416
--Huh?
--Huh?

84
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,375
You see...

85
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,333
I, uh...

86
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,166
You should know...

87
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,833
I love you more
than life itself, Moka!

88
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,625
Every time I pass
you in the hall,

89
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,333
I fall more and more
in love with you.

90
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,750
And since you saved
me from those jerks,

91
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,416
I've decided that
you're the one!

92
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,583
Huh?!
What are you saying?

93
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,166
What do you mean the one?!

94
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,500
Well, duh!

95
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,666
I want you to be my girlfriend!

96
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,791
Your what?!

97
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,500
Uh... I think...

98
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,208
Well, I...

99
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,666
I can be a girl and a friend ...

100
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,208
Yippee!

101
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,875
Oh, I'm so excited about this!

102
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,708
Yeah, no kidding; I can tell!

103
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,541
Uh, listen...

104
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,958
 Yukari, could you--?

105
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,500
Has anyone ever told
you that your boobs

106
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,083
are even bigger than they look?

107
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,416
Look at her grabbin' and
squeezin' Moka's fun bags!

108
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,208
It's just not fair!

109
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,458
I'm flat as a pancake
myself, so getting to

110
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,708
squeeze ones like yours
is a dream come true!

111
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,166
Uh, Yukari,
could you please let go?

112
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,625
I'm starting to
feel a little weak.

113
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,125
Noooo!
Stop it!

114
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,416
What are you doing,
you're both girls!

115
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,291
I knew you'd show
up at some point.

116
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,375
Tsukune Aono.
Your grades are simply average.

117
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,791
Your athletic ability
is well below par.

118
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,666
You have no
useful skills at all.

119
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,250
I couldn't imagine a
more half-baked guy.

120
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,333
[echo] Half-baked guy...
half-baked guy...

121
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,375
Now you listen and
you listen real good!

122
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,166
I don't want my darling
Moka sullied by

123
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,750
the likes of a creep like you.

124
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,208
[echo] Creep like you...
Creep like you...

125
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,750
Creep like you...
Creep like you...

126
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:11,291
So... I'm declaring
war on you!

127
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,958
Magic wand, brooms
and buckets...

128
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,500
Magic wand, brooms
and buckets...

129
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,958
Abracadabra!

130
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,333
Tsukune!

131
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,833
These cleaning supplies
are possessed!

132
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,291
It's magic you simpleton!

133
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,500
Magic?

134
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,750
Yep!

135
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,333
You see, I'm a witch,
it's sort of my thing!

136
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,083
And if any dirty boy tries
to get close to my Moka,

137
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,666
well then, they're gonna
have to answer to me

138
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,041
and my magic wand here.

139
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,458
Did you guys hear that?

140
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,875
This girl is way out of control;
revealing your monster

141
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,041
identity is definitely
against school rules!

142
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,458
Well... Looks like
you pushed your luck

143
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,791
a little too far this time.

144
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,333
Yukari Sendo?

145
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,708
Yeow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

146
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,583
I swear, I really don't
know what to do.

147
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,458
Hey! What's
the big idea, huh?

148
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,458
Here we are in the very
next episode right after

149
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,166
my big debut, and
you guys can't get

150
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,541
around to me any
sooner than this?

151
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,208
Who exactly is she talking to?

152
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,416
Whee!

153
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm so sorry about that.

154
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,666
It sounds like you had a really
rough experience, Tsukune.

155
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,041
Oh, you have no idea.

156
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,708
She won't even
let me talk to Moka.

157
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,791
I mean, just look
at the state I'm in!

158
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,875
Yahoo!

159
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,833
That means it's
just the two of us now!

160
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,750
Way to go, Yukari!

161
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,583
As far as that girl's concerned,
I've heard some things.

162
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,375
Really?
What did you--

163
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,416
Supposedly,
she's some sort of genius.

164
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,083
But apparently
she's childish and bratty.

165
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,166
And everybody in
her class hates her guts.

166
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,791
R-R-Really?

167
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,541
She's probably really full of
herself because she's so smart.

168
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,291
You know how
those brainiacs are.

169
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,583
Tsukune, my most
despised and hated rival,

170
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,166
I'm gonna beat you so bad
you'll never walk again!

171
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,625
This is my voodoo doll!

172
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,375
And it's got your
name all over it!

173
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,708
Just tuck this strand
of Tsukune's hair inside...

174
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,166
And pow!

175
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,291
Whoa!
Are you alright?

176
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,708
Pow! Pow!

177
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,500
A guy like you doesn't
deserve a pair

178
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,958
of perfect breasts like Moka's.

179
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,833
Might as well give it
up and get grabby

180
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,125
with Miss Tittie-Pie
there instead!

181
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,875
Whew!

182
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,958
Man, I didn't think I was
ever gonna lose her.

183
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,958
No, it's not what you think,
I can't control myself!

184
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,875
Hey, what do you two
think you're doing?!

185
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,208
You did it again!

186
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,083
You used your love charm
attack on him, didn't you?

187
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,583
Wait... You know
I wouldn't do that!

188
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,041
Then what's going on?!

189
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,583
And yank!

190
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,958
Uh, Tsukune?

191
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,083
I... I didn't mean
to, really!

192
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,458
It worked!
I did it!

193
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,083
It's Yukari!

194
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,833
Busted, whee!

195
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,541
Look, I can't take this anymore!

196
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,500
You guys have got
to do something here!

197
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,916
Well she's not really
bothering me that much.

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,958
Relax, she's just a little kid,
it's not that big of a deal.

199
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,083
Oh, come on, that's no excuse!

200
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,583
She needs to understand
she can't go

201
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,541
around messing with
people like that.

202
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,833
I think it's about time
she learned her lesson!

203
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,250
I suppose you're right, but--

204
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,791
Yukari, look!

205
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,458
If you keep this crap up,
nobody's gonna like you, okay?

206
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,208
And before long you'll end up
alone with no friends!

207
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,125
Who cares?
I'm a genius, alright?

208
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,333
As far as I'm concerned, if
people aren't at my level,

209
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,458
then why the heck
should I waste my

210
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,958
time being friends
with them anyway?

211
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,416
Plus...

212
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,166
What's the big deal?

213
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,958
I've been alone
from the very beginning.

214
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,666
Oh Yukari that's...

215
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,250
Oh man, you totally
fell for that one!

216
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,291
You little brat...!

217
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,791
Hey calm down, you
can't go around losing

218
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,541
your temper with a little
kid like that, okay?!

219
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,791
And what about you?

220
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,041
You need to stop hanging
around with that brat!

221
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,916
Yeah, but Tsukune...

222
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,958
You know I heard
that girl is a witch...

223
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,666
What a pathetic loser.

224
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,250
How'd we get stuck with a
girl like that in our class?

225
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,958
And all that stupid cutesy talk?

226
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,750
I mean, come on, who the
hell does she think she is?

227
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,708
Yeah well it's not
like she can help it,

228
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,000
she is a witch after all.

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,166
A snot-nosed kid like her is
nothing more than a nuisance.

230
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,041
Besides, witches are
closer to humans

231
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,583
than they are to
monsters anyway.

232
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,416
There's no reason for her to
even be at this school.

233
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,166
I know, right?

234
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,916
The only reason she
makes good grades

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,041
is because she uses magic.

236
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,958
Who needs friends?
I don't care.

237
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,041
Ow! That hurt,
you moron!

238
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,125
Why don't you watch
where you're walking, you jerk?

239
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,750
Well I suppose compared
to you almost anyone

240
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,000
could be considered a
moron, couldn't they?

241
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,375
The class president?

242
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,625
Well, if it isn't little
Miss Rule-Breaker.

243
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,041
You've gone and made
our president angry.

244
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,041
Well, that doesn't have
anything to do with you guys,

245
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,541
so leave me alone!

246
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,750
Oh, but it does.

247
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,416
You see...

248
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,041
Whenever a student
does something to

249
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,958
disrupt class discipline,
it's our responsibility

250
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,958
to teach them a lesson.

251
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:57,333
My point is you're way too
lenient when it comes to Yukari!

252
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,083
But still, when you stop and
think about how she must feel...

253
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,375
If that's the way you look at
it, think about my feelings,

254
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,708
'cause I'm the one getting
pummeled to death over here!

255
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,250
Don't you get it?

256
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,708
Look. You of all people know
what it's like to be different.

257
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,708
I know you do, Tsukune.

258
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,291
No, that's not the same thing!

259
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,958
Don't you understand?

260
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,833
I won't abandon her!

261
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,583
She did say she didn't
care if she was well liked.

262
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,250
I mean, let's be honest,
that is so like a witch!

263
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,250
Uh wait, what do
you mean by that?

264
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,708
You mean you don't know?

265
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,208
Look, witches are halfway
between monsters and humans,

266
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,500
but they're not
really either one.

267
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,666
A long time ago,

268
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,416
people used to say
witches were the link

269
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,458
between monsters
and human beings.

270
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,666
Nowadays, they just
think they're

271
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,208
nothing but half-monsters.

272
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,708
Half-monsters?

273
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,541
They aren't exactly accepted
by the humans, either.

274
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,666
Back in the day,
things were pretty bad.

275
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,416
They had "witch trials"
and "witch hunts."

276
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,708
They've always been
a hated people.

277
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,166
She doesn't feel
accepted by anyone.

278
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,500
She's probably always
felt like she's alone,

279
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,708
from the very beginning.

280
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,625
That's just like me.

281
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,250
Oh come on, you're not alone;
you've always got me, right?

282
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,708
Hey, wait!

283
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,000
Hey, what's your problem?
That hurts!

284
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,000
"It hurts," "It hurts," why
don't you go cry about it?!

285
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,791
Your voice is disgusting!

286
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,833
Yep...
"Disgusting" is exactly right.

287
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,750
It makes me sick!

288
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,833
Quick monster fact: These guys
are lizardmen--a subhuman,

289
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,666
yet highly intelligent
species that

290
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,708
look just like lizards, whee!

291
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,166
You're nothing but a
disgusting snot-nosed,

292
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,833
shrimp-ass punk bitch!

293
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,666
A thing like you
doesn't belong here!

294
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,875
I wish we didn't
have her in our class.

295
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,250
What's her deal?
The dirty witch.

296
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,791
Actin' like she's all hot shit,

297
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,750
just cause she's good
at school and stuff.

298
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,375
Why do they even let
stupid little brats

299
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,208
like her come to school here?

300
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,416
I know, right?

301
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,833
It's like, you're a
total pain in the ass,

302
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,416
why don't you just leave?

303
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,916
Hey!
What happened?!

304
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,958
I'm so embarrassed!

305
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,958
Well, that oughta teach you!

306
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,750
It was that bitch!

307
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,958
That was mean this is
why everyone hates you,

308
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,541
you dirty witch!

309
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,333
I don't even wanna be liked by
stupid girls like you, so there!

310
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:37,416
What's wrong,
cat got your tongue?

311
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,958
Magic wand, attack!

312
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,166
Magic wand, attack...
Magic wand, attack...

313
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh shut your damn mouth!

314
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,250
Oh no, he ate my magic wand.

315
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,250
Blech!

316
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,541
Gross, I've never
tasted something

317
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,791
so terrible in my life!

318
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,791
So, what should we
do with this one, eh?

319
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,333
I say we eat her.

320
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,083
There's plenty of fog, there's
no way anyone would see us.

321
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,541
Yeah, that's a good idea.

322
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,750
She's a prepubescent
little runt.

323
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,333
But at least she'll
take the taste

324
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,416
of that wand out of my mouth.

325
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,333
Oh, no!
Please help me!

326
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,916
Get away from her right now!

327
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,458
Oh, Moka, it's you!

328
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,291
Well, well, look who it is.

329
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,166
I just had a great idea, boss,
how 'bout we eat both of them?

330
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,750
I second that motion.

331
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,708
I gotta admit, this one
looks pretty damn tasty,

332
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,791
all plump and juicy,
and most of all--

333
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,166
She's got those!

334
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,708
And this!

335
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,166
And that!

336
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,625
I'm fine, just get out of here!

337
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,166
As far as monsters go,
these guys are a joke!

338
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,833
Trust me, I can
handle them myself!

339
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,958
You've gotta stop
doing that, Yukari!

340
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,208
Don't act so tough.

341
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,958
If you're scared there's
nothing wrong with

342
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,625
asking others for some help.

343
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,583
You really should try being
more honest with yourself.

344
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,166
But I--

345
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,916
There's no reason to push
yourself so hard, Yukari.

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,625
Why bite off more
than you can chew?

347
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,833
You're still a
little girl, you know?

348
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,958
I'm not pushing myself too hard.

349
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,875
The truth is, you've been
alone your whole life, right?

350
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:12,583
If you feel lonely, and if you
don't like being all alone,

351
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,500
why don't you say so?

352
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,666
I was the same.
All alone, all by myself.

353
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,541
You too, Moka?

354
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,833
That's why I'll never
give up on you.

355
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,916
It's why I wanna help you
and be there for you,

356
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,250
Yukari, no matter what.

357
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,125
Thank you, Moka.

358
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,041
Hey!
What gives?

359
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,500
Did they forget about
us or something?

360
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,708
Yeah, what are we?
Chopped liver?!

361
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,333
We won't stand for it.

362
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,125
You understand me, fellas?

363
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,416
We're not gonna put up
with this crap, are we?

364
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,541
I say it's hightime
we chow down on some

365
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,791
of that yummy-looking
rump roast!

366
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,250
No!

367
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,000
Wha--?!

368
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,625
What the hell do you
think you're doing,

369
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,041
you miserable little brat?!

370
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,958
Wait, I don't get it,
why are you here?

371
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,166
I'm sorry about before.

372
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,375
I get how you feel; I know what
it's like to be all alone, too.

373
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,208
No, you liar, you
don't know anything!

374
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:30,458
So come on, please let me do
what I can to help you, okay?

375
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,208
All right, that's enough!

376
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,625
This is getting ridiculous!

377
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,583
For the last few minutes,
it's been nothing

378
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,458
but a bunch of sappy melodrama!

379
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,708
It's time we step in and
take care of these wimps!

380
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,125
Mister Class President,
you do the other girl!

381
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,666
No, Yukari!
Tsukune look out!

382
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,083
Tsukune are you okay??

383
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:53,833
Kurumu!

384
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,708
You guys are heavy.

385
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,583
Thanks for helping
us out back there.

386
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,666
I did it for you, you know?

387
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,875
Give me a break
another do-gooder?

388
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,416
This is getting annoying.

389
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,541
Whaddya say we round em' up
and eat every last one of them?!

390
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,416
You want some, bring it on!

391
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,625
Tsukune...

392
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,416
...you're--

393
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,708
Ooo yeah, Tsukune,

394
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,708
will you be my protector
too, pretty please?!

395
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,375
Tsukune, no!

396
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,666
It's time boys attack!

397
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,500
Let's eat!

398
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,166
Dinner is served!

399
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,916
It's blinding!

400
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,416
What's happening?

401
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,958
That giant blast of light!
What is it?!

402
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,041
When the rosary seal over
her breast is removed,

403
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:46,541
Moka's innocent self vanishes
and her inner vampire awakens!

404
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,208
Get back you filthy trash!

405
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,375
This...

406
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,583
...is this...?

407
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,416
Moka's vampire form?

408
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,416
Look... her hair!

409
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,625
Don't you know
that getting your

410
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,916
hair dyed is against
school rules?!

411
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,666
That skirt is way
too short, too!

412
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,958
That's a clear violation!

413
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,708
The legendary S-class monster...

414
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,125
...a vampire!

415
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,208
She knocked them
out that easily?

416
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,916
I can't see her, what the
hell just happened?!

417
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,750
You're not worth my time; the
only way you pathetic losers

418
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,541
can wield any power is by
ganging up on the weak.

419
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:39,583
Having such strength is
against our school's rules!

420
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,000
Know your place!

421
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,791
Okay, you win,
I'll stop, I promise.

422
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,125
This episode's fight was over

423
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,208
in a mere fifty seven
seconds, whee!

424
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,916
That was amazing.

425
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,083
I guess we can
always count on Moka.

426
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:04,916
But why?

427
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,291
What do you mean?

428
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,125
I was so bad and I did
mean things to everybody.

429
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,083
I don't get it, why did you
guys come and save me?

430
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,958
Did you hear anything
we said, Yukari?

431
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,791
We came to your rescue
because we all want

432
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,208
to be there for you,
no matter what.

433
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,958
You don't have to
be alone anymore.

434
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,958
From now on,
we'll be right by your side.

435
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,291
And just like that,
a few days passed by, whee!

436
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,375
About Yukari, I heard
she completely

437
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,541
cleaned up her act after that.

438
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,958
She got up in front of the
whole class and apologized

439
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,333
for the mean tricks she pulled.

440
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,583
Everyone started to
feel guilty for all

441
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,416
the things they said about her.

442
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,958
Little by little, they
started to open up to her.

443
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,750
That's really great!

444
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,833
Oh, my Tsukune!
I just love you to death!

445
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,458
Yukari, what's up?

446
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,666
Hey guys!

447
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,250
Our classes are right
next to each other,

448
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,541
I should come over
and play sometime.

449
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,041
Come over and play?

450
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,208
Yeah, it'll be fun!

451
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,166
Because I already love
you, Moka, and now

452
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,375
I've fallen madly in
love with Tsukune, too!

453
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,666
Isn't that great?!

454
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,916
Eh?

455
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,708
When I got pushed down
by Tsukune that time,

456
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,791
for some reason, it made me feel
like I wasn't a kid anymore!

457
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,375
What I mean is, I want him

458
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,541
to push me down over
and over again!

459
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,208
You know, I really don't
think that's a good idea.

460
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh no you don't... Tsukune is
mine and don't you forget it!

461
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,416
Hey, you let go
of him, he's mine!

462
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,250
Both of you are just
wasting your breath.

463
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,750
Tsukune belongs to me!

464
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,583
Oh, no, don't bite me!

465
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,583
Cut it out!

466
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,291
Ah, come on Moka,
you're gonna suck me dry!

467
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:04,333
♪ closing song ♪

468
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,750
Welcome to Yukari's
magical classroom!

469
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,250
And now I'm going to pull a
pigeon out of this metal bowl!

470
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,250
Yukari, stop!

471
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,333
This is no time
for fun and games!

472
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,708
Get serious for a second!

473
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,541
It's about Tsukune!

474
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:52,625
Next time: "Farewell
and a Vampire" and another...
