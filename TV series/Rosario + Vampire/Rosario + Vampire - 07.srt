00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,041
Papers here!

2
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,958
Get your own copy of the new
issue of the Yokai Gazette!

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,083
This issue's hot off
the presses, people!

4
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,208
Wait 'til you take a
peek at what's inside!

5
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,458
Hey, I'll take one!

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,958
Pass one over here, too!

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,958
They've even got strategies
for the final exams.

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,208
Wow, the new issue sure
is sellin' like hotcakes, huh?

9
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,541
Yeah it's great after
all the work we put into it.

10
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,375
We did it!
We really did it!

11
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,916
We got rid of all of them!

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,125
Well it looks like this
issue of the paper

13
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,916
was another big hit for us.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,333
Hey, you guys...

15
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,250
What do you say we throw
ourselves a wrap party for once?

16
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,375
We can all bring some snacks.

17
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,875
That's a great idea!

18
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,875
Sounds like a good plan to me!

19
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,083
Wait hold on...

20
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,375
Has anyone seen Gin;
where'd he run off to?

21
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,833
Strange... He was right
here just a second ago.

22
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,375
Whatever...

23
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,583
He's probably out hitting on
girls again, don't you think?

24
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,250
Right? That article is
pretty interesting.

25
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,375
The newspaper club's looking for
sexy models for a photo shoot,

26
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,833
and I can get you an audition.

27
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,166
Wow, she was dead
on the money, whee!

28
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,333
Forget about him,
he's not invited!

29
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,625
That jerk's the
enemy of all women!

30
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,625
More important, what
should we do for the party?

31
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,875
We should buy some
snacks at the campus store.

32
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,875
Yeah, we should get
some drinks too, right?!

33
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,458
Okay, but no alcohol.

34
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,916
Alright then it's a plan. After
class is over we'll all meet up

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,291
at the newspaper club
with the snacks...

36
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,916
So do you guys wanna play
some games while we're there?

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,458
You people are all 'buddy
buddy', aren't you...?

38
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,791
You newspaper clubbers.

39
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,166
And you all like each other...

40
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,833
Truthfully, I've never
understood that way of thinking.

41
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,833
Hey! What's that
supposed to mean, huh?!

42
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,375
Newspaper.

43
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,666
Can I have one?

44
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,041
Oh...

45
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,333
Sure, as long as you
don't mind it's all folded up.

46
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,708
Uh... What are you doing?

47
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,666
So you're the
famous Tsukune, huh...?

48
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,291
You're a lot cuter than
I thought you'd be, you know?

49
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,750
I'm what?

50
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,666
I'll see ya later.

51
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,583
Who was that girl?
Do you know her?

52
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,250
I've never seen
her before in my life.

53
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,000
Whoever she is,
I don't like her!

54
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,916
Yeah!
Tell me about it!

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,875
Just calm down and
forget about her.

56
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,458
Let's have the party of
our lives after school today!

57
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,083
Yeah!

58
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:42,125
♪ opening song ♪

59
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,250
Kurumu?

60
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,375
Here.

61
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,500
Mister Sato?

62
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,708
Present.

63
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,166
And Miss Shirayuki?

64
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,791
Miss Shirayuki?

65
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:35,041
Well, I guess she must
be out again today.

66
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,916
Wait... Is that...?

67
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,875
I'm thrilled you
decided to join us today!

68
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,416
Moving on then...

69
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,125
Since we have
a new student here...

70
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,416
I guess introductions
are in order.

71
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,125
This is Mizore Shirayuki...

72
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,333
Extenuating circumstances
prevented her

73
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,000
from attending class
up till now...

74
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,250
But everyone...

75
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,666
...please be nice and
treat her like a friend.

76
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,500
All right, we'll buy snacks
and head to the party.

77
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,000
Hey...
Guess what?

78
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,166
I've got a homemade treat
with your name all over it...

79
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,958
Oh, Tsukune.

80
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,541
Hey...!

81
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,916
Come on, don't you think you're
getting a little close there?

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,291
Come on, let's go!

83
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,666
What's that?
Hey, who's there?

84
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,083
Hello.

85
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,458
Oh, I remember you,
you're Mizore, right...?

86
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,416
So what's up?
Do you need something?

87
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,833
I read your paper.

88
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,333
As usual, your articles were
the most entertaining ones.

89
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,750
You're familiar with my work?

90
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,833
Even when I wasn't in school,
Miss Nekonome always brought

91
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,250
over issues of the Yokai
Gazette for me to read.

92
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,625
Of all the articles, the only
ones I saved were yours.

93
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,750
Oh, wow, is that a fact?

94
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,791
Well, I'm flattered.

95
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,500
You like...?

96
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,708
I scribbled in a bunch of my
own comments and ideas.

97
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,291
What the hell...?!

98
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,333
Is she some kind of
a stalker or something?

99
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,041
It's just that...

100
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,000
I like all the
articles you write...

101
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,958
You're always writing things
from the point of view

102
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,958
of the weak and the helpless
and I can really relate.

103
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,916
Your personality and the
way you think about things

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,541
is a lot like me and
the way I think.

105
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,875
Uh.

106
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,125
What are you doing?

107
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,833
You must be lonely
just like me, huh...?

108
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,750
Trust me, I know
exactly what that's like.

109
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,083
Miss Nekonome.

110
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,333
Yes.
Hello there.

111
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,125
Are you aware there's
a girl in your class

112
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,250
who's been refusing
to attend school...?

113
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,000
I think her name
is Mizore Shirayuki.

114
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,083
I just got word she
showed up for the first time.

115
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,083
Yes, Mr. Kotsubo,
that's right.

116
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,750
If I were you, I'd be
very careful with that one.

117
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,208
Meow?

118
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,875
She hasn't attended a single
class since she enrolled.

119
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,666
It's only prudent to
assume she's dealing

120
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,875
with a very serious issue.

121
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,791
On top of that her school
records indicate that,

122
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,083
as well as having a very
unusual personality,

123
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,625
she caused quite a few
problems in junior high.

124
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,041
At any rate, to ensure she
won't be a bad influence

125
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,375
on the other students, we want
to make sure you watch her

126
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,125
and keep a tight rein
on her at all times.

127
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,125
Yeah, I'll keep an eye out.

128
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,291
Hey, did you see
that, Tsukune...?

129
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,958
That last one
skipped nine times!

130
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,541
Uh, hey, listen, Mizore...

131
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,458
I really better get going.

132
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,000
See ya.

133
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,250
You can't...!

134
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,875
Tsukune, you suck
so bad at this,

135
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,625
you haven't even gone
above four skips!

136
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,708
But the wrap party's
already starting!

137
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,083
And Moka and the
others are waiting for me!

138
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,250
You wanna go to that
buddy-buddy club of yours, huh?

139
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,000
Moka...
Your little girlfriend...

140
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,916
She's the one you
really wanna see, right?

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
If you don't stay...

142
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,666
Then there's really
no telling what

143
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,625
I might do to that poor girl.

144
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,875
What are you saying...?
Mizore?

145
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,500
All you have to do is just
be mine and mine alone...

146
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,541
'Kay...? That's it.

147
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,250
I wonder what's
taking him so long?

148
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,541
Tsukune!

149
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,041
What are you doing here...?
Where's--

150
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,083
Wait for him all
day if you want to...

151
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,958
He won't come.

152
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,375
But...?
Why're you--?

153
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,625
Because you're a
nuisance, that's why.

154
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,375
If you weren't always
hanging around,

155
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,041
Tsukune would've been
mine a long time ago.

156
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:55,416
Her hands, they're so cold...
What's happening to me?

157
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,166
Cut it out!

158
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,333
Well, that was a nice try...

159
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,750
...but the me that you see here
is nothing more than a puppet

160
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,000
made of ice, I did a good job
with her, don't you think?

161
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,083
Sorry, but now it's
time for you to die.

162
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,333
You see, Moka?

163
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:18,125
In order for me to get what
I desire, you have to go.

164
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,750
No... Tsukune, help!

165
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,833
Whoa!

166
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,083
Why're you doing this?

167
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,208
I'm not going to let
you get away from me

168
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,958
What the hell are you?

169
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,708
You've really never seen
a snow woman before...?

170
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,875
I have the power to
bend ice to my will

171
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,708
and make it do whatever I want.

172
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:42,750
What's happening?

173
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,083
Don't you understand?

174
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,791
It was fate that
you and I met...

175
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,208
We were drawn together because
we're both so terribly lonely...

176
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,916
I feel the connection
between us,

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,375
I think you and I could
understand each other...

178
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,750
Embrace me, and we can warm
each other's frozen hearts.

179
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,708
No stop!

180
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,291
No just relax...?

181
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,125
After I fully encase
your body in ice,

182
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,875
you won't be going
anywhere ever again.

183
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,416
Once I do that, you'll be

184
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,250
mine and mine alone,
won't you, Tsukune?

185
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,833
If she keeps
this up, then I'll--

186
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,333
Tsukune!

187
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,750
Just hold on!

188
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,125
But how...

189
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,250
...my puppet killed you.

190
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,166
Sorry to disappoint,
but I swooped in

191
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,333
and saved Moka at
the last minute!

192
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,416
I baked a secret love
potion into a cake

193
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,041
I made just for Tsukune, and
now it's completely ruined,

194
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,708
thanks to you!

195
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,500
You stay out of my way!

196
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:38,375
 Hold on, we're going down!

197
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,291
Tsukune!

198
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,583
Moka, are you okay?

199
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,291
All of you trying
to get in the way

200
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,708
of the true love between
Tsukune and myself...

201
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,666
You all need to just disappear.

202
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,500
Especially you, Miss Moka.
I've had enough.

203
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,708
Just stop it!

204
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,500
Stop this before it goes
any further, please!

205
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,083
Why do you stop me...?

206
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,333
You of all people, we share the
same loneliness, why don't you--

207
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,541
You're wrong...!
'Cause I'm not lonely at all!

208
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,333
But Tsukune, you--

209
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,375
Leave us be!

210
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,125
So you're...
You're rejecting me...

211
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,291
You don't care
about my feelings?

212
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:22,958
Tsukune why?!

213
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,875
Mizore's gone.

214
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,208
Where do you think she went?

215
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,833
Oh, no! The ice--!

216
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,500
Right?
You see what I mean, huh...?

217
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,083
Oh... Hey, Mr. Kotsubo,
see you later!

218
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,458
Have an awesome day!

219
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,458
Thanks...

220
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,750
Be careful on the
way home, girls.

221
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,500
So, what should we do?

222
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,708
I say we go shopping!

223
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,000
Ooh yeah I need some new shoes

224
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,625
Damn, I'll tell you what,
students these days

225
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,833
develop way too
friggin' fast...

226
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,291
Crazy.

227
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,000
Hey, you...

228
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,125
What are you doing
out here, huh?

229
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Oh, it's you.

230
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,541
Man... My cake's ruined thanks
to Frosty the Snow Skank!

231
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,416
I know what you--

232
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,791
Wow, you guys really
had a rough time, huh?

233
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,250
I know things seem kinda
dreary at the moment,

234
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,833
but we did plan this
wrap party and--

235
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,250
Damn.

236
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,375
Geez, you guys.

237
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,125
You're all like a
bunch of old farts.

238
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,458
Huh...?

239
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,208
I wonder what all the
racket is about out there.

240
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,541
Meow, meow.

241
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,708
Oh, thank goodness...!
You guys, are still here!

242
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah what's going on?

243
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,125
What's the matter?
Did something happen?

244
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,208
Yes your classmate
Mizore's gone

245
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,750
and gotten herself into
a lot of trouble.

246
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,291
Mizore did this?!

247
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,416
She went and froze
Mr. Kotsubo?!

248
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,916
I'm afraid so...

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,416
He was discovered right away,

250
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,875
so his life isn't in
danger or anything, but--

251
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,375
Hey, wait a sec...

252
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,875
Do you have some kinda proof
that she actually did this?

253
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,666
Proof?
Who needs proof...?

254
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,333
When we found him,
Mr. Kotsubo

255
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,458
himself told us Mizore
was the one who did it.

256
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,958
Miss Ririko!

257
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,583
She was a problem
child from the get-go...

258
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,875
We really should've expelled
her from school a lot sooner.

259
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,333
Yeah, but she...

260
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,375
...meow.

261
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,875
But...
What about Mizore?

262
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,000
Where is she?

263
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,541
For now,

264
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,541
the entire faculty is out
combing the grounds for her...

265
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,750
And of course...

266
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,125
As soon as we find her,
there's not a doubt

267
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,791
in my mind, she'll be
expelled at once!

268
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,541
It just doesn't make sense...

269
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,583
Why would she go and do
that to Mr. Kotsubo,

270
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,125
of all people...?

271
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,750
My guess is she went ballistic
'cause Tsukune rejected her.

272
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,291
Yeah, that's probably true.

273
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,125
Given her personality,
I wouldn't put it past her.

274
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,458
So, it's my fault.

275
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,875
Tsukune?

276
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,458
This whole thing was my fault;

277
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:19,125
if I hadn't been so blunt and
emphatic about rejecting her--

278
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,541
Please, that's a load of crap;

279
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,375
there's no sense in
blaming yourself for this.

280
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,666
She did this, and she deserves
whatever's coming to her!

281
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,291
But still...

282
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:28,708
Miss Nekonome!

283
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,000
Meow?!

284
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,416
I'm going out to look
for her on my own!

285
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,541
What?!

286
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,583
No, you can't do that, Tsukune!

287
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,708
But I have to...

288
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,000
There was something
I wanted to say

289
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,125
to her back there that
I didn't get to...

290
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:40,916
I'm going!

291
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,958
Tsukune, wait!

292
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,250
Sorry to barge in, guys!

293
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,833
Whoa... Man...

294
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,416
What the hell's gotten
into him anyway,

295
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,958
he sure is in a big hurry, huh?

296
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:49,708
Wow...

297
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,833
Well, look who it is.

298
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,083
What the heck
are you doing here?

299
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,208
Don't give me
those dirty looks...

300
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,833
I was out getting snap shots
for an awesome new scoop.

301
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,333
Snap shots for--

302
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,458
An awesome new scoop?!

303
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,416
Hey, Mizore, wait up!

304
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,333
Tsukune, is that you?

305
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,541
Listen to me!

306
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:24,041
Mr. Kotsubo's okay, he's
gonna pull through!

307
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,250
Look, if you act now,
everything'll be okay,

308
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,958
so just come back with
me and apologize.

309
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,375
Mizore...

310
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,708
You got carried away and
did it by accident, right...?

311
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,666
If you just show them
that you're sorry,

312
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,166
I'm pretty sure you
won't get expelled.

313
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,166
What's the matter...?
What is it?

314
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,750
Uh, Mizore?

315
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,791
It's just too much, Tsukune...

316
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,458
I thought it was you;
I thought you were

317
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,416
the one person in the
world who understood me.

318
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,333
But the real truth is...

319
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,583
I was wrong, nobody will ever
understand who I really am.

320
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,875
Nobody...
Nobody will...

321
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,333
No one!

322
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,875
Tsukune!

323
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,916
Moka!

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,250
There's been a terrible mistake!

325
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,583
It turns out that Mizore
didn't do anything wrong!

326
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,583
We found out what happened
from Gin's pictures!

327
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,208
Here, look!

328
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,500
What the hell?!

329
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,125
It's Mr. Kotsubo!

330
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,666
He saw Mizore
feeling all depressed,

331
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,125
and tried to take
advantage of her!

332
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,958
She was just trying
to defend herself

333
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,333
'cause he was molesting her!

334
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,333
I had no idea...

335
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,875
Man, I really wish I hadn't
said all those things.

336
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,875
I'm so sorry, Mizore!

337
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,833
I should've given you
the benefit of the doubt!

338
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,500
Will you ever forgive me?

339
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:55,041
Stay away...!
Stay away from me!

340
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:03,000
Alone...
Always alone.

341
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,500
No one in this world will ever
understand who I really am.

342
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm lonely.

343
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,916
Not even Tsukune
understood who I was.

344
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,166
What's happening...?

345
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,333
What are these,
the inner voices of her heart?

346
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,750
Stop... No more...!

347
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,583
You can all just freeze
to death for all I care!

348
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,666
This wind is freezing!

349
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,833
Hold on I'm coming!

350
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,833
Don't you worry,
Mizore, I've got you!

351
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,791
I'm gonna pull you
outta there right now!

352
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,625
Why're you doing this?
Just let me go.

353
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,666
I'm lonely...
So lonely.

354
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,333
I'm all by myself.

355
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,333
There's no point
in going on living.

356
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,666
It's all over.

357
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,208
Mizore...!

358
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,416
There's something important
that I never got to tell you!

359
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,250
What are you talking about...?

360
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,458
Tsukune?

361
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,875
It's true I'm not lonely
at the moment...!

362
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,625
But... That's only
because I have

363
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,166
so many fantastic
friends right now!

364
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,666
What's the point...?
How does that--?

365
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,416
Don't you see what I mean?

366
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,166
Us two...

367
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,375
We're friends...

368
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,833
Right?

369
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:29,125
At least I want us to be, but if
you die on me, it won't happen!

370
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,458
He's lying.
He doesn't want to be friends.

371
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,208
It's just a trick to get
on your good side.

372
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,916
If he really wanted
to be your friend...

373
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,041
then... he would
die with you.

374
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,416
It's no use...

375
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,916
I don't control them anymore...

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,166
There's nothing I can
do to stop them.

377
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,458
Don't worry, I'm coming for you!

378
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,583
Moka!

379
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,041
Tsukune!

380
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,583
What's happening...?
What the--?

381
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,083
When the rosary seal
over her breast is removed...

382
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,750
...Moka's innocent
self vanishes...

383
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,625
...and her inner
vampire awakens!

384
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,583
You're in big trouble now.

385
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,791
Get out of the way.

386
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,541
Or would you
rather die with him?

387
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,833
All right...
then die.

388
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,875
You're nothing but puppets,

389
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,333
the only thing that's
gonna die here today...

390
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,416
Is the lot of you!

391
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,875
There's no way...!
How did she...?!

392
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,208
They're from Mizore's
monster energy...

393
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,875
Moka's energy is more
powerful so they blew up!

394
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,291
Hey, thanks for the
easy-to-follow explanation.

395
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,416
It really helped, whee!

396
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,166
Hey, you saved me.

397
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,625
You called me
out just for this?!

398
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,791
Thanks, Moka,
I really do appreciate it.

399
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,916
If you're looking for thanks,
you might as well forget it.

400
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,875
Listen up, snow woman...

401
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,791
Don't go running your
big mouth about dying

402
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,875
until you've actually
tried to live your life.

403
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,500
Yeah, fair enough...

404
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,541
But from the kick you
gave me just now...

405
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,208
I might die...

406
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,458
This episode's big
showdown, if you can even

407
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:00,708
call it that, lasted a total
of eighty-six seconds, whee!

408
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,791
Yep... You guys sure
took a beating.

409
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,541
But thanks to the four of you,
it looks like Mizore's gonna

410
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,625
get off without being expelled,
isn't that wonderful?!

411
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,000
Is it just me, or
did it suddenly

412
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,250
get really cold in here?

413
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,083
Whoa...!

414
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,416
Hey, where the hell
did you come from?!

415
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,333
Hold on...
Your hair's different.

416
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,875
I decided to shorten it...
Does it look okay?

417
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,583
Oh, I think it looks
super-duper good on you!

418
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,166
It feels kinda
cheesy to say it,

419
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,375
but I feel like I've
been reborn...

420
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,583
So I thought, maybe I'd start
with a brand new hairdo.

421
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,083
Yeah...

422
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,958
You look awesome; it makes
you look really photogenic...

423
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,500
Let's get a shot
of you right now.

424
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,625
That's right, nice going
on those pictures, Gin.

425
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,291
I don't know how you
managed to get them.

426
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,750
Yeah, way to go...

427
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,875
Those photos were a big
help; without them

428
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:00,875
we couldn't have proven
Mizore's innocence.

429
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,916
Well, hey, you know me;
I've always got my

430
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,833
eyes peeled and my
ears to the ground...

431
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,666
I'm constantly
trolling the campus

432
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,791
in search of the perfect shot.

433
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,500
Hey, what's this...?

434
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,666
Are these pictures for the
newspaper or something?

435
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,000
You peeping perv!

436
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,166
Hey, when you were there taking
those photos, why didn't you

437
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,791
just step in and rescue Mizore

438
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,208
and save us all this
trouble, huh?!

439
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,583
Oh, my goodness,
come on now, you guys!

440
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,208
In the end it all worked
out pretty well, didn't it?

441
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,166
Yep, it looks like you saved the
day again, didn't you, Moka?

442
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,541
Oh, cut it out.

443
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,833
Now that that's over...

444
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,916
I'm starting to
feel thirsty again.

445
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,541
But... Hold on...!

446
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,833
No...
wait a second!

447
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:04,500
♪ closing song ♪

448
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,375
Sine... cosine... tangent.

449
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,500
Tsukune, what's wrong?

450
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,708
Hey, listen to him;

451
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,416
don't you think he's
gotten a lot smarter?!

452
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,708
Ehhhh?

453
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:48,750
Next time...

454
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,916
Math and a Vampire...
And another!
