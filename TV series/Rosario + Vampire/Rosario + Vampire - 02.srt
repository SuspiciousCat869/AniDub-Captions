1
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,583
Dear Mom and Dad:
I'm still hanging in there.

2
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,458
As it turns out, here in the
dorms at Yokai Academy,

3
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,583
students get their own rooms.

4
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,083
That was a relief...

5
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,833
For several reasons...

6
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,166
I slept like a baby.

7
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,958
Dude, you do realize that you're
out of your human form right?

8
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,083
Aw, dammit, I must
have transformed

9
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,166
while I was sleeping!

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,625
And it looks like you
did, too, bud!

11
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,750
Wha--?
Oh crap you're right!

12
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:53,875
Yep.

13
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,583
Yokai Academy is a
school of monsters,

14
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:00,083
by monsters, and for monsters.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,958
♪ opening song ♪

16
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,041
The bus to take me back to the

17
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,291
human world doesn't come
for another month.

18
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,416
Until then, I've gotta make sure
no one finds out I'm human.

19
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,125
Dude, check it out!
It's her!

20
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,208
Oh, yeah,
that new student, Moka!

21
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,041
She's so hot,
it should be illegal!

22
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,375
Morning!
It's so nice to see you!

23
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,791
Good morning to you, too, Moka!

24
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,833
Ah man,
what the hell is that about?!

25
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,708
It's that damn Tsukune guy!

26
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,458
He doesn't look like much,
but apparently he was tough

27
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,333
enough to beat the crap out
of that jerk Saizo Komiya!

28
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:27,333
Hey! The Expository
dialogue is my job, whee!

29
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,666
How did the story
become that I beat him up?

30
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,666
What's with you this morning?
C'mon... let's go!

31
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,791
Now she's holding his hand?!

32
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,208
Oh, the jealousy!

33
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,250
Oh, the misery!

34
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:44,458
Why couldn't that be me?!

35
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,708
That bastard!

36
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,375
This sucks!

37
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,458
So, Tsukune...

38
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,708
I imagine you're feeling

39
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,750
kinda lonely being
surrounded by monsters.

40
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,250
So if you ever need
anything, just ask.

41
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,416
I'll help however I can.

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,375
Thank you.

43
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,791
It freaked me out
the other day when

44
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,833
Moka unleashed her
scary vampire self.

45
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,083
But this version of her
is incredibly sweet.

46
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,291
Tsukune...

47
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,250
Moka...

48
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,500
Tsukune...

49
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,125
Moka...

50
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,166
It's too much!

51
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,541
Huh?

52
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:25,625
See, I overslept and didn't
have time for breakfast.

53
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,041
Hold on, I've got you.
What is it?

54
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,583
I'm sorry...

55
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,375
Hey, you can't treat me
like I'm your breakfast!

56
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,625
 I'm sorry!

57
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,500
It doesn't hurt all that much,
and she doesn't leave a scar...

58
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,166
...but still, there's no
getting around the

59
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,375
fact that Moka's a vampire.

60
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,166
And what if that scary Moka,
the one from the other day,

61
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,625
is actually the real Moka?

62
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,000
Between her and the
other students,

63
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:07,500
how am I gonna make it in
this scary-ass place?!

64
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,875
Please, help me!

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,333
Are you okay?

66
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:21,250
It just hit me... I'm so dizzy.

67
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,500
I'm really sorry, but would you
mind giving me a hand, please?

68
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,125
Oh, sure, of course.

69
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,125
Will you be all right?

70
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,375
What is something wrong?

71
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,541
Uh, no, nothing at all!

72
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,250
Let's get you to
the nurse's office!

73
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,333
Aw, thanks so much.

74
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,708
I'm such a bad girl...
but he smells so good...

75
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,208
I just can't help myself.

76
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,166
I should go apologize to him.

77
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,041
I'm sorry to put you
out like this, Tsukune.

78
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:25,625
Don't worry about it. Wait, how
do you know what my name is?

79
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,708
Oh... Don't be silly!

80
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,875
We are in the
same class, after all.

81
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,958
Oh, really, we are?

82
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, of course.

83
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,000
You see?

84
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,625
"See?" What am I
supposed to be seeing?

85
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,833
She is really cute and all...

86
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,958
But she's gotta
be a monster, too.

87
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,375
Whoa!
You okay?!

88
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,916
I'm so sorry!

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,750
It's because of this weird
condition I have with my body.

90
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,416
Every now and then,
my breasts sort of cramp up.

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,625
Your breasts?!

92
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,625
Yeah, you see,
they just get all tight like

93
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,416
they're being
squeezed or something.

94
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,958
It feels like they're
gonna pop open!

95
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,750
They get so swollen...
and they get so tight;

96
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,708
don't you see
how full they are?

97
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,125
They... feel like...

98
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,541
She's a monster just like
everyone else around here.

99
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,416
But monster or not,
when something feels good,

100
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,250
it feels good!

101
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,333
Tsukune?

102
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,583
Um, yes?

103
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,375
Look into my eyes.

104
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,708
Listen.

105
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:34,541
My name is Kurumu and
I want you to be my friend.

106
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,833
Whoa her eyes are beautiful.

107
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,375
And there's also...

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,875
Those ridiculously
awesome boobs of hers!

109
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,000
Be your friend?

110
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,958
Sure, I'd love to be
in yo-- friends with you!

111
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,708
Ooh, Tsukune, you're
such a naughty boy!

112
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,500
It's like I can't
control myself!

113
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,791
Tsukune?

114
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,083
What's going on?
Who is that?

115
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,166
Who am I?

116
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,333
I'm in his class.
We're friends now.

117
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,958
Right, studmuffin?

118
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,708
Right. We're in
the same class... Babe.

119
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,750
I've lost control again!

120
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,791
Well, we should get
going, Tsukune,

121
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,000
because class is
about to start.

122
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,875
Wait up, Tsukune!

123
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:32,041
No... I don't
wanna wait for you.

124
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:36,166
I'm tired of being used as a
substitute for your breakfast.

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,291
Why did I just say
those things to her?

126
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,958
That's just awful!

127
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,041
To think she'd use
you for breakfast!

128
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,291
Let's go before she
has you for lunch, too.

129
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:52,250
Yeah, that's a good idea...
Wait, no, it's not!

130
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,291
But, Tsukune...

131
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,083
Dean Koontz and Stephen King
are just two recent examples,

132
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,750
but there are scores
of other authors

133
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,333
who've featured cats
in their work.

134
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,625
Lewis Carroll is another
example of an author

135
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,041
Miss Nekonome has a
specialized interest...

136
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,000
in cats featured in
literature, whee!

137
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,000
That girl...

138
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,958
I do recognize her.

139
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,041
But what is she to Tsukune?

140
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,250
Why did I say all
that stuff to Moka?

141
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:22,375
I've gotta talk to her after
class and try to explain...

142
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,625
She's looking at me...

143
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,625
I am so winning!

144
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,916
...this is a superb
way of relating

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,083
feline qualities to humans.

146
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,208
Oh, look at that!
I guess we're out of time.

147
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,875
Well then, that'll be
all for today, class!

148
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,375
Meow, meow, meow.

149
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,666
Hey, Moka...

150
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,833
Moka...

151
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,583
Jerk!

152
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,583
I can't believe he was
flirting with her like that!

153
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,583
So apparently you're
a vampire, huh?

154
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,541
Well, that's what people are
saying... So is it true?

155
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,750
Dude, did you just see that?!

156
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,708
Yeah, and they
were totally white!

157
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,041
What's even better:
look at the boobs on her!

158
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,958
Damn! Those are
some fantastic tits!

159
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,000
Those're amazing!

160
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:35,333
See, I came here to
make a declaration of war.

161
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,333
A declaration of war?

162
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,541
Yeah, that's right.

163
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,666
I've got this big plan,
but you keep getting

164
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,708
in the way and
messing it up, Moka.

165
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,041
What plan?

166
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,458
Oh let me explain: my plan
is to turn all the boys

167
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,833
in this school into my
personal love slaves.

168
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,583
And it's been working
thanks to my Booby Trap!

169
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,666
Eh?

170
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,333
Plenty of guys
were falling into it.

171
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:59,041
And why wouldn't they?
I am a succubus, after all...

172
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,125
Hey, wait a minute.

173
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,000
You shouldn't reveal your
monster identity to me;

174
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,000
it's against school rules.

175
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:05,791
But--!

176
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,416
You came along!

177
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,333
And all of the stupid boys
fell for you instead of me!

178
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,166
I've had it with
your man-stealing!

179
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,916
Wait... I didn't
steal anyone, I swear...

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,791
Alright, I think a cat fight's
about to break out, whee!

181
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,375
I've had enough!

182
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,916
So the other day I vowed that
I wouldn't lose to you anymore!

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,833
Are those babes gonna fight?!

184
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,666
For our sakes, I really hope so!

185
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,625
I knew I had to beat you

186
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,875
and turnabout's fair
play and that's why

187
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,083
I've stolen Tsukune
away from you.

188
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,166
That's stupid!

189
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,166
Tsukune has nothing
to do with this!

190
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,291
Oh, there you are! I've
been looking for you, Moka.

191
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,291
This'll be good.

192
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,916
Major cat fight.

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,083
Oh, baby...

194
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,666
What Tsukune?

195
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,000
Listen, I want to talk to you
about those things I said...

196
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,250
Hey, Tsukune!

197
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,958
I'm sorry but I need to
talk to Moka right now.

198
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,500
Love Charm!

199
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,958
...but now that
I think about it.

200
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,458
I guess I really
don't have to...

201
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,708
Tsukune, get away from her now!

202
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,541
Huh?

203
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,083
Why would I do that?

204
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,458
You have to believe me!

205
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,583
She's dangerous!

206
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,416
I think she's sweet...

207
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,750
Hey, there's something
I just noticed.

208
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,916
Tsukune... smells really good,
doesn't he Moka?

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,541
Yep... Almost like a human does.

210
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,458
His blood must
taste really good.

211
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,583
That's the only reason why
you hang around him, isn't it?

212
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,083
So you can use him as
a substitute for breakfast?

213
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,416
That's not true!

214
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,291
And I don't "use him," either!

215
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,666
Yes, you do.

216
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,750
The only reason you want to
be my friend is because

217
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,666
you want to suck my blood.

218
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,541
God, it's just
like this morning!

219
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,041
Why do I keep saying
stuff I don't mean?!

220
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,208
I see.

221
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,958
All I am to you is
a substitute for

222
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,791
breakfast, lunch,
and dinner, Moka.

223
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,375
That's not true, Tsukune!

224
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,583
Yeah, run away, you loser!

225
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,166
Yahoo!
I did it!

226
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,000
I managed to make Little
Miss Moka cry her eyes out!

227
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,083
I don't get it.

228
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,958
Why did I say
those things to Moka?

229
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,416
And that look on her face,
it was so freaking awesome!

230
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,958
Even so, I've gotta apologize.

231
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,750
What are you doing?

232
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,166
Moka... I have
to apologize to her.

233
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,250
No, wait!

234
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,250
Huh?!!
Kurumu, what are you--...!

235
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,125
Aw, you're feeling down
in the dumps, aren't you?

236
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,291
Well don't worry.

237
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,791
Your bosom buddy'll
make it all better.

238
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,708
They're so huge!

239
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,166
Wait, what's this feeling?

240
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,625
Oh, no, what's happening?!
Uh-oh!

241
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,708
Sorry, but we're starting to
get into some scenes that

242
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,458
might be a little too
adults-only, whee!

243
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,750
Tsukune.
Is she right?

244
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,375
Am I only friends
with you because

245
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,416
I want to suck your blood?

246
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,166
I just don't know what
to think anymore.

247
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,625
You don't have time to mope.

248
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,500
Tsukune fell prey to
the succubus's magic.

249
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,458
It's called "Love Charm,"
and now she's got him

250
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,250
eating out of the
palm of her hand.

251
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,333
You're talking
through my rosary?

252
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,083
When a man is kissed
by a succubus,

253
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,708
he becomes her prisoner,

254
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,666
and she'll proceed to suck the
life out of him until he dies.

255
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,791
Oh, no!

256
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:39,958
You must hurry.

257
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,500
But hurry where?
Tell me!

258
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,958
Tell me!

259
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,000
Tsukune no!

260
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,625
Kurumu... um?

261
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,708
Don't move, okay?

262
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,333
My heart...

263
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,125
Yeah, mine, too.

264
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,625
It's beating incredibly
fast right now.

265
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,791
You'll be my first, you know.

266
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,625
The first boy I've
used this magic on.

267
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,208
Please Tsukune...
Don't run away.

268
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,583
I'm trapped; I can't get away...

269
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,708
I told you this
was my first time!

270
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,666
You can't be so rough!

271
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,666
Be more gentle with me, alright?

272
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,208
Let's stop.

273
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,291
I can't go through with this.

274
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:43,250
Impossible!
I'll try another Charm!

275
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,041
I said some terrible
things to Moka

276
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,791
and can't leave
things like this.

277
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,250
Besides...

278
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,833
You like her more than me.
Don't you?!

279
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,791
Even though I've
thrown myself at you!

280
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:57,333
Truth is... I've even done stuff
to you that embarrasses me!

281
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,416
Jerk!

282
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,291
Now I'm really mad!

283
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,541
I'm gonna take everything
that Moka likes

284
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,375
and smash it all to pieces!

285
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,625
Don't do it!

286
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,125
Moka, run!

287
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,916
Get away!
Now!

288
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,583
Go, before she
recovers from that!

289
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,458
Moka... Why'd you save me?

290
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,583
That girl is a succubus.

291
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,791
A strong one.

292
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,125
She can bewitch men
just by looking at them!

293
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,500
So that's why I said
those terrible things to you!

294
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,583
Tsukune!

295
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,000
Tsukune,
are you okay?

296
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:47,500
Yeah.

297
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,166
Excellent!

298
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,041
Now I get to kill
both of you at once!

299
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,458
Watch out!

300
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,583
She cut through those
trees like they were butter!

301
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,916
You're not hurt, are you?

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm fine.

303
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,541
If you were, I don't know
what I would've done...

304
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,416
But Moka...

305
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,458
If we don't do something quick,
we're both gonna get killed.

306
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,041
My rosary... hurry...
Please pull it off!

307
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,041
Damn!
It's not budging!

308
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:30,916
Oh, no!

309
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,416
But it came off the other day!

310
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,791
Well, well, Moka!

311
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,250
I guess that stuff
about you being

312
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,625
a scary vamp was just talk!

313
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,958
If you were a vampire, you
could've fought me off,

314
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,375
but since you're not, you
and Tsukune are gonna die!

315
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,625
No!

316
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,666
You can kill me,
but please spare him!

317
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,625
Are you seriously
prepared to go that far?!

318
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,583
I mean come on!

319
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,791
All he is is your food!

320
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,250
He's not!

321
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,666
And I'm not doing
this because of his blood!

322
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,375
It's because I care for him!

323
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,666
He's the world to me!

324
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,416
Tsukune's the first
friend I've ever had,

325
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,291
and I'll gladly die for him!

326
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,708
Moka!

327
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,833
What the hell is with all
this stupid friend crap?!

328
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,250
There's only one use for
men and that's as slaves!

329
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,500
They're just playthings
to bend to your will!

330
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,916
I feel for Moka the same way
that she feels about me!

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,833
So I'll gladly die
for her, as well!

332
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,041
What's the deal
with that light?!

333
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,958
And the sky; what's going on?!

334
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,875
When the rosary seal over
her breast is removed,

335
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:53,291
Moka's innocent self vanishes
and her inner vampire awakens!

336
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,875
Sorry to keep you waiting.

337
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,875
Are you one of those rare
S-Class Supermonsters?

338
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,958
Is this the true
power of a vampire?

339
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,333
Why don't you come
down here and find out?

340
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,583
What's wrong?

341
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,666
Afraid that you'll lose,
Little Miss Succubus?

342
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,458
You must be joking!
I'm not gonna lose!

343
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,500
No, I can't!

344
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,958
I'm on a very important mission.
The fate of my race is at stake!

345
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,041
A very important mission?

346
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,125
Right!

347
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,500
The reason we
succubi seduce men is

348
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,166
so we can meet our
destined one.

349
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,125
My kind are few in number, so in
order for our race to survive,

350
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,583
we must carefully choose our
destined one from a large pool

351
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,000
of men that we've bewitched
with our Love Charm.

352
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,166
I'd almost done it, too...

353
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,208
But you got in the
way of that, Moka!

354
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,500
That's why I can't let you live!

355
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,791
So that's it?

356
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,791
That's why you
picked a fight with me?

357
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,458
Big mistake.

358
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,750
Look out!

359
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,333
You're fast!

360
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,208
And you're slow!

361
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,791
Now you'll experience
the power of

362
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,208
an S-class monster first hand!

363
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,583
I'm sorry I'll stop I promise!

364
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,708
This episode's showdown took a
mere seventy-six seconds, whee!

365
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,833
I've got no guarantee of that.

366
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,708
So to be safe,
I'm going to tear them off.

367
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,583
Your wings
and your tail, that is.

368
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,291
No!

369
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,333
Please!

370
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,416
Don't do that...
I'm begging you!

371
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,333
What do you think you're doing?

372
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,791
Step aside.

373
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,666
Is her vampire self
the real Moka?

374
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,416
Not only did this
succubus bewitch you,

375
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,958
she tried to kill you as well

376
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,666
I think she's had enough.

377
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,250
Besides, you heard her;

378
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,416
she didn't do what she
did to be mean...

379
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,208
And what makes you so sure?

380
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,375
Well, 'cause
Kurumu... deep down,

381
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,958
she seems like a nice person.

382
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,666
Let's be friends with her, okay?

383
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,708
Y'know, like you and
I have become friends.

384
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,166
"Friends?" You and I?

385
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,916
Listen, Tsukune, you've got
the wrong idea about me.

386
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,833
I only rescued you
so that your blood

387
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,791
wouldn't get swiped from me.

388
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,041
That was it.

389
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,708
I'm not like the
other Moka you know.

390
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,375
So then... Who's the--

391
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,083
I've got ya.

392
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,916
The rosary spoke to you?!

393
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,458
It's weird, huh?

394
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,000
Maybe the seal's getting
weaker or something.

395
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,375
Really...

396
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,750
She may not think it...

397
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,708
...but you're both my friends.

398
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,875
I couldn't bear to be
without either Moka.

399
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,208
And you know what?

400
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,000
If you guys wanna suck
my blood it's fine by me.

401
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,291
Tsukune...

402
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,083
I wanna apologize
about yesterday.

403
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,958
Moka...

404
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,500
Tsukune...

405
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,625
How'd we go from bouncing
boobs to this crap, whee!

406
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,458
Morning!
Hi, Tsukune!

407
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,791
I baked some cute
little cookies for us.

408
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,625
How 'bout you and
I eat 'em together?

409
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,500
Wait, why are you asking me?

410
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,208
Oh, come on, I already told
you that I was looking for my

411
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,916
one-and-only destined
partner for life, didn't I?

412
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,625
Yeah...

413
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,916
Well...

414
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,250
I've decided that it's you!

415
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,458
Hey, it's all your fault
since you risked your

416
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,416
life to protect me the
way that you did.

417
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,708
Now I'm totally
in love with you!

418
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,000
--Well they do smell good...
--Take one!

419
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,583
They're real yummy like me.

420
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,708
Stop it! Tsukune is
mine and mine alone!

I'm Kurumu Kurono!

Did you enjoy this episode of
"Succubus and a Vampire?"

424
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,291
If so, I'll be showing up on--

425
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,833
That's not the
title of the show!

426
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,458
But we are introducing a new
character on the next episode!

Next time "Witchling and
a Vampire," and another...
