1
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,416
My name's Tsukune Aono.

2
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,208
I'm fifteen years old.

3
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,416
Starting this spring,

4
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,000
I was going to be a new
high school student.

5
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,666
Well, at least
that was the plan...

6
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:12,958
Here we stand together now...

7
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,541
I'm so screwed...

8
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,833
I've got three years of
nothing but dudes in school.

9
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:18,958
You're gettin' off easy.

10
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,000
I've got a one-hour
commute to school.

11
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,375
Oh please!

12
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,625
Everyone knows that
school has lots of cute girls.

13
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,000
Right, Tsukune?

14
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,541
Uh, yeah, I think so.

15
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,041
Dude!
Drop it!

16
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,583
Well, it's really not
that big a deal,

17
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,125
flunking the entrance
exams this year.

18
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,875
Don't worry,
you'll pass 'em next year.

19
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:38,500
Yeah, that's right!
Hang in there.

20
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,750
You guys wanna
stop by the arcade?

21
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:41,750
Sure sounds good.

22
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,166
The one that just opened?

23
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,625
Yeah.

24
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,166
Tsukune!

25
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,916
Tsukune!

26
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,375
Yeah, Mom, what is it?

27
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,916
--We've got wonderful news!
--Huh?

28
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,250
Yeah, your old man
here just happened to

29
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,666
run into someone today, and it
turns out he was a lucky find.

30
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,750
Ooh, yeah!
Best dad ever!

31
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,833
So thanks to me, you now get
to go to high school after all!

32
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,875
You got this off the street?!

33
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,458
Oh I'm so happy!

34
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,833
Now he won't have to
wait a year to try again!

35
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,000
Hey, kid.

36
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,666
Are you a new student
at Yokai Academy?

37
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,083
Uh, yeah.

38
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,750
In that case,
you better prepare yourself.

39
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,041
That's one scary-ass
school you're going to.

40
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,375
What do you mean by that?

41
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,750
Um, hi, Kyoko, how's it going?

42
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,833
Fine.

43
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,125
Listen, Tsukune,
I talked to your mom...

44
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:56,250
She said you were going to some
school called Yokai Academy.

45
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,291
Yeah that's right.

46
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,041
Well, since my favorite
cousin's gonna be going there,

47
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,208
I decided to do some research,
and you should know--

48
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,375
Hello?

49
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,041
Kyoko?
Are you there?

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,416
Wow, it's like a completely
different world here

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,416
on the other side
of the tunnel...

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,333
Is that the school over there?

53
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,041
I'd watch your
back if I were you.

54
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,833
I should call Kyoko again.

55
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,458
That's strange I had
a signal before

56
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,125
we went through the tunnel.

57
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,125
I hope I'm going the right way.

58
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:06,208
Whatever that is,
it's getting closer...

59
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,250
Oh no what the
hell is following me?!

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,791
Just me!
A bat!

61
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,375
Whee!

62
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,250
Aw, man...

63
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,583
...it was just a ba--

64
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:38,125
Ow... Ow, that hurt...

65
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,541
Oh, I'm sorry!

66
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,041
I just suddenly got all dizzy...

67
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,541
She's...

68
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,000
...gorgeous.

69
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,000
I... I, uh....

70
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,666
It's not what you think, really!

71
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,166
I'm sorry!

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,916
Oh, you're bleeding!

73
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,958
I can't.

74
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,250
I shouldn't...
but that smell....

75
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,375
Huh?

76
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,458
Smell?

77
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,958
Ahhh...
her hair smells so good!

78
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,333
Sorry...
I can't help it!

79
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,583
'Cause I'm a vampire!

80
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,041
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!

81
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,500
You bit me!

82
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:51,041
Wait... huh?
It's not that bad.

83
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,166
Are you going to Yokai, too?

84
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,583
Uh, yeah.
It's my first year.

85
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:59,125
That's great!
This is mine too!

86
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,250
Oh... what do you know...

87
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:06,125
I have to ask...
what do you think about...

88
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,541
...well about vampires?

89
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,000
It's a joke.
It's gotta be.

90
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,083
They're fine by me.

91
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,666
I don't have a problem
with vampires in the slightest.

92
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,333
If you wanna call yourself
a vampire, more power to ya.

93
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,500
Thank you!

94
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,125
Well, if that's the case,
maybe we could be friends.

95
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,250
What do you think?

96
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,500
Yeah... sure.

97
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,083
Oh, fantastic!

98
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,625
I was nervous 'cause I didn't
have any friends here yet... Oh!

99
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,250
Yeah my name's
Moka Akashiya by the way.

100
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,916
And mine's Tsukune Aono.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,041
I can't believe I get to go
to school with a girl this cute!

102
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,083
This is my lucky day!

103
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,791
Well, good morning, students.

104
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,250
If you're new here,
welcome to Yokai Academy.

105
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,416
My name is Shizuka Nekonome,
and I'll be your teacher.

106
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Wow!

107
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,208
The teacher
seems really nice too.

108
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,583
I really lucked out!

109
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,583
Well I'm sure that everybody
already knows this fact,

110
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,166
but Yokai is an incredibly
unique school!

111
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,250
One that's exclusively
for monsters.

112
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,791
--Yep!
--Sure...

113
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,625
...sure... monsters, why--

114
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,416
Currently, this planet is well
under the control of humans.

115
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,750
So, in order for monsters like
you and I to survive, class,

116
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,291
the only option
that we have is to

117
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,750
learn how to coexist with them.

118
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,625
Whoa... Teacher...

119
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,708
...what?

120
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,416
And that brings us to...
our first rule!

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,541
Except in special circumstances,
as long as you're on campus,

122
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,708
you must always remain
in your human form.

123
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,625
Everybody got that?

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,083
Rule number two:
never, ever reveal your

125
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,208
monster identity to
another student.

126
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,208
I'm sure you can see why!

127
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,750
Everyone will follow
these rules, right?

128
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,666
Buncha boring rules.

129
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,458
And you are...

130
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,250
Aha, Saizo Komiya 

131
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,750
If we do happen to spot
a human, why not just eat him?

132
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,208
That's what I would do, anyway.

133
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,750
He's gotta be joking!

134
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,375
Well, now. There's no chance
of that happening because

135
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,958
at this school, all the students
and teachers are monsters.

136
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,708
So, no exceptions.
Got it?

137
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:17,708
You see this school's enclosed
in a giant secret barrier

138
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,583
but even if a human got
through it somehow

139
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,833
and wandered in here... they
would be killed immediately!

140
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,125
Say whatever you
want, but I swear

141
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,958
I've been smellin' a
human this whole time.

142
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,916
I'm so sorry I'm late!

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,375
Oh don't worry, it's alright!

144
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,166
Go ahead and introduce yourself!

145
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,041
Hi!
I'm Moka Akashiya.

146
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,375
Whoa!

147
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,833
--Man look at her!
--She is so hot!

148
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,625
Totally I think I'm
in love with her!

149
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,833
Tsukune, it's you!

150
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,791
I'm so glad we're
in the same class!

151
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,541
Huh?!

152
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,250
I don't get it.
What's going on?

153
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,291
Is this a dream?

154
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,375
It has to be...

155
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,458
A school full of
nothing but monsters?

156
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,500
That makes no sense!

157
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,875
Oh, I'm sorry!

158
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,333
What the?

159
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,833
Oh you're silly!

160
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,291
She's... strong.

161
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,708
This is fun, huh?

162
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,375
Uh...

163
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:15,291
Really... This cute girl is
a real-live vampire?

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,416
Hey there, sexy.

165
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,125
You said your name was
Moka Akashiya, right?

166
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,708
No let him go!

167
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,958
So tell me... what's a smokin'
hot chick like you doing makin'

168
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,875
friends with a
numbnuts like this guy?

169
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,750
I mean come on?

170
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,333
Tsukune!

171
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,541
Hey...

172
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,291
Forget about that punk-ass and
hang out with me instead, babe.

173
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:54,583
No way, I prefer to hang out
with nice people, thank you.

174
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,041
Tsukune!

175
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,750
Are you okay?

176
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,208
Uhh... yeah... I think so.

177
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,166
Wow...

178
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,500
...that was pretty scary!

179
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,916
Are you sure
you're okay after that?

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, I'm alright...
He was really strong, though.

181
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:25,416
So that was monster power...
Crazy strength.

182
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,375
Oh Tsukune, you're so funny!

183
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,791
Back there, you
acted almost like

184
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,041
you'd never seen a
monster before!

185
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,208
Well...

186
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,375
So what kind of a monster
are you, anyway?

187
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,083
Oh, wait, we're not
supposed to reveal

188
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,875
that to each other, are we?

189
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,583
Sorry, never mind
you don't have to tell me!

190
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,208
But I already know
what you are Moka,

191
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,083
since you told me that
you're a vampire.

192
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,666
Yeah, I know but
when I told you,

193
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,791
I had no idea that
was a rule here!

194
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,916
You know, you don't look
like a vampire very much...

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,333
Well, not right now, but...

196
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,125
Look.

197
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,000
L-Look at wha--?

198
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,000
No, I can't look there!

199
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,000
It's okay...

200
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,250
Look at the rosary on my chest.

201
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,416
If I were to take this
off I would change,

202
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,833
I'd turn into my true form:

203
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,916
a powerful and
terrifying vampire.

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,125
So...

205
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,666
A real vampire?

206
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,708
That's why I wear it: as a
charm to seal my powers away...

207
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,250
I can't even take it off myself.

208
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:27,416
Well that's okay!

209
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,958
Even if you get a little
scary sometimes,

210
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,791
I'm sure you're still
the same Moka...

211
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,000
I knew you'd understand!

212
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,791
You're my first friend here!

213
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,791
And also... I feel I should
tell you that you're

214
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,125
my first in another
way, too, Tsukune.

215
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,625
In what way?

216
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,208
'Til now, all I've ever had

217
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,958
was tomato juice and
transfusion bags...

218
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:52,708
I had never sucked anyone's
blood before yours today.

219
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,708
It tasted so sweet.
So rich...

220
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,583
That feeling...
I'll never forget it!

221
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:07,625
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry!
But I have to go!

222
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,541
See you later!

223
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,833
Why'd he leave?

224
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,708
This can't be happening!

225
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,083
How can she be so cute
and still be a vampire?

226
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,541
But are we really
that different?

227
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:30,041
So her... And her, too...
And all of them?!

228
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,666
I don't think
this school's for me.

229
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,500
Tsukune!

230
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,333
You were acting kinda
weird back there...

231
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,916
I just...

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,416
I think I should go
to a human school.

233
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,000
A human school?

234
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,750
Why?

235
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,291
Look I really like you, Moka,
but I just can't stay here!

236
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,125
No way! You can't
go to a human school!

237
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,208
You can't!

238
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,625
Moka, please!

239
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,166
I'm sorry it's just that

240
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,250
I really don't like
humans very much.

241
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,500
They can be cruel.

242
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,833
I know because I
attended human schools

243
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,750
all the way up
through junior high.

244
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,416
I was lonely...
Because humans...

245
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,458
...well, they don't
believe in monsters.

246
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:39,375
I felt so different... it was
like I shouldn't even be there.

247
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,375
That's all I ever thought
about when I was there...

248
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,208
But then you said
you didn't mind

249
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,875
if I was a vampire, Tsukune.

250
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,750
And for the first
time in my life,

251
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,041
I didn't feel alone anymore.

252
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,541
But still...

253
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,916
What if I turned out to be

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,125
one of those humans
you hate so much?

255
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,250
Would you still feel the
same way about me?

256
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,791
I'm a human.

257
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,416
I'm sorry, but that's what I am!

258
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,250
And the only reason
I'm even here at all

259
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,583
is because of a major mix-up!

260
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,833
You're lying.

261
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,291
You have to be... no human
could have gotten in here...

262
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:24,375
I should've known you'd
look at me like that!

263
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,041
It's really true, Tsukune?

264
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,500
Just stay away from me!

265
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,250
You hate humans, right?
Don't you?!

266
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,458
Well, that's okay!
I don't need you!

267
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,583
I don't need monsters
for friends anyway!

268
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,541
Tsukune wait!

269
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,791
Where's the bus stop?

270
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,250
This way?

271
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,750
Tsukune...!

272
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,541
So where do you
think you're goin'?

273
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,291
Stick around, babe.

274
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:18,208
Sorry, but I'm busy now.

275
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,958
How 'bout gettin' busy
with my true form?!

276
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,625
I'm an orc!

277
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,375
Noooo!

278
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,708
Oh, no that jerk again?

279
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:39,500
But if I go back,
I'm still just a human.

280
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,166
Come on, babe, what's the deal?

281
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,291
I showed you my true form,
so why don't' you show me yours?

282
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,083
Don't tell me a sexy
little thing like you is shy!

283
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,333
For one, it's against
school rules!

284
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,083
We're outside of school now,

285
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,875
so that rule doesn't
mean crap to me!

286
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,041
No don't!

287
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,000
Stop it!

288
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,250
You! Get the hell
away from her now!

289
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,458
Tsukune...

290
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:19,500
What was that?! Beat it!

291
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,000
What the hell are you,
a monster or a mouse?!

292
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:27,916
You're pathetic!

293
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,500
Tsukune!

294
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,958
Huh?

295
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,583
Hey, you!
Get back here!

296
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,458
The bus stop.
So this is where it is!

297
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,916
Tsukune!

298
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,916
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry!

299
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,458
Forgive me!

300
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,875
I guess monsters and humans
are too different to get along.

301
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,958
Don't cry...

302
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,625
Look at me--I'm a vampire.

303
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,916
We suck people's blood
and hurt them in the process.

304
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,041
The truth is... back at my
old school all I ever

305
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,208
wanted was a friend,
whether it was a

306
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:16,000
human or a monster,
I didn't care.

307
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:22,500
But now... I think
maybe it isn't possible.

308
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,583
Well... I think--

309
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:27,708
What's with all
this lovey-dovey shit?!

310
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,291
Please, you should
get out of here!

311
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,041
But Tsukune!

312
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,083
I know I'm weak...
And nothing but a

313
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,583
piece of human
garbage to you...

314
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,250
I don't care if you're a
monster and I'm a human;

315
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,208
that doesn't matter
anymore, Moka!

316
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,166
'Cause I still want
to be your friend!

317
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,000
All your yappin' is
getting on my nerves!

318
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,208
Tsukune!

319
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:58,000
Even if you are a vampire...

320
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:05,041
Well, I still...
I still like you Moka.

321
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,833
My rosary... it came off!

322
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,625
Hey... what the hell's this?

323
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,250
She looks different...

324
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,791
...and scary.

325
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,833
That's not the same Moka!

326
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,250
She transformed!

327
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,250
If I were to take this off
I would change, I'd turn into

328
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,583
my true form a powerful
and terrifying vampire.

329
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,583
So that's...

330
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,625
...the true form of a vampire?

331
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,875
Oh, man.
The tales... they're true!

332
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,166
The red eyes...

333
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,708
The silver hair...
The overwhelming energy...!

334
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,208
She's an "S"
Class Supermonster...

335
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,166
A real vampire!

336
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,750
So then, I suppose the one
who woke me up was you, huh?

337
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,250
What the hell?!

338
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,333
What's wrong with me!

339
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:47,125
I mean... she's only staring
at me but I can't stop shaking.

340
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,166
No, this isn't right!

341
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,666
Hey, pull it together, man!

342
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,458
'Cause if you took
down a vampire...!

343
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,791
It's time for you
to know your place.

344
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,250
Yes, ma'am, I'll remember that.

345
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,583
So quick, whee!

346
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:22,750
It's like she's not even the
same Moka that she was before.

347
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,166
She's so strong...

348
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:30,666
I wonder... Which one of
them is the real Moka?

349
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:42,458
But her sweet smell...
It's the same...

350
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,333
Just like before.

351
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,708
Oh, thank goodness!
You're finally awake, Tsukune!

352
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,625
Hey, are you alright?

353
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,250
You aren't hurt
anywhere are you?

354
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:06,541
What's happening?
Did I dream all this?

355
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,083
The bus it doesn't come
at different times,

356
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,666
but different days?

357
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,333
What?
Am I reading this right?

358
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,666
The bus only comes
here once a month?!

359
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,416
Mmm-hhh... didn't you know?

360
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,083
Oh, no!
You're bleeding!

361
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,416
Here, let me help you!

362
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,458
Dear Mom, Dad, and Kyoko...

363
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,083
I know this letter
won't reach you

364
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,000
for a while because of
the weird bus schedule,

365
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,958
but I'm writing it anyway.

366
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,666
My new school, Yokai Academy,

367
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,791
turned out to be an
odd sort of place.

368
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,916
To tell you the truth,
I even considered leaving

369
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,833
and heading home right away.

370
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,541
However, I've decided
to stick it out

371
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,208
for a while longer to
see how things go.

372
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:51,750
You see, I've made a new
friend and, well, she likes my--

373
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,083
Oh no...! I'm sorry, but I
just can't resist this smell...

374
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,875
Uh, what do you mean?

375
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,333
Sorry, Tsukune!

376
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,416
I think I've enrolled in a
pretty dangerous school here!

377
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,000
You're gonna be fine,
Tsukune; let's kiss!

378
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,958
But I'm gonna be sucked
on even more next time!

379
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,291
Oh, and, what's a succubus?

380
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:52,666
Next time: "Succubus and a
Vampire," and another...
