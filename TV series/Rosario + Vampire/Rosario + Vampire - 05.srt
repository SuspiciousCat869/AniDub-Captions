1
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,291
I'm not gonna let
you score this time!

2
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,125
Here goes! I'm going
to dedicate this shot to Moka!

3
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,916
And it's good...!
Morisaki just missed that one!

4
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,333
Tsukune.

5
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,708
Alright!

6
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,291
Are you really
okay with this...?

7
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,166
You're sure?

8
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes.

9
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,125
Oh, I'm so happy!

10
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,083
Moka.

11
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,083
Wow...
Thank you so much.

12
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,833
It's the first time
you've ever offered

13
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,208
to let me suck your blood.

14
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,541
It was delicious as always;
thank you Tsukune!

15
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,458
Uh... Yeah, sure,
no problem.

16
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,500
Moka...

17
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:41,208
I wonder if she has any
idea why I do this for her?

18
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:44,083
We'd better get a move-on
or we're gonna be late!

19
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,166
Guess not.

20
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:50,291
His blood...
it's so yummy!

21
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:55,333
♪ opening song ♪

22
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,875
Okay, everyone.

23
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,875
It's time for you
to join a club!

24
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,125
A club?

25
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,750
And it's good...
Morisaki just missed that one!

26
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:37,875
Tsukune.

27
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,333
Moka.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,666
The primary objective of
this academy is to prepare

29
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,916
our monsters to adapt
to human society.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,916
Through participation
in these clubs,

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,541
you'll learn to act just like
humans, appreciate arts

32
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,791
they've developed,
and deepen your

33
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,416
understanding of the
human culture...

34
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,791
Now...

35
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,166
...In order for your
transformation to the human form

36
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,375
to be perfect, you
have to have a

37
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,916
firm grasp of
humans themselves.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,583
And always remember this:...

39
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,666
You must never reveal your
monster form, no matter what.

40
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,500
Um...
Excuse me?

41
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes?

42
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,500
Your tail.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,416
Wow...

44
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,000
There's a ton of different
clubs to choose from, huh?

45
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,625
Hey, I've got a good idea...

46
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,041
Let's join the same club!

47
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,000
Come and take pictures
of ghosts with us!

48
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,833
Acupuncture Club?

49
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,875
Mummy Club?

50
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,500
Make love potions with
the chemistry club!

51
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,791
Moka, drink this!

52
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,708
Mine's better!

53
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,958
Please, drink mine!

54
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,000
This is nuts,
doesn't this school

55
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,083
have one normal club in it?

56
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,041
Of course not, whee!

57
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,208
My name's Tamao Ichinose...

58
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,833
Come join me and my friends
in the swimming club, guys.

59
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,291
Chicks in bikinis!

60
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,125
And every single one
of em's a hottie!

61
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,666
The swimming club seems normal.

62
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,458
At the moment, the Swimming Club
doesn't have any boys...

63
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,916
That means any fellas
who join up now stand

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,916
to get a lot of personalized
service from us.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,166
Eh?!

66
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,875
So whaddaya say, huh...?
Who wants to sign up?

67
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,875
I think we've found
a winner, Moka.

68
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,041
I used to do soccer, uh,
I mean, I used to take

69
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,500
swimming lessons at one point.

70
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,666
Swimming's perfect...

71
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,208
It's something I can
impress Moka with.

72
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,625
Wow, you're so cool!

73
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,875
Plus, there's that...

74
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,125
Well...
You like?

75
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,583
Oh, yeah!

76
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,250
Tsukune?

77
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:09,791
Uh... Yeah, we
should check it out!

78
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,166
But, you see...

79
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,166
I can't...

80
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,625
Water is-- 

81
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,208
It doesn't look like your
girlfriend's too interested...?

82
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,291
Why don't you join us anyway?

83
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,000
I promise that I'll take
real good care of you...

84
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,875
Whaddaya say?

85
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,500
Eh...?
Uhh--

86
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,541
We're both joining!

87
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,458
Oh man, would you look at
the legs on those chicks?

88
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,041
Don't waste your
time on their legs,

89
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,208
look at their tits, bro,
always look at the tits!

90
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,208
But what about Moka?
Do you think she's gonna swim?

91
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,833
We can't give up just yet...

92
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,458
She'll take her shirt off,
you just watch!

93
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,458
Man, I can't wait!

94
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,875
Stupid Tsukune,
acting all flirty with her!

95
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:00,250
Good.

96
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,708
Okay.

97
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,083
That's the idea.

98
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,291
Excuse me?

99
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,916
Something on your mind, Tsukune?

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,666
D-Don't you think
you're way too close?

101
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,833
What am I making
you uncomfortable?

102
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,750
Oh, Tsukune.
You're so cute.

103
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's give this one more try...

104
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,625
Just pull your
arm back like this.

105
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,333
Oh...
So soft!

106
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,166
That's enough!

107
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,458
Moka?

108
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,166
Tsukune... You joined the
swimming club so you

109
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,916
could meet new
girls, didn't you?

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,375
No wait, you don't understand!

111
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,083
Oh, no, don't you dare tell
me I don't understand...!

112
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,458
I won't put up with this crap!

113
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,416
Please, Moka, just listen!

114
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,083
Goodbye!

115
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,750
Moka, wait!

116
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,666
You're like two
little kids fighting...

117
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,916
It's ridiculous.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,041
The only thing men and
women really need from

119
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,083
each other is to take
and be taken...

120
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,625
I'm sure you get my meaning.

121
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,208
This is the Swimming Club,
you know...?

122
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,875
If you're not going to swim,
why don't you just leave...?

123
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,750
...go bother someone else.

124
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,541
I gotta get out of here!

125
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,666
Whoa...!
Moka, wait up...!

126
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,041
Moka!

127
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,291
Ya hoo-hoo!

128
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,708
Hey, Tsukune...!

129
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,458
I just joined the swimming club,
too, isn't that great?!

130
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,375
And so did I!

131
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,333
She's gonna pop right out!

132
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,583
Dude, stop crying,
you're ruining it for me.

133
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,833
Little Yukari...
So cute!

134
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,833
It was totally worth the wait!

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,583
So...
Uh...

136
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,958
...will you show me...

137
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,375
--Teach me how to swim, please!

138
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,958
--Kurumu... Your umm...
--Teach me how to swim, please!

139
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,875
Your...

140
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,750
Your breasts!
Buh-buh-buh...!

141
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,875
Hmm?

142
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,958
Yeah...

143
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,625
My breasts are
kinda hurting right now.

144
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,125
This is my chance...!

145
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,958
Today's the day I finally
make Tsukune mine!

146
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,250
It's my suit...

147
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,000
I think it may be a little
small or something.

148
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,291
Tsukune!

149
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,750
Hey, I want you to
teach me how to swim!

150
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,750
There's no way I'm gonna let
Kurumu have her way with him!

151
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,125
You let him go; Tsukune's
mine and that's that!

152
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,250
Well, I don't see your name
written on him, so there!

153
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,416
--Give him up,
you flat-chested twit!

154
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,916
Damn I so wish I was him.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,666
--That Yukari... So hot!
--Bigger isn't always better!

156
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,833
That's interesting, cause
when I was your age mine

157
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,083
were already about this size,

158
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,125
so don't get your hopes up!

159
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,208
Oh, don't you worry, I won't,

160
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,166
cause the bigger they are,
the faster they sag!

161
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,416
You're trying to
tell me my breasts

162
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,375
are going to start sagging?

163
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,500
You brat!

164
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,083
You'd better take
that back right now!

165
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,583
I don't take orders
from you, Miss Milk Cow!

166
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,000
Guys, cut it out!

167
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,625
Shut your mouth
and let us settle this!

168
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,750
I bet you don't even
wear a bra yet, do you?

169
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,666
What difference does
that make, you slut?!

170
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,125
Why you--?!

171
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,916
Moka...

172
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,791
You idiot...!

173
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,583
Why'd you get so
close to the pool...?!

174
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,166
Getting wet like that,
it's no wonder this happened...

175
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,750
You know vampires
are weak against water.

176
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,166
In case you haven't
picked up on it,

177
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,750
water is a vampire's weakness.

178
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,250
It hurts them 'cause
of its purifying power,

179
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,125
Water reacts with a vampire's
energy and ka-pow!

180
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,833
That's why, when
Moka needs water,

181
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,875
she neutralizes it first
by adding some herbs,

182
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,458
and then uses that to wash
her face and stuff, whee!

183
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,291
This body of yours...

184
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,666
It's also my body...

185
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,583
Because I'm your other half...

186
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,250
So don't push our luck...

187
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,916
And don't let yourself get
strung along by that jerk!

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,375
Tsukune...

189
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,916
Here we go!

190
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,416
Boy, can't you see what I do

191
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,291
To get your attention
and your time

192
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,833
I don't bear these fruits 

193
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,166
For just anyone

194
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,250
They bounce and bounce for you!

195
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,375
Uh-huh!

196
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,583
I won't let go of the hope

197
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:27,500
That one day your
heart could be all mine

198
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,500
So I'll play it cool

199
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,041
Be smooth

200
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,833
I guess having a flat chest
does have some advantages, huh?

201
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:37,250
Strike a sexy pose
and wait for you to see

202
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,333
Notice me

203
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,208
Amazing!

204
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,458
Totally!

205
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:47,416
But then again it seems
you're such a shy boy

206
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,041
Scared to look my way

207
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:55,750
When I'm tryin'
to show you I care

208
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,208
Yahoo, yahoohoo!

209
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,750
Sun sun sun

210
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,125
Think of us together
under parasols

211
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,583
Lying on the beach
without a care at all

212
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,125
And I'll be, whispering

213
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,291
--I should be happy about this,
--Sweet nothings in your ear

214
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,416
but for some reason
I just wanna cry.

215
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,875
No no no

216
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,041
No one else could ever
love you more than me

217
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,500
I love you so much
that it's embarrassing

218
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,041
Don't you see

219
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,875
Look me in the eyes

220
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:23,958
--And tell me
--Yeah, alright!

221
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,875
This...

222
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,333
...sucks!

223
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,750
You don't wanna give these
melons of mine a squeeze!

224
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,416
Awesome!

225
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,125
You got that right!

226
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,666
Okay, everyone!
My turn!

227
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,125
When you look at me you
think you see a little girl

228
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,250
Treat me like I'm fragile
and you handle with care

229
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,791
Ya-hoo! I won!

230
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,500
You'd see, my heart...

231
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,083
--Stellar! You betcha!
-- has much to bear!

232
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,458
So I use my charm and try
to wave my magic wand

233
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:06,125
Aim directly for your heart
and hope you'll play along

234
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,666
So I try, and I try

235
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,083
But still, but still

236
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,625
(You) never notice me

237
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,916
Magicu magical, magicu magical

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,208
I've tried so hard to
put you under my spell

239
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,000
Why can't a miracle,
just make us...

240
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,500
Hey...!

241
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,000
Why don't you and your stupid
boobs get out of my way?!

242
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,500
Why don't you and your stupid
boobs get out of my way?!

243
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,333
--Oh, sorry, I didn't notice.
--Say that you'll be mine

244
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,833
It's time...!

245
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,375
We're gonna settle this
thing once and for all!

246
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,000
Charge!

247
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,166
--Hey!
--Ya-hoo-hoo!

248
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,041
Hey, cut it out,
that's against the rules!

249
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,291
Well, these things
are in the way!

250
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,291
Stop biting me!

251
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,333
Stop blocking me!

252
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,416
--Ouch, that hurts!
--Oh, Moka...

253
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,791
You look down in the dumps.

254
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,666
You're surrounded by sunshine,
games, and beautiful girls

255
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,416
in bikinis, is this
not what you wanted?

256
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Oh, no...
That's not it at all.

257
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,916
Then how about you
and I go for a swim...?

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,375
I don't know what's
bothering you,

259
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,958
but I'll make you forget it.

260
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,333
Who's saying "yahoo" now?!

261
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,125
Don't even think of going
back to the Swimming Club.

262
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,666
You wanna go
through all that again?

263
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,500
End your relationship
with the human...

264
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,458
He doesn't understand
a single thing about you...

265
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,625
He doesn't give any thought
to you or your needs.

266
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:51,541
That's not true...!
He's not like that, not Tsukune!

267
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,041
Even if you do go back there...

268
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,583
You won't be able to
swim with the others;

269
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,750
you know that, don't you?

270
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't care...

271
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,458
I-I just want...

272
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,833
I want to be with Tsukune!

273
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,875
Are you really this hung
up on that Moka girl?

274
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,666
Why don't you stop
worrying about her,

275
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,875
and look at me instead, huh?

276
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,166
But, Miss Ichinose--

277
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,125
Call me Tamao, would you...?

278
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,458
The truth is, I've had my
eye on you since I first

279
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,833
saw you at the opening
ceremony for new students...

280
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,916
Since then, I can't stop
thinking about you.

281
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,958
Listen, I'm so
sorry about this...

282
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,416
But I really need
to leave now...

283
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
I just have to go find Moka!

284
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,375
No so fast.

285
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,333
We have no intention
of letting people leave.

286
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,750
Huh...?
What's going on?

287
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,791
Don't think too badly of us...

288
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,666
We do lure innocent
men to the water

289
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,708
and suck their life force...

290
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,875
...but we are
Mermaids after all.

291
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,958
It's sort of our thing.

292
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,250
Quick monster fact Mermaids
are terrifying monsters

293
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,583
whose very presence
portends calamity at sea.

294
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,125
Tales of these
inauspicious creatures

295
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,708
are well known among sailors,

296
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,500
In some legends, they entice
male sea-goers with their

297
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,708
alluring looks, and then
drag them, boats and all,

298
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,791
down into the depths
of the ocean, whee!

299
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,708
B-But Tamao!

300
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,083
Didn't you hear me...?

301
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,458
I've been watching you
since you first came here...

302
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,333
I caught your scent.

303
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:34,458
You have such an irresistibly
delicious, human-like smell.

304
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,666
It's no fair hogging
him for yourself.

305
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,125
Let me have a taste.

306
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,541
I want some, too!

307
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,125
Tsukune!

308
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,583
No!

309
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,333
Back off!

310
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,000
If I were you, I'd move aside!

311
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,875
What the--?!

312
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,458
Tsukune!

313
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,041
Just hold on,
I'm coming to save you!

314
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,000
No, don't...!
Do you have a death wish?!

315
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,333
Well, well, it looks like the
rumor was true all along,

316
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,833
Little Miss Moka is a vampire.

317
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,625
Water is a major
weakness for vampires!

318
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,958
We've gotta do
something right now!

319
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,375
Moka, no!

320
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,125
I won't let you go...
Don't you get it?

321
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,291
You're all mine now.

322
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,291
No...! No!

323
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,000
Hurry! Now's your
chance, Tsukune!

324
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,916
Moka...
You came back for me...

325
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,083
You knew it would hurt you...

326
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,541
...but you still jumped
in the water...

327
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,583
When the rosary seal over
her breast is removed...

328
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,166
Moka's innocent self vanishes...

329
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,750
...and her inner
vampire awakens!

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,833
Now listen...

331
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,916
You've been nothing
but a giant pain in my ass.

332
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,625
She's so powerful...

333
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,583
I never expected this...

334
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,458
...but she's still, a vampire...

335
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:06,250
Drink this!

336
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,541
Drink it... drink
it... drink it--!

337
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,125
Drink it yourselves,
you bitches!

338
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,750
Heh...
Take that!

339
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,250
Look, I don't need your help.

340
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,500
Come on, we're helping you
'cause you're weak in water,

341
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,125
so swallow your pride
and deal with it.

342
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,583
You look awful...

343
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,958
You're sparking like crazy,
and I imagine you're in

344
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,875
quite a bit of
pain right now...

345
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,666
Stop pretending it doesn't hurt,
and admit you've lost.

346
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,625
Don't flatter yourself;
a pathetic minnow like you...?

347
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,833
I could beat you in my sleep.

348
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:38,916
Minnow...?
You'll pay for that!

349
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,833
Vampires are weak in water.

350
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,333
But for a Mermaid like me,

351
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,291
being in the water is
home territory...

352
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,041
No way in hell you have
a chance of winning here!

353
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,875
Oh, you think so?

354
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,333
Too slow!

355
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,166
I can't believe you
took the bait like that...

356
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,208
That's just like a fish!

357
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,125
Die!

358
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:02,583
...know your place!

359
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,666
Aww...
damn it...

360
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,541
How could she
defeat me so easily?

361
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,291
This episode's big
fight took a mere

362
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,875
eighty-five seconds
to complete, whee!

363
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,625
Well, she shoulda' known...
If a mermaid's in midair,

364
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,750
that's not exactly
home territory, is it?

365
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,291
Stupid fish.

366
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,791
Are you okay?

367
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,875
Even with all her vampire
strength unleashed...

368
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,875
The water's still making
Moka really weak...

369
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,458
Huh?

370
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,791
You listen to me...

371
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,708
You don't understand a
single thing about her,

372
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,458
so don't pretend like you do...

373
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,833
You're a little boy who can't
think of anyone but himself...

374
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,500
Consider her feelings sometime.

375
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,416
She was crying her eyes out.

376
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,875
As it turns out...

377
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,666
I was the one who
didn't understand.

378
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:22,791
You see...

379
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,125
Unlike Vampires...

380
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,541
Mermaids thrive in the water,

381
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,791
which makes them
very dangerous...

382
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,583
The next day...
Moka didn't show up to class.

383
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,166
They're scary...

384
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,500
Now if their favorite food was
fish, and not the souls of men,

385
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,416
it might be a different story.

386
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,250
Moka, I'm sorry!

387
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,791
I was wrong.

388
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,333
Well if you really
wanna be in it,

389
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,291
then let's just join
the Swimming Club...

390
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,833
I won't be able to
swim, of course,

391
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,333
but at least I can
cheer you on!

392
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,375
You can't...!

393
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,458
What if you got water on you?

394
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,750
Listen...

395
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,250
I just don't want you
to put yourself in any

396
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,583
kind of danger for
my sake, okay?

397
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,541
No, I'm fine, really...

398
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,041
Don't worry about me.

399
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,125
Well there's no way that we're
joining the swimming club.

400
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,625
But there's no need to do--

401
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:28,416
Well, in that case, what do you
say to the Newspaper Club?

402
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,625
Newspaper Club?

403
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,916
Yep... See,
I'm the faculty advisor.

404
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,041
Sounds like a perfect fit to me.

405
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,083
I finally got someone
to sign up!

406
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,375
You two hold on, you're not
joining that club without me!

407
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,708
Yeah, yeah,
I wanna be in it, too!

408
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,875
Woo...!
That makes four...!

409
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,541
This is totally awesome!

410
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,750
We're in the
same club after all...

411
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,208
Yeah!

412
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,458
♪ closing song ♪

413
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:39,833
Oh, no!

414
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,958
Tsukune's been accused
of being a peeping tom!

415
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,208
What?!

416
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,791
Well, I wouldn't mind it
if he was peeping at me.

417
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:45,583
What?!

418
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:46,916
In that case...

419
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,916
We've gotta go prove his
innocence; come on girls!

420
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,916
Next time...

421
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,166
"Newspaper Club
and a Vampire"...

422
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,833
...and another!
