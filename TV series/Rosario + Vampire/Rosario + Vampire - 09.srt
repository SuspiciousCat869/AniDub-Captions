1
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,666
Hey, you!

2
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,750
Oh, hi!
You're here...

3
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,083
Moka.

4
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,708
Tsukune!
You're early!

5
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:46,708
We weren't supposed to
meet for another half-hour!

6
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,375
Oh, wow.

7
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:52,708
Moka looks incredible in
that outfit she's got on today!

8
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,500
I must look kinda weird, huh?

9
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,291
No way, you look amazing!

10
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,458
You think so?

11
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,416
Yes I totally do!

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,083
I'm so glad.

13
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,583
I can't believe our summer
break finally starts today!

14
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,166
I'm looking forward to it!
It should be fun.

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,625
Yeah!

16
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,166
"Looking forward to it?"

17
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,958
More like, I was totally
surprised by it.

18
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,875
I mean, I never thought we'd
end up doing anything like this.

19
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,291
A club trip?!

20
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,666
That's right!

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,208
And I've decided that for
this year's summer trip,

22
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,250
the Newspaper Club is gonna
go to the human world.

23
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,458
Are you positive
this is a good idea?

24
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,875
Of course, it'll be fine
as long as I'm with you...

25
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:36,958
I'm hoping.

26
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,375
Ha!
So you're not sure?!

27
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,375
Moka and me.
Going to the human world.

28
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,166
It all happened so suddenly.

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,708
I just don't know if I should
be happy about this or not.

30
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,458
You know, I'm a bit nervous.

31
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,083
I told you.

32
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,833
About how I lived
in the human world

33
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,416
up through junior high school?

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,958
And how I hated
humans the entire time?

35
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,708
Yeah, that's right. Are you
concerned about going...?

36
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,125
A little.

37
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,458
To be honest, I think
I'm still worried about it.

38
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,708
I'm really afraid of
what might happen.

39
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,541
Uh, but I'm
totally fine with it,

40
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,958
as long as I'm
with you, Tsukune!

41
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,583
I'm looking forward to
it a whole lot more

42
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,833
than I'm worried
about it, truthfully!

43
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,125
Oh, Moka.

44
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,291
I'm not worried,
you'll protect me.

45
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,833
Won't you?

46
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,250
Moka.

47
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,708
Tsukune.

48
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,666
Hey, come on... hurry up!

49
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,541
Hold on, you guys, wait for me!

50
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,541
Whadda you two
think you're doing, huh?

51
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, look who decided
to come a bit prematurely.

52
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,250
Can't leave them alone, eh?

53
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,791
Hey, guys!

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,833
This is the Newspaper
Club's first trip

55
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,208
to the human world, right?

56
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,458
So let's all be happy
and have a great time!

57
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,541
Yeah!

58
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,333
Hey, guys.
Isn't Gin coming?

59
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,583
Apparently he flunked
a few subjects so.

60
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,750
He has to do make up classes.

61
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,458
Shit!
Sorry, guys!

62
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,750
I'll come as soon as I can!

63
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,416
Please.
Like you're one to talk,

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,666
you didn't exactly pass
with flying colors.

65
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,416
Oh, you don't need
to worry 'bout me!

66
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,750
I managed to finish all
my make-up classes!

67
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,500
More like managed
to skip them...

68
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,041
I bet.

69
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:35,541
Maybe...
Ya-hoo-hoo!

70
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,250
The "human world."
We're almost there.

71
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,958
Wow. I'm...

72
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,833
I'm back home!

73
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,208
You sure seem excited.

74
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,416
Yeah... no kidding.

75
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,375
What's that all about, huh?
You sound like a human.

76
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,125
You know why?!

77
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,458
It's because he lived in
the human world for so long.

78
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,791
Yeah right?

79
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,166
Right?

80
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,750
Yeah, I suppose I feel
sorta attached or something.

81
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,958
Well...

82
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,625
I guess that type
of thing can happen.

83
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,333
Tsukune! Here!

84
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,250
So what?

85
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,875
You're not afraid
of the human world?

86
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,875
No, not at all.

87
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,625
Yokai Academy's
way scarier, that's for sure!

88
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,583
Wow! Tsukune,
you're incredible!

89
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,375
You really think so?

90
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,833
I sure do!

91
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,125
Whoa!
Moka, are you okay?

92
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,666
Oh, yeah!

93
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,416
I just got a massive pile of
sand up my swimsuit, that's all.

94
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,833
Oops.
My bad.

95
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,416
So, your just comfortable here.

96
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,083
Glad that's all it was.

97
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,541
Cause I was getting worried you
might be a human or something.

98
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,125
Hmph.

99
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,041
Oh, c'mon, that's just a
buncha crazy talk, Kurumu.

100
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,458
Yeah I know.

101
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,916
Hey!

102
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,666
Hey!

103
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,833
Let's get off this boring topic
and just have some fun, okay?

104
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,208
I mean, it is summer
break, after all.

105
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:19,833
So whaddaya say?

106
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,041
Yeah, I completely
agree with Moka.

107
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,666
Well you do have a point there!

108
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,541
Hey!

109
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,666
Kurumu, stop stealing my balls!

110
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,083
--I'm sorry.
--That was supposed to be

111
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,416
for me, you top heavy twit!

112
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,666
You're so tiny
I didn't see you there.

113
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,291
That's enough, this means war!

114
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,000
Hey!

115
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,333
Oh, please.

116
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,708
You don't really think
I'm scared of you, do you?

117
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,833
If you want some.
Bring it!

118
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,208
Nice toss, Tsukune!
I'll get this one no problem!

119
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:54,875
Here you go!

120
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,000
I got it!
Try this on for size!

121
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,541
Yukari, no!

122
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:09,166
You know you're not supposed
to use magic in the human world,

123
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,625
Oops, I guess
I got carried away.

124
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,125
Uh. Can I help
you with something?

125
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,166
Yum.

126
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,375
Those fish are raw.

127
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,291
Meow.

128
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,791
To be completely honest,
I like 'em better that way.

129
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:35,083
The ocean.
It's so beautiful, huh?

130
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,500
Yeah...

131
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:45,208
Oh, yeah!

132
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,750
Tsukune!

133
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,416
Tsukune, c'mon!

134
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,875
Yeah!

135
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,208
Stop sitting around on the
beach and get in the water!

136
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,791
Whaddaya say?

137
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,291
You feel up for a swim?

138
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,958
Sorry.
But I can't.

139
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,166
I'm the one who should
be apologizing here.

140
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,958
I already knew vampires
couldn't go in the water.

141
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,500
But I--

142
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,250
If you wanna know more about
this, go watch Episode 5, whee!

143
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,875
Go on without me, Tsukune.

144
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,500
But no... I can't just...

145
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,291
Go.

146
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,291
It's fine.

147
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,583
Hurry up,
they're waiting for you.

148
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,666
No way!

149
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,291
Look, if this is
where you're gonna be.

150
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,250
I'm not going anywhere.

151
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,458
No, please,
don't worry about me at all.

152
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,791
I mean, we've come all
the way here to the beach.

153
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,541
You should have as
much fun as you can.

154
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,375
I can't have any fun
if you're not with me!

155
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,125
Tsukune...

156
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,625
Do you really mean that?

157
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,375
Hold it right there!

158
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,208
Moka!
I saw that just now!

159
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,125
You were trying to
suck Tsukune's blood!

160
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,791
You totally were!

161
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,250
Eh?

162
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,833
But Moka...!

163
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,208
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,625
Tsukune smells so delicious,
I can't help myself!

165
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,500
Hey, this is no laughing matter!

166
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,666
What do you suggest we do

167
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,416
if Tsukune collapses
or faints, huh?

168
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,416
If that happened, I'd nurse
him back to health myself!

169
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,083
No. I'd save you.

170
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,750
Oh! Don't be silly, it
would obviously be me!

171
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,166
H-Hey, c-c'mon, you guys...

172
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,833
He's mine!

173
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,166
Just butt out!

174
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,875
Well uh...

175
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,125
I'd help too!

176
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,916
No, you'd be the cause
of it, you big dummy!

177
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,458
Right.

178
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,958
Hey, what are those?
Up there.

179
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:05,833
Wow. Look at all
these sunflowers!

180
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,958
Maybe it's for tourists?

181
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,083
But there's nobody else here.

182
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,958
Yeah, you're right.

183
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,583
But this place is so beautiful.
I wonder why?

184
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,583
Hold on.

185
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,166
Oh no. How did
we end up over here?

186
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,208
We should leave.

187
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,291
Hey, come on,
what's the big rush?

188
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,250
Wait a sec, you haven't heard
about this place, have you?!

189
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,791
Listen. If I'm right,

190
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,541
this is the same hill people
keep disappearing from.

191
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,666
No way!
For real?

192
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,791
That's why I'm totally
freaked out here!

193
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,375
From what I heard,
all the locals say

194
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,500
this place is
cursed by a witch.

195
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,416
Apparently she got mad about
plans to develop this hill.

196
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,708
So she started abducting
people left and right.

197
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,666
You're joking, right--?

198
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,541
Hurry up, let's go!

199
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,583
Everybody around here
calls this place Witch Hill.

200
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,708
They say it's because the
witch has lived here forever.

201
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,500
Really? How come you
know so much about it?

202
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,125
You read it on some website?

203
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,875
Around here, everyone
knows about that story...

204
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,041
Hear that?

205
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,541
Apparently your relatives go
around abducting people.

206
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,250
And apparently you believe
everything you hear.

207
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,833
I guess you're every
bit as dim-witted

208
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,750
as I thought you were, huh?

209
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,875
Well I know this:

210
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,291
witches get on my nerves.

211
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,375
And I know I don't
like succubuses

212
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,708
whose only redeeming
feature is being a sexpot!

213
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,250
And what would a kid
like you know about that.

214
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,125
You jerk!
What the hell was that for?!

215
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,250
I just dropped a
washtub, that's all.

216
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,916
You know that wasn't
what I asked you!

217
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:41,958
--Come on, guys!
--You brat!

218
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,291
I swear, why can't
you two learn

219
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,208
to be civil with
each other, huh?

220
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:45,958
So annoying.

221
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,125
C'mon, let's head back.

222
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,000
Miss Nekonome's
probably worried.

223
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,458
That girl...

224
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,583
There's no doubt.

225
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,541
I must hurry back
home and report

226
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,916
this to Her Ladyship
right away.

227
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,708
Hey, you guys!

228
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,916
I'll leave the rest
to you, okay?

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,833
Your teacher is gonna go out
and procure some food for us.

230
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,958
But we've got plenty
of food to eat right here.

231
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,166
No, no, no.

232
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,875
Since we came all the
way to the ocean,

233
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,875
we should have fresh
fish, don't you think?

234
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,791
Oh the fish they get
in the human world

235
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,083
is just the best, isn't it?!

236
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,666
Miss Nekonome.

237
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,208
Is that the reason you wanted to
take a trip to the human world?

238
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,333
Uh, I'll be right back, okay?

239
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,125
Meow, meow, meow!

240
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,291
Miss Nekonome, your tail!

241
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,333
Meow, meow, meow.

242
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,291
Yes.
Your Ladyship!

243
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,333
I understand perfectly.

244
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,250
And as for that little witch.

245
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,333
Leave her to me.
She'll join us or else.

246
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,791
No. Not like that,
it's all wrong.

247
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:10,791
Aww.

248
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,375
Now it looks
all weird and stuff.

249
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, well, it's too late now.

250
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,791
Hey, do you want me
to help you carry that?

251
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,208
No, thanks.

252
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,083
I think it might be a bit
too heavy for you, Yukari.

253
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,958
I can take care of it.

254
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,666
Let me give you a hand.

255
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,833
Oh.

256
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,125
Thanks you really
didn't have to do that

257
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,791
I could have gotten it.

258
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,500
Hey, Moka, I can
help you cut those up.

259
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,583
Oh, that's nice.
But I think I'm all right.

260
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,125
I wouldn't want you
cutting your fingers

261
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,833
on the knife or
anything like that.

262
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,625
Why don't you sit over
there and watch instead?

263
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,541
'Kay.

264
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,541
Uh hey!

265
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,166
No, you'll just get in my way.

266
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,958
Those guys.

267
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,416
It's not fair, they
keep treating

268
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,708
me like I'm a little kid.

269
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,916
But I'm not a kid anymore,

270
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,916
I'm big enough to do
plenty of things myself.

271
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,708
Witch Hill, huh?

272
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,458
What if a witch
really lives here?

273
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,333
Maybe she's like me?

274
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:42,166
Don't look so terrified of me,
my little witch friend...

275
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,666
Hi... I'm Rubi.

276
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,416
I'm a witch who
lives on this hill.

277
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,791
A witch?

278
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:48,875
Right.

279
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,250
We're the same,
you and I Yukari.

280
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,541
How do you know my name?

281
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,583
You came up this afternoon.

282
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,708
I've been watching
you ever since then.

283
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,625
Never once did I imagine
I'd run into another witch.

284
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,833
It's great.

285
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,708
I wanna ask you something.

286
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,083
You see...

287
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,291
I think I would really like
to become your friend...

288
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,958
...if you want?

289
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,000
You...

290
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,666
...you'd be my friend?

291
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,666
So we can then, right?

292
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,416
Thank you!

293
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,166
Rubi, you...

294
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,000
You and I are both witches.

295
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,708
So we should be best friends!

296
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,041
My new friend!

297
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,583
Meow.

298
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,375
There's just no
substitute for the fish

299
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,666
you get in the human world...

300
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,208
Miss, your tail!

301
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,125
U-Uh look, you guys,
it's not what you think!

302
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,958
I promise I was
just gonna count 'em.

303
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,500
It's the truth!

304
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,125
Hey.
Where'd Yukari go?

305
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,208
It's so pretty, huh?

306
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,958
It's really such a beautiful
hillside, it's a shame those

307
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,750
humans have been trying to
tear it down for years.

308
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,375
Yeah, that's right,
I heard something

309
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,916
about a development project.

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,416
Yes.

311
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,458
And that's exactly why I'm
going to wipe out the humans.

312
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,916
So will you help me out?
I need you.

313
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,333
But, It's just...
I don't...

314
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,916
Don't worry. All of the
plans are already in place.

315
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,958
All we have to do is
carry out Her Ladyship's

316
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,708
orders and everything'll
work out just fine.

317
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,166
"Her Ladyship?"

318
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,625
Yes.
I'll show you.

319
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,083
C'mon!

320
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,166
The three of us'll live
together on Witch Hill.

321
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,750
It'll be great!
Come!

322
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,750
But... I...

323
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,208
Hey!

324
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,375
Oh Yukari, there you are!

325
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,666
I'm glad I found you, when
you disappeared on us,

326
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,291
we all got really worried.

327
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,833
I'm sorry!

328
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,666
Hey, who's your friend?

329
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,958
Oh...
This is my--

330
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,708
So you still come
to try and defile

331
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,458
our lovely hillside
Human scum?!

332
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,625
Rubi!

333
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,083
What the...?!

334
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,708
Quick monster fact these guys
are a type of plant monster

335
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,833
that will attack humans or
animals and devour them, Whee!

336
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,208
You've got it all wrong...!
Tsukune's not what you think!

337
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,500
He didn't come here
to defile your hillside!

338
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,125
Just stay out of my way, Yukari!

339
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,666
No! Please!
Don't do this, he's my friend!

340
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,625
Now devour him!

341
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,541
No Yukari!
Don't interfere!

342
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,083
I don't have any other choice!

343
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,208
Why not?!

344
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,583
'Cause I won't let
you hurt my friend!

345
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,583
I don't understand,
he's not even a witch!

346
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,750
So what?!

347
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,291
Tsukune's still a
close friend of mine!

348
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,416
And that's why I'm not gonna let
you touch him, you hear me?!

349
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,750
Thank you, Yukari.

350
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,625
Close friend?

351
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,333
That can't be.

352
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,666
I don't understand.

353
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,541
Nothing in this world could
possibly be stronger

354
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,250
than the bonds of kinship
between witches.

355
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,958
If there is
something stronger...

356
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,875
Then I will destroy it!

357
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,875
Please, stop!

358
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,208
I bet that's it.

359
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,916
The stories of all the people
who disappeared here.

360
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,791
They were all...

361
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:32,083
I can't. I can't hold
on too much longer!

362
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,125
What would a kid like you know?

363
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,875
I can do things, too!
Just watch!

364
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,541
Cause I'm not a
little kid anymore!

365
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,208
Yukari, no!

366
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,625
Some showdown, huh?

367
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,625
Everyone's favorite
vampire Moka

368
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,541
didn't even transform
this time, whee!

369
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,750
Oh, wow, what are those things?!

370
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,125
Monsters!

371
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,208
And it looks like
Yukari took them out!

372
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,083
Yukari!

373
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,541
Are you all right?
Don't die on us!

374
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,250
Don't worry.
Please.

375
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,291
I'm just a little tired.

376
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,291
Idiot!

377
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,125
Why did you fight
them all alone?

378
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,791
But Kurumu...!

379
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,250
We can chew her out later.

380
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,750
For right now, we should
get her back to the tent.

381
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,208
Get on.

382
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,000
Hey Rubi.

383
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,750
Listen.

384
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,750
I've decided that I
can't stay here with you...

385
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,041
You see.

386
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,708
I have friends
that I care about.

387
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,166
I'm sorry.

388
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,166
Come on.

389
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,416
Stop playing tough and let me
carry you down on my back!

390
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,125
No, I can walk.

391
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,916
We witches are extremely good at
healing ourselves, you know.

392
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,666
I swear you're just too
proud to ask for help.

393
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,458
Yeah, and you're too proud
to say how you feel.

394
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,583
Guess that's it.
Yukari seems fine now, huh?

395
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,375
Yeah. I'm really
glad everyone's okay.

396
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,291
You went out looking for Yukari,
but then you didn't come back,

397
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,833
either, so I got really worried

398
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,000
that something might've
happened to you.

399
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,458
I just...

400
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,041
Moka.

401
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,500
Tsukune.

402
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:48,375
We're finally alone now.
For the first time.

403
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,625
Oh, Tsukune...

404
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:11,166
I will bring Yukari home with
me, no matter what it takes!

405
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,916
'Cause it's my wish!

406
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,958
And also because
Her Ladyship demands it!

407
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
Tsukune?

408
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,833
Please, no!

409
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,750
Noooooooo!

410
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,708
Rubi, no!
What have you done?!

411
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,083
How dare you!

412
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:04,541
♪ closing song ♪ 

413
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,500
Here, you guys, I made a bunch
of snow cones for everyone.

414
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,500
Ooo!

415
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:43,875
Man, it's giving
me brain freeze!

416
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:44,625
Eee!

417
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:45,791
Eee!!

418
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:46,958
Eee!!! There's no time
for brain freeze;

419
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,916
we're in even more
trouble next episode!

420
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,666
Next time: "Sunflowers and
a Vampire" and another...
