1
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,958
The start of the second term...

2
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:26,250
I dunno if I'm more happy or
more nervous right now.

3
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,125
I'm having really
mixed feelings about it.

4
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,291
Tell me something.

5
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,666
Huh?

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,000
When we traveled
to the human world...

7
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,208
...well uh...

8
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,041
You never once
went to visit your parents.

9
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,708
Was that okay?

10
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,125
Hello?
Aono residence.

11
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,125
Hey, Mom.

12
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,791
Oh, hi, sweetie!

13
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,041
You're on summer
break now, right?

14
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,875
So when are you coming home?

15
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,750
That's what I'm calling about.

16
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,083
Oh?

17
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm actually already back
in town, but I didn't

18
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,291
have time to drop by the
house on this trip.

19
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,791
Well, I guess I can
forgive you as long

20
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,583
as I know that
you're doing okay.

21
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,583
Uh-huh, don't worry,
I'm going great.

22
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,500
I made tons of
friends at school,

23
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,833
plus I joined the
Newspaper Club.

24
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,791
We work together on
the school paper

25
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,458
and have a lot of
fun making it.

26
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,375
I'm having a total blast, Mom.

27
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,625
Tsukune, what are
you spacing out about?

28
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,541
Oh, um.
It's nothing.

29
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,000
Alright, if you say so.

30
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,375
Seeing you,
I can't help myself...

31
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:05,708
--Wait, not again?!
--I'm sorry, Tsukune!

32
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,541
One day, Moka and
I'll be done here.

33
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,041
We'll graduate from this school
and hopefully in one piece...

34
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,000
And when that happens,
I'm guessing we'll

35
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,083
each both go our
own separate ways.

36
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,375
Me to the human world and
her to the monster world.

37
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:30,166
That's why I've decided from
now on, I'm just gonna have

38
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,833
fun while I'm here and not
worry about the future!

39
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,208
♪ opening song  ♪

40
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,583
Our first edition of the
Yokai Gazette since

41
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,875
summer break ended is
shaping up nicely, huh?!

42
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,583
It sure is!

43
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,583
I think the real highlight
is the feature article

44
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,791
on the latest fashions
in the human world.

45
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,333
The girls on campus
will love it!

46
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,666
Uh-huh, of course they will,
and that's because I wrote it!

47
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,125
Can I see that?

48
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:40,250
A dark tan and loose socks?

49
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,250
I see...

50
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,708
...nice job on the
article, Kurumu.

51
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,041
Ya-hoo-hoo!

52
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,166
Those went out of style
over ten years ago, whee!

53
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,500
Wow, guys.

54
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,958
Look at all the
content we have...

55
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,458
I'm really impressed
with this latest issue!

56
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,916
Yeah!

57
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,708
So am I.
Hey, Tsukune.

58
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,000
Uh...

59
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,041
Hi Mizore?!

60
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,041
C'mon, at this point, we know
each other well enough, Tsukune.

61
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,625
So from now on,
why don't you just

62
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,583
refer to me as "your
little snow bunny?"

63
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,583
Uh...
Huh?!

64
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,833
If you're done, we still have
tons of copies to print up,

65
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,625
so let's get moving, you guys!

66
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,208
Wow you're really
worked up about this.

67
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,541
Of course I am!

68
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,666
It's because...

69
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,125
It was put together
by me and Tsukune!

70
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,166
Right?

71
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,250
Now that's not
quite true, Kurumu!

72
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,625
You know it was a group effort!

73
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,125
No kidding!

74
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,458
You know.

75
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,708
At first I thought you
guys were just a clique,

76
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,916
and a weird one at
that, but then...

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,791
Then what?

78
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:44,625
Then I thought this
Newspaper Club wasn't half bad.

79
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,708
Alright, guys, we've still
got a little time before

80
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,833
class starts so let's
hand these out!

81
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:49,833
Yeah!

82
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,291
You betcha!

83
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,666
Square!
Get your copy here!

84
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,041
It's the debut issue
of Yokai Square, folks!

85
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,291
It's super-exciting,

86
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,666
and filled with lots of
informative articles!

87
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,875
And our first issue

88
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,208
has a special feature
on the human world!

89
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,041
Awesome;

90
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,208
it's printed in color, too!

91
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,666
Yeah... And it's
got swimsuit photos!

92
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,125
Cool, the latest fashions
from the human world!

93
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,125
So tulip-heart patterns
and bell-bottoms

94
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,916
are all the rage, huh?

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,041
Just what the hell
are they all reading?!

96
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,916
It looked like it
said Yokai Square.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,625
Hey what's the big idea?!

98
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,250
Who gave you guys permission
to start handing out newspapers?

99
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,125
Huh?

100
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,541
What do you mean "permission?"

101
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,125
And this rag! This Yokai
Square or whatever it is...

102
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,416
It's not even a legitimate
paper, unlike the

103
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,000
Yokai Gazette put out
by the Newspaper Club.

104
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:33,958
Yes, it is.

105
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,416
Huh?

106
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,583
Who are you?!

107
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,208
Me?
I'm Keito.

108
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,041
The Super Newspaper
Club President.

109
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,083
Uh?
What the hell's that?!

110
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,458
There's already
a Newspaper Club...

111
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,125
We've gotten permission
from the school,

112
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,458
and we're an officially
recognized club.

113
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,041
I don't understand.

114
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,166
Well, your little newspaper
was just so unbelievably boring.

115
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,375
So we decided to create
our own newspaper

116
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,708
one that'll make everyone
forget about you.

117
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,541
Like hell it will, big mouth!

118
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,583
Come on, calm down, Kurumu.

119
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,500
If you don't believe me, then
try competing against us, 'Kay?

120
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,208
That's what we'll do!

121
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,791
Come on, we can't
let 'em beat us!

122
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:13,958
I agree!

123
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,333
We've got our latest
and greatest issue,

124
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,250
so let's start handing it out!

125
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,541
The new issue of The Yokai
Gazette's hot off the presses!

126
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,875
Check it out, it's got a big
feature on the human world!

127
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,083
It's got the latest
in human fashions!

128
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,916
If you don't read it...

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,166
I'll freeze you solid.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,958
This one's got a story
on the human world, too?

131
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,583
It's got a been-there, done-that
feel to it, don't you think?

132
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,958
There aren't
any swimsuit photos!

133
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,375
It's just a bunch
of tired old articles.

134
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,083
How lame.

135
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,083
All that work...
down the drain.

136
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,958
But it's not our fault;
we never thought

137
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,333
that we'd have a rival
to contend with.

138
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,458
What the hell is this
"Super Newspaper Club" ?!

139
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,125
Meow I'm sorry!

140
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,541
I only learned about
those guys myself yesterday.

141
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,666
Still, how did they manage
to get approval?

142
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,083
Will the school really allow

143
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,833
two different Newspaper
Clubs to exist?

144
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,958
No, they won't...

145
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,416
Huh?

146
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,958
You see.

147
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,291
It turns out the plan is to keep
the club that's most popular,

148
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,416
and scrap the one that's not.

149
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,625
What?!
No way!

150
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,583
But you can't be serious!

151
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,875
Then fine, bring it on.

152
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,125
What do you mean?

153
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,583
It's between us in
the Newspaper Club

154
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,375
and those upstarts in the
Super Newspaper Club.

155
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,875
This is about who's
more popular,

156
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,833
so let's show those
jerks who's number one!

157
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,583
Wait, just hold on a second!

158
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,708
He's right; we've gotta talk to
Gin before we can do anything!

159
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,500
He is our club
president, after all!

160
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,500
Who gives a crap
what that perv thinks?!

161
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,041
I bet you anything
that he's off with a

162
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,000
camera right now peeping
on girls again!

163
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,833
She sure nailed that one, whee!

164
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,291
Whoa!

165
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,500
Aw, man.
That was just cold.

166
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,416
What a bummer.

167
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,791
It's them.

168
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,333
Whoa, dude!

169
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,166
Who are these babes?!

170
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,083
We're Yokai Academy's...

171
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,500
...Newspaper Club!

172
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,750
Ya-hoo-hoo-!

173
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,166
And you never want
to miss out on a

174
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,041
single exciting issue
of our Yokai Gazette!

175
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,583
Do you, gentlemen.

176
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,041
Um, hey, Kurumu...

177
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,875
I feel incredibly embarrassed
wearing this outfit.

178
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,416
Hang in there.

179
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,250
We've gotta wear 'em so that we
can win over these droolers,

180
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,666
I mean readers,
so just grin and bear it

181
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,833
for the sake of the club, 'kay?

182
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,958
'Kay, I'll do it, but still...

183
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,083
Plus if any of you gentlemen
are kind enough to subscribe

184
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,708
to the Yokai Gazette well
then you'll receive...

185
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,166
...homemade cookies
from yours truly!

186
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,041
Gimme, gimme!

187
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,916
Hot maid outfits and cookies?!

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,958
So tell us, guys, which
campus newspaper

189
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,666
do you think is the
most interesting?

190
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,750
The Yokai Gazette, of course!

191
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,791
Yay, we so won!

192
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,625
Come get your Yokai Square!

193
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,666
If you subscribe right
now, you'll get these

194
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,000
exclusive and oh-so-sexy
snapshots of us!

195
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,166
They're free for subscribers!

196
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,375
Just don't use 'em for any...

197
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,958
...funny purposes, okay?

198
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,958
They're in bikinis!

199
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,708
And smokin' hot!
Oh, man, where do I sign up?!

200
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,125
I wanna subscribe!

201
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,250
What the...?

202
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,125
Can they even do that?

203
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,291
Regardless if they can

204
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,666
or can't wear revealing
outfits, they are.

205
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,666
But you guys are sexy too.

206
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,625
It's sad you don't
see this, whee!

207
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,916
Well, let's hear it, guys:
which campus newspaper

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,875
do you think is the
most interesting?

209
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,000
The Yokai Square, of course!

210
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,250
We can't let 'em get
away with this, Yukari!

211
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,000
We need some sexier outfits!

212
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,541
You're so cute!

213
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,833
I'd take you any day over those
buxom, nubile bikini girls,

214
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,875
'cause a sweet, little
flat-chested girl like you

215
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,125
is what makes me feel
all tingly inside!

216
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,500
--No, get away from me!
--Hey! Yukari, no hold on!

217
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,958
Wait!

218
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,791
We've almost beaten them.

219
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,833
That guy was so creepy!

220
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,125
It's okay, Yukari, don't cry.

221
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,625
Now let's get back
to passing out papers.

222
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,708
Huh?

223
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,750
You mean we're
still gonna keep at it?

224
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,916
Yeah, of course we are!

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,250
We can't let those
broads beat us!

226
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,916
We'll be in skimpy bikinis, too.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,291
But ours will be even
skimpier than theirs!

228
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,875
I'd like to see that, but no.

229
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,125
I'm sorry, but we didn't
feel good about this,

230
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,791
so we spoke to Gin.

231
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,166
He's club captain.

232
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,041
This is one we're
gonna hafta lose.

233
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,791
Nothing good can come
from taking these guys on.

234
00:11:58,875 --> 00:11:59,750
Are you nuts?!

235
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,250
Those talentless twits?!

236
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,625
All they do is wear skimpy
bikinis and flaunt themselves!

237
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,583
You were gonna do the
exact same thing,

238
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,916
so isn't that the pot
calling the kettle black?

239
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,416
Owie-owie-owie-owie-ow!

240
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,625
I'm more worried about
who's behind them.

241
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,083
And that would be
The Security Committee.

242
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,458
The Security...

243
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,541
...Committee, huh?

244
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,416
Who or what is that?

245
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,208
Well, in a nutshell,
they're basically

246
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,875
a more violent version of
a disciplinary committee.

247
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,791
They're all about fighting first
and asking questions later.

248
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,791
They claim that they're just
"keeping the peace" and

249
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,041
"taking the bad guys
down" on campus.

250
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,208
Student police would be
a better name for them.

251
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,541
But if those guys
are student police.

252
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,583
Then why...?

253
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,166
But we haven't done
anything wrong.

254
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,708
So why us, Gin?

255
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,625
'Cause of the same thing
that always happens;

256
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,708
as soon as they got a taste
of power, the so-called

257
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:58,041
Security Committee started
getting more and more corrupt.

258
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,375
The Committee's
just a sham now,

259
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,625
and they use force to
get whatever they want.

260
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,916
They're nothing but
of buncha thugs

261
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,583
extorting cash from
other students.

262
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,458
It's hard to believe a
group as criminal as

263
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,958
that would be allowed
to exist on campus.

264
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,916
As for why they're targeting us,
the Yokai Gazette is becoming

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,708
more and more popular,
so I'm guessing our

266
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,208
little paper became has
thorn in their side.

267
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,791
Wait just a second!

268
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,291
If there's a gang like that at
this school, then isn't it our

269
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,208
duty as the Newspaper Club to
expose what they're doing?!

270
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,583
Yeah, you hit the nail
right on the head, Tsukune!

271
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,750
Exactly!
That's it!

272
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,500
All we need to do is
keep hammering away

273
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,750
at them with article
after article!

274
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,250
Gin, what is it?

275
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,416
We're not gonna debate
this nonsense anymore!

276
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,375
All these newspapers are
going in the incinerator,

277
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,666
and that's the end of it.

278
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,125
Got it?

279
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,333
No wait!

280
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,291
But Gin we worked so hard on it.

281
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,666
You heard what I said.

282
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,750
But it doesn't make any sense!

283
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,875
Do what I told you.

284
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,333
That's an official
club decision.

285
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,541
Is that all of them?

286
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,333
There's still a few more
boxes inside, I'll go get them.

287
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,833
Need any help, Moka?

288
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,583
Don't worry, Tsukune,
I'll give her a hand.

289
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,833
This sucks because we
worked really hard on these.

290
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,208
Now Mizore's gone off pouting to
who knows where and as far as

291
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,375
the Newspaper Club goes,
what's gonna happen to us?

292
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,458
Hey, Tsukune?

293
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,083
Yeah?

294
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,166
Let's just take these papers and
go hand them out right now.

295
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,500
You heard what Gin said.

296
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,208
He's club president
so we just can't--

297
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,666
Who cares?

298
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,666
Kurumu?

299
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,500
These newspapers.

300
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,916
You don't realize how precious
they are to me, Tsukune.

301
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,833
It's because I made
them with you.

302
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,208
They're something that
you and I created together.

303
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,166
So then...

304
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,583
...the thought of having
to burn what we created...

305
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,750
...it's just too much!

306
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,208
I can't do it!

307
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,291
Kurumu...

308
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,291
Oh, Mistress!

309
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,750
These two are still
planning on handing out

310
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,666
their crappy newspaper
to everyone!

311
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,958
Unleash your divine
wrath upon them!

312
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:24,958
It's You guys again!

313
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,666
Who's this "Mistress?!"

314
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,083
Hah! These papers
weigh so little,

315
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,875
I guess they really
are light on content!

316
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,250
Good job, girls; thanks for
keeping an eye on them.

317
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,958
We live to serve you, Mistress!

318
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:40,958
What the hell!

319
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,041
Why'd you have
them watching us?!

320
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,750
Yes, please tell us, and why
are you trying to run our

321
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,666
Newspaper Club into the ground.

322
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,208
You two are full of questions.

323
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, I guess Ginei Morioka

324
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,791
hasn't told you
about it, has he?

325
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,708
Told us about what?

326
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,125
It doesn't matter.

327
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,083
From this moment forward,
your little club

328
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,416
and its paper are done.

329
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,458
No, they're not!

330
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,166
Those are our papers.

331
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,000
Give them back right now!

332
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,833
What did you just say?

333
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,375
Who exactly do you think you're
talking to here, you peon?

334
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
See?

335
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,750
I knew your newspaper
was nothing but

336
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,916
page after page of trash,
and look how well trash burns.

337
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,041
Those are our papers!

338
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,083
Not anymore!

339
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,166
They're gonna burn!

340
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,791
Those are our Mistress' orders!

341
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,250
Don't worry, Kurumu,
I'll get 'em out!

342
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,875
What the hell?!

343
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,750
Keito here is
actually a <i>jorogumo</i> !

344
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,375
That's a gi-normous spider
monster from Japanese folklore

345
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,458
who can also take the
form of a woman, whee!

346
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,041
That's your true identity, huh?!

347
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,625
I know who you serve;
you're wearing their uniform!

348
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,750
Well, well.

349
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,541
It seems the one thing
you are good at

350
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,458
is digging up information,
Miss Reporter.

351
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,250
What is that thing?

352
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,083
The Security Committee's
armband and our badge of pride.

353
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,958
We preserve order and
defend justice at this school.

354
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,500
Your "order" and
"justice" is all BS!

355
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,916
You guys are lowlifes!

356
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,375
And thugs!

357
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,416
You really need
an attitude adjustment!

358
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,583
Kurumu, no!

359
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,458
What is this?!

360
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,916
There's no point fighting it!

361
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,208
Trust us, we know.

362
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,375
Our Mistress caught you...

363
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,291
...just like she caught us.

364
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,166
If you're wondering who
these girls are, they were

365
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,458
members of former clubs who
defied the Security Committee.

366
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,083
I used to be a member of
the Classic Literature Club.

367
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,708
I was in the Japanese
Tea Ceremony Club.

368
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,291
As for me, I was a member
of the Yaoi Manga Club.

369
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,083
Yes.
They were...

370
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,250
...but once I injected
them with my venom,

371
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,875
those stubborn girls became
my faithful servants.

372
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,833
We live to serve Mistress!

373
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,208
We love you,
our beautiful Mistress!

374
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,125
And your wish is our command!

375
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,833
And all it's going to take
to change that bad attitude

376
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,208
of yours is just a
tiny bit of my venom.

377
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,708
No, stay away from me!

378
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,416
I'd rather die than serve an
eight-legged skank like you!

379
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,416
Oh, I love to trap
prey in my web!

380
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,125
All of you struggle and
scream but there's no escape.

381
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,416
Hey, Spider-Woman.

382
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,875
That's what you look
like in your monster form?

383
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,750
It's pretty gross.

384
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,166
What? Ice?!

385
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,625
Mizore?!

386
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,750
Hey, come on.

387
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,291
Didn't I tell you to
start calling me

388
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,458
your "little snow bunny"?

389
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,791
I'm a <i>jorogumo</i> , so if
it's a fight you want,

390
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,375
it's a fight you'll get!

391
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,875
Actually, I'm not the
one that you'll be fighting.

392
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,791
You guys, are you okay?!

393
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,000
Moka!

394
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,750
I'll use my magic to
help give you a step up!

395
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,041
Tsukune!

396
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,708
Moka!

397
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,000
Grab my hand!

398
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,541
I'm trying!

399
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,791
No!

400
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,458
What's this?!

401
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,166
When the rosary seal
over her breast is removed...

402
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,958
...Moka's innocent
self vanishes...

403
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,208
...and her inner
vampire awakens!

404
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,500
Is that--?
An "S" Class Supermonster?!

405
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,583
Would you hurry up and
get me down, from here?!

406
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,333
No, I won't.

407
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,625
What?!

408
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,208
If you want to save
yourself from becoming

409
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,958
one of those spider's minions,

410
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,708
then you're gonna have to find a
way out of there on your own.

411
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,458
Fine! I will!

412
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,250
Maybe if I just pull harder...!

413
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,125
Uh-uh, no, you don't!

414
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,500
Hold onto her tight!

415
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,500
We're not letting you go!

416
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,958
Lay off!

417
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,583
I didn't need you after all!

418
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,625
You cost me my prey, vampire!

419
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,458
You think you're hot shit with
that power, but compared

420
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,708
to Kuyo, the president of
the Security Committee,

421
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,541
your monster strength
is just a joke!

422
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,625
And?

423
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,333
And I'll prove just how
weak you really are.

424
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,583
Oh, will you now?

425
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,166
Wind, wind, the little thread...

426
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,250
--Wait, what are you doing?!
--Wind, wind, the little thread.

427
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:44,125
No...! Can't we
talk about this?!

428
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,333
Stop it! Please!

429
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,583
Look, if you let me go,

430
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,083
I won't report this to
the Security Committee.

431
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,166
I promise...

432
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,041
I won't tell them a thing!

433
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,041
...'til it's dead.

434
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,875
What do you say?!

435
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,958
Piss off.

436
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,458
That's from me!

437
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,541
We're with you, Mistress.

438
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,541
Together.

439
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,458
'Til death do us part.

440
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,208
Since you four like
webs so much, you can

441
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,166
spend the rest of your
days wrapped in them.

442
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,708
Um, sure.

443
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,416
That'll be super.
Right, guys?

444
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,250
This episode's fight took

445
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,958
one hundred and seventeen
seconds, whee!

446
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,625
I've made a decision!

447
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,458
I know it means going against
what Gin wants us to do...

448
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:48,666
...but as the Newspaper
Club it's our duty.

449
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,125
We have to expose
the Security Committee!

450
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,583
Tsukune?

451
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,125
You guys don't have
to do this, but I am.

452
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,375
Me, too!

453
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,625
I'm behind you one
hundred percent, Tsukune.

454
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,916
You can count on me as well!

455
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,458
You can add me
to that list, too.

456
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,208
The Newspaper Club's main weapon
is the power of the press,

457
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,833
so let's show these
creeps what we've got!

458
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,291
Keito was defeated?!

459
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:23,125
Yes, sir, and in a mere one
hundred and seventeen seconds.

460
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,583
Hmph.

461
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,416
I suppose it's only
to be expected.

462
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,416
Vampires are "S" Class monsters.

463
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,750
Still, that was foolish,
Newspaper Club.

464
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,625
It appears that you've
forgotten all the

465
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,750
lessons we taught
you last year.

466
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,416
Then there's you.

467
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,583
Tsukune Aono, sir?

468
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,750
Him?

469
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,291
It looks like we're in for the

470
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,791
best show we've
seen in some time.

471
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:04,333
♪ closing song ♪

472
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,791
Guys, let's show 'em what
the Newspaper Club can do!

473
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:42,583
Oh, no!

474
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,833
Tsukune's in big trouble!

475
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:44,916
What happened?!

476
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,708
Someone sucked too
much of his blood.

477
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:52,041
Next time: "Security Committee
and a Vampire," and another...
