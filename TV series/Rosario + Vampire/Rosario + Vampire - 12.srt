1
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,625
We're sorry sir.

2
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,916
But we need more time...

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,333
...please just a little more.

4
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,625
But that's not
what we agreed to.

5
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,708
You were supposed to have

6
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,791
that payment to
me yesterday, my friend.

7
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,041
Y-Yes, it's just...

8
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,875
We had to buy new
training equipment, and...

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:40,041
No, wait!
I promise we'll get it to you!

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,666
This is friggin' lame,
I hate class.

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,666
Screw it man,
let's stay here and skip.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,125
Yeah... That's some
righteous thinkin there, man.

13
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,916
Any students who
slack off better be

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,166
prepared to feel the
hammer of justice.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,708
It's the Security Committee!

16
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:01,791
Oh, damn it

17
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,416
Lets get outa here!

18
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,666
And so it went.

19
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,583
The Newspaper Club's
investigation into the

20
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,625
nefarious dealings of
the Security Committee

21
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,750
was proceeding at a
rapid pace, whee!

22
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:40,791
♪ opening song ♪

23
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,291
Those creeps are getting away
with whatever they want.

24
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,000
At this point, what
we really lack is

25
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,250
some direct testimony from
the victims themselves.

26
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,333
That's the thing...

27
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,958
We keep trying to get answers,

28
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,583
but no one wants to
respond to our questions.

29
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,958
Yeah...

30
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,875
It's like everybody's
terrified of retribution.

31
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,541
But we can't run
with what we have now.

32
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,791
We don't have enough
for a solid article yet...

33
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,083
What we need is an informant...

34
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:34,791
But who?

35
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,541
I think I found some.

36
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,791
Uh... Mizore, when
did you get in here?!

37
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,708
Call me your "snow bunny"...

38
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,666
Oh, I love that.

39
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,750
Wait, you said you
"found some." Found what?

40
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,125
I found some informants.

41
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,916
I found a club
that could never pay...

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,958
A club that looked like it
could go under at any minute...

43
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,291
So I reached out to them.

44
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,083
Hey, who's that
girl over there, huh?

45
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,958
Beats me, but she
looks pretty hot.

46
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:09,041
Man, for some reason, I feel
a really weird chill in here.

47
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,333
Yo, guys...

48
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,208
...that girl's still looking
at us, isn't she?!

49
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,541
I don't even have to check;
I can tell she is by this chill!

50
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,041
Hey.

51
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,541
Yes ma'am?!

52
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,000
I need you to tell
me what you know

53
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,916
about the Security Committee.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,083
What do you mean?!

55
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,750
We don't know nothin'
'bout those dudes!

56
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,041
Yeah I don't know no dudes.

57
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,625
I hope that's true...

58
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,750
'Cause if you
three're lying to me...

59
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,291
I swear, I'll stalk
you your whole life...

60
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,666
And then I'll freeze you solid.

61
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,083
Oh, man, this chick
is scary as hell!

62
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,458
Don't freeze us;
we're begging you!

63
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,583
That's basically the
long and short of it.

64
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,625
Ah...
Okay, then.

65
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,833
Great job, Mizore, way to go!

66
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,708
Those creeps may think
it's fine when they're

67
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,625
doing the stalking, but
it seems they don't like

68
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,375
it so much when the shoe's
on the other foot, huh?

69
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,125
Excuse us, sorry for
interrupting you.

70
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,041
Could we maybe borrow
your ear for a moment?

71
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,541
We're really busy here,
what do you people want?

72
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,666
We're looking for the Fan
Club Coalition guys;

73
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,583
you wouldn't happen to know
where they are, would you?

74
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,916
Ah...

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,083
If you want to find them,
the Security Committee

76
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:20,666
just came here and--

77
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,208
Hey, shut up!

78
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,500
Uh, sorry, but we
don't know anything.

79
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,416
Tell us the truth!

80
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,416
Wait, what did you just say?

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,416
Come on just What
are you hiding?!

82
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,750
Just go away and leave us alone!

83
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,958
It's got nothing to do with us!

84
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,625
Sorry for disturbing you sir.

85
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,458
Well, what is it?

86
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,458
It's about those clowns
we carted off to

87
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,791
keep their mouths shut;

88
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,041
they had some interesting
information to share.

89
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,541
Oh, they did...?

90
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,583
Please, do tell.

91
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,916
And It's the next morning;

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,333
in "the biz" we call this
passage of time, whee!

93
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,250
Good morning, Tsukune!

94
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,541
Hey, what's the matter...?
You look really tired.

95
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,541
Uh... Yeah, it's
the investigation.

96
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,208
I started thinking about where
we should take it from here,

97
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,416
and I guess I
couldn't get to sleep.

98
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,083
Oh I see.

99
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,291
The way things are now,

100
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,041
we still don't have
enough for an article...

101
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,000
Unless we can get
some new evidence.

102
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,500
Hey, Tsukune?

103
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, what is it Moka?

104
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,041
You know compared to how
you were when you first

105
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,416
started school here, somehow,

106
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,833
I feel like you're a lot
manlier than you used to be.

107
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,291
Oh yeah?

108
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,625
It's just that...
I really think I...

109
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,375
Ah...

110
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,750
You smell wonderful.

111
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,125
So, what'll it be
this time, Moka...?

112
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,291
You want the usual?

113
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,583
Oh, yes, please...

114
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,166
That sounds lovely.

115
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,500
Kurumu Kick!

116
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,083
Hey what the hell
was that for Kurumu?!

117
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,125
We're gonna be busy
as hell all day long!

118
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,375
So don't you go sucking
him dry, you hear me?!

119
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,000
Hey!

120
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,250
Pull it together!

121
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,458
Let's keep this investigation
going, you guys?

122
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, good plan.

123
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,583
I'll try and find more people
I can stalk into submission!

124
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,125
Yes!
You're right...!

125
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,958
Just thinking about it gets
us nowhere, let's take action!

126
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:19,708
Yeah!

127
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,250
Let's go!

128
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,666
♪ Who will it be,
who will I see, ♪

129
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,333
♪ taking off their clothes... ♪

130
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,375
♪ ...taking of their... ♪

131
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,083
It's him.

132
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,000
And so, what that means is...

133
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,166
The most important
adjective we encounter

134
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,916
in this particular text is
the word "terrifying."

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,916
These adjectives are--

136
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,500
Oh no, it's them.

137
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,250
What're they doing here?

138
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,333
Umm, we're in the middle
of class right now...

139
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,125
What can I do for you?

140
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,458
There's no need to worry.

141
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,666
This won't take but a moment.

142
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,458
Tsukune Aono, right?

143
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,750
Uh... yes?

144
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:10,916
As of right now...

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,666
You are under suspicion
of being a human.

146
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:15,833
He's a human?

147
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,416
No way, that can't be!

148
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,375
Think about it, nobody knows
what Tsukune's monster form is.

149
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,750
Therefore...

150
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,375
You will be undergoing a
Security Committee inquest.

151
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,125
Hey, now hold on just a minute!

152
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,666
Come on!

153
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,375
A human couldn't even be at
this school in the first place!

154
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,208
Stop making these
wild accusations...!

155
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,666
Silence!

156
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,500
Wow...
His monster energy...

157
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,250
Depending on the circumstances,
you three are just as guilty...

158
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,416
Moka Akashiya...

159
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,791
Kurumu Kurono...

160
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,625
Mizore Shirayuki...

161
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,500
Gather your things,
you're coming too.

162
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,333
Just as guilty?

163
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,375
Oh, no...

164
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,125
How'd he find out...?

165
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,666
This can't be.

166
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,000
But... Tsukune?

167
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,375
Hey, are you okay?

168
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,333
Everything's gonna
be fine, Tsukune!

169
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,541
I know you're not some human.

170
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,208
And don't worry, that's exactly
what I'm gonna tell them!

171
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,041
What's goin' on?

172
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:06,875
Where are they taking them?

173
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,791
I dunno, man.

174
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,041
Uh okay now listen up everybody,
please just calm down!

175
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:12,916
Check it out.

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,291
Whoa, is that guy the human...?

177
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,291
Yeah.

178
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,416
I think his name
is Tsukune Aono!

179
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,416
And the other
Newspaper Club members?

180
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,583
That would be tenth-grader
Yukari Sendo

181
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,666
and eleventh-grader
Ginei Morioka Sir.

182
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,791
Interesting...

183
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,750
Ginei Morioka, huh...?

184
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,166
It's been quite some time
since I've seen that nuisance.

185
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,166
Shall I have him arrested, sir?

186
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,458
Leave him be.

187
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,333
As long as he hasn't
forgotten about last year,

188
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,208
I doubt he'll raise
a hand against us.

189
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,666
If I'm gonna save everybody,
then this is my only chance!

190
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,125
Hey!

191
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,416
Stay back!

192
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,916
Gin...?
What are you doing?

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,083
There's way too many of 'em.

194
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,166
What good can you
do by yourself, huh?!

195
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,416
Stop it, I have to
go and help them!

196
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,458
Please if I don't go save
them right now, they'll be...!

197
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,500
We gotta hold
back for now, okay?

198
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,208
I warned you...
I tried.

199
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,750
No...!
I'm not a human!

200
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,041
Where's Moka...?

201
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,208
I wanna know where
you dragged her off to!

202
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,708
No need to worry about her;

203
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,500
she's not being
harmed in any way.

204
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,791
Not yet.

205
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,791
Calm down...

206
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,458
They're in custody
like everybody else.

207
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,041
They're probably being
questioned as we speak.

208
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,208
Hold on, what...?
Everybody else who?

209
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,750
Yep... There's no
doubt about it,

210
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,458
that dude smelled like
a human, all right.

211
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,791
I mean, I sit in the seat
right across from him.

212
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,583
That guy has always
smelled weird,

213
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,416
and I've thought so from the
first time I laid eyes on him.

214
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,875
Tsukune...?
Well, as far as athletes go,

215
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,833
he's pretty much the
worst I've ever seen...

216
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,041
And... I have to admit
he's such a weakling;

217
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,708
it would make sense
if he's a human.

218
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,791
Well, he definitely has
a human-like scent,

219
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,708
and everyone knows about it.

220
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,375
Moka is always kissing
him on his neck...

221
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,583
but the real rea--

222
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,666
That guy reeks.

223
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,291
I thought he was
sorta weird sometimes.

224
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,416
And he smells awful!

225
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,166
You know, now that
you mention it...

226
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,375
He never once tried to change
into his monster form to save

227
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,791
Moka and his friends even when
they were in serious danger.

228
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,208
Mister Aono...?

229
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,958
Oh, yes, he had a really
delicious scent, all right...

230
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,500
He smelled exactly
like a human being.

231
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,333
The writing is on the wall...

232
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,625
No matter whose
testimony we listen to,

233
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,375
they all lend support to the
assertion that you're human.

234
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,083
Including...

235
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,833
All of the people
you call your friends.

236
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,000
What's this?

237
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,875
Are you really going to
sit there and tell me

238
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,791
you don't believe that
your friend is a human?

239
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,416
Of course I don't believe it!

240
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,416
Tell me: what makes
you so certain?

241
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,208
Uh...

242
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,666
Well, for one thing,

243
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,083
a human being could never
even get into Yokai Academy.

244
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,000
Very well, then
surely you must know

245
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,000
what kind of monster
he is, correct?

246
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,916
No, I don't.

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,125
You've never seen it, then?

248
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,291
Not once, right?

249
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,791
Well... It's just...

250
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,083
But that's the school rule.

251
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,458
We're not supposed
to reveal our

252
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,500
monster identities
without a good reason.

253
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,333
Yes, you're certainly
right about that.

254
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,083
Well, then it just
means that Tsukune's

255
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,041
been really good about
obeying the rules.

256
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,333
Right, I suppose
that's one possibility...

257
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,208
But not turning into
your monster form

258
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,375
even after your good friends
are in serious trouble?

259
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,833
Come on...
Do you really buy that?

260
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,333
Just what are you trying to say?

261
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,083
Well, I'm saying that
your friend is a,

262
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,041
cowardly spineless,
lily-livered excuse for a man.

263
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,375
He's not...

264
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,333
Tsukune's not a...

265
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,416
We know... Everything.

266
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,875
Oh, yes...

267
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,458
We know all about how you've
been sucking his blood...

268
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,625
Vampires...

269
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,916
They love human blood,
don't they?

270
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,750
Therefore, logic dictates
he's a human.

271
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,916
No, you're wrong...!

272
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,333
I suck his blood because...

273
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,208
Because it's delicious...

274
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,166
It's not 'cause he's
a human or anything.

275
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,125
That's not all,
I've done my homework...

276
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,875
...water is a vampires weakness.

277
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,083
That's right...

278
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,375
That's exactly
what's in this glass...

279
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,208
Pure water.

280
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,666
No, please.

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,500
Moka!

282
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,875
If you continue
with this farce...

283
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,750
...all of your friends
are going to wind up

284
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,000
like those poor
fellows over there.

285
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,208
Wait, hold on...

286
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,291
What "poor fellows?"

287
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,958
These three have
been very cooperative.

288
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,750
They told me all about that
little fight they had with you.

289
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,500
"Tsukune Aono was so weak,
it was like fighting a human...

290
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,333
We kept beating on him
and beating on him,

291
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,875
but he never once tried to
break his transformation,"

292
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,500
It's time to fess up...

293
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,000
Just tell us the truth...

294
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,083
Unless you want Moka
to end up like those three.

295
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,958
Moka, no!

296
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,541
Just behind this shrine,

297
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,541
we've got ourselves a
nice little pond...

298
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,000
If the investigation
drags on much longer,

299
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,791
Moka might need to cool off.

300
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,916
 Leave her alone!

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,333
Filthy bastards...!

302
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,875
You let her...

303
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,541
What's wrong...?

304
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,666
Now's your chance to
show me your true form...

305
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,041
Go right ahead, Tsukune,
everyone is dying to see.

306
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,458
Getting free from the men
now holding you down

307
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:56,083
should be no problem for
you once you've transformed.

308
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,333
In fact, you don't even
need to go that far.

309
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,125
The simple act of changing to
your monster form will clear

310
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,000
the charge of being
human, and all your

311
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,875
beloved friends can
be set free at once.

312
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,458
Noooo!

313
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,750
What's wrong...?
Why won't you change?

314
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,666
Right. Because you
actually are a human.

315
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,125
Moka.

316
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,916
Well Moka...

317
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,166
This is it...

318
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,708
I guess this is goodbye then.

319
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,958
Yes, you're right...

320
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,125
I am a human, just like
you said, now let her go!

321
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,541
Did you hear that, everyone?

322
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,250
But Tsukune you...

323
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,708
It can't be...
There's just no way...

324
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,041
It's not really true, right?

325
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,208
This shrine can be deceiving;

326
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,375
inside are many layers of
misdirection and illusion.

327
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,958
We can present the appearance
of separate rooms,

328
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,500
or bring everyone together
into one big hall if we want.

329
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,250
You tricked me?

330
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,583
Oh, Tsukune...

331
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,083
Whatever they
threatened to do to me,

332
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,791
it shouldn't have made
any difference...

333
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,125
Why'd you do that?
Why'd you tell em' the truth?

334
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,458
Wait what?

335
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,125
We came this far...

336
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,416
You and I have been getting
by just fine the entire time.

337
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,291
So why now, when you--

338
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,625
You knew all along...
You lied to us.

339
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,125
Take it easy, Kurumu!
This isn't Moka's fault!

340
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,791
Leave me alone!

341
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,125
Family feud, eh...?

342
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,625
Well... You have
been lying to them

343
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,041
about who you really
are from the start...

344
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,833
Guess you're getting yours, huh?

345
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,083
Guys, please...

346
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,958
I swear, I never meant to...

347
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,750
Go on, toss them out...!

348
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,958
Except for Moka; she's to
remain here in custody.

349
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,208
Wait, no!

350
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,541
Take her away; lock her
up in the special cell.

351
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,625
Hey, wait...!

352
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,208
I thought you were
gonna let her go?!

353
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,625
She knew your true identity all
along and kept it a secret...

354
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,708
She's obviously guilty as well.

355
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,083
No, you can't...

356
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,083
Tsukune!

357
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,875
Moka, no!

358
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,666
Please, don't!
Let me go!

359
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,166
Tsukune!

360
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,916
No...!

361
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,833
Nooooooooo!

362
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,875
Moka, no!

363
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,166
Now then, members of the
Security Committee...

364
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,208
In the name of order,
and for the sake of justice...

365
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,750
I call for the judgment
of Tsukune Aono!

366
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:32,958
Guilty as charged.

367
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,208
Guilty as charged.

368
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:39,666
He's guilty.

369
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,833
Tsukune Aono...
This court finds you guilty.

370
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,000
The punishment is death!

371
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,125
Dammit...
I tried to warn you guys...

372
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,125
I told you not to
go messing with them!

373
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,750
Kurumu!
Mizore!

374
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,166
I can't believe you guys
got out of there all right.

375
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,500
Oh, I'm so happy!

376
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,541
Hey, where are Tsukune and Moka?

377
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,458
Everything they're
saying is true.

378
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,250
What? Speak
up, I didn't hear.

379
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,375
It's Tsukune...

380
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,625
It turns out he's a human.

381
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,500
No you're joking, right?

382
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,250
It's true.

383
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,291
Tsukune admitted it.
He said so himself.

384
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,666
No way, it can't be!

385
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,125
It's gotta be a lie!

386
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,541
The thought that Tsukune's
some human is just wrong...!

387
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,000
And as for Moka...

388
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,541
It looks like she knew
about it the entire time.

389
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,916
At least now we know why she
liked Tsukune's blood so much;

390
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,291
this explains it.

391
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,458
I guess it does make sense;
he was pretty bumbling

392
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,750
for a monster, I always
thought something was up.

393
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,750
Come to think of it,
when we went on that

394
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,791
trip to the human world, he did
seem very excited to be there.

395
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,250
To tell you the truth...

396
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,875
I feel like a total jack ass.

397
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,875
Mizore, wait.

398
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,250
I think that's the right move...

399
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,458
Guess I'll do the same...

400
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,875
Don't 'spect to see
me round the club.

401
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,041
As for you...

402
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,666
Either make amends
with the Committee...

403
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,791
Or hide out' till the
heat dies down...

404
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,625
Figure out how to play it.

405
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,708
"Figure out how to play it?"

406
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:16,041
Hey... Yukari.

407
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,625
What do you really
think about human beings?

408
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,208
Not much, I guess.

409
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,375
Back when I was a little kid,
we all lived in this tiny border

410
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,500
village located in a valley
deep inside the mountains...

411
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,583
Growing up I was always
told that humans

412
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:34,333
were terrifying... We witches
truly did go through hell...

413
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,250
Over the years, my people were
persecuted in witch trials...

414
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,875
The humans hunted
us like animals.

415
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,125
Yeah...
I can relate...

416
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,583
I was always told that
human men were miserable,

417
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,625
unworthy creatures
whose sole purpose

418
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,791
in life was to be
slaves for succubi.

419
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:49,458
Yeah, but...!

420
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,458
Attention, students.

421
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,958
From this moment,
we shall proceed with the

422
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,458
public execution
of Tsukune Aono,

423
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,916
the human who
infiltrated our school.

424
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,541
This individual,
pursuant to questioning

425
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,916
by our Security Committee,

426
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,500
confessed that he was in
fact a human in our midst!

427
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:13,375
Wherefore, it is now our duty to
carry out his public execution.

428
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,666
Oh, gross...

429
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,375
So he's really a human, huh?

430
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,875
Aww man, get a whiff,
that guy smells terrible.

431
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,583
Yeah, tell me about it.

432
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,041
He stinks like one!

433
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,333
Yeah, but even so...

434
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,333
I mean, I hate humans as
much as the next guy,

435
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,875
but don't you think
death's a bit much?

436
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:32,750
I think so...

437
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah...

438
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,375
To tell you the truth,
back when I was goin'

439
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,416
to that human school, I made
plenty of friends there.

440
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,666
Me, too...

441
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,875
This whole thing
is going too far.

442
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,375
Whoa, what the...!

443
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:50,208
The execution will take
place at exactly 4:44 PM.

444
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,541
Students one and all!

445
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,083
Remember this
human's final hour!

446
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,041
Remember how he met his doom!

447
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,250
Yeah!

448
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,750
Damn the human to hell!

449
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,666
Long live justice!

450
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,500
Long live the glorious Kuyo!

451
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,583
Oh, no, what are
we gonna do...?!

452
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,625
We have to put
a stop to this...!

453
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,041
That Tsukune kid...

454
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,208
He's a student from your class,
isn't he, Miss Nekonome?

455
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,666
Yes.

456
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,625
But the death penalty?!

457
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,583
Come on, that's
taking it way too far!

458
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,375
And besides, this is supposed to
be Yokai Academy, isn't it?!

459
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,500
I thought the whole purpose of
this school was to promote

460
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,625
a secret and peaceful
coexistence with humans!

461
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,291
Yes, well, that's one thing,
and this is another...

462
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,291
Since ancient times,
human beings

463
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,958
have been our mortal enemies...

464
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,333
If the Security
Committee hadn't

465
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,583
taken action,
I certainly would've!

466
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,500
We can't just sit here...

467
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,208
I have to go down
there and stop them!

468
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,875
Excuse me, Miss Nekonome?

469
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,625
Yes Miss Ririko?

470
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,583
The director said
he wants to see you.

471
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,541
What...?!

472
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,375
Did he say what for?!

473
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:49,708
Stop...

474
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,291
now...

475
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:50,875
calm...

476
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:51,875
down...

477
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,125
He said it was
urgent business...

478
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,708
--Oh, meooooow!
--So we'd better get a move on.

479
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,625
They're going to kill him...!
We've got to rescue him!

480
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,208
What do you think we should do?

481
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,125
Those idiots...

482
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,333
Tsukune...

483
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,291
...and Moka.
They're both such idiots.

484
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:16,000
Damn it...!
Both of them are such idiots
