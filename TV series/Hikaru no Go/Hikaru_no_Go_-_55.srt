00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,871
DOCTOR: Now, I'll
let you play online

3
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:51,973
if you can assure
me it's just for fun

4
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:53,575
and there's no stress involved.

5
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,877
-It helps pass the time.

6
00:01:55,911 --> 00:02:00,115
Although, there are still some
games I can't afford to lose.

7
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:02,250
-From the first
time I saw him, I

8
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:06,054
sensed that he and I
shared the same path.

9
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:07,889
The path towards
the Divine Move.

10
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:15,163
Tomorrow will be my chance.

11
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:17,666
My chance to make
the Divine Move!

12
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:28,777
WOMAN: How long do
you think you're

13
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,846
going to be at the
study group, Akira?

14
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:33,982
-It's probably gonna
last into the evening.

15
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:35,250
-That long?

16
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:37,652
You will be home in time to
have dinner though, won't you?

17
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:42,724
-You're not going
down to the hospital?

18
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:45,193
WOMAN: Your father told me
not to bother him today.

19
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:45,794
-Hm?

20
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:47,262
Really? How come?

21
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:48,897
-He says he doesn't
want to be interrupted

22
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,068
while he plays his internet Go.

23
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:55,537
They're releasing him
the day after tomorrow.

24
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,938
What he should be
doing is getting

25
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:59,107
as much rest as possible.

26
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,909
Sometimes I wonder
if playing Go is

27
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:03,278
the only thing you and your
father ever think about.

28
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,679
-Well, I better get going.

29
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:14,789
The time's gone by so fast.

30
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:16,791
Soon my father's going
to be out of the hospital

31
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:18,693
and back at home.

32
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,996
When he collapsed 10 days
ago, I thought the worst.

33
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:28,837
It happened the day I was
scheduled to play Shindou.

34
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,840
I won't get a chance to play
him again until next month,

35
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:34,843
when we're in the
Young Lions tournament.

36
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:37,279
But I'm not going to sit
back and wait until then.

37
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:40,248
I can always watch his
matches against other pros.

38
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:45,053
That should be enough for me to
gauge his strength right now.

39
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:49,724
And the day will soon be
here when I figure out

40
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,626
what kind of player
he really is.

41
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:04,606
It's weird how my father started
playing Go on the internet,

42
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,842
not wanting visitors
and everything.

43
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:09,844
He never showed any
interest in using a computer

44
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,112
before he went in the hospital.

45
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:27,696
SAI (VOICEOVER): At
last, the day has come.

46
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:28,963
-OK, Sai.

47
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:29,798
You ready?

48
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:30,353
-Yes.

49
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:36,671
-Hi, come on in.

50
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:39,708
-I thought Mitani's
sister worked here.

51
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,843
Did she quit, or is
it just her day off?

52
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:46,114
-You can use this one here.

53
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:46,848
-OK, thanks.

54
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,255
I wonder if the
Meijin's online yet.

55
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:00,729
I can't believe he said
he'd retire if he lost.

56
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:02,564
That's crazy!

57
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:05,834
-If I lose to your
friend, then I'll retire.

58
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:08,236
I won't play again.

59
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,739
-He sounded pretty
serious about it.

60
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:12,107
Ah, he's just like Akira.

61
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,909
Neither of them can stand
the thought of being beaten.

62
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:20,882
Come on, log in.

63
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:21,437
Sai?

64
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:29,290
There he is.

65
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:35,597
If Sai manages to beat
him, will he really retire?

66
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:43,705
An even game with a 5.5 komi.

67
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:45,774
Three hours each.

68
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:47,609
There we go.

69
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:50,678
He has five championship titles,
and if he suddenly retires,

70
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:51,780
there's gonna be chaos.

71
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,581
It's seriously bad news.

72
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:58,586
Toya-sensei gets to go first.

73
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:36,591
This game feels really intense,
even over the internet.

74
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:39,160
It's the same intensity I felt
during the Shincho Dan series,

75
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:41,830
only stronger.

76
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,199
This is Toya Meijin.

77
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:46,167
His first move.

78
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:48,970
I guess it doesn't really
matter to me if he retires.

79
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:53,808
I'm going to get to watch a
great game and be a part of it.

80
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:58,112
One of the best games ever,
between Toya Meijin and Sai,

81
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:00,215
right here, right now.

82
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:51,900
-I'm home.

83
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:53,201
WOMAN: Yoshitaka!

84
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:55,703
You're coming home just now?

85
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:57,272
Where have you been?

86
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,974
No one plays Go all night long.

87
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:01,843
-I went to Saeki's
place to play.

88
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:03,978
It got kind of late,
so I stayed over.

89
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:05,847
WOMAN: How many times
do I have to tell you?

90
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,749
Call me if you're
not coming home.

91
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:09,551
I tried calling your
cell phone for hours,

92
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:11,119
but you turned it off.

93
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:12,220
-Sorry.

94
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:14,756
WOMAN: Did you have
any breakfast yet?

95
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,558
-Yeah, stop worrying.

96
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,092
Ugh.

97
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:19,661
Maybe I should do
the same as Saeki

98
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:22,530
and start looking
for my own place.

99
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:25,066
If Sensei could get me
some teaching jobs or game

100
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,835
recording, I'd be able
to make extra money.

101
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,837
Add it to my match
earnings, and it

102
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:32,941
should be enough to cover
rent for an apartment.

103
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:35,710
But I'd have to make my
own meals, do laundry.

104
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,373
Eh.

105
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:45,053
I haven't played Go
online in a while.

106
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:49,824
WOMAN: Yoshitaka!

107
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:51,926
Are you gonna be home
for the rest of the day?

108
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,228
Are you staying for
lunch and dinner?

109
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:57,966
-Yeah, I'll eat here, thanks.

110
00:08:57,966 --> 00:08:59,667
Sai?

111
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,135
The impostor's back again?

112
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:02,537
What an idiot.

113
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,005
Didn't he learn his lesson?

114
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:07,241
I guess it could be
someone else this time.

115
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:08,743
Hm?

116
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:09,977
Koyo Toya?

117
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,182
The Meijin's playing a game?

118
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:15,249
It can't be him!

119
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:16,985
It's gotta be some
jerk using his name.

120
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:18,186
Another impostor.

121
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:20,622
There's no way he would
ever play Go online.

122
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:23,057
If Morishita-sensei's not
gonna spend his time doing it,

123
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:25,259
neither would Toya Meijin.

124
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:28,296
Besides, I thought he was
still in the hospital.

125
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:32,667
But, if he was in a private
room, I suppose he could play.

126
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,234
Hm.

127
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:34,569
It couldn't be him.

128
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:36,938
He doesn't have time
for this kind of stuff.

129
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,740
Looks like he's
playing right now.

130
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:40,575
I wonder who his opponent is.

131
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:44,112
Sai?

132
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:47,882
There's no way those two
are playing each other!

133
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:50,852
They're just getting started.

134
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:53,121
Toya Meijin playing against Sai?

135
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:55,857
If it is really them, this
is going to be an epic game.

136
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:00,795
They've each got three
hours of playing time.

137
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:04,298
For an online game?

138
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:06,234
Hm.

139
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,770
What if it is the Meijin?

140
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:18,179
And what if-- it's Sai?

141
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:20,181
What if it's really him?

142
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:51,913
[phone ringing]

143
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:55,583
[groan]

144
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:56,884
FRANK: Hello?

145
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:58,286
Mr. Ewyer.

146
00:10:58,286 --> 00:10:59,987
Yeah, it was good
to see you, too.

147
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,728
So, why are you calling me
in the middle of the night?

148
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:09,263
Yeah?

149
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:11,999
Koyo Toya's playing
a game online?

150
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
OK.

151
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,970
And who is his opponent?

152
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:17,638
Huh?

153
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:19,140
No!

154
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:20,274
-It's Sai!

155
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:23,678
The one you told me
about the other day.

156
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:25,146
How on earth would
I be able to tell

157
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:27,815
if he's the real
thing, or an impostor?

158
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:29,650
-I've got to find out!

159
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,285
Sai against Koyo Toya.

160
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:33,054
Come on, come on.

161
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:33,921
Let's see.

162
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:36,124
Must be about noon in Japan.

163
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:39,727
Uh, Koyo Toya and Sai.

164
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:40,561
Here it is!

165
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,630
-So this is the notorious Sai.

166
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:18,599
Well, well.

167
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,568
He is a worthy opponent.

168
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:31,012
MAN: Look, it's Sai.

169
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:32,280
-So it is.

170
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:34,916
And he's playing a
game against Koyo Toya.

171
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,918
-Hope you didn't
mind me coming over,

172
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:39,687
but I thought it'd be more
fun to watch it together.

173
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,721
Look at the playing time.

174
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:41,889
Three hours each.

175
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:43,624
Is going to be a long game.

176
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:44,058
-Whoa.

177
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:46,160
This is awesome.

178
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,662
MAN: All right if I make coffee?

179
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:48,296
MAN: Yeah.

180
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:49,530
And make some for me, too.

181
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,868
This is quite a surprise.

182
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:55,236
Sai's online again.

183
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:56,137
If it's really him.

184
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:01,609
After his game against Akira,
he just seemed to disappear.

185
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:02,877
And that was two years ago.

186
00:13:02,877 --> 00:13:05,546
Does this mean
he's back for good?

187
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,248
-What a game it's going to be.

188
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:08,716
Sai versus Koyo Toya.

189
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,990
-The moves seem pretty
straightforward so far.

190
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:17,859
The question is, how
is it going to develop?

191
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:27,034
TOYA MEIJIN: He is
no mere amateur.

192
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:33,107
But he's different from any
other professional I've played.

193
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:42,283
I made a promise to
retire if I lose the game.

194
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:45,753
And I have no intention
of going back on my word.

195
00:13:51,626 --> 00:14:00,735
But if I'm the one who wins--
you will tell me your name.

196
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:05,940
MAN: This is incredible.

197
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:08,609
Sai is back.

198
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:12,613
And what's more, his opponent
is none other than Koyo Toya.

199
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:15,716
I just played Koyo
Toya the other day.

200
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,588
I'm convinced that this player
has to be Toya Meijin of Japan.

201
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:22,723
And Sai seems to
be doing a good job

202
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:24,859
of holding his own
against the Meijin.

203
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:26,794
It must be the same Sai.

204
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:29,163
The one who was
online two years ago.

205
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,771
-So, he's going
on the offensive.

206
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,996
I can see through your strategy.

207
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:57,626
All right, then.

208
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:58,494
-Huh?

209
00:15:58,494 --> 00:16:02,198
Toya finally made another move.

210
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:02,870
Huh?

211
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:08,204
This is-- Sai's plan.

212
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:10,539
He'd been waiting for
him to play there.

213
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:13,008
Is that the best the
Meijin could come up

214
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,511
with after thinking about
it for all that time?

215
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:41,770
-You think I'm playing right
into your hands, don't you?

216
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:48,544
However-- by going
for the capping move,

217
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:50,746
and then building
steadily on it,

218
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:53,315
my position is stronger
than you anticipated.

219
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:02,658
-This has got to be
the Meijin playing.

220
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:04,193
What a game.

221
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:08,697
I never imagined it would turn
out to be as exciting as this.

222
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:10,633
When Sai made the move
to go on the attack,

223
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:14,303
he seemed to have the
advantage there for a while.

224
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:18,507
But looking at it now,
well, that advantage

225
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:22,077
has been completely wiped out.

226
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:23,746
What an awesome game!

227
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,247
Way to go, Toya-sensei!

228
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,352
-Now you'll see what my game is.

229
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:33,355
The Meijin, a true master of Go.

230
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:42,364
I will not fall back.

231
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:44,767
I will win this game.

232
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:47,636
And you will tell me your name.

233
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:52,608
BOY: Toya Meijin was lucky
it wasn't more serious,

234
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:55,477
but you should see his schedule
for the next couple of months.

235
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:57,479
He's supposed to be
traveling all over the world

236
00:17:57,513 --> 00:17:58,747
to play a ton of games.

237
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:02,151
If he doesn't take it easy,
he's gonna collapse again.

238
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:03,118
-Now, come on.

239
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:04,486
-All the more reason
for young pros

240
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:07,056
like us to get out there
and win a few titles.

241
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:11,994
Only to help ease the
pressure on him, of course.

242
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:13,696
-Well, Ogata's
making some headway.

243
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:16,298
They're at two games
each in the Judan series.

244
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:19,101
-And Kurata's going to be making
a challenge for the Honinbo

245
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:20,202
title, which is coming up.

246
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:22,438
We've gotta follow their lead.

247
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:23,272
-Hey, guys.

248
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:24,373
What's up?

249
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:26,609
-You took your
time getting here.

250
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:28,310
-Thanks for coming.

251
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:30,613
-I didn't know you were
going to be here, Toya.

252
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:31,680
-Yeah.

253
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:32,982
I thought it would be
good to invite him.

254
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:34,750
-He's pretty good
at analyzing games.

255
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,019
We might learn a
thing or two from him.

256
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:38,220
-I hard about your dad.

257
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:39,154
How's he doing?

258
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:40,356
Is he better now?

259
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:41,490
-Yes.

260
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,626
-You saw him the other
day in the Judan series.

261
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:45,060
He's in better shape than you.

262
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:47,062
-They're releasing him
from the hospital the day

263
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:48,330
after tomorrow.

264
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:50,499
He was going to spend today
playing Go on the internet.

265
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:51,433
-The internet?

266
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:53,135
Toya-sensei?

267
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:56,105
-But he doesn't seem the type.

268
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:58,040
BOY: Do you think
he's online right now?

269
00:18:58,073 --> 00:18:59,174
You have a computer.

270
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,009
Turn it on.

271
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,477
-I hardly ever use the internet.

272
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,245
For Go, or anything else.

273
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:05,981
-What's the point of even
having a computer, then?

274
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:08,083
-I keep all my game
records on here.

275
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:09,218
Now, let's see.

276
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:10,219
Just a sec.

277
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:12,221
What name does he use online?

278
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:13,455
-Just his real name.

279
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:15,257
BOY: Toya.

280
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,525
-Aw, so cool!

281
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,361
I never thought about playing
Go on the computer before.

282
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:20,095
-Found it.

283
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:21,764
Koyo Toya.

284
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:23,098
-Let me see.

285
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:25,034
-Look how many people
are watching the game.

286
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:26,735
-It's not every day a
champion plays online.

287
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,005
BOY: Oh.

288
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,073
BOY: Is this it?

289
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:32,408
BOY: Wow.

290
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:34,209
-What a showdown.

291
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:36,512
Check out what's going
on with white at the top.

292
00:19:36,545 --> 00:19:39,348
-And things look interesting
down at the bottom left.

293
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:42,685
-So, uh, who's in control?

294
00:19:42,718 --> 00:19:46,355
BOY: You know, guys, it's not
easy to tell from this board.

295
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:48,691
-White looks like he's in
a better position to me.

296
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:50,125
-Well, I don't know about that.

297
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,460
Black is Toya-sensei, right?

298
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:53,095
-Even, so white is--

299
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:55,164
-Don't forget they're
playing an even game.

300
00:19:55,197 --> 00:19:57,366
If white's playing this
well with no handicap--

301
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:58,467
-Whoa!

302
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,202
They've both got three
hours of playing time.

303
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:01,503
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Three hours?

304
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:03,205
This is no ordinary opponent.

305
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:05,174
Who's he playing, anyway?

306
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:08,711
-Um. Let's see.

307
00:20:08,744 --> 00:20:11,447
Looks like his
opponent's called Sai.

308
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,748
-Sai?

309
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:14,116
-Sai?

310
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:16,085
-Who is this guy?

311
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:17,086
-No idea.

312
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:31,433
-Never heard of
him, but he's got

313
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:33,135
to be a pro to play like this.

314
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:34,436
-You'd think so.

315
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,105
-Hm.

316
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:37,339
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): It can't be!

317
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,445
It's Sai!

318
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,613
He's back in the game!

319
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,754
And he's playing my father!

320
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:54,690
[theme music]

321
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:23,478
SAI: For two years, Akira has
waited for me to reappear.

322
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:25,214
HIKARU: He's played
you before, so he'll

323
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:27,115
