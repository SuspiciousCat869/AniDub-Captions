[theme music]

2
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:19,317
-We all know of Hikaru Toya, but
there's also Shindou, and Ochi

3
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,823
and with Waya and the
others filling up the ranks,

4
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:25,899
there's bound to be a huge burst
of energy into the world of Go.

5
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:35,421
When I think about
the future, my heart

6
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:36,389
pounds with excitement.

7
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:56,402
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Toya

8
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,506
-You and I have played
each other twice.

9
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:01,647
Both times at the Go salon.

10
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:02,816
You are Sai.

11
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,785
You have to be.

12
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,699
I know you Shindou.

13
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,536
I know your game better
than anyone else,

14
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:14,576
and that's how I can tell.

15
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,684
I'm the only one who could know.

16
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:21,258
There is someone
else inside you.

17
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,328
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Toya.

18
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:35,023
-Never mind.

19
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,994
I'm not make much sense, am I?

20
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:48,587
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Toya can see Sai.

21
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,997
Until now, I was the only
one who knew who he was.

22
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:55,703
Sai, Toya has found you.

23
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:03,789
He found you.

24
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:18,989
-It's you.

25
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:21,495
Your life is in this game.

26
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,865
It means everything to you.

27
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:26,941
It's something that
doesn't change,

28
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:29,481
and I think that's
the way it should be.

29
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:32,821
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Wow.

30
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:46,652
Hm, my life is in this game.

31
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,692
It means everything to me.

32
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:53,001
Toya, you're right
about that but only

33
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:54,905
because Sai is in my every move.

34
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:13,447
-Maybe one day, when
I have the time,

35
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,683
I'll tell you the whole story.

36
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,169
-Shindou.

37
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,633
What did mean by that?

38
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,468
-What?

39
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:40,776
What are you talking about?

40
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:42,813
-There's something
you're not telling me.

41
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:44,017
What is it?

42
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,620
-Look, never mind.

43
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:47,725
Forget it.

44
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,061
Anyway, you're the
one who told me

45
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:52,503
my life was about playing
Go, and you're OK with that.

46
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:54,707
-Well, yeah, I
did say that but--

47
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:55,442
-Then, that's it.

48
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:56,612
End of story.

49
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:58,884
-Then why did you say
you'd tell me one day?

50
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,053
-I didn't.

51
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:03,026
I said maybe, like way
off in the future, dummy!

52
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,628
-Dummy?

53
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,448
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I'm home.

54
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:15,154
MITSUKO (VOICOVER): How'd
everything go today?

55
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:16,791
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I'm so tired.

56
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:18,795
The game was over real
quick, but afterwards, we

57
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,567
spend forever discussing it.

58
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,571
Don't you want to know who won?

59
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:24,943
MITSUKO (VOICOVER): Well, not
if you don't want to tell me.

60
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:27,148
Besides, I don't know
anything about Go.

61
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:30,122
All I care about is whether
you're doing OK or not.

62
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:31,792
If you want a bath,
you'll have to wait

63
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,262
until your father's finished.

64
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,665
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): That's OK.

65
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,101
I don't want one anyway.

66
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:38,073
MITSUKO (VOICOVER): How
about something to eat?

67
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,543
You must be hungry.

68
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:40,578
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Not really.

69
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:41,848
I think I'm going to
go straight to bed.

70
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:37,040
(SIGH) Wha-- I'm wearing shoes.

71
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:43,121
-Oh, this must be a dream.

72
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:45,626
It's hard to tell because
everything seems real.

73
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:48,333
Who knows, this
might not be a dream.

74
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:54,046
Well, if this really is a
dream, then something good

75
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,618
could happen in it.

76
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:57,101
Hopefully.

77
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:19,351
Sai!

78
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:36,743
It's you?

79
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,947
You came here to
see me in my dream?

80
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:40,852
Is that it?

81
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:43,191
(LAUGHING)

82
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:45,329
Sai, guess what happened today?

83
00:08:45,363 --> 00:08:48,102
I finally got to play Toya.

84
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:49,172
Can you believe it?

85
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:51,042
It was the first round
of the qualifiers

86
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:54,851
for the Meijin tournament.
was such a great game.

87
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:57,724
I, um, I didn't
actually win the game.

88
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:03,002
But from now on, we're going to
play each other all the time.

89
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:05,909
Hundreds of thousands of
games, me versus Toya.

90
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:07,847
And not just in
tournaments, we promised

91
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,420
to play as often as we
can over at his Go salon.

92
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:12,892
But I can't tell Morishito
Sensei because he'll get mad.

93
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,039
By the way, Isumi finally
passed the pro exam.

94
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,008
Isn't that awesome?

95
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,812
And Mitani took part
in a tournament.

96
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:24,317
Oh, you wouldn't believe what's
going on sine you disappeared.

97
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,163
There's so much to tell you.

98
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,131
A lot has happened.

99
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,319
Sai, why did you disappear?

100
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:45,332
You told me you wanted
to play Go forever, so

101
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:46,268
why'd you disappear?

102
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,504
It doesn't make any sense.

103
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,199
What were you feeling
when you left me?

104
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,206
Was everything OK?

105
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,946
Were you upset about something?

106
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,450
Or were you smiling
when you left?

107
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:16,436
I hope everything was OK.

108
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:28,063
Hey, Sai, guess
what else happened?

109
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:31,070
Toya said he can see
someone else inside of me.

110
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:31,872
I panicked.

111
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:33,007
I didn't know what to say.

112
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,114
But in a way, I was glad
that he noticed you.

113
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:39,456
he can see how much
influenced my game.

114
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:40,057
Hm?

115
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,404
Sai, you OK?

116
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,111
Sai?

117
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:50,013
Don't go!

118
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:51,951
Say something, would ya?

119
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,420
Don't leave me!

120
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,022
Don't go!

121
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:04,045
For me?

122
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:38,090
-Sai.

123
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,894
MITSUKO (VOICOVER):
Hikaru, it's past 7:00.

124
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:58,401
You're going to be
late for school.

125
00:11:58,436 --> 00:11:59,371
-It's OK.

126
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:00,006
I'm up.

127
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,488
I'm coming.

128
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:09,528
MITSUKO (VOICOVER): Are you sure
you've got everything you need?

129
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,431
-Yeah, I'll be at the
Go salon after school,

130
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,336
but I'll come home
in time for dinner.

131
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:13,937
-Hm.

132
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:20,285
-If you try saving those stones,
your position will crumble.

133
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,223
-OK, but what if I
played it this way?

134
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,328
Then it would've been better
if I hadn't moved here

135
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,497
in the first place.

136
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,635
-Isn't that young Toya
Sensei over there?

137
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:29,506
Who's he playing?

138
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,411
-Oh, that's Hikaru Shindou.

139
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:33,248
He turned pro last year.

140
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:34,083
-Really?

141
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:35,320
Does he stop by here often?

142
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,188
Regular customer?

143
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,558
-Hm-huh.

144
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:40,297
Recently, he's been coming
in here all the time.

145
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,001
-The two of them
are good friends?

146
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:45,075
-Ah, um, sort of, I guess.

147
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:46,678
-It's starting to
get ugly up there.

148
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,215
Time to make a quick exit.

149
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,053
-Yeah, let's get out of here.

150
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:51,589
-Not again.

151
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:53,461
-What's wrong?

152
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,966
TOYA: Don't say, is that
so with that tone of voice.

153
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,436
You know I'm right, Shindou.

154
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,073
-Who says, you're right?

155
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:00,243
You missed this descent here.

156
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:01,245
How obvious.

157
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,481
-Oh, if you're
talking about obvious,

158
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,219
what about the
attachment you missed,

159
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:07,259
and how many time are you going
to keep saying is that so?

160
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:08,728
-They're really going at it.

161
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:11,168
Those kids are
passionate about Go.

162
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,339
-Sure, if you say so.

163
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:16,379
TOYA: You've said it four
times in this game, not three.

164
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,516
-Like you can talk.

165
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:20,055
You said, yes, I see at
least six times already.

166
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:21,491
-Now way, I did not.

167
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:23,295
I'd never say it
that many times.

168
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:24,732
-Did too!

169
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:26,369
-I do not!

170
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:29,242
-I'm going home!

171
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,244
-Don't forget your bag.

172
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,396
You see, those two fight like
they're still in grade school.

173
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:40,401
-You say, he only
became a pro last year,

174
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:42,105
and he thinks he's
a match for Toya?

175
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:43,808
That kid's get some
nerve if he thinks

176
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:46,682
he can challenge someone who's
made it to the Honinbo league

177
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:47,650
already.

178
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:48,820
-Why is that so weird?

179
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:50,691
I'm only a three dan.

180
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:52,161
-Wah!

181
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:53,831
-No matter how strong
you are, everyone

182
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,602
has to start as a one dan.

183
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,675
And you can only move up the
rankings one level at a time.

184
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,416
You're dan ranking has nothing
to do with your strength.

185
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,420
Shindou is only a one
dan now, but nobody

186
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:04,589
should underestimate him.

187
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:13,443
-Those two we're fighting
earlier, weren't they?

188
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:16,716
-Oh, yes.

189
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:19,457
-I wish I could play more
high ranking players.

190
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:20,325
-Yeah?

191
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:22,196
So who's your opponent today?

192
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,766
-Kowasaki, three dan.

193
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,871
It's my third game in
the Honinbo qualifiers.

194
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:34,724
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Toya is already

195
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:37,464
battling against some of
the top players in the game,

196
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:41,406
and I'm still just a one dan.

197
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,612
I have to advance through
the first qualifying round

198
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:45,616
in every tournament,
not just the Honinbo.

199
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:50,861
All the games are against
the lower ranking guys,

200
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:52,498
but it's something I gotta do.

201
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:03,623
-OK, I'm hungry.

202
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:05,461
-Are you going somewhere
for lunch, Shindou?

203
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:06,363
-Yeah.

204
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:08,635
-I ordered mine,
so I'll stay in.

205
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:09,931
-K.

206
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,862
-Time for some katsudon.

207
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:21,799
-Hey.

208
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,204
-Huh?

209
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,676
-You're his friend,
why's he still a one dan?

210
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,850
Do you know?

211
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:32,890
Why is someone as good as
Shindou still only a one dan?

212
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,605
WAYA (VOICEOVER):
Well, you see, you

213
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,648
remember the guy who skipped all
of his games earlier this year?

214
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:45,686
GUY AT GO SALON (VOICEOVER):
Oh, yeah, I think so.

215
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,390
Why?

216
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:48,593
-That was Shindou.

217
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,563
By not showing up, he lost
a lot of games by default.

218
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:52,502
Even if his winning
streak continues,

219
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,239
it'll be a long
time before he earns

220
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:56,377
enough points for a promotion.

221
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:59,418
So he'll be a one dan
for quite a while.

222
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:01,823
-But that seems so unfair.

223
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:04,462
He's way too good to
play at this level.

224
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:05,832
He's the strongest
one dan around.

225
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,797
WAYA (VOICEOVER):
Shindou's practically

226
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:22,303
won his game already.

227
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:24,742
The obvious response to
blacks indirect connection

228
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:26,902
would have been to extend.

229
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,638
But I guess he thought
that was too easy

230
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:30,506
and decided to make a
contact play instead.

231
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:37,780
That move was perfectly timed.

232
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:41,450
-Hey, Waya.

233
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:45,121
-Huh?

234
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:47,857
Shindou, what have
you got there?

235
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,393
-You mean this?

236
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,895
I saw it in the shop
and decided to buy it.

237
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,903
-You bought that?

238
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:02,738
-I did, yeah.

239
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,241
OK, let's finish this game.

240
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,273
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Sai, one day,

241
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:41,644
you and I are going to play
the divine move together.

242
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:42,162
