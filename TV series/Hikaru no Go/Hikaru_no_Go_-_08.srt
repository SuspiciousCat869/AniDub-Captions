NARRATOR: After many
years inside a go board,

2
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:10,452
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:13,591
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:17,598
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

6
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:49,329
-You coward!

7
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:53,570
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I'm gonna make

8
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:55,774
him wait until I can
play as good as him.

9
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:56,776
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Wait.

10
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,212
It isn't him.

11
00:01:58,212 --> 00:01:59,681
It's me.

12
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:01,350
I'm the one who's scared.

13
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:03,521
I'm the one who's running back.

14
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:06,627
If that's your plan, then I'm
going to do the same thing.

15
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,729
I won't back down.

16
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:22,522
-Hm.

17
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:23,457
Here it is.

18
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,493
What do you think?

19
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:26,496
-That's the one we've
been looking for.

20
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:28,199
CLER: Will there
be anything else?

21
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:28,800
HIKARU: Um, yeah.

22
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,537
I'll take this, and this.

23
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:38,351
-Your total comes to 1,600 yen.

24
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:41,122
-I got you a copy of that
manual you asked about.

25
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:42,892
It's the same book
that Tetsuo ripped up.

26
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:45,263
-I'm certain that it'll
be an enlightening read

27
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:46,800
for both of us.

28
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,669
Perhaps you and
Akari would benefit

29
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,405
from studying the book together.

30
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:51,440
-Akari?

31
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:53,111
This stuff's way too
advanced for her.

32
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:54,179
-Why's that?

33
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:55,381
-Listen.

34
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:57,852
She can't tell the difference
between Othello and Go.

35
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:58,520
-Othello?

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,622
What is that?

37
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:01,559
-It's another game
played with stones.

38
00:03:01,592 --> 00:03:02,527
Uh oh.

39
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,230
Look how dark it is already.

40
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:06,668
If I don't get home soon,
my folks are gonna flip out.

41
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,839
I wish I had brought
a watch with me.

42
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:11,610
There's gotta be a
clock here somewhere.

43
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:12,612
Found one.

44
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:13,280
Oh no!

45
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:14,516
It's almost 7:30.

46
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:15,684
Huh?

47
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:18,423
Toya Meijin has one the Judon.

48
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:20,593
This is his fourth major title.

49
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:22,797
Akira's dad is really cleaning
up at the tournaments.

50
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,668
He's unstoppable.

51
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:28,374
SAI (VOICEOVER): That man's
skill has reached a new level.

52
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:31,813
Higher and higher he goes.

53
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:33,817
HIKARU: I wonder what
Akira's doing right now.

54
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,587
BOY: Why's he replaying
old games by himself?

55
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,291
-He probably thinks
we're not good enough

56
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:57,493
to be his opponents.

57
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:58,762
-You heard of Toya Meijin?

58
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:00,798
The guy who holds
four major titles?

59
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:02,468
That's his dad.

60
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:04,305
-Yeah, I saw him
on TV yesterday.

61
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:05,240
Four titles.

62
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:06,309
It's unbelievable.

63
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:08,412
Personally, I'd be
happy to win just one.

64
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:10,582
-His father's the best
of the best, isn't he?

65
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,285
-He's the king of Go.

66
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,554
-Yep.

67
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,391
-And we've got his son, the
prince, sitting right there.

68
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,827
-Think he's any good?

69
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,398
-They say that one day,
he'll surpass his dad.

70
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:20,734
-Yeah, right.

71
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,805
I dare you to challenge
him to a game.

72
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:24,207
-What am I, crazy?

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,776
You play him.

74
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,312
-Akira.

75
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:29,650
Your dad's an amazing player.

76
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:31,320
Please congratulate him for me.

77
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,756
Winning the Judan like that.

78
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,292
It is quite a victory.

79
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:35,928
-Uh, oh.

80
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:36,930
Thank you, sir.

81
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:38,599
I'll be sure to pass that along.

82
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:48,717
MR. YUN: This boy's a mystery.

83
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:49,753
He so unemotional.

84
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:59,871
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): You're
the reason I'm here, Hikaru.

85
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,908
I joined this club
because of you.

86
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:03,511
Kaio means nothing to me.

87
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:10,490
There's only one thought in
my mind, catching up to you.

88
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,896
I'll train all day, every day,
until I get to play you again.

89
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:21,409
And once I've defeated
you, maybe I'll

90
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:24,715
finally be able to
achieve the Divine Move.

91
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:29,658
BOY: I gotta throw in the towel.

92
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:31,394
You're just too good.

93
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:32,463
Wow, I'm impressed.

94
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:34,333
You're really in the zone today.

95
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,769
-Yup.

96
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:36,904
-Wanna play again?

97
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:37,605
Come on.

98
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:38,574
-Naw, maybe later.

99
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,744
-Aw.

100
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:41,913
-Thanks for the game.

101
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:42,781
-Yeah, you too.

102
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:43,549
That was awesome.

103
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,293
-Akira.

104
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:51,396
Would you like to play a game?

105
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:51,839
-Oh?

106
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:56,706
-Look at this.

107
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:57,574
-Yeah, OK.

108
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:58,676
Why don't you pull up a chair?

109
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:04,319
-Onegai shimasu.

110
00:06:04,354 --> 00:06:04,821
-Onegai shimasu.

111
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,431
-What is he doing?

112
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:30,768
-He's sure got guts.

113
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,420
-What's going on?

114
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,858
I'm a seventh grader and I
don't know everybody's name yet.

115
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:03,960
Who's the guy over there?

116
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:06,398
The one playing Akira
Toya Is he any good?

117
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:08,702
-That's Aoki, and he's
our third best player,

118
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:10,672
behind the team
captain and co-captain.

119
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:12,008
He's in the ninth grade.

120
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:12,609
-Oh.

121
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:19,421
BOY: In other
words, Aoki's going

122
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:22,092
to lose his place on the
team now that Touya's here.

123
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:23,696
There's only room
for three players,

124
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,065
and someone's got to go.

125
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,612
He's a nice guy, always
helping us with our training.

126
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:33,613
-Yeah.

127
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:34,882
Looks like he's
taken the initiative

128
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:37,554
to settle the question of woh
gets the last spot on the team.

129
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,590
If he loses, he'll
come to terms with it.

130
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:40,926
He's pretty thick-skinned.

131
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,928
-He hasn't lost yet.

132
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,997
This will be interesting.

133
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:21,967
-I resign.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,507
[gasping]

135
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:26,776
-That was fast.

136
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:32,887
-Toya, I learned a
lot from this game.

137
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,992
I want to thank
you for playing me.

138
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:36,727
-Any time.

139
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:04,610
-That Toya sure has
got a lot of nerve.

140
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:13,993
GIRL: This is the
legendary Kaio Go club?

141
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:16,531
everyone seems
totally depressed.

142
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:18,668
And it's all because
of that Akira Touya.

143
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:21,073
I've always wanted to
play Go at this school.

144
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,475
Can't anyone match him?

145
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:23,978
It's not fair.

146
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:24,646
-Wake up.

147
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,480
It's your move.

148
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:26,148
-Hold on.

149
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:29,488
I've got it!

150
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:32,827
I just got the best idea ever.

151
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:34,664
I'm gonna play Touya.

152
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:35,698
I have a plan.

153
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:38,003
I know I can't win, but
I won't lose either.

154
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,647
Let's play, me and
you, what do you say?

155
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,649
-That'd be great.

156
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:45,449
-Who's that?

157
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:46,718
-Some new kid.

158
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:47,720
He's in seventh grade.

159
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,756
I hope he's good.

160
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,725
-What should we set
your handicap at?

161
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,829
-I don't need one, as
long as I go first.

162
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:53,965
Is that all right with you?

163
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:55,634
-Sure, OK.

164
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:56,102
-Cool.

165
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:57,939
Onegai shimasu.

166
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,476
-Onegai shimasu.

167
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:01,845
-That kid is out of his mind.

168
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,981
-He's an idiot.

169
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,216
-No kidding.

170
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,454
-Toya's gonna crush him.

171
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:07,623
-This should be fun to watch.

172
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:15,503
AKIRA: That's a
strange opening move.

173
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:17,608
-(VOICEOVER) As long as I
control that center point,

174
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:20,946
I've got this game in the bag,
and there's nothing you can do.

175
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,840
-(VOICEOVER) A copycat.

176
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:55,324
Hm.

177
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:00,284
-(VOICEOVER) He's
figured it out.

178
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:05,760
It doesn't matter, though.

179
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:08,865
The center point is mine, and
as long as I mirror his moves,

180
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,170
there's absolutely nothing
he can do to stop me.

181
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,240
I'll reflect his skill
right back at him.

182
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:14,676
He'll wind up beating himself.

183
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:19,685
-Did you see that?

184
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,520
Toya hesitated.

185
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:46,081
-Heh.

186
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,982
-If that's the way
you want to play--

187
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,962
(VOICEOVER) This guy's
trying to trick me.

188
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:03,564
Hm.

189
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:09,942
I won't fall into his trap.

190
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:12,246
If he expects me to
stop mirroring him,

191
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,249
he's got another thing coming.

192
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:09,282
Oh, no!

193
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,073
-It's your turn to move.

194
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:26,913
-I resign.

195
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:37,298
That guy knew my
weaknesses before I did.

196
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:38,635
It's like he read my mind.

197
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:40,004
-What was going
through your head?

198
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:42,408
Toya's too smart to fall
for such a simple trick.

199
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:43,142
-Chill out.

200
00:13:43,176 --> 00:13:44,845
Go easy on the poor kid.

201
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:46,882
-He lured you into filling
in your own liberties,

202
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:47,918
and you took the bait.

203
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,187
Or he could have used a ladder.

204
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:50,789
It doesn't matter, though.

205
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,925
[groan]

206
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,196
-Either way, you still
would have lost the game.

207
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:55,298
-Hold on.

208
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,969
If you're so smart,
why don't you play him?

209
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,839
-BOY: You better
caln down, newbie.

210
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,909
I don't want you to go
and do something stupid.

211
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,347
You'll wind up embarrassing
the Kaio Go club.

212
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,318
-Someone should put
Toya in his place.

213
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:07,854
He's messing up everything.

214
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:10,692
-Do you think he's going to be
our team captain at the next Go

215
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,174
tournament?

216
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:11,994
-Probably.

217
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:13,430
He's practically a pro already.

218
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:15,267
They say he's going
to be a future Meijin.

219
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,003
-I'm not sure if I
should have asked him

220
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:18,806
for a game or an autograph.

221
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:20,108
-I left my autograph
book at home,

222
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:22,212
but maybe I could
challenge him to a match.

223
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:23,782
I could brag all
about it one day.

224
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:26,721
Everyone would know I faced
off against a real live legend.

225
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:28,390
If I managed to
capture a stone or two,

226
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:29,993
I might even get a signed photo.

227
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:31,162
Wow!

228
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,332
BOY: I think you're setting
your goals way too low.

229
00:14:37,673 --> 00:14:38,175
Huh?

230
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,078
[car horn]

231
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:40,879
-Akira!

232
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,150
Over here.

233
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:45,388
-Miss Ichikawa, what
are you doing here?

234
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:46,790
-Hello, there.

235
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:48,960
I thought you might
want a lift home.

236
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,162
-Are you sure?

237
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:51,364
It's kind of far.

238
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:52,767
-You're gonna get soaked.

239
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,804
Come on, get inside the car.

240
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:56,240
Wel, don't just stand there.

241
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:59,847
Get in.

242
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:01,349
You promised me a
teaching game today.

243
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:03,120
I hope you haven't
forgotten about it.

244
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,922
-I would never break a promise.

245
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:05,958
-Are you hungry?

246
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,694
I've got some cake
and coffee for you.

247
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,978
-Did she just say
cake and coffee?

248
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:21,118
It's not fair!

249
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:22,420
-Now that I think
about it, maybe I

250
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,825
would enjoy humiliating
that little brat.

251
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:25,760
-Senpai!

252
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:27,997
-I'm behind you 100%.

253
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,268
But how can you beat
him without a handicap?

254
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,505
You'd be better off running
for class valedictorian.

255
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,976
At least it'd be easier.

256
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,947
-He's got to have
some kind of weakness.

257
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,983
But what could it be?

258
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:41,989
-In a fair fight, Toya
can easily defeat me.

259
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:43,191
There's no doubt.

260
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:43,792
-Huh.

261
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:44,494
-Bit shot.

262
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:45,395
What are you thinking?

263
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:46,730
Spit it out?

264
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:47,866
-We've got to surprise him.

265
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:50,170
Catch him totally off guard.

266
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:51,306
BOY: But how?

267
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,075
You've got a plan,
right, Senpai?

268
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:03,327
-What a storm.

269
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,030
It's starting to
rain pretty hard.

270
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,008
-We should get going.

271
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:11,875
-OK.

272
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:14,146
I wonder why Akari showed up?

273
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:15,182
-Aw, who cares?

274
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:17,286
We don't need her, anyway.

275
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:19,422
TSUTSUI: You were kind of
hard on her the other day.

276
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:21,426
You really shouldn't have
yelled at her like that.

277
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:22,895
-I've known her for a long time.

278
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,164
She's got thicker
skin than that.

279
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:26,001
Relax, it's not a problem.

280
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,169
She's fine.

281
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:28,840
-You owe her an apology.

282
00:16:28,873 --> 00:16:31,077
Invite her back to the club.

283
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:31,878
-Give me a break!

284
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:33,014
Go is a boy's game.

285
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:34,817
You should get that
through your head already.

286
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:37,021
SAI: I'm afraid that's not true.

287
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:38,189
-Huh?

288
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:40,994
-Many women throughout the
Heian capital played Go.

289
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:42,865
They were quite
skilled, you know?

290
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,945
-Look, everyone.

291
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,983
Master Sai has chosen
to pay us a visit.

292
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,030
-Both Sei Shonagon
and Murasaki Shikibu

293
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:04,136
were avid Go enthusiasts.

294
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,339
-Huh?

295
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,175
-You learned about them
in class yesterday.

296
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:07,810
Remember?

297
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:08,284
-What?

298
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:08,945
I did?

299
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:16,792
Oh, Sai?

300
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:18,562
-Yes?

301
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:20,399
-Pretty cool, huh?

302
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:21,468
-No.

303
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:23,337
I was merely playing
along with your joke.

304
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:24,539
-Really?

305
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:27,544
-I've seen you use that
device several times now.

306
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:29,215
-You thought my
umbrella was awesome

307
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,486
the first time I showed
you how it worked.

308
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:33,122
-What did she say?

309
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:33,856
-Me?

310
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:36,093
Nothing.

311
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:38,498
-I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

312
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:39,233
-OK.

313
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:40,033
I'll see you later.

314
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:04,511
-The Go board has remained
unchanged for centuries,

315
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:07,082
and the umbrella is the
same as it's always been.

316
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,858
HIKARU: I guess you're right.

317
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,094
You know, they never were
very good to begin with.

318
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:15,865
They don't keep you totally dry.

319
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:17,634
And your feet still
wind up soaking wet.

320
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:20,105
They're easy to lose, they're
hard to hold in your hand.

321
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:24,614
How come they never improved it?

322
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:26,083
Seems kind of silly, doesn't it?

323
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:27,085
-Yes.

324
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:28,187
-They can put them
a man on the moon,

325
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:30,090
but they can't make
a decent umbrella.

326
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:31,259
-What did you say?

327
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:32,528
You can't be serious.

328
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,264
I wish you wouldn't
tease me like that.

329
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:37,270
It's cruel to even suggest that
a man could travel to the moon.

330
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:38,104
-Yep.

331
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:39,908
We've already gone there.

332
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:40,910
I'm serious.

333
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:42,312
I could show you
pictures if you want.

334
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:43,548
-Impossible!

335
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:44,917
That couldn't have happened.

336
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,019
Right, Hikaru?

337
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:48,290
It's really not polite
to tell such tall tales.

338
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:50,226
That's certainly the
most ridiculous story

339
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,228
I've ever heard.

340
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:53,131
I mean, just consider
it for a moment.

341
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,535
Man on the moon.

342
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:55,870
[laughter]

343
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,905
SAI: Hikaru, listen to me.

344
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:59,944
Did man really
travel to the moon?

345
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:02,882
The same moon that floats
in the sky at night?

346
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:03,551
HIKARU: You got it.

347
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:05,420
Took you long enough.

348
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:08,025
SAI: If man can go
to the moon, then

349
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:10,931
why are umbrellas
still umbrellas?

350
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,567
HIKARU: Uh-- huh?

351
00:19:19,412 --> 00:19:21,482
-It doesn't matter how
we set up the game.

352
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:23,920
As long as I manage to beat
Touya without a handicap,

353
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,923
I don't care what we have to do.

354
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,493
-Now, don't get
too carried away.

355
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:28,629
-I'm with you.

356
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:30,265
Beating him is all
that counts, guys.

357
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:32,903
It doesn't matter how do it,
as long as we come out on top.

358
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,945
What if we waited until he
got really, really sick, like

359
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:39,681
if he had the flu or something?

360
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:43,088
BOY: If he was ill, he
wouldn't come to school.

361
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:45,525
-We could always challenge him
to a game in the karaoke room.

362
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,161
I'd turn up the
music so loud, it'd

363
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:48,632
be impossible for
him to concentrate.

364
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,234
-He's still find a to defeat me.

365
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:53,072
We've gotta put him at a huge
disadvantage for this plan

366
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:53,640
to work.

367
00:19:53,674 --> 00:19:54,608
-I've got an idea.

368
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:56,077
We could tie up
his hands and feet

369
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,415
and make him place the
stones with his teeth.

370
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,190
-I kinda like that idea.

371
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:03,673
-Huh?

372
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,286
-Hm.

373
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:19,769
There.

374
00:20:24,195 --> 00:20:27,000
BOY: I'll teach that
wonder kid a thing or two.

375
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:29,958
When I'm done with him, he'll
never touch a Go stone again!

376
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,595
I swear it.

377
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:36,498
He'll regret the day he ever
set foot in the Kaio Go club!

378
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:56,351
[theme music]

379
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:21,670
HIKARU: Akira's
gonna have to play

380
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:23,972
a game without
looking at the board.

381
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:26,575
SAI: It's a very
difficult challenge.

382
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:28,610
HIKARU: More like impossible.

383
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:32,214
If he doesn't win, he might
quit the Kaio Go club.

384
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:35,250
SAI: You should think about
your own club, Hikaru.

385
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:36,385
You need another player.

386
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:41,957
HIKARU: Next time, Eyesore.

387
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,596
I'll find someone!
