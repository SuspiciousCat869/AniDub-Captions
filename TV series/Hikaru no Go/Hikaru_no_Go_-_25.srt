1
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:07,513
After many years
inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:10,518
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:13,656
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindo.

4
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:17,496
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,068
[theme music]

6
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,191
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): I won't
go on the defensive just yet.

7
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:56,460
I'm still in a good position.

8
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:08,780
I'll show him.

9
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:12,587
He'll be jealous
of my every move.

10
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,724
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I think
I know what's driving him.

11
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:18,429
Akira, there's a message for me
in here somewhere, isn't there?

12
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:22,603
-You know what?

13
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:24,473
I'm going to remember
everything about this match

14
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:26,477
for a long time.

15
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:27,478
I really liked it.

16
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:28,446
It was cool.

17
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,244
-Shindo, Shindo.

18
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:48,646
-Mhm?

19
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,850
-How come you don't
have a Go teacher?

20
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:53,755
You can't improve your game
if you're playing by yourself.

21
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,291
-You got one?

22
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:57,528
-I've been studying
with Morishita 9-dan.

23
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:00,666
I go over to his place after
school for some private lessons

24
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,737
and coaching.

25
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,540
So how do you train?

26
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:07,244
-Well, when I'm at home, I uh--

27
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:09,381
-Get intensive training.

28
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:11,752
-More like painful training.

29
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:15,157
-Oh, you mean you just work
through stuff on your own?

30
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,560
-I bet you reconstruct
famous games

31
00:03:16,593 --> 00:03:18,863
and work at life and death
problems on the board, right?

32
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:21,768
You often learn a lot
from that kind of thing.

33
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,606
-You can't ahead
without a teacher.

34
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,542
You've got to have
more than just talent.

35
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:28,279
You'll never get
stronger unless you're

36
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:30,115
playing as much as
you can against people

37
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:31,251
who are better than you.

38
00:03:31,284 --> 00:03:34,121
And that's what counts.

39
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,392
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Play as
much as I can against people

40
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:37,528
who are better than me?

41
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:41,534
That's all I seem to
do day in and day out.

42
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,605
SAI (VOICEOVER): Well, in
that case, your progress

43
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:45,608
could be considered
to be a little slow.

44
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,344
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): What?

45
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:50,549
-Hey, Shindo, why don't
you try our study session?

46
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:52,352
See how you like it.

47
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:54,155
-Really?

48
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:56,392
-It's just like what we
do at the insei classes,

49
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:58,395
but the guys are at a
totally different level.

50
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:01,668
Some of my teacher-students
come into the session.

51
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:04,907
They're all pros,
every one of them.

52
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,579
We rent a room at the Go
Association every week.

53
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:09,614
What do you say?

54
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:12,286
-Nah, I don't think so.

55
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,487
-Go!

56
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,422
You're going!

57
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:15,624
You're going, Hikaru!

58
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:18,329
Do you hear me?

59
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:18,796
-What?

60
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,265
What happened?

61
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:21,768
-Shindo?

62
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:24,906
-OK, OK, ask your
teacher if I can come.

63
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:31,150
-Hikaru, what are you doing?

64
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,688
We're going to be late
for the study session.

65
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:36,626
This is no time to be standing
there staring at fake fish,

66
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,262
no matter how real they look.

67
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:40,765
-Stop bugging me and give
me a minute, would you?

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,769
Can't you see I'm kind of
nervous about going in?

69
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,877
I've got no idea what
goes on in there.

70
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:49,213
-Huh?

71
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:50,315
-I wish Waya was here.

72
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:51,818
The pros look scary.

73
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,254
-What was that you were
saying to yourself?

74
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:55,423
-Huh?

75
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:57,326
-Why are you here?

76
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:59,897
There aren't any
insei classes today.

77
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:02,702
-I was told there was some
sort of study session.

78
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,672
-Study session?

79
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,607
And who's the teacher?

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,508
-You got me.

81
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,579
I mean, I don't really know.

82
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:11,717
-Hikaru, this is the
gentleman who helped you

83
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:13,854
so that you could
take the insei test.

84
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:15,590
You should thank him for it.

85
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,627
-Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.

86
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,565
By the way, I want to
thank you for letting

87
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:21,934
me take the insei test.

88
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:25,874
-Hm, so you want to study, huh?

89
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:29,347
How would you like to
join Toya Meijin's class?

90
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:32,251
-Toya Meijin and I have
the same aspiration.

91
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:34,388
We both want to play
the Divine Move.

92
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:35,490
-Yeah.

93
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:37,260
I guess I don't really
know what goes on

94
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:38,562
during one of the
study sessions.

95
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:40,865
Do you guys just play a
lot of games and stuff?

96
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,501
-What?

97
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:44,806
You had no idea what
you were going to do?

98
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,608
Well, we do play
against each other,

99
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:48,344
but it's mostly discussion.

100
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:51,383
We might play a game
and then analyze it.

101
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,755
Sometimes, we replay a famous
title match from the past.

102
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,559
That way, we get
an insight into how

103
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:59,897
Toya Meijin thinks
when he plays.

104
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:02,234
-What about Akira Toya?

105
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,405
Will he be there?

106
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:05,372
-Yes.

107
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,477
You two would be
good for each other.

108
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,213
-Hikaru, we have to attend.

109
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:12,751
He'll be playing and
discussing his moves.

110
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:14,621
What are we waiting for?

111
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:16,291
-I won't go.

112
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,760
-Hikaru, what?

113
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,266
-I'm not saying you have to give
up your other study session.

114
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:21,933
-That's not it.

115
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,871
I don't want to study with Toya.

116
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,407
I only want to
compete against him.

117
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:27,776
-Huh?

118
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,981
-He's my-- you see, Toya's my--

119
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,488
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): If I
told him he's my rival,

120
00:06:34,522 --> 00:06:35,723
he'd never believe me.

121
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:38,327
Not when I'm ranked
18th in the B-league.

122
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:41,232
But there's no way we could
study together like friends.

123
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:42,735
No way.

124
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:44,471
-Oh, Hikaru.

125
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,009
-You want to
compete against him?

126
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:47,943
Hmph.

127
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:49,947
Well, I shall look
forward to that.

128
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:57,793
-Hey, what were you and
Ogata-sensei talking about?

129
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,264
-He wanted me to go to
Toya Meijin's study group.

130
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:01,700
-Why would he invite
someone like you?

131
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,805
-None of your business.

132
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:07,710
-The Young Lions tournament's
coming up in a few months.

133
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,413
Maybe I'll get a
chance to see you

134
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:11,783
and Toya compete against
each other there.

135
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:13,652
-Young Lions, what's that?

136
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:16,825
-Are you completely
clueless or what?

137
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,428
It's a tournament
where the insei

138
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:19,830
play against the young pros.

139
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:21,700
-We get a chance to
play against young pros?

140
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:29,379
I don't suppose
you know if Toya's

141
00:07:29,412 --> 00:07:31,415
going to be entering
the tournament?

142
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:32,951
-You will be there, won't you?

143
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:33,686
-You betcha.

144
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,989
Of course I will.

145
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,561
-Then I'll look forward
to seeing you both play.

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,337
-The Young Lions tournament.

147
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:45,706
I'd never even
heard of it before.

148
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,876
This is so cool.

149
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:50,014
-Shindo, you don't
know anything about it.

150
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,015
-I sure do.

151
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:53,319
The insei play against
the young pros.

152
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:56,391
-Don't get too excited because
only the top 16 in the A-league

153
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:57,358
can enter.

154
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,927
-Huh?

155
00:07:58,961 --> 00:07:59,763
You sure?

156
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,699
The top 16 in the A-league?

157
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:02,701
-Yep.

158
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,704
The new ratings are
announced in May.

159
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:07,442
So whoever makes it
into the top 16 by then

160
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,813
gets to play in the
tournament against the pros.

161
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:10,981
Of course, I'll be there.

162
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:14,421
But what about you, Mr.
18th in the B-league?

163
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:19,462
-Well, only the top 16, and
I'm 18th in the B-league,

164
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:20,331
so that means--

165
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:20,931
-Face it.

166
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:22,067
You don't stand a chance.

167
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,905
Forget about Toya.

168
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,341
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He's right.

169
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:27,910
Akira's not going to
wait for me forever.

170
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:32,718
It'll be tough, Sai.

171
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:34,854
[crying]

172
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,423
-What are you crying
for, huh, Sai?

173
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,604
-I wanted to go to
Meijin's study session.

174
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:45,805
-Enough already.

175
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,110
There's going to be pro
players in this session too.

176
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:50,079
-Oh yes, of course,
I'd forgotten that.

177
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,949
I suppose I can make do.

178
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:53,051
-I give up.

179
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,854
-Hello, we're here.

180
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:55,822
Come on, Shindo.

181
00:08:55,856 --> 00:08:56,456
Come in.

182
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:57,458
[gasp]

183
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,628
-Look who's here.

184
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:00,997
-Huh?

185
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:01,999
Sensei?

186
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:03,068
-Huh?

187
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:06,340
Hikaru Shindo, what
are you doing here?

188
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:07,675
-You know him?

189
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:12,016
-He used to attend a
little Go class that I run.

190
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,854
-Waya, you said you were
going to bring and insei.

191
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,755
Is this him?

192
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,091
-Yes.

193
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:17,859
-Insei?

194
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:19,462
You're an insei?

195
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:21,031
-Is that unexpected?

196
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:24,904
-Uh, well, unexpected?

197
00:09:24,904 --> 00:09:27,375
Not exactly unexpected.

198
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:29,912
But it's definitely a
bit of a surprise. .

199
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,049
A year ago, he was just
a beginner at the game,

200
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:34,352
and now he's an insei?

201
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:35,488
-Ah.

202
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,990
-That's as fast as Kurata.

203
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:39,361
-You told me he was
in the B-league.

204
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,364
Are you sure he's good
enough to be here?

205
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:43,569
-I'm going to make it into
the A-league in no time.

206
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:46,506
All the way to the top 16.

207
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:48,677
I want to enter the
Young Lions tournament.

208
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,413
I mean, I have to.

209
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:52,049
Otherwise, no one
will believe me

210
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:55,387
when I tell them I'm going
to defeat Akira Toya.

211
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,125
I have to enter that tournament
if it's the last thing I do.

212
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,795
I want to make sure
he knows I'm going

213
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:01,130
to catch up to him one day.

214
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:02,366
-Good for you.

215
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:04,402
So your goal is to defeat Toya?

216
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,740
Stick with us and we can
help you improve your game

217
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,976
to achieve that goal.

218
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:09,110
-Yes, sir.

219
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:10,947
-And I hope this
won't distract you

220
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,917
from your goal of
defeating Toya Meijin.

221
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,986
-Course not.

222
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,522
Nothing could
distract me from that.

223
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:19,427
-Morishita-sensei and Toya
Meijin have always been rivals.

224
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:22,065
It's so intense, I wonder
how they became friends.

225
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,436
-We are not friends.

226
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,838
-You're still in the B-league.

227
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:26,640
-Hmph.

228
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:27,441
-Don't worry about it.

229
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:28,643
You'll improve in no time.

230
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:30,680
We've still got three months
to get you into shape.

231
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,016
As long as you do your best.

232
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:32,716
-Yes, sir.

233
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:40,529
Thank you.

234
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:42,098
Good game.

235
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:43,534
Lost again.

236
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:46,706
I haven't won a single
game since last week.

237
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:48,944
I wish you'd stop
looking so depressed.

238
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:51,782
I'm going to be fine.

239
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:52,950
-Shindo.

240
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,685
-Huh?

241
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:54,987
-I'm your next opponent.

242
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,988
You want to get started?

243
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,661
-Onegaishimasu.

244
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:07,541
-Hikaru, I think I know the
reason why you keep losing.

245
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:14,686
-Another loss.

246
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,692
It was only by a small
amount, but I still lost.

247
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:21,430
If I keep going like this, I'll
never make it into the top 16

248
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,532
in time for the tournament.

249
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:25,504
-Hikaru?

250
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:30,445
Hikaru.

251
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:31,447
STUDENT 1: I don't know.

252
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:34,519
M-- Maybe I should quit.

253
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:35,988
STUDENT 2: But why?

254
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,492
STUDENT 1: Let's face it, I
haven't been doing good here.

255
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:39,894
And there's no
reason for me to stay

256
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,998
if I'm not going to
make it as a pro.

257
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:44,168
I should start
thinking about college,

258
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:47,507
try and figure out what I
want to do with my life.

259
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,811
You know I don't
have a Go teacher.

260
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:52,482
It's times like this
that you really need one.

261
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:53,517
-Why's that?

262
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,086
So he can give
you encouragement?

263
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,655
-Yeah, right.

264
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:59,694
More like so he can
tell me the truth.

265
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:03,100
Ryo, maybe you should
consider doing something else.

266
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,736
Stuff like that.

267
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:08,608
Then I just could just
quit and be done with it.

268
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,546
-You're being too
hard on yourself.

269
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:11,747
So you had a run of bad luck.

270
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:13,651
Don't let it get to you.

271
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:15,020
Look, when you win
your next game,

272
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,757
you'll feel a whole lot better.

273
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,059
-He's right.

274
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:22,164
All I have to do is win one
game and I'll be back on track.

275
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:25,169
Everybody goes on a losing
streak now and again.

276
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,605
Yeah, everyone.

277
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,191
-This is where the stone
was placed in the match.

278
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,563
Whichever way you look
at it, it was a bad move.

279
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:43,968
-But he didn't seem to have
any other alternatives.

280
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,670
Where else could he have gone?

281
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:47,273
-Make a sudden move,
and the opponent

282
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:50,979
will likely back off and
solidify his territory.

283
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:53,950
-How about if he'd simply
played a quick parry?

284
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:56,021
-No, that would have left
the corner vulnerable.

285
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:57,791
Maybe if he'd played over here.

286
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:00,495
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I'm lucky
to have all this extra training,

287
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:02,665
but I don't seem to
be getting any better.

288
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,969
-Ah, Hikaru.

289
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:06,237
-What is it, Sai?

290
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:09,176
-I know you told me
to keep out of things,

291
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:12,047
and I don't want you to
think I'm interfering.

292
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,816
-It's OK.

293
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:14,585
Go ahead, I'm listening.

294
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:16,021
-I have the solution.

295
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:18,525
If you place the
next stone here,

296
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:20,195
it will be difficult
for your opponent

297
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:23,567
to respond without
leaving himself open.

298
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,505
-Oh, yeah, that might work.

299
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,974
Can I say something?

300
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,510
-What?

301
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,046
The guy who keeps losing games
in the B-league has the answer?

302
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:31,913
-Erg.

303
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:32,815
-It's all right.

304
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:33,917
Go ahead.

305
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:37,990
-What about going here.

306
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:39,559
-Oh, yes.

307
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:40,928
-OK, let's put the stone there.

308
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:42,799
-Oh, nice move.

309
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:43,933
-Not bad.

310
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:46,037
-I never saw that.

311
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:48,674
-Not bad at all.

312
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,077
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Way to go, Sai.

313
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,150
That's more like it.

314
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:58,925
-No way.

315
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,596
How can I have dropped down
so far in the rankings?

316
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,799
My game record for
February is the pits.

317
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,202
Now I've got to
start all over again

318
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,972
from the bottom of the B-league.

319
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:09,142
Why me?

320
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:11,947
I won't even make it into the
A-league, let alone the Young

321
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,183
Lions tournament.

322
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:16,688
I've only got two
months left to go.

323
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,624
Why is this happening?

324
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,294
I'm playing against
you every day.

325
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,829
-That's the reason.

326
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:24,067
-Huh?

327
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,239
-You're not winning because
you've been playing me.

328
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,184
-Honinbo Shusaku,
that's what the pro

329
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:36,821
replied without hesitation.

330
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:39,259
-The greatest player
in the history of Go.

331
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:42,798
-I remember reading that
magazine article a while back.

332
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,102
Just shows how unique Go is.

333
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:47,605
Even though we continue
to study and develop

334
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,277
our knowledge of the game, a
player who lived centuries ago

335
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,315
is still recognized as
the best player ever.

336
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:56,721
-It's a game dependent on
character as well as skill.

337
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:57,990
-I agree.

338
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,260
I could never compete
with Shusaku's ability

339
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:01,963
to read a game.

340
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:05,702
It's like he knew every possible
outcome, right, Ashiwara?

341
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,005
-Oh yeah.

342
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:09,609
But what if we confused
him with some modern joseki

343
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,978
he'd never seen before.

344
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:12,714
-It might throw him
initially, but I'm

345
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:15,252
sure he'd catch on to the
modern game in no time.

346
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:16,688
-Huh?

347
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:18,324
-If that happened,
he'd be invincible.

348
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:22,597
Even Toya Meijin
might not be-- oh.

349
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:24,200
-Sensei, Ashiwara
was just telling--

350
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:26,303
-Sasaki, it wasn't important.

351
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:29,142
Let's concentrate on the game.

352
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:32,280
-Someone with the skill
of Honinbo Shusaku who's

353
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,617
able to play the modern game.

354
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:38,290
There is someone like that.

355
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:41,729
-Sai isn't a professional,
but he's getting stronger.

356
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:43,331
You know what?

357
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:47,639
If Shusaku had learned modern
joseki, he'd play like Sai.

358
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:49,976
-That article about
the greatest player,

359
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,180
is that what you were
talking about just now?

360
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:53,649
-Oh no.

361
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:56,087
I was discussing who might
be a worthy rival for someone

362
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,856
as good as you, sensei.

363
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:00,761
-I consider everyone
to be a worthy rival.

364
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:04,767
Kuwabara-sensei,
Zama-sensei, Ogata here.

365
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,702
And you know what?

366
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:06,838
Even you.

367
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:08,607
-That's very kind of
you, but this whole thing

368
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,879
was just a sort of hypothetical
discussion anyways.

369
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:14,283
-I'd like to hear
your opinion, sensei.

370
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:17,956
What if Honinbo Shusaku
was still alive today?

371
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:20,727
Do you think he'd still be
the world's greatest player?

372
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,068
-What do you mean
the reason I'm not

373
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,006
winning is because I'm
playing against you every day?

374
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,311
-Well, I think it's
because you're afraid.

375
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:33,148
-Cuz I'm afraid?

376
00:16:33,181 --> 00:16:33,883
Of what?

377
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:43,365
-Of the fact that
my moves are always

378
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:44,767
attacking you on the board.

379
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:53,181
You used to respond to my
movies with wild abandon.

380
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:55,785
But now you see
every stone I lay

381
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:58,190
cutting into you like a sword.

382
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,927
Each move fraught with danger.

383
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,697
You started to become afraid.

384
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,267
With fear comes hesitancy.

385
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:09,074
And with hesitancy comes doubt.

386
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:12,279
This doubt is what
marks your recent games,

387
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:15,785
and may account for the
pattern of continuing losses.

388
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:23,799
Is any of this
making sense to you?

389
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:32,079
If it does, then
your course is clear.

390
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:34,817
Look for the blade of
your opponent's sword,

391
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,220
and move toward the
very edge of it.

392
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:38,957
-Look for the blade.

393
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,893
Move to the edge.

394
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,296
-That's right.

395
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,431
That's how Akira plays.

396
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,289
-With that in mind, turn your
fear into courage and fight.

397
00:17:58,322 --> 00:17:59,257
-All right.

398
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,226
Here I come!

399
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:04,473
-Come on.

400
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:05,167
Get up.

401
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,934
Let's play another game.

402
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,103
Another game, Hikaru.

403
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:08,973
-I would if I could.

404
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:14,849
-So the Young Lions
tournament's coming up soon.

405
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:17,054
All the young pros I've
spoken to recently seem

406
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,423
to think you're the one to beat.

407
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:20,326
And they can't wait
to take you on.

408
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:23,397
-I can't wait to
take them on either.

409
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:26,969
I'm really looking
forward to it.

410
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,708
-How do you think the
insei will do this year?

411
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,377
-Well, sometimes a
few of them make it

412
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,180
through to the third round.

413
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,484
But usually by the time
we get to the semifinals,

414
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:38,789
only the pros are left in
the running, as you'd expect.

415
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:40,192
-By the way, Toya.

416
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:41,394
-What?

417
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:43,330
-I bumped into
Shindo the other day.

418
00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:47,371
Said he was going to enter
the Young Lions tournament.

419
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:50,809
Some added excitement?

420
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,746
-Why would I care?

421
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,750
It makes no difference
if he enters or not.

422
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,324
-Shindo.

423
00:18:59,357 --> 00:18:59,924
-Hm?

424
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,916
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Look the blade.

425
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:18,221
Move to the edge.

426
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:23,229
Turn fear into
courage and fight.

427
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,769
-How's this move here?

428
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:30,742
-Hey, Shindo, would you
like to play a game?

429
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:32,077
-Shirakawa, no.

430
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:34,449
You're playing in the
Judan tournament this week.

431
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:36,953
You need to be practicing
against someone stronger

432
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:38,421
than an insei.

433
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:40,392
-I know it's an important match.

434
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:42,028
That's why I figured
I should capture

435
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,331
some of Shindo's passion.

436
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:47,838
I'll never win unless I've
got some of that spirit.

437
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:50,007
Am I right, or am I right?

438
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,910
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I
can't lose my passion.

439
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:02,228
I'm right behind you.

440
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:04,799
I'm going to make it.

441
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:06,535
-OK, ready to start?

442
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:08,873
this isn't a teaching game.

443
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:09,373
-Onegaishimasu.

444
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:18,221
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Turn fear into courage.

445
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:19,824
Look for the blade.

446
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:20,959
Move to the edge.

447
00:20:24,398 --> 00:20:26,535
Akira's not going to
wait for me forever.

448
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,371
He's going to keep
moving forward,

449
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:29,908
keep improving is game.

450
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:36,785
I've just got one month left.

451
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,190
One month to get into the
top 16 in the A-league.

452
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:41,326
Whatever it takes.

453
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:43,797
I have to compete in the
Young Lions tournament

454
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,800
so I can play
against Akira Toya.

455
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:51,577
[theme music]

456
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:20,290
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I'm going
to make it into the A-league.

457
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:22,627
SAI (VOICEOVER): Just take it
one game at a time, Hikaru.

458
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:23,896
One game at a time.

459
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,232
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I have to concentrate

460
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:26,433
on getting into the top 16.

461
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:28,003
SAI (VOICEOVER):
To do that, you'll

462
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:30,240
have to defeat Waya
and the others.

463
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:33,171
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): They'll
take it easy on me, won't they?

464
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:36,107
Next time, Welcome
to the A-league.

465
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:38,042
SAI (VOICEOVER):
Tetsuo and Kimihiro

466
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:40,178
are graduating from Haze.

467
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:43,448
And you're on the way
to becoming a pro.
