I'm catching up to you.

166
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:20,336
I hope you're ready!

167
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:23,710
-Touya, Haze Middle School's
application just arrived.

168
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:26,082
Here, take a look.

169
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:28,152
-Hikaru's in third position?

170
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:30,257
-My guess is that
it's a strategic move.

171
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,095
Sometimes schools don't
place their members

172
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:33,263
in order strength.

173
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:35,268
I assume that their new
teammate, Yuuki, is probably

174
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:36,738
the weakest of the three.

175
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:38,074
If they're
deliberately forfeiting

176
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:40,747
the game between the
two team captains,

177
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:43,285
they must think they'll win
the two remaining matches.

178
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:44,822
Their club president,
to Tsutsui,

179
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:46,393
will be their co-captain.

180
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,669
And Shindou will be their
number three, like you said.

181
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:53,174
It's an interesting
move, I have to admit.

182
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:56,648
I wouldn't have predicted it.

183
00:08:56,682 --> 00:09:01,159
-Sensei, I want to play
as our number three.

184
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:03,063
-Hm.

185
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:04,966
-Mr. Yun.

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,005
-I'll think about it.

are our only player

189
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:18,964
who could beat Hikaru Shindou.

190
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:22,806
-Thank you, sensei.

191
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:29,287
-I withdraw.

192
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:31,058
-Thank you for the game.

[gasping]

194
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,405
-The better player
has won this time.

195
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,243
-Don't underestimate yourself.

196
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:41,815
You were much stronger
than I expected.

197
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,752
-You completely overpowered me.

198
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:46,024
-I paid too much attention
to the center of the board.

199
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:47,995
You played a much
more balanced game.

200
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:49,799
-You're cutting points
hurt you, so you

201
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,169
couldn't secure your groups.

202
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:52,906
-I connected here
out of desperation.

203
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,709
Oh that was a bad move.

204
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,380
After that, I was
on the defensive.

205
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,983
And you wouldn't let up.

206
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:00,055
I didn't have a chance
to make any strong plays.

207
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,033
I could never turn professional.

208
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,235
I understand that now.

209
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:13,151
-Everyone, may I have
your attention, please.

210
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:15,857
We've received a lot of
applications for the upcoming

211
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:16,859
tournament.

212
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:18,229
Several schools will
be participating.

213
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:19,799
I'm sure you're
all eager to know

214
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:21,469
who will be playing
on our team this year.

215
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:27,282
I'll read the boy's
division first.

216
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:32,036
The captain will be
Touya, seventh grade.

217
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:37,271
The co-captain will be
Kishimoto, ninth grade.

218
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,489
And in the number three
position, Kuno, ninth grade.

219
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:48,361
And now for the girl's division.

220
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:49,965
-That's not fair!

221
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:52,337
I thought we agreed that I
would play in the number three

-How are you this
morning, Kuwabara sensei?

229
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,091
-Hello!

230
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,031
We haven't bumped into each
other for quite some time.

231
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:38,238
Now that you're here, I've been
meaning to tell you something.

232
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:41,178
I'm going to challenge you for
the Gosei title next month.

233
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:43,115
I've been looking
forward to facing you.

234
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,119
It'll be a stimulating game.

235
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:46,556
-I've already heard.

236
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:50,030
I recently had the pleasure of
watching you overpower Ogata.

237
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:53,471
That was quite an impressive
play, for a man your age.

238
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,278
-You're not exactly a
spring chicken yourself.

239
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:57,547
How many titles do you hold?

240
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,182
Four?

241
00:11:58,215 --> 00:11:59,250
Five?

242
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:02,091
It's getting hard to
keep track these days.

243
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:07,102
-After I'm done taking yours
away, I'll have five titles.

244
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:08,404
-Haha.

245
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:11,277
Ah, these youngsters leave a
lot to be desired, don't they?

246
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:13,281
Winning a title is
admirable, but they're not

247
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,085
good enough to hold onto it.

248
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,023
The younger players
are inconsistent.

249
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:19,929
Nobody really stands out.

250
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:22,268
The new non-rank title
holders are nothing special.

251
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:27,914
Even the Insei are
getting weaker these days.

252

Ah, how's your son?

I hear he's not an Insei.

-That's right.

255
00:12:31,622 --> 00:12:33,159
We practice together a lot.

256
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,397
He likes to play the
pros who come to visit.

257
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,303
Akira takes the
game very seriously.

258
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:41,210
-But he hasn't taken
the pro exam yet?

259

-No.

260

He's keeping busy.

261
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,127
He decided to join his
middle school's Go club.

wanted to play Go at Kaio,

I allowed you to.

00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,937
The principal felt your
presence would help encourage

266
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:11,209
the other students,
so I didn't object.

267

But why do you insist on
entering this tournament?

268
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:16,688
I'd like to know what's
going through your head.

269
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:20,363
You're a talented player.

Listen.

271
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:25,107
You're too skilled to be playing
children in middle school.

272
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,077
I don't think someone
with your ability should

273
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:28,614
be challenging weaker opponents.

274

You really ought to
know better, Akira.

going to spend my time

everyone else thinks of me.

If Hikaru Shindou plays in that
tournament, then I will, too.

278

I have no choice
but to go after him.

279
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:53,135
I don't mean to
upset you, father.

280
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:55,006
But my goal is to
reach your level.

281
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:56,643
I've worked hard to
develop my abilities

282
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:59,048
and to grow confident and
be proud of my skills.

283
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:00,384
I thought that if
I kept studying,

284
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:02,255
if I kept moving forward,
I would eventually

285
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:04,493
play the divine move.

286
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:05,996
But I was wrong.

287
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,433
None of my training
had prepared me

288
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:09,337
for an opponent like Shindou.

289
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:11,476
I was completely
helpless against him.

290
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:14,548
There was no way
that I could win.

291
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:16,720
It's strange, he's different.

292

I've never seen
anything like it.

It's tormenting me!

He isn't like you, father.

Or even Mr. Ogata.

297
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,125
I can't figure
out how he learned

298
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,364
to play the game like that.

299
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:37,666
It's all I ever think about.

until he agrees to face me.

KOUYOU TOUYA (VOICEOVER):
There's fear in his voice.

But he still wants to
challenge his opponent.

304

I've never seen Akira
act this way before.

305

This is the kind of courage
that helps a person grow.

306
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:06,563
He is stubbornly pushing
forward in spite of himself.

307
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:09,202
This is indeed how he
will advance closer

I was the only person who

would have a chance

Please, sir.

I only joined this club
so I could battle him.

-Enough.

317
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:33,255
This is just a
middle school club.

318
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:38,501
I've made my decision.

319
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:40,505
Our strongest player
should be team captain.

That issue is not
open for debate.

And that's final.

-But sensei!

The Go club here at Kaio
sets a standard of excellence

325
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:54,803
which other schools
respect and follow.

326
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:57,141
I did say you were
the only player who

327
00:15:57,175 --> 00:15:59,480
have a shot at defeating Hikaru.

328
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:03,823
But this is a place
of learning, Akira.

329
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:06,161
And the school must come first.

330
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,308
I'm the teacher,
and I have to stick

331
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:14,145
to what's best for the club.

332
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:16,283
You will play in first position.

333
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:19,424
-I thought--

335
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:32,653
--just this once.

336
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,798
Just this one time.

337
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,936
I promise I'll quit the
club after the tournament is

338
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:42,542
finished.

339
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,412
I might never get another
chance to face him.

340
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:46,349
This could be the only
opportunity I have!

341
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,425
Sensei, I'm begging you!

342
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:02,586
Say something!

343
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:08,251
-Very well then.

346

You made it!

347
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:33,695
-Uh-huh.

348
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:40,803
-I'm glad you came.

349
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:42,707
I wasn't really sure if
you were going to show up.

350
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,812
I thought you might be
afraid of Kaio's team.

351
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:45,514
-Who's afraid?

352
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:50,892
Kimihiro, why are you running
with those black stones?

353
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:53,664
If you keep that up, all
these stones on the other side

354
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:54,868
will be captured.

355
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:55,970
-Huh?

356
00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:56,905
Who asked you?

357
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,851
-Are you OK?

358
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:05,725
Yuuki, I want to
ask you something.

359
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:07,462
If you're such a
strong player, then how

360
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,731
come you had to win by cheating?

361
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:13,708
-Oh, there you are!

362
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,315
-You didn't have to come here.

363
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:19,789
You're just going to get bored
and want to leave, you know.

364
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:21,860
-I've been looking
forward to this!

365
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,363
Kimihiro's been teaching me.

366
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:24,633
You want to prove it to you?

367
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,739
I know how to capture stones
and how to count territory.

368
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,742
-Oh.

369
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,045
-You jerk!

370
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:32,383
And to think I spent all morning
making lunches for you guys.

371
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:32,873
-Huh?

372
00:18:32,873 --> 00:18:33,508
Great!

00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,447
Thanks Akari!

for you, too, Yuuki!

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,495
-Follow me, Akari.

377
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:44,532
I'll show you where
you can put that stuff.

378
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:45,769
Come on, let's go.

-Lead the way!

-Want to play?

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,882
What do you say?

382
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:53,753
-I'll pass.

-Your friends don't
seem very happy.

Are you all right?

00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:02,038
-Hey, isn't that Shindou
from Haze Middle School?

386
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:02,706
-Huh?

387
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:03,775
-Is that him?

388
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,811
-Looks like it.

389
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,748
-He defeated a very
strong Kaio player

390
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,519
at last year's tournament.

391
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:09,755
-No way.

392
00:19:09,788 --> 00:19:11,859
-He was still a sixth
grader, but pretended to be

393
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:14,499
in middle school so he could
participate in the competition.

394
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:16,837
Everyone was impressed by
his incredible victory.

395
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,775
It was a truly magnificent game.

396
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:23,552
-Are they still staring?

397
00:19:23,585 --> 00:19:25,189
Don't let their
comments affect you.

398
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:28,664
Focus on your game, try your
best, and you'll be fine.

399
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:29,097
-Right.

400
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:30,133
I'll do my best.

401
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,636
Then I'll beat the
pants off my opponent.

402
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,173
I can hardly wait
for the first round,

403
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,845
it's going to be awesome!

404

-I don't know if it'll
be all that easy, Hikaru.

405
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,658
Your opponent will be trying
his hardest to win, too.

406
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:42,828
-I know that.

407
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,066
The only reason I came here
today was to beat Kaio.

408
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:48,273
I can't afford to get
eliminated in the first round.

409
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:50,578
I'll give everything I've
got against Kaio's number

410
00:19:50,612 --> 00:19:51,948

the second round.

411

Who knows?

412
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:54,554
We might just win
the whole tournament!

413
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,892
-I'm sure that Kaio's
number three player is just

00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:58,095
as determined as you are.

Be ready.

-Ah.

417
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:03,072
The tournament should
start any minute now.

418
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:05,911
I can't wait to find out
who I'll be playing against.

-That would be me.

-Huh?

421
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:12,861
-I'm Kaio's number
three player, Shindou.

00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:13,729
Surprised?

You're Kaio's number three?

-Do you remember when you
refused to play against me?

-Huh?

-I do.

You said you wanted to
play in tournaments.

I finally got you cornered.
