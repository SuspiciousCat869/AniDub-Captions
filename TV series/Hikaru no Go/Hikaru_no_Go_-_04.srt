NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:10,523
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:13,629
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:18,238
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:21,177
[theme music]

6
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:08,737
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I want to be
able to play a stone like that!

7
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:17,222
-Hikaru!

8
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:45,415
-S-Sai?

9
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:53,732
Did you just take
control of my hand?

10
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,179
-Come back!

11
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,949
-I guess I'm to blame.

12
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,688
I'm the one who found him on the
street and dragged him up here.

13
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:12,605
MAN: Well, is he good?

14
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:14,743
KOYO: There was nothing
wrong with his strategy.

15
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:16,680
He had good, solid moves.

16
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:18,752
As good as a pro, in fact.

17
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:20,789
MAN: So it wasn't just luck.

18
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:24,263
KOYO: Keep in mind, I only
saw him play a few stones.

19
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:27,737
I don't know how strong
a player he really is.

20
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,808
-I see.

21
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,745
-There was one thing.

22
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,649
-And what was that, sensei?

23
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:36,488
-It's nothing.

24
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:39,329
That last move he
made was interesting.

25
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:42,735
Taken for what it was,
it was a bad move,

26
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:46,644
but there was
something about it.

27
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:48,581
-You went too far!

28
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:50,452
You took control of
my body, didn't you?

29
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:52,489
You're inside my head, but
that's not enough for you,

30
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:53,324
is it?

31
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,894
No, you had to take control.

32
00:03:54,894 --> 00:03:57,533
I can't place a
stone down like that!

33
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:58,001
-No!

34
00:03:58,234 --> 00:03:59,270
You're mistaken.

35
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:00,639
I can do no such thing.

36
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,510
And even if I could, I wouldn't.

37
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,749
-You're saying I put
that stone down myself?

38
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:06,552
SAI: That's right.

39
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:07,521
HIKARU: Stop lying.

40
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:08,390
SAI: Look.

41
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:10,927
Try it again with this pebble.

42
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:11,930
Hold it in your fingers.

43
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,533
-OK, like this?

44
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:14,301
SAI: Yes.

45
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:15,571
-I'm gonna snap it down!

46
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,485
See, I told you
I couldn't do it.

47
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,554
SAI: But Hikaru.

48
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:24,957
You really did play
that stone on your own.

49
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:26,861
You didn't even place
it where I told you to.

50
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:28,331
HIKARU: Sounds like an excuse.

51
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:30,702
I was just sitting there,
and you took over my body.

52
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:31,704
SAI: Fine, then.

53
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,310
Go ahead and think
that, if you want.

54
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:39,588
But Hikaru, you were the
one who made that move.

55
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:41,960
You're becoming more
familiar with the game,

56
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:44,566
and you want to start
playing on your own.

57
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:45,434
It's undeniable.

58
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,478
-You know, Akira's dad
sure plays the game

59
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:51,981
with a lot of style.

60
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:55,322
Akira's been learning
from him for a long time.

61
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:56,056
Me?

62
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:57,926
I can't even hold
the stone right.

63
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,702
What a difference, huh?

64
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,704
SAI: Hikaru.

65
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,843
Try it once more,
with this pebble.

66
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:07,080
-Will you forget it?

67
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:09,651
I'm not the one
who did it, anyway.

68
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,488
-Hikaru.

69
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:12,056
-Hey, Akari.

70
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:19,472
-I just came from your
house, and you weren't there.

71
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:22,378
What have you been
doing all this time?

72
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:23,848
-I've been playing Go.

73
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:24,850
-Go?

74
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:26,353
Again?

75
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:28,759
You must really like it, 'cause
you've been playing it a lot.

76
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,661
-Go is stupid.

77
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:32,032
I don't like it one bit.

78
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:32,667
-Oh.

79
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,579
Here.

80
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:39,514
-Huh?

81
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,817
-My sister gave them to me.

82
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,921
Her junior high's
putting on a festival.

83
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:43,957
Wanna go?

84
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,427
-Naw.

85
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,366
-Oh, why not?

86
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:51,974
It's gonna be a lot of fun, and
we get to eat free takoyaki.

87
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:53,510
HIKARU: That's OK.

88
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,617
-I'll meet you in front of Haze
Junior High at 2:00 on Sunday.

89
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,853
HIKARU: Do whatever you want!

90
00:05:57,886 --> 00:05:59,790
AKARI: Hikaru!

91
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,126
HIKARU: You know,
I think I'll have

92
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:04,433
ramen when I get home tonight.

93
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,104
AKARI: Just be
there at 2:00, OK?

94
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:11,515
[barking]

95
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:13,519
-Hikaru, why don't you go?

96
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,788
-Oh, please.

97
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,926
If anyone sees me walking
around a festival with a girl,

98
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,799
I'll never hear the end of it.

99
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:23,473
-I think that young
woman is fond of you.

100
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,177
-That's exactly what
I'm talking about, Sai.

101
00:06:57,746 --> 00:07:01,153
Show up at 2:00, Hikaru.

102
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:04,459
She stood me up!

103
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,664
SAI: Is this a festival?

104
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:08,235
Like at a temple school?

105
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:09,069
-Yeah, yeah.

106
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:10,639
I guess something like that.

107
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:12,143
I mean, usually
they're a lot of time,

108
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:16,919
except for today I didn't
bring any money with me.

109
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:17,687
-Here!

110
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:19,725
I've got some takoyaki.

111
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:23,065
-I could sure go for
some of that right now.

112
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,869
-Hikaru, look over there.

113
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:25,838
-Huh?

114
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:28,944
-They're playing Go.

115
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:30,748
Can we go over there?

116
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:32,618
Can we, can we, can we?

117
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,224
-OK, but just for
a little while.

118
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:36,092
TSUTSUI: All right.

119
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,896
Here's an intermediate problem.

120
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,834
You have to solve
it in three moves.

121
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:48,486
-First black attaches right
here, then white goes here.

122
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,187
-OK.

123
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:51,024
But how about if
white goes here?

124
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:54,164
-Oh, it was right
there in front of me.

125
00:07:54,164 --> 00:07:56,803
Wow, that was really
difficult, son.

126
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:59,642
-Hikaru, what is that book?

127
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:00,912
-Huh?

128
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:04,085
-The Go Matches of Toya Meijin.

129
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:07,259
-It's the grand prize if you
can solve all the problems.

130
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,797
Would you like to sit
down and give it a shot?

131
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:12,002
-Hikaru, I want it, I want it!

132
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:12,937
-All right, already!

133
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:15,074
Now get off me!

134
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:16,010
-Have a seat.

135
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:16,678
-OK.

136
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:17,680
Thanks.

137
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:18,883
-What grade are you in?

138
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:19,718
-Me?

139
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:20,987
Oh, I'm in the sixth grade.

140
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:24,060
-Then let's start
with a simple one.

141
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:24,662
Here.

142
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:27,601
Try this.

143
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:30,040
-You know, I think I
can solve this one.

144
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:31,142
Don't help me, OK, Sai?

145
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:31,944
-I won't.

146
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:48,144
-Mm-hm.

147
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,984
[applause]

148
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:51,986
-Here's your prize.

149
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,021
HIKARU: What?

150
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:54,324
Pocket tissue.

151
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:56,595
I want you to give
me a harder problem.

152
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,834
-Oh, an overachiever?

153
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:00,236
Can you handle it?

154
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,205
HIKARU: You're up, Sai.

155
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:02,608
-SAI: I'm ready.

156
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,212
-This one's for a
Dan level player.

157
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:06,583
Even I'd have problems
with this one.

158
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:07,919
Solve it in three moves.

159
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,362
Huh?

160
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:13,966
-No way!

161
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:15,068
TSUTSUI: You got it.

162
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:15,936
MAN: That was quick.

163
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,740
MAN: It was instantaneous.

164
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,778
TSUTSUI: You've won
an orange juice.

165
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:22,750
-Look, I want that book, so gve
me the hardest one you've got.

166
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:25,356
-Whoa, you want the
hardest one in the book?

167
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:26,893
OK, then.

168
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:30,099
If you can solve this one, then
you're at Akira Toya's level.

169
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:31,936
-Did you say Akira Toya?

170
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:33,073
I know him.

171
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,010
Is he supposed to be
a pretty good player?

172
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:36,279
-Oh, yeah.

173
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,316
He's probably good enough
to take the test to go pro.

174
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:40,254
He likes to play teaching
games for adults,

175
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,728
so that should give you
an idea of how good he is.

176
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:46,266
Akira Toya might be able
to solve this problem.

177
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,903
Here you go.

178
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:50,843
The first move is the key.

179
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:53,081
-Akira would be able
to solve this one.

180
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:54,651
Hm.

181
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:55,720
Let's see.

182
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:57,657
SAI: Do you want
to try it yourself?

183
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:58,140
-Huh?

184
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,745
-The first move goes here.

185
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,115
-What's the big idea?

186
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,084
-Heh.

187
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:12,255
Go's a game for losers.

188
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:14,392
That's what I think
of Akira Toya, too.

189
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:17,933
Know why? 'Cause I've
already beaten him at Go.

190
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:18,935
Ha ha!

191
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:20,672
Shogi is a thousand
times better.

192
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:28,956
Heh, heh, heh.

193
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:33,700
-Akira's as good as a pro.

194
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,303
How could someone
like you beat him?

195
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:37,274
-'Cause I'm better than him.

196
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:40,280
You moron.

197
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:42,752
-His name is Tetsuo Kaga.

198
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:46,994
He used to be in the same
Go class as Akira Toya.

199
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:49,868
SAI: That boy just solved
a rather difficult problem

200
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,203
with ease.

201
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:54,276
Who is he?

202
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:57,350
-Hey, Tsutsui, have you
been able to get your Go

203
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:58,719
club off the ground yet?

204
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:01,993
Or are you still pretty
desperate for members?

205
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:06,369
You know, I could join if
you made it worth my while.

206
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:07,404
-A Go club?

207
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:08,473
-Oh, yeah.

208
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:09,976
I've been talking to
the school about it.

209
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,713
But there's no club yet.

210
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,317
We only need three members.

211
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,187
Then they'll recognize
us as a cloud

212
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:18,060
and let us enter tournaments.

213
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:21,333
-You know, I'm
awesome at this game.

214
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:24,072
I'm about 1,000 times
better than you.

215
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:25,909
-I do not want the
help of a guy who

216
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:28,950
would do something gross
like stick gum on a Go board.

217
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,753
-That's funny.

218
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:32,089
The other day you
were begging me

219
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:35,463
to join your club so you could
play in the team tournament.

220
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:36,933
-Take it.

221
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:40,206
Just take your stupid
prize and get out of here.

222
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,411
-The Go Matches of Toya Meijin?

223
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,899
I told you, I hate Akira
Toya, and I hate Go, too!

224
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:53,901
I hate them!

225
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:07,030
-Hate him?

226
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:11,205
What did Akira ever do
to you, you big jerk?

227
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,309
-You want to know my reasons?

228
00:12:13,343 --> 00:12:14,846
You givin' me attitude?

229
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:18,921
Time for a lesson.

230
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:22,796
This is what happens to
punks with big mouths.

231
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,232
I like your guts.

232
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,334
Watch my hands.

233
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:33,218
Choose a hand.

234
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:36,224
Pick the right one, and I'll
tell you the whole story.

235
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:41,836
But if you don't, I'll make
you wish you'd never been born.

236
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,539
-Stop playing around, Tetsuo.

237
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:44,208
Go on.

238
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,278
Just go home.

239
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:47,615
-Just like I figured.

240
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:50,855
A big talker with
nothing to back it up.

241
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:52,926
SAI: Hikaru, don't do it.

242
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,862
He's a player.

243
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:56,099
He likes challenges.

244
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:58,371
Settle your differences with Go.

245
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:02,246
He will leave you alone after
I've soundly defeated him.

246
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,116
-There's no
guarantee you'll win.

247
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,553
You just said he's a player.

248
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:06,588
Well, you know what?

249
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:07,991
I can play, too.

250
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,933
SAI: Wait.

251
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:12,935
-This one.

252
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:13,417
-Hikaru!

253
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:23,891
-Huh?

254
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:28,501
-I was right about you, kid.

255
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:29,536
You got guts.

256
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:32,375
HIKARU: There's no stone!

257
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:34,447
TSUTSUI: You're a jerk, Kaga.

258
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,150
-I love playing this joke.

259
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,589
The look on your face
was so priceless.

260
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:39,557
Forget about Go.

261
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:40,593
It's a lame game.

262
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:42,296
Come and join the Shogi club.

263
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,368
I'll teach you
everything I know.

264
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:45,437
-Just shut up!

265
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,674
I'd rather die than
learn Shogi, especially

266
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:49,478
from a big creep like you.

267
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,313
TETSUO: What?

268
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:51,315
TSUTSUI: Stop it, you two!

269
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:52,685
-You say you Akira?

270
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,625
I bet you cheated,
just like you did now.

271
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:59,332
Either that, or he felt sorry
for you, and he let you win.

272
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:00,902
You probably started
playing Shogi

273
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:04,042
after you ran away from Go.

274
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,314
TETSUO: Tsutsui, let him go!

275
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:09,120
Now you've gone too far!

276
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:11,057
I'll show you what I can do.

277
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,296
I'm the best!

278
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:16,602
If I lose, I'll get down
on my knees and apologize.

279
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:20,276
But if you lose, you have to
jump into a freezing pool!

280
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,579
-Fine by me.

281
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:24,719
Let's go!

282
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:27,491
-Three, four point in
the upper right corner.

283
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:33,538
-That is such a lame
way to hold a stone.

284
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:36,277
-Never mind how I hold
my stone, you jerk!

285
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,612
SAI: Enclose the corner.

286
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:39,951
TETSUO: You're going to regret
that attitude when I beat you,

287
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:40,393
kid.

288
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:46,231
Smart-mouthed kid.

289
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:48,235
He doesn't know what
I had to go through.

290
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,104
No one does.

291
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:55,150
MAN: Tetsuo!

292
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:57,388
Tetsuo, come here.

293
00:14:57,421 --> 00:15:00,395
Why can't you beat that boy?

294
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:01,697
You know who.

295
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,632
Akira Toya.

296
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:04,035
You're always
second best to him.

297
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,338
You're two years older.

298
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,375
You should be ashamed.

299
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,014
-I really do try to win, Dad.

300
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:11,518
But Akira's too good.

301
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:15,025
-Win today, or else.

302
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:17,229
I won't tolerate
losers in my house!

303
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:21,539
What can I do?

304
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:24,111
You're better than me, and
that's all there is to it.

305
00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:25,613
You're the best player in here.

306
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:29,456
In fact, you play Go
better than anyone.

307
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:32,094
And one day, I'll
beat you, and I'll

308
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:35,468
go from being number two to
number one just like that.

309
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,040
Keep an eye out for me, OK?

310
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:38,741
You ready?

311
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:40,245
Let's get started.

312
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:44,688
-Should I, uh, let you win one?

313
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:46,290
-What?

314
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:48,796
Lose on purpose?

315
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:54,307
Don't treat me like
a nobody Don't you

316
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:55,577
dare treat me like a nobody.

317
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,456
I'd always thought
of him as a rival.

318
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:05,097
But he didn't think
anything of me.

319
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,335
It didn't even matter
if he won or lost to me.

320
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:10,167
After we counted the
Komi, I realized I'd won.

321
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,238
But the game had
been ruined for me.

322
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,259
My father gave up on
me once he realized

323
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:26,334
I'd never be the best as
long as Akira was around.

324
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:27,603
I'm not a nobody.

325
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:51,755
Know what?

326
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:54,293
This kid-- he's pretty good.

327
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,382
TSUTSUI (VOICEOVER): Wow.

328
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:21,684
This guy can really play.

329
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:42,963
TETSUO (VOICEOVER): Hey.

330
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,867
What's going on here?

331
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,437
He's got me playing on the run.

332
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:53,952
SAI: 11, 15.

333
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:54,554
Atari.

334
00:18:58,795 --> 00:18:59,731
11, 14.

335
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:00,332
Connect.

336
00:19:03,238 --> 00:19:04,575
What a delight.

337
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:06,879
Though this boy is
not at Akira's level,

338
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:10,453
he plays the most interesting
counters to my every move.

339
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:15,765
I could easily
finish him off, but I

340
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,902
want to savor the
pleasure of this game.

341
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:43,289
TSUTSUI (VOICEOVER): Black
is taking a risk here.

342
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:46,429
It might turn out OK,
but he has to be careful.

343
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:48,901
The shape is about even.

344
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:52,576
No-- it favors black.

345
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:56,083
-9, 19 point.

346
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:56,758
-Really?

347
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:58,095
No way.

348
00:19:58,128 --> 00:19:59,064
-Akari?

349
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,066
-He's gonna lose it.

350
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,368
He just--

351
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,538
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I
guess she did show up.

352
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:03,673
TETUSO: Hurry up and play!

353
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:04,475
-Huh?

354
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:05,744
Sorry.

355
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:06,980
-Hikaru, not that spot!

356
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:12,065
-Wait!

357
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:12,792
Hold it!

358
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:13,727
TETSU: Hold it?

359
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:15,768
You're kidding, right?

360
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:16,802
-Oh, no.

361
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:19,438
They've all been captured.

362
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,407
SAI: It can't be helped now.

363
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,311
12, 15, atari.

364
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:27,980
-I'd say that last move just
cost you the whole game.

365
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,754
-Get outta here.

366
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:36,722
All those stones?

367
00:20:41,593 --> 00:20:45,431
-Well, you want to give up now?

368
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:47,866
Boy, that freezing pool's
gonna cool you down.

369
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:48,767
-No-- I--

370
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:57,876
[theme music]

371
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:22,661
HIKARU: Sai!

372
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:24,630
You told me we could win.

373
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:26,331
TETSUO: Tsutsui,
looks like we now

374
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:29,501
have the members for
the Go tournament team.

375
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:32,538
SAI: I think I understand now
why I was drawn to Hikaru.

376
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:48,687
Once you've placed a
stone, it cannot be moved.

377
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,410
Every move is crucial.
