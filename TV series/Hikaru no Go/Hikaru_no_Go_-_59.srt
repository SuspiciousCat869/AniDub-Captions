[theme music]

3
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:51,718
-Thank goodness.

4
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,191
I shouldn't be so surprised
he made a mistake.

5
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:57,266
It's not like I'm playing Koyo
Toya, or Kuwabara, or anyone

6
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,301
like that.

7
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:01,944
This is a kid who
only just turned pro.

8
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:05,787
[gasp] Then again,
this is the first time

9
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:08,627
Shindo's ever
played one-color Go.

10
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:11,903
I can see that Akira Toya
isn't the only one coming up

11
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:16,615
from the lower ranks that
I need to watch out for.

12
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:18,620
There's someone else now.

13
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:25,571
-[gasp] Toya Meijin is retiring?

14
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,208
What are they talking about?

15
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:28,578
I can't believe it.

16
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:32,255
He wouldn't, not out of the
blue like that, not him.

17
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:33,725
-As head of his
support organization,

18
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:37,334
Toya did call to apologize
for not letting me know.

19
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:39,273
It came as a complete surprise.

20
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:40,676
I have arranged a
press conference

21
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,314
to give you more details.

22
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,319
All I can say at the
moment is that he

23
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,026
said was for personal reasons.

24
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:48,496
-Ms. Ichikawa.

25
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:49,365
-I know.

26
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,936
I'm just as shocked as you.

27
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:52,406
-He's left us no choice.

28
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,944
We're going to have
to call an emergency

29
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:55,280
meeting of the directors.

30
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:57,319
We've got one of the major
championship sponsors

31
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:58,322
on the line.

32
00:02:58,355 --> 00:02:59,524
[phone ringing]

33
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:02,598
-Do you think there's
something wrong his health?

34
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:03,802
-Well, that's it.

35
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:06,910
I'm going to go
find out for myself.

36
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:09,283
-He can't retire, not yet.

37
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:12,323
How can I take one of his titles
away from him if he's retired?

38
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,339
-This retirement
has nothing to do

39
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:19,943
with him losing
the 2-dan series.

40
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:22,316
If losing a title meant you
had to consider retiring,

41
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:24,421
then I would have to give
up as well, after the Oza

42
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,292
crown was snatched from me.

43
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:28,866
-When we played that last
game of the 2-dan series,

44
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:31,472
I felt as though I was
seeing a new side of Toya.

45
00:03:31,506 --> 00:03:33,544
He had such a different energy.

46
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:35,917
So why on earth would he retire?

47
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,490
Why now?

48
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:40,529
-How are we organize
the championships

49
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:42,333
without a title holder?

50
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,907
-Maybe the challenger should
just win the title by default.

51
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,644
-No, we should hold
playoffs to fill

52
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:48,115
the other spot of
the championships.

53
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:51,390
We could have a five or
seven game playoff series.

54
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,863
-I heard this rumor Toya Meijin
lost to some amateur player

55
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:54,865
on the internet.

56
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:56,336
So I got my hands
on the game record.

57
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,906
And boy, was I ever surprised.

58
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,410
It was a fantastic game.

59
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:01,783
Without a doubt, these were
two top players battling it out

60
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:02,786
for the board.

61
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:03,921
All this talk of
him being depressed

62
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:07,397
about losing to an amateur
called Sai is pure bunk.

63
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,667
None of it's true.

64
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,539
But the one thing that's
bugging me is we've

65
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:13,078
still got no idea which pro
is using the same Sai when

66
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:14,449
he plays online.

67
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:16,153
Well, better not stay
chatting all day.

68
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:16,989
Gotta run.

69
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:18,526
Can't miss the bullet train.

70
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,065
My wife would be angry if I was
late for the memorial ceremony

71
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:23,438
her family's having.

72
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,607
-Early retirement?

73
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,181
How could you do such a
selfish thing, Koyo Toya?

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,759
-I wonder if you can help me.

75
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:46,096
My name's Akiro Toya.

76
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:47,533
I'm looking for the match room.

77
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:48,435
-Glad you made it.

78
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:49,605
I'll show you the way.

79
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:51,811
-Ah, Toya, you're here.

80
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:54,016
We heard the news about
your father's retirement.

81
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,787
Everyone here's very worried.

82
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:57,124
We knew he was
sick, and wondered

83
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:59,731
if that was the reason for
his decision to quit playing.

84
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:00,766
How's he doing?

85
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,872
-Oh, there's nothing
wrong with his health.

86
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:03,674
He's fine.

87
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:05,177
But thanks for your concern.

88
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:06,749
MIYAMATSU: Oh, that's a relief.

89
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:08,519
The information
we get here isn't

90
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:11,928
very reliable at
the best of times.

91
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:13,499
There's another
rumor going around

92
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:15,672
that he hasn't even told
you why he's retiring.

93
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:16,941
Is that true?

94
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:20,082
-Yes, I don't think he told
anyone, not even my mother.

95
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:24,593
But she did tell me
something interesting.

96
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:27,133
-Akira, there's no
reason for any of us

97
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,807
to be worried about your father.

98
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,077
Just look at him.

99
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:32,815
If he wasn't so sure that this
was the right thing to do,

100
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:34,519
he wouldn't be so at
peace with himself.

101
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,701
-But he's going to miss playing
all those matches, won't he?

102
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,904
-I don't think so.

103
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:43,676
There are always people
coming around our place who

104
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,511
want to play him.

105
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,914
That's not going to change.

106
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:46,516
-Oh.

107
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:47,285
-Follow me.

108
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,156
-His fans are going to miss him.

109
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,131
Does he realize how disappointed
they're going to be?

110
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:54,972
-It's no good trying to
persuade him to change his mind.

111
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:57,712
I guess it's now going to be
up to me to take his place.

112
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:58,235
-Oh.

113
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:04,904
-The match room's up the
stairs, and on the right.

114
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:09,282
,
but he's the holder of four

115
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:10,686
titles.

116
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:12,624
Yet he seems so sure of himself.

117
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:14,027
That kid's going
to go a long way.

118
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,667
-You'll be sitting here.

119
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,773
-Well, Akira, Hi.

120
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:34,914
-Uh, Ichirayu Sensei,
what are you doing here?

121
00:06:34,947 --> 00:06:37,688
-I was about to ask you
the very same thing.

122
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,125
I have to admit,
this isn't somewhere

123
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:41,096
I'd normally visit to play Go.

124
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,801
My in-laws live here in Nagoya.

125
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,706
They're having this
big memorial ceremony,

126
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,678
so I thought I'd check
out the local scene

127
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:47,413
while I was in town.

128
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:48,916
Did they put you
up in some hotel?

129
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,222
It wasn't too bad, huh?

130
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:52,759
-It was fine.

131
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:54,965
-And how's the
former Meijin doing?

132
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,703
-When I left, he was playing go.

133
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:58,909
Morishita Sensei
and Okuba Sensei

134
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:00,379
had dropped by the
house for a visit.

135
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:03,186
-I had no idea Okuba
Sensei knew your father.

136
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,091
What about Kurata,
seen anything of him?

137
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:05,859
-Yes.

138
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,132
-Ichiryu Sensei.

139
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:09,870
-If it isn't Miyamatsu!

140
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,875
How have you been doing?

141
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,212
MIYAMATSU: I'm good, thank you.

142
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:15,384
What brings a player of
your stature out this way?

143
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,990
ICHIRAYU SENSEI: Well, I've
come to cheer you on, of course.

144
00:07:18,024 --> 00:07:19,127
Why else?

145
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,032
MIYAMATSU: Come
on, you're joking.

146
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:28,951
[music playing]

147
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,798
KURATA: Thank you very
much for the game.

148
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,769
KOYO TOYA: Thank you
very much for the game.

149
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,173
-Something has been bugging me.

150
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,046
You say you can continue
playing Go after you've retired.

151
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,024
But I don't see how it
can possibly be the same.

152
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:46,196
I mean, aren't there aspects
of the game that can only

153
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:47,532
be developed when
you're fighting

154
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,237
to win a championship title?

155
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,779
-Kurata, that may be
true for younger pros,

156
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,149
such as you and Akira.

157
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,959
There's certainly a lot you can
learn from competitive play.

158
00:07:57,992 --> 00:07:59,930
But in my case, it's different.

159
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,237
I'm glad to free myself
from all the obligations

160
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,777
that come with
playing at my level.

161
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,782
I don't have to spend
days on the road just

162
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:08,118
to go and play a game.

163
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:10,491
My time is my own again.

164
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:14,368
--[laughing] So now you
can sit back, relax,

165
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,041
and have everyone come to play
you in the comfort of your own

166
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:19,046
home, just like I did today?

167
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,149
I'd love to come again.

168
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,464
That is, if you'd let me.

169
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:27,367
-By all means.

170
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,470
You're welcome any time.

171
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:41,437
-Mr. Kurata, I learned a lot
from watching you play today.

172
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,876
Thank you.

173
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,847
I'm going to work hard
on my game with you

174
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:47,585
and Mr. Ogata as my targets.

175
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:50,025
I know I lost to you in the
second round of the Meijin

176
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:51,128
Series qualifiers.

177
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:52,965
But I'm going to work
hard, so that one day I

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,935
can avenge that loss.

179
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,017
-You're always setting your
sights on players above you.

180
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,454
Maybe you should
pay more attention

181
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:03,225
to who's coming up from below.

182
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:04,996
-From below?

183
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,901
-There's someone else
you should worry about.

184
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,541
And he's right behind you.

185
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:11,446
There are only two
young pros out there

186
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,184
who I feel threatened by.

187
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,186
You're one of them.

188
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,891
And the other's Hikaru Shindo.

189
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:20,602
-[gasp]

190
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:22,341
-You've probably
never heard of him,

191
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:24,613
because you're so focused on
us guys who are above you.

192
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,484
Well, to be honest, if
I hadn't have bumped

193
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,557
into him at some event
I was at, I probably

194
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,027
wouldn't have
noticed him either.

195
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,965
But then I got a chance
to play him myself.

196
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:32,449
-Shindo.

197
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:37,278
-I suggest you
keep an eye on him.

198
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:42,540
-Shindo.

199
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:47,037
(THINKING) Even
players like Mr. Kurata

200
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,211
have started to notice him.

201
00:09:50,245 --> 00:09:53,386
If only I didn't have
to be here in Nagoya.

202
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,531
I'd be able to watch
him play in Tokyo.

203
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:58,132
Shindo.

204
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:06,386
-I don't understand
why he's retiring.

205
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:09,260
Didn't he earn, like, hundreds
of millions this year?

206
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:11,065
-Yeah, so?

207
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:12,635
-Even if you're set
for life financially,

208
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:15,142
you don't just give up the game.

209
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:16,245
MALE SPEAKER: No.

210
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:19,285
-Do you know which
opponent you've got today?

211
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,558
-Some new kid, called Shindo.

212
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,563
He won his first round
match by default.

213
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:25,100
So this will be his first game.

214
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:26,571
-How come?

215
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,041
-His opponent never showed.

216
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:30,013
He was scheduled
to play Akira Toya,

217
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,188
but that was the morning
Toya's sensei collapsed.

218
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:34,458
-Oh yeah?

219
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,298
So this really is the first
time he'll play a game as a pro.

220
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:40,439
The kid's going to be a nervous
wreck today, don't you think?

221
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:49,596
Oh, hey.

222
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,332
How you doing?

223
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:50,855
-Morning.

224
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,622
-(THINKING) The records
from last year Young Lions

225
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:04,434
tournament said that he lost
in the first round to Murakami.

226
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:07,609
And he didn't do so well in
the Shinshu-dan Series, either.

227
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:09,046
-Uh, good morning.

228
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,350
Nice to meet you.

229
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:12,288
-(THINKING) because this is his
first time playing in a major

230
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:13,825
tournament, he's
bound to be nervous.

231
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:17,100
As a 3-dan, I can't
afford to lose to him.

232
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:21,210
[music playing]

233
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,564
-(THINKING) The board's 19
by 19, just like normal.

234
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,804
But somehow it seems smaller.

235
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:33,274
It's weird.

236
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:35,514
But I've got a feeling that
I'm not going to lose this one.

237
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:43,500
-(THINKING) Hikaru is starting
on the path to the divine move.

238
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:48,547
[buzzer]

239

FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: (THINKING)
It won't be me that finds it.

240
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:51,688
It'll be Hikaru.

241
00:11:57,737 --> 00:12:02,448
The destiny set by the spirtis
of Go can not be changed.

242
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:06,826
[music playing]

243
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:55,985
-(THINKING) This is
a difficult game.

244
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:57,956
Actually, he's
making it difficult.

245
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:05,376
I've got to change the momentum
of the game, or I'm dead.

246
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,959
Get the momentum.

247
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:21,617
Ah, I think I might have
overplayed the top side.

248
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:26,262
Black's attacking, and gaining
ground while he does it.

249
00:13:26,295 --> 00:13:27,332
It's no good.

250
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:28,335
I've got to make some
eyes on the board,

251
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:29,972
even if it means I
have to overplay later.

252
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:32,378
The important thing
is to hang in there.

253
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,416
-(THINKING) Making eyes
isn't going to save him.

254
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,288
While he's spending
moves on that,

255
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,560
I'll build myself a huge lead.

256
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:40,933
[music playing]

257
00:13:50,557 --> 00:13:52,930
-(THINKING) Not good enough.

[music playing]

00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:13,450
-(THINKING) Whoa.

260
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:16,423
I managed to connect his plan.

261
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,462
But now he started
going on the offensive,

262
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:19,865
attacking my other positions.

263
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,470
I could be in trouble here.

264
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:28,788
The only area on the board
where I can regain some ground

265
00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:30,559
is over on the left hand side.

266
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,904
I have no choice
but to go for it.

[music playing]

268
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,559
-(THINKING) Hikaru's
really coming into his own.

269
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:11,430
This is it.

270
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:14,638
--[sigh] (THINKING) I admit my
attacks are pretty reckless.

271
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:16,576
All he needs to do
is defend himself.

272
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,049
But he's not even trying.

273
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:22,091
He's going for the
counter attack instead.

274
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:25,099
-(THINKING) I had no idea
he'd improve this much.

275
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,488
-I resign.

276
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:08,642
-I resign.

277
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,815
-Thank you very
much for the game.

278
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:22,578
(THINKING) I wonder how
Shindo did in his game.

279
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,792
-Ishihara, you were
playing Akira Toya.

280
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:28,995
How'd it go?

281
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:31,701
--[sigh] I'm never
going to beat that guy.

282
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:32,838
-What?

283
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:34,776
ISHIHARA: No matter how
hard I study the game,

284
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,313
I'll never beat him,
as long as I live.

285
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:43,598
AKIRA TOYA: (THINKING) I
haven't figured it out yet.

286
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:47,909
But that whole thing with
Sai got me wondering.

287
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:51,051
Shindo, why did you
appear in my life?

288
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:58,804
Why do I feel like I
have to pursue you?

289
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:00,909
And why do you keep pursuing me?

290
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,199
Why?

291
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,965
-So, what did you
think of my game today?

292
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:13,207
I'm totally on a roll.

293
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,012
That guy wouldn't
resign, when it

294
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:16,783
was obvious he
was going to lose.

295
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:17,685
He was so stubborn.

296
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:19,223
He kept playing, and playing.

297
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,135
He probably went into
the game thinking

298
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,241
there was no way he could
lose to a kid like me.

299
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:27,009
This isn't right.

300
00:17:31,186 --> 00:17:32,724
Huh?

301
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:34,094
Hey, what's up.

302
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:35,364
It's your turn.

303
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:38,071
-What did you think you were
doing with this move here?

304
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:40,677
You have the audacity to
think you're such a big shot

305
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:42,849
when you're making
moves as bad as this.

306
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:45,089
-So it wasn't the greatest
move in the world.

307
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:46,024
Fine, OK.

308
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:48,230
But you don't need
to get all mad.

309
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:50,402
-You're not a strong enough
player to defeat me yet,

00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:53,910

315
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:04,905
Please, it can't end here, not
until I know you can defeat me.

up a stone without me around

00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,993
to help you, let alone play Go.

318
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:19,258
Sorry.

319
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:26,794
Come on, let's play.

320
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:27,278
Sai?

321
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:31,974
Fine.

322
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:52,160
-All right, then.

323
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:53,430
Let's continue.

324
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:54,933
-Just forget it.

325
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:57,373
You're the one who quit playing
in the first place, not me.

326
00:18:57,373 --> 00:18:59,111
-Hikaru, no!

327
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:00,981
-(THINKING) I don't
know what's bugging him.

328
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,987
But I've had enough of it.

329
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:18,392
Burglars broke into
grandpa's house last night?

330
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:21,067
-Yes, I just finished
speaking to him on the phone.

331
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,937
Grandpa said there's
nothing to worry about.

332
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:24,074
He and grandma are OK.

333
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:26,145
But a load of stuff
from the attic is gone.

334
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,678
-Huh?

335
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:32,369
-Hikaru, the Go
board, do you think

336
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:34,141
the Go board is still there?

337
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:38,251
-You mean the one released
you from after 140 years?

338
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,524
-That one?

339
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:43,497
-It gave me the creeps, all
those blood stains on it.

340
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,402
But I guess the board
means something to you,

341
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:48,143
because it reminds you of the
time you spent with Torajiro.

342
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,513
-We need to go and check.

343
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:50,449
Please.

344
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,253
-(THINKING) What's up with him?

345
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:54,492
Last night he was all grouchy,
and itching for a fight.

346
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:55,662
And now look him.

347
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,567
[sigh] Oh well.

348
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,171
The Go board's still here?

349
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:00,441
It wasn't stolen?

350
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:01,610
GRANDPA: That old thing?

351
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:02,580
No, no, no.

352
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:04,050
They went for stuff
they could sell.

353
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,022
You name it, they took it.

354
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:07,392
But it's good to see you.

355
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:09,598
I appreciate that you
were concerned enough

356
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:10,433
to come around.

357
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:12,204
It's been a while.

358
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:14,543
-Dad said he didn't know why
I was so worried, because you

359
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:16,314
only had a load of junk in here.

360
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,986
-Oh, he did, did he?

361
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:18,954
-Yep.

362
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:21,394
-Really, just like
your grandmother.

363
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,034
She's been trying to get me to
clear this place up for years,

364
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:26,407
says the robbers have just
given me a head start.

365
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:28,713
-Here it is.

366
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:29,582
That's weird.

367
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:34,461
-[sigh]

368
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:36,332
-(THINKING) Is it
my imagination,

369
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:40,175
or has the stain started to
disappear since last time I saw

370
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,145
it?

371
00:20:41,178 --> 00:20:47,060
[music playing]

372
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:24,876
-Why has Hikaru been
chosen, and not me?

373
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:27,215
Tell me, spirits of Go?

374
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:28,318
Why?

375
00:22:28,351 --> 00:22:31,659
Once I disappear, only
you will remain, Hikaru.

376
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:33,297
-What are you talking about?

377
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:34,501
You're not going anywhere.

378
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:36,706
Ogata wants to
challenge you to a game.

379
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,677
-I'd rather spend
the little time

380
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:41,377
I have left playing against you.

381
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:44,981
Next time, farewell, Hikaru.

382
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:46,916
-I'm sorry, Hikaru.

383
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,853
But I will be leaving soon.
