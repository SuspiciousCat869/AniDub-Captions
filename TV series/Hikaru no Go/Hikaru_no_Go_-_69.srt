2
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:49,610
-Did you hear about Shindou?

3
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,646
The Chairman of the Players
Association, Murota Nine-Dan,

4
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,247
gave him a call.

5
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,016
-Yeah? And?

6
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,018
-He asked Shindou if he was
missing games because he

7
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,420
was sick and offered the chance
to take a leave of absence,

8
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,990
but he didn't even
bother to reply.

9
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,759
-What an idiot.

10
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,061
-Think he'll quit being a pro?

11
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,631
-I don't know.

12
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:15,002
Looking at him now, it's hard
to believe he was Toya's rival.

13
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,436
-Having talent is
a waste of time

14
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,005
if you don't put
it into practice.

15
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,480
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): If I
start having the urge to play,

16
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:33,153
and if I start playing
Go again, then Sai

17
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,321
will never come back to me.

18
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,258
That's how I feel.

19
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,362
I can't help it.

20
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,357
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): It's
good to be back home again.

21
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,434
With the qualifying rounds
of this year's pro exam

22
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,203
just around the corner, the
competition is heating up.

23
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,972
The former holder of three
collegiate titles, Katawaki,

24
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,041
has announced he
will be entering.

25
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,409
I can't believe
it's here already.

26
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,144
I wonder how the
others have been doing.

27
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,350
Let's see the results
of last week's matches.

28
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:43,557
Ochi beat Machiba,
Waya had a by.

29
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:50,464
Shindou-- He lost by default?

30
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,145
-Ah!

31
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,280
Isumi!

32
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,448
You don't look any different.

33
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,417
I figured since you were
spending all your time

34
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,386
training, you'd have grown
a beard or something.

35
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,355
I was surprised when
I got your call.

36
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,190
So, how was china?

37
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,760
What was like?

38
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,429
What's wrong?

39
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,064
-Well, if it isn't Le Ping.

40
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,365
You've grown up fast.

41
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:35,008
-Uh-- Yeah, so, after that,
Le Ping followed me around,

42
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,277
wanting to play against
me all the time.

43
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,246
I guess it was good he
was working on his game,

44
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,281
but I didn't get
much time for myself.

45
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,117
-He was a pest, huh?

46
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,587
-I know he's just a kid, but
he's a really strong player.

47
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,422
In the end, I enjoyed
hanging out with him.

48
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:53,160
He sort of became
my best friend.

49
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,028
Once I gave him
some Waya medicine.

50
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,463
-Gave him what?

51
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,165
-You know that
special medicine you

52
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,733
take whenever you
get a stomach ache?

53
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,701
Well, one day Le Ping
had a stomach ache,

54
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,171
so I gave him some.

55
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,606
I figured he looks exactly like
you, so it was bound to work.

56
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,409
-What kind of dumb
logic is that?

57
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,278
-It helped get rid
of his stomach ache.

58
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,047
From that moment on, he
and I became good friends.

59
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,248
-Cool.

60
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:19,553
What about your game against
the other kid, Zou-si.

61
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:22,689
Did you beat him?

62
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,291
-No, I lost.

63
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,625
And because of
that, Yang Hai lost

64
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,295
his bet and his MP3 player.

65
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,132
But the next time we played
against each other, I beat him,

66
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,000
and after I got
my visa extended,

67
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,735
we played a few more times.

68
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,205
Anyway, I played as much as
I could during the past two

69
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,273
months.

70
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,676
I got the chance to meet some
of China's best up and coming

71
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,544
players.

72
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,413
-Some of the games
were pretty tough,

73
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,648
but I still managed to
win quite a few of them.

74
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:53,553
The important thing is, I've
got confidence back in my game.

75
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,155
-Way to go.

76
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,424
You said you wanted to
ask me about something.

77
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,626
What was it?

78
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,195
-Oh yeah.

79
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,263
Here.

80
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,565
I haven't seen a copy
since I went away.

81
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,502
Did you know it says
Shindou lost by default?

82
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,338
I've been wondering
what happened.

83
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,505
Is he sick?

84
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,241
I mean, I want to see
him again before I

85
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:20,146
get started in the pro exams,
but I-- What is it, Waya?

86
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,148
-This isn't in the first
time it's happened.

87
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,117
He's lost more than
once by default.

88
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,629
He's lost a lot.

89
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:26,148
-What?

90
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,258
-WAYA: It's been
like this since May.

91
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,095
-Careful!

92
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,063
WAYA: I don't know why,
but he's completely

93
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,431
lost interest in playing Go.

94
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:54,335
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai.

95
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:12,320
-Hello Isumi.

96
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:13,655
-Well, hello, Mr. Amano.

97
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:15,290
It's good to see you again.

98
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:17,592
-Narusawa-sensei told
me you'd been away.

99
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,294
Studying in China, wasn't it?

100
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:20,895
So, when did you get back?

101
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:22,297
-The other day.

102
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:24,499
-I'd love to hear all about it.

103
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,167
Maybe over coffee sometime?

104
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,468
Eh?

105
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:29,304
-Sure.

106
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:30,171
-Wonderful.

107
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:31,573
I'll be in touch with you soon.

108
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:32,340
Bye for now.

109
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:39,247
ISUMI: Uh, Mr. Amano?

110
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,249
-Hm?

111
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:42,450
-Have you heard about Shindou?

112
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,552
Do you know what's
happened to him?

113
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:47,322
-You mean Hikaru,
the new One-Dan?

114
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:48,323
-Yes.

115
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:50,558
I don't understand
what's going on.

116
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:52,961
Why would he miss
all those matches?

117
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:56,064
Do you know?

118
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:57,432
-Sorry, I don't.

119
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,467
It's funny, but
Ogata-Judan was asking me

120
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,336
the same thing just
a few minutes ago.

121
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:02,503
-He's worried about him, too?

122
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:09,143
Ogata-sensei?

123
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,547
Can I talk with you?

124
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:18,453
You played Shindou?

125
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:19,320
when?

126
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,321
-Couple of months ago.

127
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:23,157
Towards the end of
Golden Week, at one

128
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:27,629
of those seminars organized
by the Go Association.

129
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:29,430
As far as I know,
he hasn't played

130
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:33,234
in any games or
tournaments since then.

131
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:36,304
ISUMI: When you two played,
did you notice anything unusual

132
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:37,005
about him?

133
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:42,877
-I don't remember.

134
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:45,313
Let's just say, I was a little
bit worse for wear at the time.

135
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:51,586
-Thanks for the ride.

136
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:53,655
-Don't mention it.

137
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:56,157
If you find out
what's going on, I'd

138
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:58,293
appreciate it if
you'd let me know.

139
00:08:58,326 --> 00:08:58,893
-Sure.

140
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,904
So, he hasn't been
coming here either?

141
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:12,307
-No, he has not, but if
he did show his face,

142
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:14,042
I'd give him a piece of my mind.

143
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:16,577
I'd ask him what in the world
does he think he's doing.

144
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:19,948
-Something must've happened
for him to simply stop playing.

145
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,215
-Like what?

146
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:25,019
-Well, unfortunately, I don't
know of anything for sure.

147
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:28,656
Mr. Kawai, what about the
Shusaku pilgrimage he went on?

148
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:29,891
-What?

149
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:33,294
Do you mean Shusasku
as in Honinbo Shusasku?

150
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:34,529
-Yeah.

151
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:37,632
It was near the end of
Golden Weej, I think.

152
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:40,401
I happened to bump into
him while I was working.

153
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:44,372
Oh, did I mention that
I drive a taxi cab?

154
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:47,175
-So, you bumped into him and--

155
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,910
-He looked like he
was going on a trip,

156
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,445
so I asked him
where he was headed.

157
00:09:50,478 --> 00:09:52,447
Said he was going to Hiroshima.

158
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:54,916
I'd never been there, so
I decided I'd take a break

159
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,217
and go with him.

160
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,953
It sounded like it was
an interesting place,

161
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:02,590
being Shusaku's
birthplace and all.

162
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,193
When we got there, the kid
ran all over the place.

163
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:07,161
We started at the
Ishikiri shrine,

164
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:09,597
where they've got the
Shusasku Memorial Museum.

165
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,600
We went to the Jikanji
Temple at Irozaki Hachimangu,

166
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,902
and then we went back to Tokyo.

167
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:19,340
Ha even dragged me to the
Honmyo-ji Temple in Sugamo.

168
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:22,477
We sure crammed a lot in.

169
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,444
-So.

170
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:24,912
You spent all that
time with him.

171
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:26,948
Was he OK?

172
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:30,618
Did you notice anything weird?

173
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:32,520
-I don't know about that.

174
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:34,455
The only thing I can
think of is he always

175
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:36,157
seemed to be in such a hurry.

176
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,926
He never stayed very
long in one place.

177
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,963
You know, it was like he
was searching for something

178
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:43,531
important.

179
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:44,565
-Searching for something?

180
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:22,570
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Shindou.

181
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:31,179
Why aren't you playing anymore?

182
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,184
Here's your place.

183
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:41,456
You're gonna tell
me what's happened.

184
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:54,402
I'm sorry for just
dropping by like this.

185
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:56,137
-Oh, well, he should
be home from school

186
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,572
soon, so if you
don't mind waiting.

187
00:11:57,605 --> 00:12:00,475
Oh, how about I
get you some tea.

188
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:02,376
-Oh, don't make it just for me!

189
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:06,948
Hm.

190
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,032
That's a lot of dust.

191
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:27,368
It hasn't been used in months.

192
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:29,904
What's up with you, Shindou?

193
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:31,005
-I'm home.

194
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:42,450
-Shindou, hi.

195
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:49,524
-It's only you.

196
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:52,393
Hi.

197
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:53,394
-Hikaru.

198
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:56,130
You went up the stairs
in such a hurry.

199
00:12:56,164 --> 00:12:57,899
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
It wasn't Sai.

200
00:12:57,932 --> 00:13:00,168
I knew someone was here
and thought that maybe,

201
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:02,870
just maybe, it
might have been him.

202
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:04,205
But it wasn't.

203
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:05,106
Oh well.

204
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:09,243
-Isumi hasn't been here long.

205
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:12,113
If you give me a minute, I'll
get some tea for you too.

206
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:13,114
-I don't want any.

207
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:16,317
-Thanks.

208
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,618
This is great.

209
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:18,386
-You're welcome.

210
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:19,954
Make yourself at home.

211
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:29,330
-It's been quite a while.

212
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,199
How are you?

213
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,567
-Good.

214
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,570
I heard that you went to
China and did some studying.

215
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:36,604
-Yeah.

216
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:38,339
I was there for a
little over two months.

217
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:41,008
I just got back a
couple days ago.

218
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:43,544
Look, I didn't come
here to talk about me.

219
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:44,979
What's been happening, Shindou?

220
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:47,215
Waya says you've been missing
your games and the study

221
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:49,183
sessions.

222
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:50,095
Shindou?

223
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:54,222
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Here we go again.

224
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:56,357
All I want to do right
now is get out of here.

225
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,459
But I can't do that to Isumi.

226
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:02,563
I can't just bail on him when
I haven't seen him for so long.

227
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:06,434
-I remember you telling me
once thar Toya was your rival.

228
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:09,170
Do you think you can
never catch up to him?

229
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:11,205
Is that why you don't
want to play anymore?

230
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:13,341
-Toya's got nothing
to do with it.

231
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:17,111
And what exactly did you mean
by never catch up to him?

232
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:19,080
-Obviously you haven't heard.

233
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,082
You should see the way
he's been playing lately.

234
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:23,084
He's incredible.

235
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:26,287
-What does it say there?

236
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,055
Promotions?

237
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:29,056
Huh?

238
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:30,324
Toya's already made
it to a Three-Dan?

239
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:31,859
-Now look in the
preview where it

240
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:34,362
shows the games
playing this week.

241
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,864
You see today's date?

242
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:39,934
Hagiwara Nine-Dan versus
Akira Toya Three-Dan.

243
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:43,371
Honinbo championship,
third round qualifiers.

244
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:44,472
Through to the third round?

245
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:11,632
-Huh?

246
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:12,366
Kuwabara-sensei!

247
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:18,205
I thought you were supposed
to be playing right now.

248
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,141
Is the game finished already?

249
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:21,442
-Far from it.

250
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:24,378
My opponent, Mano, is taking
so long to think about his move

251
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:28,049
that I decided to come out
here for a bit of a break.

252
00:15:28,082 --> 00:15:30,951
How's young Toya doing in there?

253
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,586
-Oh, it's a battle.

254
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,089
Both players are
having a tough time.

255
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:36,891
Can you imagine what
an upset it would

256
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:39,193
be if Toya actually
managed to win?

257
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:41,896
A 15 year old Three-Dan.

258
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:43,931
Only in his second year
as a pro, and already

259
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:46,467
through to the
Honinbo round robin.

260
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,003
Kurata sure gave you a run
for your money in this year's

261
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:52,006
final, but if young Toya is one
of the challengers next year,

262
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,507
you'd better watch
out, or you're

263
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,042
going to lose your title.

264
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:57,945
The new wave you once talked
about will finally be here.

265
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:08,122
But you've got to wonder
what happened to Shindou.

266
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:10,925
I seem to remember you
were watching his progress

267
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:12,927
with a great deal of
interest, along with Ogata,

268
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:15,162
and even Koyo Toya.

269
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:16,897
-I'm not worried.

270
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:20,601
Hardship and doubt are
necessary for any Go player.

271
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,103
No, Mr. Amano.

272
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:24,338
I'm not worried
about him at all.

273
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:26,240
-Huh?

274
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:28,075
-Shindou got himself
dragged into the world

275
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:31,178
of the pros because
of young Toya.

276
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:33,948
As long as Toya's doing
his best to reach the top,

277
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:37,451
I guarantee Shindou
won't be far behind.

278
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:42,990
He will return-- so he
can face the opponent he's

279
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:46,227
meant to play.

280
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,396
-By the way you're
talking, you make it sound

281
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:52,166
as though it's Shindou's
destiny to be Toya's rival.

282
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,868
I think you overestimate him.

283
00:16:57,938 --> 00:17:01,075
-I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

284
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,543
Even Toya believes it.

285
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,876
-Toya's gotten this far already?

286
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:29,915
-If he wins the
game today, he'll

287
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,516
make it through to
the final eight.

288
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,185
Then he can enter
the lead to challenge

289
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,154
Kuwabara for the Honinbo title.

290
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,223
-He's turned into a
really strong player.

291
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:39,691
But how strong?

292
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,793
-It's obvious you still
care about the game.

293
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,796
So tell me why you
won't play Go anymore?

294
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,301
-Well, you see, I'm not really
interested in this stuff.

295
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,571
Besides, isn't it up to me
whether I quit playing Go or not?

296
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,174
-You?

297
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,242
Quit Go?

298
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:57,776
Are you serious?

299
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,350
Look, Shindou.

300
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,619
We're going to play.

301
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,319
-Wait.

302
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,187
Isumi, no.

303
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,221
I don't want to.

304
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,223
Just leave me alone.

305
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:48,293
I wish everyone would
stop worrying about me.

306
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:51,296
-I don't want to play because
I'm worried about you.

307
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,731
-Huh?

308
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,633
-I need this.

309
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,803
I need you to play
me one more game.

310
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:01,373
This is why I came
to see you today.

311
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,409
-But, Isumi, I--

312
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:07,345
-Do you remember the
last time we played?

313
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:11,149
It was during the pro
exam, nearly a year ago.

314
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,256
I went for atari
from the wrong side.

315
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,403
-Hm?

316
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:41,513
-I-- I-- I decided to resign.

317
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,914
What else could
I do after moving

318
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:46,184
a stone I'd already
placed on the board?

319
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,387
But it wasn't an easy
decision for me to make.

320
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:53,425
I seriously considered seeing
if I could get away with it.

321
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,693
I hate myself for it.

322
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,371
Shindou, that game was the
last time the two of us

323
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,373
ever played against each other.

324
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:10,909
Before this year's
pro exam begins,

325
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:12,510
I need to wipe the slate clean.

326
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:19,784
Please.

327
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,686
For me.

328
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,290
I really need you to
play this game with me.

329
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:27,659
-But Isumi--

330
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,894
-Please, Shindou!

331
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:29,628
One game!

332
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,836
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I want
to, but if I play Go again,

333
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,371
Sai might never come back.

334
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:57,188
[theme music]

335
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,776
HIKARU: Isumi really wants me
to play him in the rematch.

336
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:27,212
I've been thinking
about quitting as a pro,

337
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,748
but I can't give up on a friend.

338
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:34,419
I hope Sai understands how much
this one game means to Isumi.

339
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:36,488
During the game,
something amazing happens.

340
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:48,266
Next time, Sai Was Here!
