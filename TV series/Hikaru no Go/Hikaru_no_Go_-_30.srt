00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,407
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a go board,

2
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,478
a spirit from the past known as
Fujiwara no Sai has returned.

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,982
Visible only to Hikaru
Shindo, a master of go,

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,584
Sai seeks to play
the divine move.

5
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,553
[theme song]

6
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,610
-Ogata-sensei!

7
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,145
I need to know about
Shindo's match yesterday.

8
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,547
Something happened, didn't it?

9
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,183
Something important.

10
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,986
-You saw the board for yourself.

11
00:01:59,019 --> 00:01:59,686
-Yeah, I know.

12
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,055
But that's not the whole story.

13
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,291
I can't work out how
they got to that point.

14
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,460
It doesn't make any sense to me.

15
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,161
Something unusual happened.

16
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,998
You have to tell me what
it was that Shindo did!

17
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,399
-After making a
careless mistake,

18
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,101
he used the move
to his advantage.

19
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,369
It was a smart choice.

20
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,537
He didn't let the
fact that he'd made

21
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,673
a mistake affect the
rest of his game.

22
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,675
He drew his opponent
in and managed

23
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:26,313
to turn the game in his favor
with that one innovative move.

24
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,748
There's no rush.

25
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,116
-Hm?

26
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,551
-You'll get all the
answers you need

27
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,754
in just a couple
of months' time.

28
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,322
-The pro exam?

29
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,423
-That's right.

30
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,259
He's following the same
path you've been taking,

31
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,562
only he's doing it a year later.

32
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,131
-Kadowaki?

33
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,666
The same guy who held
the Student Meijin

34
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,135
title, the Student Honinbo
title, and the Student Joketsu

35
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,536
title at the same time?

36
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,104
That Kadowaki?

37
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:51,972
-You've got it.

38
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,407
He's the same guy, all right.

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,576
Everyone was talking
about him back then.

40
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,145
What's he up to now?

41
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,463
-Wow.

42
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,498
I haven't been here since my
college days in the Meijin

43
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,766
tournament.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,270
Oh, yeah.

45
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,970
Hey there.

46
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:24,538
It's me.

47
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,206
Guess where I am!

48
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,008
This place has a
lot of memories.

49
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,209
Hold on.

50
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,312
Didn't we lose the team
title because you messed up?

51
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:36,183
I told you already, I'm
going to take the pro test.

52
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,384
No, I'm not joking.

53
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,087
I got the registration
forms right here.

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,154
That's right.

55
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,256
By this time next
year, I'll be us apro.

56
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,259
You better get my autograph
now before I become too famous

57
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,094
for you.

58
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,662
Yeah, see you later.

59
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,565
-You think we need to be
worried about this Kadowaki guy?

60
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,033
-Huh?

61
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,001
-Are you sure that he's going
to be taking the pro exam?

62
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,971
-Well, that's what I
read on the internet.

63
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,706
We're going to have to
work really hard anyway.

64
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,974
Remember last year?

65
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,310
The only insei who
passed was Mashiba.

66
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,012
Players come from all
over the world for this.

67
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,248
-I still think
Kadowaki's a big threat.

68
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,450
-Who do those insei
jerks think they are?

69
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,752
They didn't even recognize me.

70
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,153
Read about me on the internet.

71
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,756
I bet that was his fault.

72
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,693
At least they're looking
forward to seeing me play.

73
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:20,994
They won't be disappointed.

74
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,006
Hm.

75
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,008
[laughing]

76
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:41,982
-I resign.

77
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,663
-What's he laughing at?

78
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:02,235
-I don't know, but whatever
it is, it's creeping me out.

79
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,136
-Thank you very much.

80
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,004
Have a nice day.

81
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,243
-They say you never
lose your skill at go,

82
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,345
even if you don't
play for a while.

83
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,681
But I guess I should
brush up on my game.

84
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,550
-I can't believe Sensei
actually scolded me.

85
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,350
-What?

86
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,251
For resigning too quickly?

87
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,261
-Did you see him staring at us?

88
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,196
-Yeah, what a weirdo.

89
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,441
-Oh.

90
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,369
-Hey, you.

91
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,537
You one of the insei?

92
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,371
-Yep.

93
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,606
Sure am.

94
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,575
KADOWAKI (VOICEOVER): Maybe
I could tune up for the exam

95
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,176
by playing him.

96
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,979
-The pro test's
happening soon, isn't it?

97
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,147
Are you taking it?

98
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,648
-Who are you, the town crier?

99
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,050
-What's that?

100
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,052
KADOWAKI (VOICEOVER): OK,
remember, he's just a kid.

101
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,186
Nearly half my age.

102
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,688
I'm sure he didn't mean
to insult me, so take

103
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,424
a deep breath and
ask him to play.

104
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,426
-I've always enjoyed playing go.

105
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,095
I wonder if you'd be
interested in a quick game?

106
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,029
-What?

107
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,397
You mean right now?

108
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,398
-Why not?

109
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,033
If you've got the
time, let's do it!

110
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,501
I'd love warm up.

111
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,136
I mean, test my skills.

112
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,040
-OK, why not?

113
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,442
Sure, I'll play with you.

114
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,443
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai!

115
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,043
-Huh?

116
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,486
-I never knew the Go Association
had a room like this.

117
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,022
-It's open for members of
the public to come and play.

118
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,156
You've never been in here?

119
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,195
-Hikaru?

120
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,429
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Hey.

121
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:40,033
You play, OK?

122
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,468
It's not an official
game, so I don't

123
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,703
see why I can't give
you a chance to play.

124
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,405
He said he wants
to test his skill,

125
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,173
so he probably knows
what he's doing.

126
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,024
We're up first, Sai.

127
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,996
-Onegaishimasu.

128
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,497
-Onegaishimasu.

129
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,473
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai?

130
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,009
-I'm sorry, but I haven't
played anyone other than you

131
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,511
in a very long time.

132
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,336
Not since I played it
Akira on the internet.

133
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:30,939
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Just don't
spend too much time thinking.

134
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:34,309
I want to get home before dark.

135
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:35,043
-Very well.

136
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,782
The 3-4 point, top right corner.

137
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:44,345
-Two minutes until the
game is called for the day.

138
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:47,782
I bet Kuwabara-sensei
will seal the last move.

139
00:08:47,782 --> 00:08:49,817
I never expected this.

140
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:51,853
The Honinbo title is
going to be decided

141
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,254
in the final game of the series.

142
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:56,290
When Ogata-sensei won the
first game so brilliantly

143
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,892
two months ago, I
thought for sure he

144
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:01,162
was going to win the title.

145
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:05,833
But now here we are, game seven.

146
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:09,237
Kuwabara-sensei is
a tough guy, the way

147
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,939
he fought his way
back into the series.

148
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:14,909
I guess that's where
his experience makes

149
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:15,810
all the difference.

150
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,886
-Time, please.

151
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,540
-Huh?

152
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:36,864
-I'm afraid we've
run out of time.

153
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:38,733
We need you to seal
your move for tomorrow.

154
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:25,213
-Huh.

155
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,748
He's been thinking about
it for over half an hour.

156
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,752
-The game record, please.

157
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:31,786
-Oh, here you are.

158
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:51,906
-You can seal it now.

159
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:53,841
-Thank you.

160
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,209
-I'm starving.

161
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:56,978
Let's go to this
great restaurant

162
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:57,945
just around the corner.

163
00:10:57,979 --> 00:10:59,814
Best unagi I've ever tasted.

164
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:01,649
And you, young
man who's scoring,

165
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:02,950
you're welcome to join us.

166
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:03,651
-Really?

167
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:04,118
Thanks!

168
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:05,787
I'd love to!

169
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,288
-I'll meet you in the lobby.

170
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:09,157
I just need to go and
get changed first.

171
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,759
Uh, Kakimoto, you'll
be coming, won't you?

172
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:12,860
-I'll be right with you.

173
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:16,230
I've got to put this
away in the hotel safe.

174
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:17,632
-What about you, Ogata?

175
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:19,033
-Thank you, but I
think I'll pass.

176
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,171
-See you all in the lobby, then.

177
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:23,771
-OK.

178
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:28,643
-Ogata?

179
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:35,082
I hope you're not
thinking you've

180
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:38,085
got the Honinbo Championship
in the bag already.

181
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,687
-That would be foolish.

182
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,389
The real battle's still to come.

183
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:42,857
-Absolutely right.

184
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,893
It's going to be a doozy-- a
fight to the very last stone.

185
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:48,930
Feeling confident
about your sealed move?

186
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,631
-Huh?

187
00:11:50,665 --> 00:11:52,133
-It's the first
time you've done it.

188
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,935
You never had to before.

189
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:56,003
In fact, this is the
first time you've ever

190
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:58,773
had a game of go that's
lasted longer than a day.

191
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:00,675
And up to now, I've
had the sealed move

192
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,010
in every single one
of our six games.

193
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:05,079
-And what exactly is your point?

194
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:08,049
-I hope you didn't mark
the score card incorrectly.

195
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:11,085
--[laughing] I'm sorry,
but I don't think so.

196
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:13,821
-Are you telling me people
never make mistakes?

197
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:17,158
It happened before, and it
could easily happen again.

198
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,293
Just a little slip of the pen.

199
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:24,365
It's a championship title match.

200
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,133
There's a lot at stake for you.

201
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,668
You must have been
a little nervous

202
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:31,639
sealing the move
for the first time.

203
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,174
Any doubts cross
your mind as your pen

204
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:35,743
hovered over the paper?

205
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:38,913
Should I choose
option A or option B?

206
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:42,617
Maybe your mind thought option
A but your hand wrote option

207
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,254
B. You've been staring at
a go board all day long.

208
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:49,323
Your mind must've
been exhausted.

209
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:52,627
Can you 100% certain that
the move you wrote down

210
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,961
was the correct one?

211
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:55,763
OGATA (VOICEOVER): He
had the sealed move

212
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:57,899
on all of the six
previous games.

213
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,901
Was that a deliberate
tactic on his part?

214
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:05,806
He couldn't have planned
every single one of them.

215
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,642
But whether they
were coincidences

216
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:09,644
or an intentional
ploy, it's obvious he's

217
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:10,811
trying to shake my confidence.

218
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:26,761
-[laughing] Oh dear.

219
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:30,898
I hope I haven't gotten
you all worried now.

220
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:33,167
-Not a chance.

221
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,369
-Well, I'd better get
changed before we go and eat.

222
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:36,364
Ta-ta.

223
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:43,844
You told me a new wave was
about to sweep the world of go.

224
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:48,015
I am most intrigued
at the prospect.

225
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:50,184
It's too early for me to leave.

226
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:55,189
I want to be there to greet
this new wave of players, firmly

227
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:57,258
established as the
reigning Honinbo.

228
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:01,896
I intend to hold onto this title
for a very long time to come.

229
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:30,925
-I-- I resign.

230
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:31,826
-Thanks for playing.

231
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:33,060
It was a good game.

232
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:34,829
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
This guy was awesome.

233
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:40,634
-Are you really-- are
you really an insei?

234
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:41,702
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Uh-oh!

235
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:43,637
Busted!

236
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,941
-What's the big rush?

237
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:48,609
Why don't you stick around?

238
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:50,244
-Sorry, but I've got to run.

239
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:52,913
-At least tell me how long
you've been playing go.

240
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:02,256
-Hm.

241
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,129
1,000 years.

242
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:08,729
-Huh?

243
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:25,379
Hm.

244
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:31,685
-Huh?

245
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:44,932
[phone ringing]

246
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:45,633
-Hey.

247
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,901
What do you want?

248
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,235
Huh?

249
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,672
No, I'm not doing it.

250
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:53,841
I'm not doing the pro exam.

251
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:55,609
Gave up on the idea.

252
00:15:55,643 --> 00:15:59,246
I think I underestimated
these guys.

253
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,049
No, that's not it.

254
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,820
You wouldn't understand anyway.

255
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,921
I'm going to train.

256
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:09,890
Spend a year and get my
game into better shape.

257
00:16:09,924 --> 00:16:11,192
That's right.

258
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:13,994
Nothing wrong with me delaying
the pro exam until next year.

259
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,801
Oh, I'm totally serious.

260
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:23,838
Life as a pro, here I come.

261
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:53,968
-It's time to start, so if
you're both ready, we'll begin.

262
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:11,732
-Huh?

263
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:30,317
The next move will be 3-12.

264
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:33,053
-[sigh]

265
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,089
-So, 3-12.

266
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,925
He decided to keep
the left side split.

267
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:41,028
I didn't think he'd move there.

268
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,230
-Did you get a
good night's sleep?

269
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:44,331
You well rested?

270
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:50,271
-Whoa, where did all
this tension come from?

271
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,907
Did something happen last
night between these two?

272
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,779
-You think I'm going
to any attention

273
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,681
to the ramblings of an old man?

274
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:03,751
It's time for you to
vacate the Honinbo throne!

275
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:06,120
Time for the new regeneration
to take its place.

276
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:28,876
-Hey, Waya?

277
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,277
What's this about
you and Isumi not

278
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:32,980
having to do the prelim
round for the pro exam?

279
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:35,783
-Well, the top eight
insei bypass the prelims

280
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:38,085
and go straight through
to the next stage.

281
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,653
Last year, I made up to ninth.

282
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,822
I came so close!

283
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,324
-You can say that again.

284
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:46,126
-I got up to number seven
this month, so I'm in!

285
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,860
-Sorry.

286
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:48,162
You're out of luck.

287
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,264
They go on your average ranking
over the last three months,

288
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,365
so you won't make it.

289
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:57,338
-Time for our last
study session.

290
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,107
And then we got summer
break in the prelims.

291
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,676
Good luck, and hope you make
it through the first around

292
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,211
of exam next month.

293
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:05,613
-Mmhmm.

294
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:06,213
-Later.

295
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:07,648
-You're going to do great.

296
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:08,949
-Thanks.

297
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:11,051
-I'm gonna go use the bathroom.

298
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:11,652
-OK.

299
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:15,789
-What was Shindo so happy about?

300
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,691
Doesn't he realize we're
going to be opponents

301
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,593
as soon as the exam starts?

302
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:34,174
[tapping]

303
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,709
-Ochi?

304
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,211
-And I'm the one who beat him.

305
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,685
[tapping]

306
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:50,324
-We're all so desperate to
win, but only three of us

307
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,327
can become pros, and one
of them is going to be me.

308
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,199
We can't all pass
the exam, so Shindo,

309
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,301
prepare to be disappointed.

310
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:12,730
-[humming]

311
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,167
-All right!

312
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:18,502
At last, the big day is here!

313
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,180
Can you believe I made this far?

314
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:31,548
-What do you mean, this far?

315
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:33,317
This is just the
start of your journey.

316
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,419
-Yeah, yeah, I know that.

317
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:36,921
But this is where I'm at!

318
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,657
One step closer
to my final goal!

319
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,426
First hurdle-- the
pro exam prelims!

320
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:45,462
Oh yeah, bring it on!

321
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,431
[theme song]

322
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:23,927
SAI (VOICEOVER): Hikaru,
aren't you nervous?

323
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,363
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): What is
there to be nervous about?

324
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:28,399
He's just another
opponent, right?

325
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:29,533
SAI (VOICEOVER): Be careful.

326
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:31,268
He's going to do
everything he can

327
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:32,836
to make you lose
your confidence.

328
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,538
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
What, like the fact

329
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:36,807
he walked out and left me
sitting there for half an hour

330
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:38,308
during the game?

331
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:39,777
SAI (VOICEOVER):
It's just a ploy.

332
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:45,349
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Next
time, The Awful Opponent.

333
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:47,584
SAI (VOICEOVER): I've never
seen anyone intimidate

334
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:49,887
Hikaru like this before.
