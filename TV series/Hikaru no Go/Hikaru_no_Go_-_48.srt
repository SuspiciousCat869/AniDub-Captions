1
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,274
[theme music]

2
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,242
-Huh?

3
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,012
I thought being a pro was all
about playing lots of matches.

4
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,680
When do you think I'll
get to play Toya, huh?

5
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,282
Any idea Waya?

6
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,183
-No!

7
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,284
-But now we're pros.

8
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,552
We've got a connection.

9
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,088
Me and Toya, me
and Toya's father.

10
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,223
We're all a part of
the same world now,

11
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,025
and one day I'll be
able to play them!

12
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,393
Me!

13
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,528
-He's right.

14
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:12,032
I'm not the one
connected to that world.

15
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,433
It's Hikaru.

16
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,969
It's him and him alone.

17
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,405
KUWABARA: I see that
kid managed to pass.

18
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,642
So, his name is Shindou?

19
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:25,679
He might be part of the new wave
that Ogata once talked about.

20
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,147
-Did you hear that?

21
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,218
They want me to play against
Toya Meijin in the next Shincho

22
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,185
Dan series.

23
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,420
-Please.

24
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,589
Allow me to play for you.

25
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,235
-But Sai, I can't let you.

26
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,674
-Please.

27
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,342
Let me play him, Hikaru.

28
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:09,623
-No!

29
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,725
Forget all about it!

30
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,427
Akira will be watching the game.

31
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,563
And so will Waya, and
Ochi, and everybody else!

32
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:24,171
It's gonna be on the
front page of "Go Weekly!"

33
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,505
Besides.

34
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,443
There's gonna be a reverse komi
handicap of 5 and 1/2 points.

35
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:32,079
That's what happened in
the Shincho Dan last year.

36
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,414
The new One-Dan player
has the advantage,

37
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,416
so it would be easy
for you to win.

38
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,221
You're too strong,
and if I let you play,

39
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,490
I'm gonna have your shadow
hanging over me again.

40
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,025
-Then let it be that way!

41
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,594
-Stop being so selfish, Sai!

42
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,162
This game's important to me.

43
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,163
-All right.

44
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,164
If you're not gonna
let me play now,

45
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,432
then tell me, when will you?

46
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,144
-Sai.

47
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,979
What's wrong?

48
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,647
I mean, you told me a
while back that you'll

49
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,050
be around for all eternity.

50
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,354
So, there's no rush for you
to play games right now.

51
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,256
You even said if I
died, you would simply

52
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,759
move on and find
someone else to inhabit.

53
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,727
Isn't that right?

54
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,196
-Hm.

55
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,408
HIKARU: Well?

56
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,035
-I can't deny that what
you've said is true--

57
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,337
-There, you see?

58
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,972
I'm just the second person.

59
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,374
There's also going to
be a third and a fourth.

60
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,177
-But Hikaru, you don't
seem to understand.

61
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,013
Lately, I've been starting
to feel very worried.

62
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,549
I don't know how much longer
I can stay in this world.

63
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,017
-If that's what
this is all about,

64
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,585
then you're worrying
over nothing.

65
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,621
Anyway, whenever I
let you play, I always

66
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,990
seem to get into
some sort of trouble.

67
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,025
Maybe the next guy you
inhabit will let you play.

68
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,729
SAI (VOICEOVER): Hikaru.

69
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,668
Does that mean he
has no intention

70
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,471
of letting me play again?

71
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,071
Ever?

72
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,280
OGATA: Kuwabara-sensei.

73
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,418
-Well.

74
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:49,316
Ho ho!

75
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,017
If it isn't Ogata.

76
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,552
It's been a while.

77
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,987
Nice to see you again.

78
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,595
We haven't met face to face like
this since the Honinbo title

79
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,096
match, hm?

80
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,131
The best of seven
series was a lot of fun.

81
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,139
-Even if I didn't win, I
learned a lot from playing you.

82
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,142
-You've been doing
very well recently, eh?

83
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,677
I hear you managed
to defeat Kurata

84
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,981
in quite a decisive
manner the other day.

85
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,515
-And what about you, sensei?

86
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,651
I've heard you've been
having a tough time.

87
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,419
-Well, you can't win 'em all.

88
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,621
Not when you get to my age.

89
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,556
But I won't be letting
go of my Honinbo title,

90
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,157
I can assure you of that.

91
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,468
-So why exactly are
you here, Kuwabara?

92
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:44,512
-Here, have one of these, Ogata.

93
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:48,182
It's an awful
habit we have, huh?

94
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:49,250
-I'm fine, thanks.

95
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:05,066
-So, you want to know
why I'm here, don't you?

96
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,103
I could ask you the
very same question.

97
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:13,040
This game today is with
a mere novice, a One-Dan.

98
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:14,508
Even though the
Meijin is playing,

99
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,344
I wouldn't have thought
it was worth someone

100
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:19,313
of your stature coming to watch.

101
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:21,315
I can only assume
you're here because you

102
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,250
have an interest in the
boy, because you think

103
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:26,187
he's going to be part of that
new wave of the world of Go?

104
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,756
-Do you know anything
about this Shindou?

105
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,459
Have you ever seen him
play anywhere before?

106
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,626
-That's why you're here!

107
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,095
I knew it.

108
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:36,664
I knew there was something
special about that boy.

109
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:40,401
I have a sixth sense
about these things.

110
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:42,103
-A sixth sense?

111
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:44,105
-Call it intuition, if you like.

112
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:47,475
All I did was walk past him, but
I just had a feeling, you know.

113
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,577
-How could you possibly
know from walking past him?

114
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,045
That's impossible.

115
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:52,580
WAYA: Shindou gets to go first,
and then it's you next week,

116
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:53,347
Ochi.

117
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:54,448
You guys are so lucky.

118
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:56,050
OCHI: You mean they
haven't called you yet?

119
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,618
WAYA: Not yet, but it
better happen soon.

120
00:08:04,558 --> 00:08:06,160
-Ogata Nine-Dan and
Kuwabara Honinbo?

121
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,097
Good afternoon!

122
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,198
-Come on, Ochi.

123
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:13,100
Let's go sit over here.

124
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,101
Come on!

125
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:22,710
-What do you think
they're doing here?

126
00:08:22,743 --> 00:08:25,112
I mean, they're some of the
best players in the world,

127
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:27,048
so why would they
come to watch this?

128
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,784
-They probably wanna see
how shindou does today.

129
00:08:30,017 --> 00:08:31,452
Did you know Ogata
was watching him

130
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:33,421
when he played the
Young Lions tournament?

131
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:35,056
And he was the one
who invited Shindou

132
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:37,591
to joint Toya Meijin's
study session.

133
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:40,161
-Shindou was studying
with Toya Meijin?

134
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:42,596
-No, he actually
decided not to, but only

135
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:46,033
because he'd already started
studying in my group.

136
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,036
I've got no idea why
Kuwabara-sensei's here,

137
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,671
unless he's also got
his eye on Shindou.

138
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:00,247
-Uh.

139
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:00,762
-Hello.

140
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:08,089
-Hello, Mr. Ogata,
and Kuwabara-sensei.

141
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:11,725
WAYA: So he did come, after all.

142
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,394
-Hi, how are you?

143
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,528
-Hi Ochi.

144
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:15,563
I'm fine, thank you.

145
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,597
-He knows your name?

146
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,465
How come?

147
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:19,633
How do you two know each other?

148
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,570
-Young man, you're the son
of the Meijin, aren't you?

149
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,471
-Yes, sir.

150
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:24,805
My name's Akira Toya.

151
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,640
It's a pleasure to meet you.

152
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:29,743
-I suppose you're also here
to see how Shindou does.

153
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,547
-Uh, no, I was just--

154
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,182
-I see, I see.

155
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:37,351
Everyone seems
interested in him.

156
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,552
Even the Meijin.

157
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:40,454
He might have five
championship titles,

158
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:42,523
but he's keeping a close
eye on the new boy.

159
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:43,691
Fasinating!

160
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:46,127
-Is this match that important?

161
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,595
-All here for Shindou?

162
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:50,598
Who is he?

163
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,601
-He was a classmate,
a rival, and a friend.

164
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,202
That's all I know.

165
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:57,705
-And smile, please.

166
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:00,708
[camera snapping]

167
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:19,260
-My son Akira will be
watching the match today.

168
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:21,462
I've noticed he's been
following your progress

169
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,663
with a great deal of interest.

170
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,801
But he isn't the only one.

171
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:31,071
Both Ogata and myself have
been keeping a close eye

172
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:32,506
on your development.

173
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,208
And if you want
to know the truth,

174
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,278
I personally choose you
to be my opponent today.

175
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:39,013
-Huh?

176
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:40,748
-So show me how strong you are.

177
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:43,717
Don't hold anything back.

178
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:44,718
-Yes, sir.

179
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:50,724
(VOICEOVER) The
championship room.

180
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:53,127
The same room that Waya
and I snuck into last year

181
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,195
to look around.

182
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:56,197
And now I'm the one
who's playing in there.

183
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:11,111
Huh?

184
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:11,627
Huh?

185
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,643
Sai?

186
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:34,034
Sai!

187
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:57,291
Sai!

188
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:18,112
-Huh?

189
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,414
Shindou, please take your seat.

190
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,316
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai,
move out of the way!

191
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:33,694
KUWABARA: So, Ogata.

192
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:39,133
How would you feel about
making this more interesting?

193
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,101
-A friendly wager, then?

194
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:42,369
Sounds like a good idea.

195
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:43,771
[laughter]

196
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:45,272
-It does, doesn't it?

197
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,042
-A wager?

198
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:51,478
-Now, there's a handicap
of 5 and 1/2 reverse komi,

199
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:54,748
but even with that, he'll have
a tough time against Koyo Toya.

200
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:55,482
-Yes.

201
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:56,717
I agree.

202
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,619
-Unless, of course, the
Meijin takes it easy and lets

203
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:01,388
him win, as a gift to welcome
him to the big leagues.

204
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:02,156
-No.

205
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:03,424
He'd never do that.

206
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:06,527
-No, I don't suppose he would.

207
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,562
-So, who are you betting on?

208
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,373
-I'll go for the boy.

209
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:20,641
-Hm.

210
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:22,776
Going for the long
shot, are you?

211
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,078
-Not at all.

212
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:27,781
I never make bets that
I don't think I can win.

213
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,316
Not me.

214
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,385
I know what you're
thinking, Ogata.

215
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:33,420
You wanted to be the
one betting on the kid.

216
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,489
Isn't that right?

217
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:38,158
-You forget that I'm one
of the Meijin's students.

218
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,461
There's no doubt in my mind
that he's going to win it.

219
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:42,363
-The way they talk
about Shindou.

220
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:43,731
Just who is he?

221
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:45,733
-Well, he was a
classmate and a rival.

222
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:47,534
And he's also a friend.

223
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:50,437
That's all I know.

224
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:52,339
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Shindou.

225
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,375
You're about to play my father.

226
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,277
Ogata and Kuwabara-sensei
are watching your every move.

227
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:59,146
You've made it this far.

228
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:02,049
I've been waiting for this
moment for a long time.

229
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:03,484
What will your strategy be?

230
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:10,357
What kind of game are
you going to play?

231
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:24,638
-Uh, young man?

232
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:26,640
We need you to sit down now.

233
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:36,483
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai!

234
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:41,155
-Hm?

235
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,293
Is something the
matter, Shindou?

236
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:56,503
-You OK?

237
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:58,739
-I'm really sorry, Hikaru.

238
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,508
I just wanted to sit
there for a moment.

239
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:02,309
-That's all right.

240
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:16,490
-Come on, Shindou.

241
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,392
Sit.

242
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:18,946
-Hm?

243
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:33,240
(VOICEOVER) Pull yourself
together Sai, and stop sulking.

244
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,075
I've got an important game here.

245
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:40,214
I understand how you feel.

246
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:55,028
But-- I know the thing
is-- Sai, I know a chance

247
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:57,064
like this doesn't come
along for you every day.

248
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:05,772
No, no!

249
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:08,642
If I let Sai play when there's
a 5 and 1/2 point reverse komi,

250
00:16:08,642 --> 00:16:11,078
he'd win way too easily.

251
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:13,380
Then I'd get all kinds of
attention from everyone.

252
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:19,219
Wait a minute.

253
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:24,224
What if-- yes, a handicap.

254
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:26,560
If Sai had to work with
a different handicap,

255
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:28,729
his game would be
completely changed.

256
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:30,497
Toya Meijin gets
the second move,

257
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,634
and he has the 5 and 1/2
point handicap against him.

258
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:38,071
But if I gave Sai an even
bigger one-- let's see.

259
00:16:38,105 --> 00:16:41,742
If Sai had to overcome
the handicap of 15 points,

260
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,278
he wouldn't be able to
play his usual game.

261
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:47,214
And that his true ability
wouldn't be so obvious.

262
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:47,714
-I'll do it!

263
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:49,049
I'll do it!

264
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:52,185
I'll plays as if I'm
facing a 15 point handicap.

265
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,487
-Sai.

266
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:55,789
Do you understand what
you're agreeing to?

267
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,759
Even if you get to move first,
trying to make up 15 points

268
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,395
means you'll have to
make a lot of over plays.

269
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,564
Don't forget, your
opponent is Akira's dad.

270
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:06,166
He could crush you
in this kind of game.

271
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,535
Is this really how you
want to play against him?

272
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,504
-It's time for play to begin.

273
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:12,406
The new One-Dan moves first.

274
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,541
Reverse komi of
5 and 1/2 points.

275
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,543
You'll have two hours
of playing time.

276
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,178
If you go into
overtime, you will

277
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,747
be allowed one minute per move.

278
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:21,348
-Huh?

279
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:25,185
Sai?

280
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:31,091
-When you're ready,
please begin.

281
00:17:31,124 --> 00:17:31,625
-Onegai shimasu.

282
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:35,762
HIKARU (VOICEOVER:):
All right, then.

283
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,466
If that's what you really want.

284
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:40,167
Onegai shimasu.

285
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:52,479
How are you gonna
pull this off, Sai?

286
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:15,702
OCHI: It's been 20
minutes already.

287
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:21,508
-They have started the
game, haven't they?

288
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,077
-This kid must be
very determined.

289
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:25,712
-Are you sure it's
determination?

290
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,481
-What else could it be?

291
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,283
You're not saying he's too
nervous to pick up a stone?

292
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,486
[laughter]

293
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,087
-Shindou's up to something.

294
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:36,390
Or why else would he wait?

295
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:39,559
It's not like he didn't know who
his opponent was going to be.

296
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:41,228
Normally you would
come into the game

297
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:45,198
with at least some idea
about your first move.

298
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:48,068
He does realize he's only got
two hours of playing time,

299
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:49,169
doesn't he?

300
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:50,637
Wasting 20 minutes at
the beginning like this

301
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,305
is very unusual.

302
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,307
-You wouldn't catch me
using that much time.

303
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,642
-Yeah. Me neither.

304
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:01,615
-Well, this makes
me think he must

305
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,550
be planning something special.

306
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,652
After all, he's
quite extraordinary.

307
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,488
[laughter]

308
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,623
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Shindou.

309
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:32,112
-What is he doing?

310
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:36,249
SAI (VOICEOVER): So, I need
to finish 15 points ahead?

311
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:39,286
Hm, that's quite
a tough challenge.

312
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,122
It's not like this is some
player from a Go salon.

313
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:44,291
This is one of the
strongest adversaries

314
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:45,592
I'm ever likely to meet.

315
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,029
Someone who will fight down
to the last half point.

316
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,263
Yes.

317
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:53,266
The atmosphere around this
board is intense, exactly

318
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:56,336
as it was the time we
faced each other before.

319
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,371
No matter what the
circumstances are,

320
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,440
he will have to respond
to my every move.

321
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:09,116
My goal is to win by
more than 15 points.

322
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:12,185
I have no alternative but
to go on the offensive.

323
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:14,488
A fight where I
destroy my opponent,

324
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:17,591
or be destroyed in the process.

325
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:21,394
How far will I be able to go?

326
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,730
The upper right hand corner.

327
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,531
Star point!

328
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:45,485
[theme music]

329
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,251
SAI: I must play
the board perfectly,

330
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:25,685
all the way until the end game.

331
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,421
HIKARU: Do you think
you can do it, Sai?

332
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:29,522
SAI: Don't worry.

333
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,591
All of my attacks
may look random,

334
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,761
but there will be a
greater plan in force here.

335
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:36,129
HIKARU: Remember.

336
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:38,431
A lot of people are
watching us really closely.

337
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:42,502
SAI: And I'll give them a
game they'll never forget!

338
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:43,536
HIKARU: Next time.

339
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:45,772
A Game of Desperate Measures.

340
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,440
SAI: I just hope
the Meijin doesn't

341
00:22:47,474 --> 00:22:49,432
realize what we're up to.
