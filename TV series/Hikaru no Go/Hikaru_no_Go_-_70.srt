--This isn't the first
time it's happened.

00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,653
He's lost more than
once by default.

6
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:54,513
He's lost a lot.

7
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:55,223
-What?

8
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,587
WAYA: I don't why,
but he's completely

9
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,155
lost interest in playing Go.

10
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,229
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai.

11
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,678
-That's a lot of dust.

12
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,180
It hasn't been used in months.

13
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,150
What's up with you, Shindo?

14
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,188
Look, Shindo, we
are going to play.

15
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:39,426
I don't want to play because
I'm worried about you.

16
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,495
I need this.

17
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,465
I need you to play
me one more game.

18
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,135
This is why I came
to see you today.

19
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,504
-But, Isumi, I--

20
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,707
-Do you remember the
last time we played?

21
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,411
It was during the pro
exam, nearly a year ago.

22
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,337
Please Shindo.

23
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,440
Shindo.

24
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,248
One game.

25
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,116
That's all I ask.

26
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,558
ISUMI: Sai.

27
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,528
What if-- no, I can't.

28
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,111
Huh.

29
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:11,251
In China, know what I found out?

30
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,188
I discovered how much I
wanted to become a pro.

31
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,157
I was immersed in the game.

32
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:21,061
I was surrounded by pros who
spent every minute studying it.

33
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,699
It made me realize that this was
the path I was meant to take.

34
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,101
Passing the pro exam is
one stop along the way,

35
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,703
but that's not my final goal.

36
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,171
The path keeps going.

37
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,140
We're all competing
against each other,

38
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,676
but everyone's headed
in the same direction.

39
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,413
It doesn't matter whether it's
a top pro or someone like you.

40
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,250
-Like me?

41
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,284
-Am I wrong?

42
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,454
You said you're going
to quit, didn't you?

43
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,527
I think it would be a shame
if you decide to do that.

44
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:03,537
-But I-- I-- I can't do it.

45
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:15,982
-But I-- I-- I can't do it.

46
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,119
I'm not going to play.

47
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,454
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,189
It's just--

50
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,263
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Shindo.

51
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,670
Listen.

52
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,471
What you do with your
life is up to you,

53
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,006
so if you want to
quit playing Go,

54
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,275
I'm not going to
stand in your way.

55
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:48,048
But why don't you play one last
game with me just for my sake?

56
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,690
-Just one game.

57
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,191
-Yeah.

58
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,492
And then I'll leave you alone.

59
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,380
-All right. Sure.

60
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,140
Sai, I'm doing this for Isumi.

61
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,547
This has got nothing to do
with me wanting to play.

62
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,021
Isumi's trying to
continue on the path

63
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,422
with a clear conscience.

64
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,257
You know what he's feeling.

65
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,992
You can understand him, right?

66
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,028
-Onegaishimasu.

67
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:08,495
-Onegaishimasu.

68
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,706
Sai, there's no other way.

69
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:24,744
I have to play, or he'll
never be able to move on.

70
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,613
It's only one game.

71
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,248
You can forgive me.

72
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,049
Can't you?

73
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:35,155
Sai, why won't you answer me?

74
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,456
Where did you go?

75
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,117
HAGIWARA (VOICEOVER):
Whoever wins

76
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,053
this game gets through
the Honinbo league

77
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,022
and has a chance to
play for the title.

78
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,399
Whoever loses has to
start over again next year

79
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,667
with a qualifying tournament.

80
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,741
Both of us desperately
want to win.

81
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,976
It's only his first chance
to enter the league,

82
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,678
but I've been trying
for seven years

83
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,413
and only made it once so far.

Come on, Shindo.

Here I am.

86
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,144
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Concentrate.

87
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,557
I can't get too excited.

88
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:26,366
But I can't help it.

89
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,241
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): He's
taken the upper right corner,

90
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,511
but my stones are in
a stronger formation.

91
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,346
Shindo's not giving up much.

92
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,084
He's reading the board well.

93
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,352
If it comes down who can
better read the board,

94
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,254
my training in China
should come in handy.

95
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,035
There.

96
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,146
-Huh?

97
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,150
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): I'm not going
to let you have your own way.

98
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,052
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
He's fighting back.

99
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:24,023
He was in a tricky spot,
but he handled it well.

100
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,665
I don't like the way he's
clustered my stones together,

101
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,400
but I can still cut.

102
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,250
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): He's
dictating the game again.

103
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,985
I can't let him
get away with that.

104
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,556
I can't afford to lose
any more territory.

105
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,031
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He's left
some of his stones vulnerable.

106
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,667
If I attack him, I can
split his position.

107
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,473
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): If
I can connect here.

108
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,378
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Now I've
got more territory than him.

109
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,684
His defense is too strong.

110
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,253
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): The
game is still even.

111
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,288
It's not over yet.

112
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,075
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Isumi.

113
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,143
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Shindo.

114
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,147
BOTH (VOICEOVER):
He's gotten stronger.

115
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,723
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): If I can
push against White's position

116
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,738
at the top there--

117
00:12:58,489 --> 00:12:59,529
--Sai?

118
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,330
-Shindo?

119
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:34,635
-That move I just played.

120
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:45,646
It was-- it was exactly the
same move he'd have played.

121
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:53,554
He was here.

122
00:13:53,587 --> 00:14:00,561
I've been looking
for him everywhere,

123
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:03,764
and he was here all the time.

124
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:09,303
-Are you OK?

125
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:18,745
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Sai was here.

126
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,180
I couldn't find him anywhere.

127
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,121
But he was here in the Go
board, here with me as I play.

128
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:32,192
He wasn't hiding from me.

129
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:36,263
The only way for
me to see him again

130
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,699
was by actually having a game.

[sobbing]

132
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:55,682
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Sai, does this

133
00:14:55,716 --> 00:15:02,489
is mean-- does this mean
it's OK for me to play?

134
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:07,187
-Shindo?

135
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:16,837
-You know what, Isumi, I
think I can play again.

136
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:19,172
I don't have to quit after all.

137
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:20,140
I can play Go.

138
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:34,254
-Listen, Shindo.

139
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:39,560
Something has been
troubling you all this time.

140
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:42,296
-I promise from
now on, I'm going

141
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:45,165
to play all the time,
dozens, hundreds,

142
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,135
even thousands of games
against you, Isumi,

143
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:51,338
and Waya, and
Ochi, and everyone.

144
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:53,307
-Yeah.

145
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:54,441
Same here.

146
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,176
I'm going to play
as much as I can.

147
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:07,220
-You've been a big help, Isumi.

148
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:09,823
Now, I'm ready to
make a fresh start.

Huh?

-Do you know if the
game's finished yet?

153

-You're Hikaru Shindo.

154
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,169
What's the matter with you?

155
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:57,404
-Well, I, uh--

156
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:58,405
-I don't want to hear it.

157
00:16:58,438 --> 00:16:59,773
Perhaps, you can
explain why you've

158
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:01,208
been skipping all your games.

159
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:03,310
-Give it a rest would you?

160
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,645
-Give it a rest?

161
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:06,213

00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,148
-Listen, Shindo.

164
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:16,156
If you're looking for your
rival, he's on the fifth floor.

165
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,011
-Thanks.

166
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:25,732
-Kuwabara Sensei,
what was that about?

167
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:28,268
-Didn't you see that
look in his eyes?

168
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,170
It's good to know he's
back to normal again.

169
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:36,176
Mr. Sakamaki, I'm surprised
you haven't realized this.

170
00:17:36,176 --> 00:17:41,181
It takes not one, but two
people to play a game of Go.

171
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:42,716
-Of course, I know that.

172
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:43,483
Everyone does.

173
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,452
It's obvious.

174
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:46,153
-No.

175
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:46,653
You don't get it.

176
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,493
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Wait for me, Toya.

177
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:54,861
I've got to tell you something.

178
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:01,368
-Congratulations, it
was a hard fought game.

179
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,302
-Yeah, congratulations.

180
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:03,236
-Thank you very much.

181
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,639
-That was an awesome game.

182
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:07,107
-OK, Toya.

183
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,643
If you have time, let's go
upstairs and do the interview.

184
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:10,711
-OK.

185
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:12,713
-I felt sure this
was a year Hagiwara

186
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:15,182
was going to return
to the Honinbo League.

187
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:16,850
-And he was beaten
by a teenager.

188
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,853
This is going to be a big story.

189
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:21,722
-Having a champion
for a father must

190
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,825
have helped him along the way.

191
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,326
-Hold on.

192
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,762
Are you insinuating that Toya
couldn't make it on his own?

193
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:29,563
[gasp]

194
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,801
-Toya deserves all the credit.

195
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,803
No one else.

196
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:38,839
His father had
nothing to do with it.

197
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:46,379
-Hey, Toya.

198
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:49,750
Congratulations on your
win, and good luck.

199
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,519
-Thank you very much.

200
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:53,653
-Thanks for the good game.

201
00:18:58,158 --> 00:18:59,326
-Shindo!

202
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,101
-Huh?

203
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:08,869
-Shindo, where have you
been hiding all this time?

204
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:12,472
-Is this the game record?

205
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:13,306
So you won.

206
00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:18,345
-Why are you here?

207
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:27,254
-Toya, I'm back.

208
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:30,457
-You can't play Go
by yourself, oh no.

209
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:33,260
-I've decided I'm not quitting.

210
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:34,127
-Didn't you hear me?

211
00:19:34,161 --> 00:19:35,695
I already said I know that.

212
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:38,598
-Yes, but you're not
really listening.

213
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:41,134
A truly great game
will never happen

214
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:43,603
with only one great player.

215
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:46,673
-I'm going to keep
on this path forever.

216
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:48,108
I had to tell you.

217
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:51,344
That's why I'm here.

218
00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:54,614
-You see, Mr. Sakamaki,
you have to have

219
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:56,583
two players of
equal genius, two.

220
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:04,357
And when these two come
together, anything is possible.

221
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:05,192
-Catch up to me.

222
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:10,330
-Hm.

223
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:14,100
KUWABARA: Even the divine move.

224
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:15,202
-Are you sure?

225
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,537
The divine move?

226
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:19,139
-It's one step closer.

227
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:20,874
[laughing]

228
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:22,742
-They're so far away from it.

229
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:26,746
-It looks like the kid is
determined to stay on the path,

230
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,550
but it's an endless journey.

231
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:31,618
And it's hard.

232
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:33,753
As long as I'm around,
I'm going to fight.

233
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:35,355
I won't make it
easy for these kids,

234
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:36,523
no matter how good they are.

235
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:56,877
[theme music]

236
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:23,830
-My next pro match
is set, and there's

237
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:26,266
no way I'm going to
forfeit this one.

238
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,401
It's against Murakami,
and he really

239
00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:30,837
wants to win so he can
be promoted to 3-dan.

240
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,174
Even though he's ranked higher
than me, I'm not intimidated.

241
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:37,344
The game is going to be close.

242
00:22:37,377 --> 00:22:39,746
The guys at the Go club are
making some changes too.

243
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:41,414
A new leader has to be chosen.

244
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:48,121
Next time, "Making a Comeback."
