NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,656
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:13,763
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:19,308
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

6
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:53,477
-So, did you pass?

7
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,780
-Huh?

8
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,650
-Mm-hm.

9
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,888
-Any idea who this guy is, Waya?

10
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:00,792
-No, but I saw him
outside in the hall.

11
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:04,501
I overheard him say he
was gonna beat Akira Toya.

12
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:05,436
-Of course I am.

13
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:06,872
I'm his rival and he's mine.

14
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:08,242
Why would I make that up?

15
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:11,148
-But he's way better than you.

16
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,384
-I'll catch up to him someday.

17
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:12,785
You'll see.

18
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,590
-Aw.

19
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:31,725
All those losses.

20
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,731
Toya's so-called rival
has six straight losses

21
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:37,270
in the B league.

22
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:38,306
-Yeah, what's your point?

23
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:40,611
What's it got to do with you?

24
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:41,780
-Wait, I've got it.

25
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:44,385
Maybe you two are rivals
at playing Shogi, not Go.

26
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,822
[growling]

27
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,559
-Don't pay any attention to him.

28
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:50,432
You're getting stronger
all the time, Hikaru.

29
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:52,704
-And I guess your ranking's
a whole lot better?

30
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:53,339
-Take a look.

31
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:54,307
-Hm?

32
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,911
Let's see.

33
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:58,415
Waya, Waya.

34
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,284
What?

35
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:01,723
He's number six in the A league?

36
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:02,491
OK.

37
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:04,262
So you're pretty good.

38
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:07,202
-Sure, compared to you,
last place in the B league.

39
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:10,308
-But, you still lost
to Toya twice in a row.

40
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:11,745
-So what if he beat
me twice in a row?

41
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:14,617
I'm still way closer to
his level than you are.

42
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,321
But I'm not even on his radar.

43
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:18,826
He couldn't care
less if I exist.

44
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,430
-What are you talking about?

45
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:21,499
-Hm?

46
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,202
I'm just really
mad because I let

47
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,675
myself be intimidated
by him in the pro test.

48
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,512
It didn't matter
how good I played.

49
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,816
I mentally lost the
game before it started.

50
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:30,819
-Yeah.

51
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:32,823
I also got to play
against Toya once.

52
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:35,228
And I lost!

53
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:36,966
-What a surprise.

54
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,669
-Who cares about Akira Toya?

55
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,816
I'm just gonna rise to the top.

56
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:51,496
-Who was that?

57
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:52,365
-Ochi.

58
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,868
He's a kid from the sixth grade.

59
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,372
-Oh.

60
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:57,910
-He came here about a
year before you did,

61
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:00,683
and he started off at the bottom
of the B league, like you.

62
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:02,253
-What's his rank now?

63
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:04,357
-He's number three
in the A league.

64
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,294
-Third in the A league?

65
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:08,466
Whoa.

66
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,874
WAYA: I think he's planning to
take the pro exam this year.

67
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:14,946
I wanna pass the pro
exam this year as well.

68
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:16,517
If I can do that,
then I don't have

69
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,421
to go to my stupid high school.

70
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:20,692
-I guess you don't like
going to school, huh?

71
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:22,563
I hate it it's so
boring sitting around

72
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,035
in a class for hours
and hours every day.

73
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:26,504
-I hear that.

74
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:28,776
-I'll be in ninth grade when
I take the test next summer.

75
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,317
If I pass, I'll finish school
and begin life as a pro.

76
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,656
-I have to pass the
test this year too.

77
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:35,056
-Yeah?

78
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,326
How come?

79
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,862
-I'm going to be 18
pretty soon, and that's

80
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:41,838
the age limit for
being an Insei.

81
00:04:41,838 --> 00:04:43,508
-But you don't have
to be an Insei.

82
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,715
You can still take the pro
exam right up until you're 30.

83
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:50,923
-Yeah, I know all that stuff,
but it's more about how I feel.

84
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,562
The last two years, I've gone
into the test as the number one

85
00:04:53,596 --> 00:04:55,366
Insei and I still didn't pass.

86
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,471
-Hm.

87
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,810
-If I don't make it
this year, I don't

88
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:02,983
know if I wanna take it anymore.

89
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:04,953
-How many people
actually pass the test?

90
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,390
-Only three.

91
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:06,992
-What?

92
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:07,727
Three?

93
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,996
Is that all?

94
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:11,000
-You've got a long way to
go before you stand any sort

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,073
of chance, Mr.
Six-Losses-In-A-Row.

96
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,477
-He's right.

97
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,479
A long way.

98
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,623
MAN: I cut my losses there.

99
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,661
Now, if you look
carefully, this sequence

100
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:25,765
leaves black at a disadvantage.

101
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:27,068
-All right.

102
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:29,039
So you think I should focus on
going after those two stones

103
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,740
there?

104
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:30,475
MAN: Right.

105
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:31,911
You should extend here.

106
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:34,651
MAN: Then I could win the
match from that one move?

107
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:36,387
MAN: Um, probably.

108
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:38,693
-Probably?

109
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:41,666
What's your opinion on it, Toya?

110
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,635
Uh, Toya?

111
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:43,503
-Huh?

112
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:45,039
Oh, I'm sorry.

113
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:46,376
-What's the matter?

114
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:49,048
Too busy dreaming about
finally becoming a pro.

115
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,084
-No.

116
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,122
-I can't believe it's
finally happened.

117
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:54,526
Akira Toya turning professional.

118
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:56,130
-But I still don't
understand what

119
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:59,069
you thought you were doing
playing in a school Go club.

120
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:01,441
Any ideas, Ogata?

121
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:03,713
-I don't know, but he seemed
to have a lot more spirit

122
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:06,886
back then.

123
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,628
Go's more than just technique.

124
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,534
When there are two players with
a similar technical ability,

125
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,405
a game can often
be decided by which

126
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:17,643
one has the greater
mental strength.

127
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:22,553
And right now, Toya,
you just don't have it.

128
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:23,656
-Hey.

129
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,159
I don't think I'm any
different from before.

130
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:27,097
-I don't know about you
guys, but I've never

131
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:29,669
noticed a lack of spirit
when I've played him.

132
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:31,673
-Well, you wouldn't notice
because he beats you

133
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:32,975
all the time.

134
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,081
You play against him
every day Meijin.

135
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:36,851
You must be able to
tell the difference.

136
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:42,831
-Once he starts competing
professionally in April,

137
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:46,705
the results will
speak for themselves.

138
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:48,642
Ashiwara, I think you
should concentrate

139
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:49,979
on your own progress.

140
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,485
I'm surprised you haven't got
beyond the preliminary rounds

141
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:53,186
by now.

142
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,188
-Uh, yes sir.

143
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:57,996
-Hm.

144
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,502
-Do you have any
plans this Sunday?

145
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:01,670
-Uh.

146
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:05,946
-There's someone
I want you to see.

147
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,216
AKIRA: I wonder what he means.

148
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:15,667
-Hey, Shindou!

149
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,037
You actually won.

150
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,705
-Ha ha!

151
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:18,841
Yep, I did it.

152
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,150
-Your one and only win.

153
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,789
-My winning streak's
gonna start here.

154
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:26,190
-Hm?

155
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:31,602
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Akira?

156
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:39,251
-Huh?

157
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,554
That's Toya.

158
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:45,197
What's he doing around here?

159
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:48,771
-Hey!

160
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:54,784
Hey, Toya.

161
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:57,858
Toya!

162
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:03,938
-What do you
think's up with him?

163
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:06,810
Maybe he's looking for an
instructor or something.

164
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,679
-Don't think so.

165
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:08,548
-Huh?

166
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:10,585
-He came here to check up on me.

167
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:11,922
-What are you talking about?

168
00:08:11,955 --> 00:08:15,194
In case you didn't notice, he
just completely ignored you.

169
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,103
There's no way you
and him are rivals.

170
00:08:19,137 --> 00:08:22,878
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He said
I'd never see him again.

171
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:24,548
But he's waiting for me.

172
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,954
He's waiting for me to
rise up to his level.

173
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:38,244
-You didn't know that
Hikaru had become an Insei.

174
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:39,848
-Is that what you
meant when you said

175
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:41,117
you wanted to show me something?

176
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,128
So what if he's managed
to become an Insei.

177
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:48,734
I really don't see what
that's got to do with me.

178
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:51,039
-I get the impression that
he's chasing after you, Akira.

179
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:57,786
-Ah, Akira Toya, you're here!

180
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:58,989
-Good afternoon.

181
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,091
-Oh, perfect timing.

182
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,762
Could we get an
interview with you?

183
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:03,766
I'm interested in your
thoughts on turning pro,

184
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,636
about your father,
that kind of thing.

185
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,873
-Sure, I don't mind.

186
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:09,311
-Come up to the PR
department when you're ready.

187
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:10,647
-I'll be right there.

188
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:12,017
-Appreciate it.

189
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,219
Nice to see you, Ogata-sensei.

190
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,965
-I guess I'll head up there now.

191
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:19,733
-OK.

192
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:20,736
I'm going to go home.

193
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,205
I just thought
seeing your friend

194
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:24,844
here might be a bit of
a motivation for you.

195
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:25,746
-Heh.

196
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,149
You think you're
funny, don't you?

197
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:31,292
How could he be a threat
to me at his level?

198
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:34,031
But even if it is true
that he's chasing after me,

199
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:36,235
I'll move so far ahead
of him that he'll never

200
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:38,774
catch up to me.

201
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:40,010
He won't even come close.

202
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:03,093
-Looks like he was all
the motivation you needed.

203
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:05,698
OGATA (VOICEOVER): It's gonna
be interesting having that kid

204
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,068
around.

205
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:09,674
I suppose he'll remain here
as an Insei for a while.

206
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:16,454
I can't wait to see
him competing as a pro.

207
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:22,000
That is, if he's good
enough to make it that far.

208
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:36,197
[surprised whispering]

209
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:36,932
-Imanishi.

210
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:37,701
Where are you going?

211
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,943
-Hey!

212
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:44,749
-You can't storm out like that
just because you lost a game.

213
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:47,020
-You were playing
Imanishi, right?

214
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:48,223
-Yeah.

215
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:50,261
-Did he make a big
mistake or something?

216
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:51,029
-Mm-hm.

217
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:53,000
Totally misread the game.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,372
-I think he's just a bit on
edge because of his high school

219
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,207
entrance exam.

220
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,211
-Thanks, man.

221
00:10:58,244 --> 00:11:00,983
-He said his grades
were going down.

222
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:02,020
-Makes sense.

223
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,823
Improve your game
or study for school.

224
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:05,159
I know which one I'd choose.

225
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,963
-That's fine if you
can make it as a pro,

226
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:08,400
but Imanishi's still
in the B league.

227
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,072
-No wonder he was so mad,
making a stupid mistake

228
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:13,176
and losing to
someone like Shindou.

229
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:16,016
-Thanks a lot.

230
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:19,189
Hey, Toya never seems to study
for school either, does he?

231
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:22,363
But he still got into Kaio,
so he must be really smart.

232
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:23,165
-Right.

233
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:24,233
Doesn't that make you mad?

234
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,202
-Not really.

235
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:26,237
Doesn't bother me.

236
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:28,109
-Well, it bothers me.

237
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:33,152
Then he goes and passes the
pro test on his first try.

238
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:36,326
He's gonna be playing in
the Shinsho Dan series soon.

239
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:37,228
HIKARU: Shinsho Dan?

240
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,464
What's that?

241
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,337
-You really don't have a
clue about anything, do you?

242
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:43,776
The Shinso Dan series
is where the guys who

243
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:45,847
just turned pro
play against the top

244
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,082
ranked veterans in the game.

245
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:49,354
-It's like a big
debut for the rookies.

246
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:51,191
-What a way to start.

247
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:53,463
-The new pros officially
begin in April,

248
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,169
but until then, they play
in the Shinsho Dan series.

249
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:57,238
-Oh.

250
00:11:57,271 --> 00:11:59,008
-There was a really
good game last week

251
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,212
between Mashiba and
Kuwabara-sensei.

252
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:02,449
It was awesome to watch.

253
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:03,919
-Who's Mashiba?

254
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:05,956
-He used to be an Insei like us.

255
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,027
-Oh, so he's one of the
guys who actually passed

256
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,368
the test, unlike Waya and Isumi.

257
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:12,503
-You shut up!

258
00:12:12,537 --> 00:12:14,975
-So, how did the
Mashiba game turn out?

259
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,049
-Kuwabara-sensei beat him
so easily, it was a joke.

260
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,855
-Oh, I see.

261
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:23,227
WAYA: Toya's debut game
should be coming up soon.

262
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:25,431
-He seems to be getting
further and further ahead of me

263
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:26,968
all the time.

264
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:29,507
WAYA: It's not just Toya.

265
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,179
Once they pass the test,
everyone who becomes a pro

266
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:35,219
gets way better.

267
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,524
And as long as we
keep failing the test,

268
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,428
we're not gonna make
any progress at all.

269
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:49,550
-Hm?

270
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,418
Who's that?

271
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:53,158
-Shindou.

272
00:12:53,191 --> 00:12:53,558
-Huh?

273
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,004
So, who is he?

274
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:00,406
-That's Zama-sensei, the Oza.

275
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:01,509
-The Oza?

276
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:04,382
-It's only one of the
top titles you can win.

277
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:05,551
Come on.

278
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,354
Learn the names of the major
championships, will you?

279
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:12,900
-Zama-sensei.

280
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,537
I'm glad I caught you.

281
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:16,140
-What is it?

282
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:18,178
-The date for your game
in the Shinsho Dan series

283
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:19,180
has been set.

284
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,084
We'll send some
official notification.

285
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:22,621
-Who's my opponent?

286
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:26,295
-It's Akira Toya, the
son of Toya Meijin.

287
00:13:26,295 --> 00:13:27,665
-Akira, huh?

288
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,168
I've heard about him.

289
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,540
Quite the reputation.

290
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:35,949
-The students of Toya Meijin
say he's a really strong player.

291
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,156
-I'm sure they wouldn't dare
say anything bad about him.

292
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,327
So, the series is
underway now, huh?

293
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,564
How are the old pros?

294
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:45,336
Have we been making a
clean sweep of the matches?

295
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,975
-No, some wins and some losses.

296
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:49,211
-Ah.

297
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,616
Obviously some of the rookies
are putting up a fight.

298
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,520
These games are just for show.

299
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:54,622
You know what?

300
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:57,061
Maybe I should let him
beat me by half a point.

301
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:59,066
That'd make everyone
happy, wouldn't it?

302
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,468
-It'll make the front page.

303
00:14:00,468 --> 00:14:03,107
Toya Junior's amazing debut.

304
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,579
-It would be great publicity
for the association, that's

305
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:06,615
for sure.

306
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,352
-Kuwabara-sensei
played last week.

307
00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:09,588
How did his game go?

308
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:14,298
-He was playing against Mashiba,
one of the former Insei.

309
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:15,635
-I'll take it.

310
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:18,474
-I don't know if he was nervous
about playing Kuwabara-sensei

311
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:20,511
or if he was over awed by
the fact he was playing

312
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:22,449
in the championship
room, but Mashiba

313
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:23,985
seemed to self destruct.

314
00:14:23,985 --> 00:14:26,191
When Mashiba finally
decided to resign,

315
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:29,097
Kuwabara-sensei said, (SHAKEY
VOICE) oh, is it over?

316
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,371
As if he'd been playing
the game in his sleep.

317
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,174
-Poor kid.

318
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,980
Sometimes Kuwabara-sensei
can be really cruel.

319
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:38,984
-Well, we're all looking
forward to your game.

320
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:41,523
The major title holder
against the talented newcomer.

321
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,227
I hope it's a good one.

322
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,095
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:01,166
-What?

324
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,535
Today?

325
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,307
-Didn't you see the schedule
up on the bulletin board?

326
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:07,579
This afternoon, Toya's
going up against the Oza

327
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:09,416
in the championship room.

328
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,485
-Really?

329
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:11,788
I wanna watch.

330
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:12,490
WAYA: You can.

331
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:14,794
Follow me.

332
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:16,298
The board in the
championship room

333
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:18,570
has a camera installed
directly above it.

334
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:21,509
There's a TV down here
you can watch the game on.

335
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,480
-Whoa.

336
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:24,583
-There it is.

337
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:26,820
There's no way we can
watch the whole thing,

338
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:30,328
because we gotta go play our own
matches, but, once we're done,

339
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:31,731
we can come back
here and maybe we

340
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,802
can catch the last
half of the game.

341
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:36,040
-I was hoping we could
see the whole thing.

342
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:38,245
While we're here, wanna
check out the room itself?

343
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:38,713
-What?

344
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:39,648
Are we allowed?

345
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,124
-Here it is.

346
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:45,728
The championship room.

347
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:46,630
-I can't see anything.

348
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:48,467
It's too dark.

349
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,369
-Hikaru!

350
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:49,769
-Hm?

351
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:05,637
Sai?

352
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:12,184
-My senses are tingling
with excitement.

353
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:17,162
The intensity of this room
is so strong it almost hurts.

354
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:20,636
Oh, the anticipation's
getting too much to bear.

355
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:24,812
-What do you think?

356
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:26,782
It's a pretty awesome
room, isn't it?

357
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:29,121
-So the pros play
their matches in here?

358
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,390
-Course not.

359
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,497
Pro matches are normally played
in the same room we play in.

360
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,603
This room's only used for
the big championship matches.

361
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:38,674
-Oh, I see.

362
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,381
WAYA: They use this room
for the Shinsho Dan series

363
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:45,122
as a way to get all the new guys
excited about winning titles.

364
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:47,126
Next year, it'll be me in here.

365
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:55,511
MAN: OK.

366
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:58,183
Now we just need to take a
few photos before the match.

367

Get a lot of shots of the kid.

369
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:08,304
I predict he's going to be
a big name in the future.

370
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:09,541
-Whatever you want, boss.

371
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:10,810
-Right.

372
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:13,850
Let's have a couple of you
facing each other and chatting.

373
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,823
-What do you want to
talk about, young Toya?

374
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:20,430
-I'm going to give this match
everything I've got and more.

375
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,334
Hope you have a good game.

376
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:23,169
-Of course.

377
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,506
I'm counting on it.

378
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:27,913
Now, there's no need to be
intimidated by my title of Oza.

379
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,285
As pros, we're all
on the same level.

380
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,690
There's no chance of
winning if you're too timid.

381
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:35,663
You must think of me as
a One Dan, like yourself.

382
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:36,699
-Yes.

383
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:37,968
I fully intend to.

384
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:45,317
ZAMA (VOICEOVER):
He fully intends to?

385
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:46,586
What a precocious brat.

386
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,931
MAN: OK, just a few more.

387
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:54,370
ZAMA (VOICEOVER): This
calls for a change of plan.

388
00:17:54,403 --> 00:17:56,274
I'm going to destroy him.

389
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:04,959
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I wonder
is Akira started his match yet.

390
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:06,262
-Hikaru.

391
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:07,665
I think it would be wise
for you to concentrate

392
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:08,901
on your own game.

393
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:10,605
-Uh, yeah, yeah.

394
00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:16,016
-I'm guessing you've been
in this championship room

395
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,420
before, Toya.

396
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:19,791
-Actually, this
is my first time.

397
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,896
-I know you haven't
played in here before,

398
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:23,332
but what about with your father?

399
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,670
He's played here more
times than I can remember.

400
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,774
You must have tagged along
with him once or twice.

401
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,509
-Nope.

402
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:29,813
I've never been in here.

403
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:32,685
Not even as a time keeper or
keeping a record of the scores?

404
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:34,857
-You normally learn
about those sort of jobs

405
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,694
when you're an Insei,
but I was able to skip

406
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:38,265
that part of the process.

407
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:38,932
-Huh?

408
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:40,636
You've never been an Insei?

409
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:42,373
-Wait a minute, I'd forgotten.

410
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:44,544
The new pros are the ones
who do those jobs, right?

411
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:47,384
I guess I'd better learn before
I officially start in April.

412
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:52,929
ZAMA (VOICEOVER): He really
is a precocious little brat.

413
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:54,900
He's not the least bit nervous.

414
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,706
-Gentlemen, it's time
for us to begin the game.

415
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:59,810
-The new One Dan
player goes first

416
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,817
and will be given a handicap
of 5 and 1/2 points.

417
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,055
Each player will be
allotted two hours.

418
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:06,558
If that time runs
out, the players

419
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:08,964
will enter over time
with one minute per move.

420

Everyone ready?

Oh, of course.

429

You're one of Toya
Meijin's students.

430
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:49,985
-Yeah, but I'm also
friends with Akira,

431
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:51,955
so I wanted to come
and support him.

432
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:54,561
He doesn't have many
friends around his own age.

433
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,465
-That would explain it.

434
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:58,770
I couldn't figure out
how he could be so calm.

435
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,674
The new kids are
usually so scared.

436
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:03,915
They get intimidated playing
guys with that much experience.

But young Toya
didn't bat an eyelid.

you were a complete mess.

crack the board.

-He was obviously
trying to psych you out,

and you went and fell for it.

Kuwabara-sensei to me.
