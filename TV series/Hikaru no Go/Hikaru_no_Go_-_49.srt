[theme music]

2
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:50,505
-Please.

3
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:53,812
Let me play him, Hikaru.

4
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:54,781
-No!

5
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,485
Forget all about it!

6
00:01:56,518 --> 00:02:01,495
If I let you play,
you'd win for sure.

7
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:03,700
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Shindou.

8
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,539
You've made it this far.

9
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:09,479
I've been waiting for this
moment for a long time.

10
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:10,882
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Yes, a handicap.

11
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:13,320
If Sai had to work with
a different handicap,

12
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,191
his game would be
completely changed.

13
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:15,726
I'll do it!

14
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,561
I'll do it!

15
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:39,376
-Shindou took 20 minutes
on this first move.

16
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,385
That doesn't seem like
a very good start to me.

17
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,757
It'll be interesting to see
how the Meijin responds.

18
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,573
-Lower right corner, star point.

19
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:28,649
-The tension's
too much in there.

20
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:29,451
-Tell me about it.

21
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:30,788
I'm exhausted already.

22
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:32,858
-It's the first time anything
like this has ever happened,

23
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:35,397
but I didn't get the impression
that Shindou was nervous,

24
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:36,366
did you?

25
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,903
-No.

26
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:40,275
-Akira's watching in
the other room, right?

27
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:41,912
Let's see if we can
get a comment from him

28
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:43,348
on that long opening move.

29
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:48,760
Ogata-sensei?

30
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:51,432
And Kuwabara-sensei, too?

31
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,503
-That game took a long
time to get started.

32
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:55,273
What was the reason
for the delay?

33
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:56,777
Technical difficulties?

34
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,712
-What?

35
00:03:57,746 --> 00:03:58,848
No.

36
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:00,718
Everything's going according
to plan on our end.

37
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:01,788
It's Shindou.

38
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:04,827
He took 20 minutes to
make his first move.

39
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,333
I hope you don't mind me
asking, Kuwabara-sensei,

40
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,770
but why are you here today?

41
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:09,905
To watch Shindou play?

42
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:10,974
-But of course.

43
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:13,713
I've decided to take
an interest in the boy.

44
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:15,350
I walked past him
and knew something

45
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:16,987
was special about him.

46
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:17,855
-What?

47
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,759
How could you even know that?

48
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,563
I mean, you've never
even seen him play.

49
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:22,599
That's absurd.

50
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:25,772
-Strange, but true.

51
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,710
He claims it's intuition.

52
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,712
-What?

53
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:30,383
-Make fun of my
intuition if you like,

54
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,587
Ogata, but if you don't
take it seriously,

55
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:33,990
you're never going to beat me.

56
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,594
MAN: Well, however
it happened, it's

57
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:37,598
quite impressive for a
young player like Shindou

58
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:40,337
to be noticed by
Kuwabara-sensei.

59
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,379
Not to mention the interest
you're taking in him, Ogata.

60
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:46,952
And did you know that Toya
Meijin asked specifically

61
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:49,491
for Shindou to be his
opponent in this game?

62
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:50,326
-Ah.

63
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,795
Did he?

64
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:52,965
-No way.

65
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:54,702
-Hey, Waya.

66
00:04:54,735 --> 00:04:55,770
Who is Shindou?

67
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,581
-Well, he is out-- Oh forget it.

68
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:02,752
Stop asking me that.

69
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:04,456
OCHI: OK.

70
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:08,030
-The Meijin's only interested
because Akira considers Shindou

71
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,039
to be his rival and he
wants to test his strength.

72
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:12,741
-Is this true?

73
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:13,943
Is he your rival?

74
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:16,615
-Uh, well, uh--

75
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,784
KUWABARA: No, no, no.

76
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,856
This has got nothing
to do with Akira.

77
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:22,862
The Meijin has his own reasons
for wanting to play the boy.

78
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:23,564
-Really?

79
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:24,934
And what are they?

80
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:27,940
-Let's just say he's got a
very good intuition, like me.

81
00:05:32,684 --> 00:05:34,654
-13, 14.

82
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:36,358
A cap.

83
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:37,560
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): A cap move?

84
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,423
-What's Shindou doing?

85
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:58,005
I can't believe he
started his attack!

86
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:01,178
It's so early in the game!

87
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:02,714
WAYA (VOICEOVER):
What's he up to?

88
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,084
I don't get it.

89
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,540
-Exactly the response I wanted.

90
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:15,023
Good.

91
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:20,620
Unless I go on the
offensive right away,

92
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:21,856
there's no chance of winning.

93
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:26,566
I will lead him into
a complex battle

94
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,704
with moves that will be
hard for him to read.

95
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,953
Now I need to
create some opening

96
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:38,992
on the board that
will lure him in.

97
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,515
And then, when he does go in
for the kill, my path to victory

98
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:05,784
will become clear.

99
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:16,774
Lay the next stone at 18, 16.

100
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:31,974
Wait.

101
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:34,245
He's not playing the
way I thought he would.

102
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:35,615
He's being too cautious.

103
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:51,115
If he continues like this,
I'll be left with no choice

104
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:53,219
but to take even greater risks.

105
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,126
Well, so be it!

106
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,163
Now, 18, 19.

107
00:07:58,197 --> 00:07:59,099
Block it.

108
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:32,571
-I don't understand what
Shindou's trying to do here.

109
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:33,974
He's being so
aggressive, he's going

110
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:37,682
to overplay his hand
if he's not careful.

111
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:38,884
-Hm.

112
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,989
-He stretched
himself pretty thin.

113
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:42,994
-His formations aren't good.

114
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:44,062
-Well, Akira.

115
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:45,799
It looks like Shindou's
got a long way

116
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,205
to go before he rivals you.

117
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:49,742
-Hm.

118
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:52,179
-If he captures these stones,
then it's all over for black,

119
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,318
right?

120
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:57,157
-Yes, that would seem
like the obvious choice.

121
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,966
-Then why isn't my
father capturing them?

122
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,938
-Hm.

123
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:06,177
Maybe he doesn't want to
end the game that quickly.

124
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:07,179
You know?

125
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,682
Give the newcomer
a fighting chance.

126
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,054
-What do you think, Ogata?

127
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,927
-Black's obviously at
a big disadvantage,

128
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,331
but I have no idea what
Toya-sensei's strategy might

129
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:18,202
be.

130
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:19,906
-He knows how to
trust his intuition.

131
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:32,968
TOYA MEIJIN (VOICEOVER):
At first glance,

132
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:36,676
it looks like black's
game is about to collapse.

133
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,016
But reading further
ahead, I get the sense

134
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,687
this could become
quite dangerous.

135
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,398
I'm not gonna fall into the
trap my opponent has set for me.

136
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:51,976
Hm?

137
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:04,335
On the surface, his game
is exceedingly reckless.

138
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,273
But there's something
deeper going on.

139
00:10:10,182 --> 00:10:12,720
There's definitely
more to it than that.

140
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:16,962
This boy is a new One-Dan.

141
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:26,784
He's a mere 14-year-old child.

142
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,928
There's a strength
I sense around him.

143
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:41,482
How could he possess such power?

144
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:02,895
OGATA: The battle
in that one corner

145
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,364
has spread right out
across the board.

146
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:11,079
It's as though Shindou decided
to expand his game by attacking

147
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:14,787
in random places, hoping
to confuse his opponent.

148
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,758
-There's not too
much he can do now.

149
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,364
-It's obvious what the result
of the game's going to be.

150
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:20,866
Black's going to be wiped out.

151
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,435
Wiped out!

152
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:26,813
-I've never seen him
play like this before.

153
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:28,083
-Why's Toya-sensei holding back?

154
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,251
He should finish it off.

155
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:31,155
-I know young players
have a tendency

156
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:34,062
to throw caution to the
wind, but he's gone too far.

157
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:36,033
It just won't work
against the Meijin.

158
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:39,340
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Shindou.

159
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,828
-What do you know?

160
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:05,496
He resigned.

161
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:10,541
I told you he was going to lose.

162
00:12:10,574 --> 00:12:11,443
Poor Shindou.

163
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:13,915
He must be very disappointed.

164
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:15,150
-Hey, Waya?

165
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:16,286
-Hold on.

166
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:17,889
Those guys are going to
start reviewing the game.

167
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,041
-Well, I guess that
means I've won the bet.

168
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:29,915
However, this hasn't changed
my opinion of Shindou.

169
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,490
-What an intriguing
game of Go that was.

170
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:37,365
Oh, and Ogata-- the next
time there's a game like this

171
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:39,069
and you want to
have a little wager,

172
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:40,438
my money's still on the kid.

173
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,128
OGATA: You coming, Akira?

174
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:51,595
-Huh?

175
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:52,397
Yeah, sure.

176
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,634
I'll be along in a minute.

177
00:12:58,243 --> 00:12:59,880
Kuwabara-sensei?

178
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:00,482
-Hm?

179
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:02,219
You want my opnion?

180
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:04,089
-Yes.

181
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,127
-Let me see.

182
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,931
Shindou's strategy
starts to make sense

183
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:10,503
if you consider the possibility
that he might have actually

184
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:13,275
given himself a large handicap.

185
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,044
-What?

186
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:15,914
Gave himself a handicap?

187
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:17,919
Are you sure about that?

188
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:19,590
-Mm-hm.

189
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:21,694
-But he's playing my father.

190
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:23,331
That'd be crazy!

191
00:13:23,364 --> 00:13:25,970
[laughter]

192
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,477
-I'm not saying I understand
why he'd do such a thing.

193
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,018
But it's an interesting
possibility, isn't it?

194
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:35,925
[laughter]

195
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:46,648
SAI (VOICEOVER): It's over.

196
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,433
-I wish we could have played
the game without a handicap.

197
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,304
-Huh?

198
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,577
-I have no idea why you
played the way you did,

199
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,985
but you cannot hide the strength
of the spirit inside you.

200
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:07,708
-Huh?

201
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,474
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I
think he must have realized

202
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:18,082
that we put our own
handicap on the game.

203
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:19,452
And it sounds like
he somehow knew

204
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:22,324
Sai was playing through me.

205
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:24,763
-As we played, I could
sense an intensity from you

206
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:27,669
which is normally only found
in veterans of the game.

207
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,622
Next time we play, let's
make it an even game.

208
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:37,524
SAI (VOICEOVER): Yes.

209
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:38,125
Next time.

210
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:45,374
-Well, that was quite a game.

211
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:50,084
Let's discuss the first move.

212
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:58,769
AKIRA: He put a
handicap on himself?

213
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:01,108
Why on earth would he do that?

214
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,014
-Young Shindou is proving to
be more and more interesting

215
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:06,219
all the time.

216
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:09,593
-There's something I don't
understand about him.

217
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:14,604
When I played him
two years ago, it

218
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:17,810
was almost like I was
playing my father.

219
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:20,149
He was such a strong opponent.

220
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:20,625
KUWABARA: Oh?

221
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,160
-But it was strange.

222
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:27,632
The next time I played
him, over six months later,

223
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,269
it was like he was
a different person.

224
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:31,273
His game was so weak.

225
00:15:31,273 --> 00:15:33,143
-Stop messing around!

226
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:33,612
-What?

227
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:35,147
What's wrong?

228
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:36,784
-Like he was a
different person, eh?

229
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:38,388
Well, that's very unusual.

230
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,593
-If I'd known he was as
weak a player as that,

231
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:42,564
I'd never have
considered him my rival.

232
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:44,401
Never in a million years.

233
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:45,537
I was so angry.

234
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:47,274
I felt like he tricked
me, or something.

235
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,218
Then when I bumped
into him later on,

236
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,757
he said the weirdest
thing to me.

237
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,727
-Now, listen.

238
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:59,668
If you keep on chasing
your phantom image of me,

239
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,738
one day I'm gonna
catch up to you.

240
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:11,225
-The next time I saw him,
he'd become an Insei.

241
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:13,196
And now look at him.

242
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:14,866
He just finished
playing my father

243
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:17,138
in the championship room.

244
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:19,477
-Sounds to me as if
you're the one responsible

245
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,320
for him joining the
world of the pros.

246
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:27,494
Tell me, Toya, what's
your first name, again?

247
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:28,429
-Akira.

248
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:29,264
-Akira Toya.

249
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:30,668
Akira Toya.

250
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:33,172
I'll have to remember that name.

251
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,211
[laughter]

252
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:38,918
-Oh.

253
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:40,255
Hello, Akira.

254
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:42,593
-So, how's everything
going in there?

255
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:45,733
-Well, I think there might
be something up with Shindou.

256
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,470
No matter what
anyone asks him, he's

257
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,341
just sitting there,
not saying a word.

258
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,426
I don't know if
you're interested,

259
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:00,565
but I overheard the recorder say
something which surprised me.

260
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:01,267
-Really?

261
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,569
And what was that?

262
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:04,674
-Apparently your father
told Shindou the next time

263
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,878
they play each other, he
wants to play an even game,

264
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:08,248
with no handicap.

265
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:09,384
-What?

266
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,389
My father said that?

267
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:12,458
Are you sure?

268
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:13,426
-Mm-hm.

269
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,263
Although when we
tried to get the story

270
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,502
direct from your father, he
wouldn't confirm or deny it,

271
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:19,606
so we're going to be able
to use it in the article.

272
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,319
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): My
father, the Meijin,

273
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:28,258
wants to play Shindou in an even
game the next time they meet?

274
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:31,665
-Huh?

275
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:33,402
Hey, Akira!

276
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:34,939
Aren't you coming with me?

277
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:35,775
Akira?

278
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:36,376
Akira!

279
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,464
-I don't think he
quite figured out

280
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:49,805
the you were the one playing
him in that game, and not me.

281
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:51,475
But you gotta hand it to him.

282
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:52,812
He knew something was up.

283
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:56,586
He knew it wasn't a
bunch of reckless moves.

284
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:59,726
-Next time we play, let's
make it an even game.

285
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,962
SAI (VOICEOVER): Yes.

286
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:04,336
Next time.

287
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:07,610
HIKARU: You are going to want
to play him again, aren't you?

288
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:08,092
-Yes.

289
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,925
-I wonder if I can
make it happen.

290
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,696
-You wonder if?

291
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,701
You have to do better than that.

292
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:20,771
-I'm sure I'll figure
something out someday.

293
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,007
-You'll just have to wait.

294
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,709
-Someday?

295
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:23,277
-When?

296
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:23,844
When?

297
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:24,914
-How should I know when?

298
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:26,283
Whatever it happens?

299
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:27,753
Today was an important
day for me, too.

300
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:30,325
My first game as
a pro, remember?

301
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,394
So don't be so selfish.

302
00:18:31,427 --> 00:18:33,499
I gave up a big chance
to let you play.

303
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:34,768
You don't get it, do ya?

304
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,349
I--

305
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:42,017
-I'm very sorry.

306
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,794
-It's your own fault.

307
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,598
You're the one who
decided to inhabit me.

308
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,811
Shusaku was a lot
better than me, right?

309
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:57,383
But there's one big
difference between us.

310
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:00,056
He let you play all his
games, all the time.

311
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,394
What was his first name again?

312
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:03,998
Torajiro, wasn't it?

313
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:08,307
I don't understand why he never
wanted to play by himself.

314
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,813
Didn't he want to
be a Go player?

315
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:12,883
What a loser.

316
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:18,463
-You see, that's because-- the
thing is-- it was all my fault!

317
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:21,802
When I returned to this world,
I was so desperate to play--

318
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:24,943
and I didn't know I
would meet you, Hikaru.

319
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:26,980
I thought Torajiro
was my only chance,

320
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:29,352
so I took it and forced
him to let me play.

321
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:29,954
-Huh?

322
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:31,557
Now, hold on a minute.

323
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:34,363
I know that Torajiro died young.

324
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:36,535
Was that because
you inhabited him?

325
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:38,572
Tell the truth.

326
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:39,006
-Huh?

327
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,976
No, no, no, no.

328
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:41,011
You don't understand.

329
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:43,349
Torajiro was a good person.

330
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,119
A terrible epidemic
struck his village,

331
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,091
but instead of escaping,
he risked his life

332
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:50,632
to look after everyone
who'd become sick.

333
00:19:50,665 --> 00:20:00,419
And then-- And that's
why-- Poor Torajiro.

334
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:04,728
He was intelligent, and truly
kind to everyone he met.

335
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:05,864
-Hmph.

336
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:09,739
So, you think I'm stupid
and not kind to anyone.

337
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:10,181
-Hikaru.

338
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,538
-Father.

339
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:25,941
I heard that after
the game today,

340
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,179
you told Shindou that
next time you play,

341
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:30,451
you wanted it to be an
even game with no handicap.

342
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:35,276
-Yes.

343
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:39,905
TOYA (VOICEOVER):
My dad's the Meijin,

344
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,075
and he wants to have an even
game with Hikaru Shindou?

345
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:53,466
Shindou-- just who are you?

346
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,440
[theme music]

347
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:22,559
SAI: I am Fujiwara-no-Sai.

348
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,171
Being here with Hikaru
is the third time

349
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:29,912
I've been placed in this world.

350
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:32,881
My sole purpose has been
to play the Divine Move.

351
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:35,250
But I could not come close
to it during my match

352
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:37,119
against Toya Meijin.

353
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:40,756
So, is there another
reason why I'm here?

354
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:42,124
HIKARU: Next time,
Fujiwara-no-Sai!

355
00:22:44,793 --> 00:22:46,728
SAI: I will find out why
I've been brought here

356
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:48,931
to guide Hikaru!
