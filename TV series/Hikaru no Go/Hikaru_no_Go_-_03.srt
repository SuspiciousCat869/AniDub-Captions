00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,607
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,642
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,745
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:17,715
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play The Divine Move.

5
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:21,285
[theme music]

6
00:01:58,601 --> 00:01:59,368
-Hikaru Shindou.

7
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:14,547
-Akira?

8
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,048
Akira Touya?

9
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:17,216
Whatcha doing here?

10
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:17,699
-Uh--

11
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:23,722
-Weren't you playing
in the Go tournament?

12
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:25,123
-Were you?

13
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,223
-Me?

14
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:29,493
No, I just stopped to
take a look around.

15
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:32,496
But you know what?

16
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:35,264
I've never seen
anything like it.

17
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:39,401
I saw kids in there
even younger than me.

18
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:40,602
And they were all so intense.

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,341
It was really kind of cool.

20
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,609
-Kind of cool?

21
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:51,612
Haven't you ever felt the
intensity of the game before?

22
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:53,680
-Intensity?

23
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:55,982
-Can I take a look at your hand?

24
00:02:56,016 --> 00:02:57,584
-My hand?

25
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:59,652
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): His
fingernail isn't worn down

26
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:01,253
or anything.

27
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:04,556
It doesn't look like
the hand of a Go player.

28
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,657
-What are you doing?

29
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,092
-Uh, sorry.

30
00:03:08,126 --> 00:03:10,495
Are you going to become a pro?

31
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:11,995
-Pro?

32
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:13,230
Haha haha.

33
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,671
Me?

34
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,564
A pro.

35
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:17,067
I've never even
thought about it.

36
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,037
Uh, are you gonna
become a pro, Akira?

37
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,338
-Of course I am.

38
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:22,938
-Huh?

39
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,345
Well, if that's what
you want to do you.

40
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:35,082
Say, do professional Go
players make a lot of money?

41
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:38,685
-The winner of the Meijin
title gets 36 million yen.

42
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,254
The Kisei title has a
prize of 42 million.

43
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,523
-Uh, ho-- how many
Go titles are there?

44
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,091
And how much money do you
get if you can win them all.

45
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:48,460
-There are 8 titles in
all, so your total winnings

46
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:51,162
could reach about
180 million yen.

47
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:53,364
-180 million?

48
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:54,965
Haha!

49
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,067
Sai.

50
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,234
Think you're good enough
to get the Meijin title?

51
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,970
SAI: One does not play
for financial gain.

52
00:04:01,004 --> 00:04:02,939
-Oh, it wouldn't be so bad.

53
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:04,373
AKIRA: What wouldn't be bad?

54
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:07,242
-Ah, you know, playing
around to become a pro.

55
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:09,311
I think it'd be kinda fun
to win a title or two.

56
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,313
Just a few here and there.

57
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:14,615
-Play around and become a pro?

58
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:18,485
Win a title or two
here and there?

59
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:19,986
How dare you?

60
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,123
What you just said was an insult
to every professional Go player

61
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:23,622
out there!

62
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:24,623
-I didn't mean--

63
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:26,926
-You're not a Go
player, you phony.

64
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,561
Anyone who plays
the game would never

65
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:31,930
dishonor their
efforts like that.

66
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:33,198
Play around?

67
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:36,366
Do you have any idea what
it takes to become a pro?

68
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,370
Tenacious perseverance,
hard work, sacrifice.

69
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,439
Many of them struggle
against despair,

70
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:45,374
and they're still
not good enough!

71
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:48,311
A lot of players like that
have studied with my father,

72
00:04:48,344 --> 00:04:51,046
but you-- you just
insulted them all.

73
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,415
I've worked hard and
made sacrifices too.

74
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:56,417
Since I was little, I've spent
hours and hours playing Go.

75
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,421
And no matter how difficult
it was, I just did my best

76
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:01,589
and kept on playing.

77
00:05:04,357 --> 00:05:05,492
How could I have lost to him?

78
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,233
Let's play a game right now.

79
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,466
-Huh?

80
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,068
-I'm going to be a pro.

81
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,369
I know that for sure.

82
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,605
And if you're good enough
to play around and pick up

83
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:22,539
a few titles by
becoming one too,

84
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,541
then you should be good
enough to beat me today,

85
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,277
right here and now.

86
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,210
Come on.

87
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,312
Let's go find out.

88
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:32,348
-Sai, what should we do?

89
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:33,916
-Let's go.

90
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:37,685
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): As I strive
to play the Divine Move,

91
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,187
I cannot lose to him.

92
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:44,324
Hikaru Shindou is no beginner.

93
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:46,693
I must not underestimate him.

94
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:48,995
But the shapes of his
Joseki are outdated.

95
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:52,064
He even played the
Shusaku diagonal.

96
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,099
It was considered a good
move before the Komi

97
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:56,101
rule was introduced.

98
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:57,068
That's it.

99
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,036
That's the weak point.

100
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,105
The one that'll be his downfall.

101
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,173
-Aw, he still seems pretty mad.

102
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,341
I was just joking around.

103
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,609
-Joking around?

104
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:08,044
It didn't sound like that to me.

105
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,345
-Argh.

106
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:12,949
Can't anyone take
a joke anymore?

107
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:14,082
I don't get it, Sai.

108
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:15,584
If you're so good,
how come you're only

109
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,986
able to beat Akira
by two points?

110
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,521
The idea's for you
to help me become

111
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,923
a pro and rake in the cash
by winning a few titles

112
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,591
but I think it might
be too hard for you

113
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,626
if you can't even
beat a sixth grader.

114
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,093
-Hikaru.

115
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:30,297
Though I won, victory was not
my objective in that game.

116
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,097
-What?

117
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,666
-That was a teaching game.

118
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,633
-Teaching game?

119
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,403
SAI: The goal of such a game
is to guide the other player

120
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:39,438
into making the correct moves.

121
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:44,075
The instructor refrains from
overwhelming his opponent.

122
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:45,210
-Oh.

123
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:46,410
So you're better than Akira.

124
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:50,214
Ah, big deal.

125
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:51,515
Of course you're
better than him.

126
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:54,250
He's only a kid in the
sixth grade like me.

127
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,619
SAI: Did you say
he's only a kid?

128
00:06:56,652 --> 00:07:00,288
Akira's great talent is
not in the least childlike.

129
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:01,990
Though he still
has room to grow,

130
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:04,926
I can only describe
his play as superb.

131
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:09,096
With every move he makes, I
can feel his talent awakening.

132
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,497
When this child
comes into his own

133
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,699
and achieves his
full potential, he

134
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:18,204
shall transform into a
lion, or perhaps a dragon.

135
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,906
I can see him starting
to bare his fangs.

136
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:29,146
AKIRA: I'm going to use
the table in the back.

137
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,982
-Akira, and you!

138
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:31,915
-Uh, hello.

139
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,583
-It's that kid.

140
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:36,052
-Yeah, it's him all right.

141
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:38,021
-The one who beat Akira?

142
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:40,923
-That's right, that's him.

143
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,258
-Hey, watch it.

144
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:42,740
Huh?

145
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:50,231
-Have a seat.

146
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:53,033
-Uh, OK.

147
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,368
Hey.

148
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:55,903
This crowd doesn't even bug him.

149
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,406
-We're going to
play even, right?

150
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,274
-Play even?

151
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:04,010
Oh, you mean with a normal Komi?

152
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,043
-Let's choose for color.

153
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:22,926
HIKARU: Even, I got it.

154
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,094
That means I'm black!

155
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:28,563
-Komi's 5 and 1/2 points.

156
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:29,298
-Hm.

157
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:29,898
Mm-hm.

158
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:34,669
-Onegai shimasu.

159
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:36,503
-Uh, OK?

160
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:39,105
Same here.

161
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,140
Sai?

162
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:41,574
SAI: The three, four point.

163
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,108
Like before.

164
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:44,043
Three, four.

165
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:49,914
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Hm.

166
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:52,350
How should this
situation be handled?

167
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:56,353
This child is bright eyed and
overflowing with potential,

168
00:08:56,386 --> 00:09:01,024
but right now, he is
baring his fangs at me.

169
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:04,627
Do I dodge his bite and
pet him on the head?

170
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,630
Should I gently lead him along?

171
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:09,030
Or should I be merciless?

172
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:12,567
-Hm.

173
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:14,903
Three minutes and Akira
hasn't made a move.

174
00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:15,352
Huh?

175
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:21,141
SAI (VOICEOVER): The star point.

176
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:24,978
Lower right, three, four.

177
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:26,579
-Three, four.

178
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,219
SAI (VOICEOVER): The
star point again.

179
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:37,154
These moves were unthinkable
in Shusaku's day.

180
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:41,192
The game has had many changes
during the last 140 years.

181
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:44,160
Consider the advantage of
a 5 and 1/2 point lead.

182
00:09:44,194 --> 00:09:47,330
It is difficult enough
against this child,

183
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:50,032
but against an opponent
of equal strength,

184
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:53,168
it would be a serious
handicap indeed.

185
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:57,538
I must further my study of
the moves 15, three point.

186
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:03,010
Furthering my
knowledge of the game

187
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,311
fills me with your delight.

188
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,885
-Look at his eyes.

189
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:15,053
He's really mad.

190
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:16,621
SAI (VOICEOVER): Playing
the diagonal next

191
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:20,325
may be too timid of a move.

192
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,659
Perhaps the pincer
would be more effective.

193
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:30,967
Or is he waiting
for the diagonal?

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,501
Very well, then.

195
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:32,902
The shall comply.

196
00:10:32,902 --> 00:10:35,504
The 15, 16 point.

197
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:37,305
The diagonal.

198
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:39,408
Now, we shall see.

199
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:37,073
[clock ticking]

200
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:57,390
-I-- I resign.

201
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,529
-Sai?

202
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,397
SAI: He has conceded.

203
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:08,267
Akira knows that he
cannot win this game.

204
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,334
-What?

205
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:10,902
But I don't get it.

206
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:12,870
We played less than half
of what we did before.

207
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,018
Ah, good game.

208
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,486
Hey, that was a great match.

209
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,023
Your intensity was out
of this world, Akira.

210
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:39,059
I mean, you really put the
pressure out with every move.

211
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:42,528
Those guys at the tournament
are nothing compared to you.

212
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,631
They were really good.

213
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:46,966
But not like you.

214
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,370
He's not listening.

215
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:53,905
He can't hear me.

216
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:55,072
He didn't hear a word I said.

217
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:03,112
Well, uh, I'm going to go now.

218
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:03,595
See ya.

219
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:15,556
-Father-- father!

220
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,530
Father, do you think
I'll ever be good at Go?

221
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,098
-Good at Go?

222
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,033
Heh.

223
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,336
I know many things son,
but unfortunately, I

224
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,471
don't know the answer
to that question.

225
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,172
What is evident
to me is that you

226
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:38,243
have two great
talents in your favor.

227
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:42,179
Akira, you seem willing to work
harder at it than anyone else.

228
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:48,084
And your heart is filled with
a great passion for the game.

229
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:50,019
-Oh, father.

230
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:53,122
I've always been proud of
what you told me that day.

231
00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:56,024
Your words have been my guide.

232
00:14:56,057 --> 00:15:01,028
But now a huge wall
stands before me.

233
00:15:01,061 --> 00:15:02,930
And I can't see my way over it.

234
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:10,937
-Why did you have
to play like that?

235
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:19,343
Weren't you just gonna
win by two points again?

236
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:25,915
Sai something, Sai!

237
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:27,517
SAI: I had no choice.

238
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,452
I had to strike as
hard as I could.

239
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:35,591
That child did not give me
the opportunity to be gentle.

240
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,967
-What's up with him?

241
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,369
-He scared me,
yelling like that.

242
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:05,516
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Haven't you
felt the intensity of the game

243
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:06,884
before?

244
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:07,818
-(VOICEOVER) Intensity?

245
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:15,258
-It was so funny.

246
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,226
It was about this
old man and woman,

247
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,227
and they lived a long time ago.

248
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:21,196
And guess what they did?

249
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:23,298
Hey, are you listening?

250
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:24,266
-Uh, yeah.

251
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:27,835
-Hikaru!

252
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,139
Hey, hold on.

253
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:34,574
Home is this way.

254
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,142
-I know.

255
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,143
-Are you going to Go class?

256
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:41,547
HIKARU: There's no class today.

257
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,948
-Boy, you've turned
into such a weirdo!

258
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,353
-Akira.

259
00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:51,321
Why are you so intense?

260
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,190
How come Go means
so much to you?

261
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:54,925
Are you like Sai?

262
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,826
Are you trying to
play the Divine Move?

263
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:04,833
-Hm?

264
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:07,335
SAI: Hikaru, are we gonna
play Go again today?

265
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,370
-Forget it.

266
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,371
SAI: Then why did we
come all this way?

267
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:12,239
-I'm not in the mood right now.

268
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:12,840
-Hey!

269
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:15,109
You?

270
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:16,076
Sensei!

271
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,043
I found him.

272
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:18,344
This is the boy.

273
00:17:18,344 --> 00:17:19,879
HIKARU: Hey, uh--

274
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:21,447
-Remember, at the tournament?

275
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:26,118
He's the one who spotted the
key point after just one glance.

276
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:27,586
-Oh, it's you again.

277
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,854
Akira's not here today.

278
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:30,388
-Hm?

279
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:32,323
-So, you're the one
who defeated my son.

280
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:37,160
-Hold on.

281
00:17:37,193 --> 00:17:38,361
I know you.

282
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,563
Oh yeah, from the other day.

283
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:42,898
The guy who wants to
play the Divine Move.

284
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:44,500
He's Akira's father?

285
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,902
-I want to know
how good you are.

286
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:50,453
-Me?

287
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:56,443
-Have a seat.

288
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,010
-Thanks.

289
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,578
I'm OK.

290
00:17:58,812 --> 00:17:59,413
-Hikaru.

291
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,914
Allow me a match with him.

292
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,350
-In my days spent
with Honinbo Shusaki,

293
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,420
I was challenged by some of the
greatest players in the land.

294
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:12,557
This man burns
with the same fire.

295
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:22,899
-Put down three
stones, young man.

296
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,168
That's how I play with Akira.

297
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,969
That's how good he is.

298
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:31,940
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He's got
the same look in his eyes

299
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,341
that Akira has.

300
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,477
Sai has it, too.

301
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,846
I'm the only one who
doesn't belong here.

302
00:18:45,218 --> 00:18:47,219
Hm.

303
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:57,895
I want to play the
game like they go.

304
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:58,529
KOYO: Let us begin.

305
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:06,503
5, 3, the corner.

306
00:19:11,907 --> 00:19:12,875
-5,3 here.

307
00:19:16,144 --> 00:19:18,079
That's awesome.

308
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:20,514
SAI: Attach at three, three.

309
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:22,916
-I thought the way Akira
placed his stones was cool,

310
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,219
but this guy has style, too.

311
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:28,120
-I've been teaching Akira
since he was two years old.

312
00:19:28,154 --> 00:19:30,389
We play a game of Go
every single morning.

313
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:34,893
He's already good
enough to be a pro.

314
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:35,894
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Wow.

315
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:38,797
His fingers look
like they're glowing.

316
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,433
SAI: The tiger's mouth
at the four, four.

317
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:45,812
KOYO: I don't allow him to
play in amateur tournaments.

318
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:47,581
His skill is such
that he would crush

319
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:50,417
the hopes of aspiring players.

320
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,986
Akira is on a different level.

321
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:56,590
That's why I find it
hard to believe my son

322
00:19:56,623 --> 00:19:58,792
lost to another
child his own age.

323
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:00,193
SAI: Descend at three, two.

324
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:09,836
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He takes
the stone in his fingers,

325
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,171
Then releases it
above the board.

326
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:19,746
His fingers are glowing
with some kind of light.

327
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,517
I wanna be able to do that.

328
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,784
SAI: 10, 16.

329
00:20:24,818 --> 00:20:27,687
Star point.

330
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:32,893
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I want to be
able to play a stone like that.

331
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:41,501
-Hikaru!

332
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:56,950
[theme music]

333
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:23,737
TETSUO: Who cares
about Akira Touya?

334
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,671
He's nothing.

335
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:27,407
A nobody who lost to me.

336
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,943
HIKARU: You beat Akira?

337
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:31,011
SAI: Don't do it, Hikaru.

338
00:22:31,044 --> 00:22:33,513
I sense he loves challenges.

339
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:46,793
-All right, kid.

340
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:50,030
Let's see if you've got
what it takes to play me!
