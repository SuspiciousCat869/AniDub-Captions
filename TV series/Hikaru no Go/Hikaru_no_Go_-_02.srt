After many years inside a Go
board, a spirit from the past,

00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:11,625
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai,
has returned,

00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:13,729
visible only to Hikaru Shindo.

00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:17,671

to play the Divine Move.

-Hi there.

10
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:10,912
-Well, hello, Akari.

11
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:12,916
-Is Hikaru at home?

12
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,255
-No, I'm afraid he's not here.

13
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:17,492
He's taking a Go class.

14
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,163
-Go class?

15
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,431
-Yeah, I know.

16
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:23,405
I wonder what's gotten
into him lately.

17
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:26,611
-Hikaru plays Go?

18
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:31,556
-Let's examine this game setup
a little closer, shall we?

19
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:35,932
Here, black descending
is a good move.

20
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:38,838
Even if white plays
the block here,

21
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:41,276
black plays an atari here.

22
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,880
The white captures two stones.

23
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,519
Black's next move will take
away white's potential eye

24
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:46,454
on this side.

25
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:47,923
And all the white
stones are dead.

26
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:54,571
-I don't have a clue
what he's talking about.

27
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:55,874
-Of course, you don't.

28
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:57,344
You're just a beginner.

29
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,316
-That way your opponent won't
guess how skilled you are.

30
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:02,355
Now, what would happen
if black took away

31
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:05,327
the eye before making the atari.

32
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:06,931
-19, 16.

33
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:08,401
-Very good.

34
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:11,407
If black plays here, white
lives by making the second eye--

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,881
-I wonder how good a
player this instructor is.

36
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,318
-He's a pro.

37

-A pro?

38
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:18,756
-That means he's
good enough that he

39
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:21,461
could make a living
just from playing Go.

40

-That's it for my lecture.

You must be Hikaru Shindo.

-Uh, that's me.

00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:35,358
-Have you played Go before?

47
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:36,761
-Yeah, but only this one time.

48
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,899
And honestly, I felt like I
was watching the game more

49
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:40,803
than I was playing it.

50
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:41,972
-All right.

51
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:43,542
Then, we'll start with a
game of capturing stones.

52
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,927
-Huh, I know this one.

53
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:55,233
A black gets captured if white
puts a stone here, right?

54
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,803
-That's correct.

55
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,676
When we are just one move away
from capturing an opponent's

56
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,382
stone or stones, we say atari.

57
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,422
Here, this is another example.

58
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:06,391
Atari.

59
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:08,561
OK, Hikaru, try to escape.

60
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:11,602
-Well, let's see.

00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:12,337
-Atari, again.

62

-Hmm.

-Atari.

65
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:25,297
And atari, again.

Thank you very much.

-Huh?

68
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:45,740
This pattern is called
the Shichou or Ladder,

69
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:48,647
because it resembles one.

It's impossible to escape
from and appears quite often.

the other players' games today.

-A vending machine.

You put your money in,
and a drink comes out.

-Oh, no, I'm late again.

how to play Go, too?

-Uh, yeah, sort of.

plays Go all the time.

But it's not an easy game if you
don't know anything about it.

some of the basics,

and stuff like that.

-I know it's silly, but
I'm such a big fan of his.

-This man is no
ordinary Go player.

Like me, he yearns to
play the Divine Move.

in hearing that Toya Meijin has

quite a strong player.

But he might not want to play.

He hasn't played anyone
since that game last week.

No, there's no way.

00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:52,192
-Is there something weird
about doing the corrections

166
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:53,194
on my test?

167
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:55,833
-No, there's nothing
wrong with it.

168
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,737
Look, tomorrow's Sunday.

169
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:59,742
Do you want to
hang out together?

170
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:01,078
-Tomorrow?

171
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,982
I'm busy tomorrow.

172
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:04,685
I have to go someplace.

173
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,857
-Are you going to Go class?

174
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:08,326
-Uh, you know about that?

175
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,331
Well, yeah.

176
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:11,934
-You want to come, too?

177
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:12,669
-Me?

178
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:13,939
Let me think about it.

179
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:20,786
Hello.

180
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,156
I'm very pleased to meet you.

181
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,860
-I hope you don't
mind, but my friend

182
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,332
wanted to come along and
watch for a little bit.

183
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:27,902
-Hmm, not at all.

184
00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:32,912
Anyone with an interest in Go
is most certainly welcome here.

185
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:35,218
Today, many players
open at a star point.

186
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:38,324
But the 3, 4 point
still has its fans.

187
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:40,796
By making the knight's
move enclosure like so,

188
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:43,068
we can effectively
secure that corner.

189
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,274
-Hikaru, do you understand
what he's talking about?

190
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:48,245
-Haha, not a word.

191
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:49,748
-But this is a good position.

192
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:53,222
And your opponent won't always
allow you to set up like this.

193
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:55,360
Let's say white goes here.

194
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:58,935
How should black respond?

195
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:00,772
-Hey, I know this one.

196
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:01,373
-Huh?

197
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:03,243
Ah, Hikaru, was it?

198
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:05,348
Well, where would
you place your stone?

199
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:08,521
-16, 5.

200
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:11,762
-It's 16, 5, just
below the star point.

201
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:12,730
-Ah.

202
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:15,837
-16, 5, here?

203
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,040
Oh.

204
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,510
-Huh?

205
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:21,014
-Eh.

206
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,821
-I thought you said you'd
never played Go before.

207
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:25,357
-Uh, was I wrong?

208
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,460
Sorry about that.

209
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:27,762
-On the contrary.

210
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:30,501
That's a very good move.

211
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:31,771
-Huh?

212
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:33,508
-We don't see it quite
so often nowadays.

213
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:36,080
But it was a popular
move in the past.

214
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,817
-Oh.

215
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:38,352
-Haha.

216
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:39,989
You can sit down now.

217
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,826
-OK.

218
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:45,367
Excuse me, why don't they
play this move anymore?

219
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,339
-Because the komi rule
wasn't in effect long ago.

220
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:49,909
-The komi?

221
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,215
-Well, black has the
advantage of playing first.

222
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:55,087
So white is awarded 5 and
1/2 points at the start

223
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:55,989
to compensate.

224
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:56,858
-Huh?

225
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:58,160
-Oh.

226
00:11:58,193 --> 00:12:00,832
-In other words, if white's
final tally comes to 50 points,

227
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:04,541
black requires 56
points to win the game.

228
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:07,146
-Ah, 5 and a 1/2 points.

229
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,184
-So you've never heard of this?

230
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:12,925
-There was no such rule
during Shusaku's time.

231
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,431
-Hmm, it never crossed
your mind that black

232
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:17,368
might have an advantage?

233
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:20,240
-Now that I think about it,
I've never lost playing black.

234
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,977
-Give me a break.

235
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:23,046
-I see.

236
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,585
Komi is worth 5 and 1/2 points.

237
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,224
-Following the inception
of the komi rule,

238
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,863
it was felt that moving
on the diagonal like this

239
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:32,266
was a bit slow.

240
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,274
This particular move isn't
played too often anymore.

241
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:39,081
Nevertheless, in a lot of
ways, it is an exquisite move.

242
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:46,230
Place one stone if
you think Hikaru

243
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:49,035
is holding an odd number
of stones in his hand.

244
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:53,912
Place two if you think he's
holding an even number.

245
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:56,317
OK, Hikaru, count
out your stones.

246
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,290
-2, 4, 6, 8, 9, odd.

247
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,560
-I guessed right.

248
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,597
-Then you'll be black.

249
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:04,969
This is how we
determine who goes first

250
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:07,575
when both players
are of equal skill.

251
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:10,114
-Huh?

252
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:11,951
-Professionals
played these games.

253
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:15,357
Replay one of them so you can
get a feel for what Go is like.

254
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,533
I'll come back in
a little while.

255
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,037
-Ah.

256
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,308
-Hey, do you know
what to do, Hikaru?

257
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:26,448
-I think we're supposed to
set up our stones according

258
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:27,550
to the numbers.

259
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:29,922
Your first move is
right here, Akari.

260
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:30,389
-It's where?

261
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:31,993
-Uh, right here.

262
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:33,630
-Thanks for the
six stones, buddy.

263
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,000
-Huh?

264
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:38,941
-You sure do like giving
up your stones, don't ya?

265
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:42,282
-Mr. Akota is picking on
a weaker player, again?

266
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:43,952
Ah, the bully.

267
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:45,121
-Ha ha ha.

268
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:49,564
Don't take this personally,
but that was a dumb move.

269
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:53,505
I've never met anyone you
liked losing as much as you.

270
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:55,009
-Wait a sec.

271
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,412
-I can't take this anymore.

272
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:58,483
Hikaru, trade places
with that man's opponent.

273
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:02,425
I despise this braggart's
attitude and playing style.

274
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,694
-Sai?

275
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,500
-I refuse to stand by while
a stronger player ridicules

276
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,103
a weaker one.

277
00:14:08,103 --> 00:14:11,411
I shall replace his frightened
opponent and engage him anew.

278
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:13,448
He will learn how it feels
to be on the receiving

279
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:14,985
end of such cruel play.

280
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:18,592
And then, when the game is done,
I shall chastise him soundly.

281
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:21,632
-Oops, sorry.

282
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:23,102
-What's the big idea, kid?

283
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:26,743
Your clumsiness just ruined
a perfectly good game.

284
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:29,215
-Sorry, it kind of
slipped from my fingers.

285
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:30,050
-Huh.

286
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:31,386
-I'll start picking them up.

287
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:32,556
-Hey, what are you doing?

288
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:33,424
No, don't touch that.

289
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,460
No, leave it alone.

290
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:35,060
Ah.

291
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:42,477
-Hikaru, I want you
out of here right now.

292
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,982
-Hey, did you bring me
here just to embarrass me?

293
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:46,485
-I didn't bring you.

294
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,988
You decided to follow me.

295
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,560
-Oh, forget it.

296
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,164
-You've angered the instructor.

297
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:56,038
And now, he's never going to
let us come back and play.

298
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:57,442
-Ah.

299
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:59,246
Huh?

300
00:14:59,279 --> 00:14:59,728
Wait.

301
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:05,426
-By the way, there's
a Go tournament

302
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:07,096
for kids coming up soon.

303
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:08,565
-How about I take you to this?

304
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:11,237
Will that cheer you up?

305
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:11,721
-Hikaru.

306
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,140
-There's so much
tension in the air.

307
00:15:44,174 --> 00:15:46,479
These kids are even
younger than I am.

308
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,049
Huh?

309
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,786
Those people over there
must be their parents

310
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,755
and family members.

311
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:58,437
Sai, this is incredible.

312
00:15:58,472 --> 00:16:00,309
-Indeed.

313
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:02,179
Truly wonderous.

314
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,682
All these children.

315
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:06,756
Though my passion for Go
may be a thousand years old,

316
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:10,330
I see the same
fervor in their eyes.

317
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:11,800
This tells me that
a thousand years

318
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,171
hence, if I were to
search, I would still

319
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:16,677
find people with the
very same passion.

320
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,798
-You know, I wonder
if Akira Toya's here.

321
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:30,840
-Hello, Akira.

322
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,844
Mr. Hirosei wants
to know if you'd

323
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:35,583
like to play a
teaching game with him.

324
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:36,185
-I'm sorry.

325
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:38,724
I can't.

326
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,694
-Are you waiting for that boy?

327
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,137
-There are so many people here.

328
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,542
I'll never find him.

329
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:49,813
-That battle in the
upper left corner.

330
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:50,448
-Huh?

331
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:51,685
This one?

332
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:54,457
-The wrong move by black
will leave him dead there.

333
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:55,292
-Oh?

334
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:57,898
-The key move there is 1, 2.

335
00:16:58,132 --> 00:16:58,900
-Oh, too bad.

336
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:00,637
You should have
played it one higher.

337
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,506
-Huh?

338
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:01,988
-Uh.

339
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,564
-Huh?

340
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:02,875
Oh.

341
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,445
-You there.

342
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:05,714
What's the matter with you, kid?

343
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:08,587
No comments are allowed
when the game's in progress.

344
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:09,790
-Uh, I'm sorry.

345
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:10,591
-Easy there.

346
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,295
Everybody, please calm down.

347
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:16,203
-Ah, Ogata Sensei, I was
about to take this unruly boy

348
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,205
off the floor.

349
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:18,642
-Good idea.

350
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:19,911
-Come with me.

351
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:20,879
-What?

352
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,183
-Sorry for the
interruption, kids.

353
00:17:22,216 --> 00:17:24,588
Pick up your games where
you left off, please.

354
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:27,327
So tell me what happened.

355
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,735
-When I played 1, 3, that
boy said, oh, too bad.

356
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:32,337
Should have played
it one higher.

357
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:34,242
-He what?

358
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,478
-I just remembered.

359
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:37,315
When that boy was
here, I handed him

360
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,221
a flyer for the National
Youth Go Tournament.

361
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:41,624
-The one at the Go Association?

362
00:17:41,657 --> 00:17:42,793
-Yes.

363
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:44,597
He didn't seem interested
when I showed it to him,

364
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,302
but he might have gone.

365
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:48,304
-Ah.

366
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:49,541
-Akira.

367
00:17:49,574 --> 00:17:52,180
-Please, if he shows up, keep
him here till I get back.

368
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:56,221
-What's gotten into him?

369
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:57,491
He's changed.

370
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:58,960
-Maybe it's because
he's never met

371
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:00,697
someone he could
call a rival before.

372
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:10,920
-Unacceptable.

373
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:13,659
There's no excuse for a slip
of the tongue like that,

374
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,661
young man.

375
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:15,529
-Yes, sir.

376
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,333
-So how did you rule on it?

377
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,538
We decided to nullify
the match and have

378
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:21,509
the two boys start another game.

379
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,713
-Yes, you had no choice really.

380
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:25,317
-We're done with you.

381
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,287
Go home now.

382
00:18:27,321 --> 00:18:30,895
-Sorry for all the trouble, sir.

383
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:31,496
Hmm.

384
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:36,474
-I'm glad that's over.

385
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:38,612
Now, tell me about the
move he commented on.

386
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,288
-Hey, son, your change.

387
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:51,473
-Boy, did I ever mess that up.

388
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,911
-I feel bad for those two boys.

389
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:55,849
-Ugh.

390
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:56,416
Huh?

391
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:05,335
-You should be more careful.

392
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:05,818
-Huh?

393
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:12,718
-He is the one.

394
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,457
The man closest to
playing the Divine Move.

395
00:19:26,714 --> 00:19:29,019
-I heard there was
some trouble earlier.

396
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,591
-Yes, Toya Sensei.

397
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:32,426
-Take a look.

398
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,867
We need your advice on this.

399
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,671
-This game is such
that even a pro

400
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:38,906
would have to reflect a while.

401
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,514
But a boy commented on it.

402
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:45,388
-We were told he
merely glanced down.

403
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,057
-You don't say.

404
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,598
He recognized the key to black
survival at a mere glance?

405
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:53,037
My son Akira might
have spotted it,

406
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,509
but I didn't know there was
another child of his level

407
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:56,677
out there.

408
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:59,684
-And they let him go without
even getting his name.

409
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:00,987
-I'm sorry, sir.

410
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,857
-It doesn't matter.

411
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:07,501
If this boy's that
strong of a player,

412
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:11,543
then he will make his presence
known to us, sooner or later.

413
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:24,938
-It's all your fault, Sai,
for opening your big mouth.

414
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:29,547
Oh, so you want to fight, do ya?

415
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,084
Well, I'm never going
to play Go again.

416
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,521
How do you like that?

417
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:33,490
-Hikaru.

418
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:33,972
-Hmm?

419
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:41,373
-Akira?

420
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:48,855
-I found you.

421
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:53,431
I finally found
you, Hikaru Shindo.

422
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,035
[theme music]

423
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:23,657
-I see.

424
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,196
So you are the one
who beat Akira.

425
00:22:26,196 --> 00:22:28,796
Put down three
stones, young man.

426
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:30,898
That's how I play with Akira.

427
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:33,767
That's how good he is.

428
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,169
-Me, a pro?

429
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:36,637
It's never even crossed my mind.

430
00:22:46,113 --> 00:22:50,050
-A true Go player would never
say something so insulting.
