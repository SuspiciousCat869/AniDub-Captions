00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,974
[theme music]

2
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,676
-I'd love to win a title!

3
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,212
Kurata Meijin's got a nice
ring to it, don't you think?

4
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,549
Maybe that's how I'll sign
my autograph, Meijin to be!

5
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,550
There.

6
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,684
-Who's he?

7
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,286
-Ask him, Hikaru.

8
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,520
-Excuse me.

9
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,688
What's your name?

10
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,157
-Don't you know who I am?

11
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,027
Atsushi Kurata,
professional Go player.

12
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,063
Soon to be the Meijin,
or the Honinbo.

13
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,499
The ones to watch out for
are the younger players

14
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,202
still coming up the ranks.

15
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,206
That's why I'm more afraid of
Akira Toya than his father.

16
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,608
The games I play against
those ranked below me

17
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,276
will be life and death battles.

18
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,283
I gotta go, but I'm
gonna remember your name.

19
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,686
The kid who's an expert on
Honinbo Shusaku's handwriting.

20
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,562
HIKARU: In the Shincho Dan
series, Ochi won his game,

21
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,563
but Waya lost.

22
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,543
-Hm.

23
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,277
HIKARU: And then, in March--

24
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,545
-What?

25
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,380
You've got to be kidding me!

26
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,515
-Waya!

27
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,716
Noise the noise down.

28
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,418
-You won't believe this, Sensei.

29
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,720
Shindou said he's never
heard of the Otayai.

30
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:07,688
-Oh really?

31
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,423
You haven't heard
of them before?

32
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,191
-It's obviously some
sort of big game.

33
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,393
So why don't you
just tell me, Waya?

34
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,429
-Some sort of big game?

35
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,400
-You're so clueless!

36
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,135
Do I have to tell
you everything?

37
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,537
You couldn't even
do the timekeeping

38
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,671
until I showed you how.

39
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,540
-How am I supposed to
know unless you tell me?

40
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,011
-The Otayai are
the games you play

41
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,280
as part of the Dan
promotion league.

42
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,282
-You managed to become
a pro without ever

43
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,583
learning about this?

44
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,152
-You have to admit, the way
Shindou's progressing so fast

45
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,320
is pretty amazing.

46
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,655
-Yeah.

47
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,491
I remember when he first started
coming to my Go study sessions.

48
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,393
And now take a look at him.

49
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,728
-He did have an
excellent teacher

50
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,396
to guide him along the way.

51
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,231
-Oh really?

52
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,000
-Well, I'm glad both of
you passed the pro exam.

53
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,437
That should keep the
rest of us on our toes.

54
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,673
But now you'll only meet
lower ranked players

55
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,509
in your Otayai games
and the qualifiers.

56
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,412
It'll be good
experience for you.

57
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,114
-Just a sec.

58
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:10,016
What's this Dan promotion
leage you were talking about?

59
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,186
-As a pro, you'll play about
10 Otayai matches each year.

60
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,389
They use those results to
determine your ranking.

61
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,692
Saeki here is a Four-Dan.

62
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,529
Suzuki and myself
are both Seven-Dan.

63
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,397
-I'm gonna be a Five-Dan soon.

64
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,032
-Hey there, Saeki.

65
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,468
Toya's student Eshiwari
is a Four-Dan, too.

66
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,670
You better make it to
Five-Dan before him.

67
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,239
-What's the big
deal with us having

68
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,008
to beat Toya Meijin's
students all the time?

69
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,010
-Every year starts with
the Otayai matches,

70
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,612
but the real fun
begins in the summer.

71
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,148
That's when we start playing
the qualifying rounds for all

72
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,616
the different titles.

73
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,619
You end playing two,
maybe three games a month.

74
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,553
-Is that all?

75
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,321
Doesn't seem like
very much to me.

76
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,423
-If you make it through
the first few rounds,

77
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,425
then you're gonna have
to play a lot more.

78
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,094
Take Akira Toya for example.

79
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,629
He's already through
to the second round

80
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,598
in both the Honinbo and
Meijin championships.

81
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,233
He's gonna be
playing more games,

82
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,270
and my guess is he's gonna
be the center of attention.

83
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,705
-All right! everyone listen up!

84
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,708
Stop Akira Toya at all costs!

85
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,143
-Come on, Saeki.

86
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,678
You should know better than
to mention Toya's students

87
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,146
in front of the sensei here.

88
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,126
-Are you sure you really
wanna wear a suit?

89
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,694
-Mom, it's OK.

90
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,162
This is gonna be a big day.

91
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,233
It's the new One-Dan certificate
preservation ceremony.

92
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,101
-You mean presentation ceremony.

93
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,540
It just doesn't look right,
you wearing a suit and tie.

94
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:44,277
You're still at school, and
a suit looks so grown up.

95
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,746
-Ochi's still in
middle school like me.

96
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,614
So's Toya.

97
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,082
They'll both be dressed up.

98
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,050
-Oh.

99
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,284
What are you kidding
yourself into?

100
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,687
I'm really worried about you.

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,355
Do you have your
health certificate

102
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,489
and resume with you?

103
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,157
HIKARU: Yeah.

104
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,698
Oh, by the way,
Mr. Saeki said I'll

105
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,333
need to open a bank account.

106
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,534
-A bank account?

107
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,602
Oh, OK.

108
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,538
Uh, is that for when
you start getting paid?

109
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,572
-That's right.

110
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,507
I don't think it'll
happen straightaway.

111
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,577
And I'll also have
to file tax returns.

112
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,478
-Tax returns?

113
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,265
HIKARU: Waya!

114
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,839
Hey.

115
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,004
-You're on time, for a change.

116
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,675
-Huh?

117
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,477
If it isn't Hikaru Shindou.

118
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,616
-Hello, Mr. Kurata.

119
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,685
-No, you cannot
have my autograph!

120
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,287
You missed your chance.

121
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,056
-I still don't want
your autograph.

122
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,271
-Hmph.

123
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:05,692
Ha.

124
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,161
-Mr. Kurata.

125
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,431
-So, how do you and
Kurata know each other?

126
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,335
-I met him a while ago at
an amateur Go festival.

127
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,003
I thought he was really weird.

128
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,071
Do you know him?

129
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,441
He's not important, is he?

130
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,445
-He had the most wins last year,
and he played the most games.

131
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,146
-Him?

132
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,147
The most wins?

133
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,348
-You got it.

134
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:32,112
Lots of the players are here
today to receive awards.

135
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:34,682
Player of the year is
going to Toya Meijin,

136
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,583
then there'll be all
sorts of other awards.

137
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:38,619
Female player of
the year and so on.

138
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:41,422
Akira Toya's won the award
for best percentage of wins,

139
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:43,957
and also one for the
most consecutive wins.

140
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:45,893
-He's gonna be here?

141
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:48,062
With two awards?

142
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:51,465
-The big awards are the real
reason everyone's come to this.

143
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:53,901
Our certificates are just extra.

144
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:55,769
-I see.

145
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:56,637
-Oh, come on.

146
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:57,905
You should be proud of yourself.

147
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:59,940
Don't forget, it
was only a year ago

148
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:02,443
when Akira was standing
where you are now.

149
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:04,578
-Yeah, but that's different.

150
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:07,448
-How do you think Akira
advanced to the level he's at?

151
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:08,982
He was focusing on
one game at a time.

152
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:15,723
-Got to take it
one game at time.

153
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,624
-You OK, Shindou?

154
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:20,694
-I wonder who my first
opponent's going to be.

155
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:22,429
I can't wait to find out.

156
00:08:22,463 --> 00:08:23,630
-That's the spirit.

157
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,468
Just one step at a time.

158
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,002
-Maybe it'll be me.

159
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:29,603
-Hm?

160
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:35,809
-Then again, your
opponent doesn't

161
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:37,911
have to be a One-Dan at all.

162
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:39,780
It could be a Two-Dan,
or even a Three-Dan.

163
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:54,962
-It's Toya.

164
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:36,770
I can't believe it.

165
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,072
I have finally made it.

166
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,047
We're both pros now.

167
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,516
I wonder what he
thinks about that.

168
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,451
Toya!

169
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:51,518
Over here!

170
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:52,519
Finally we--

171
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,776
-That guy is such a jerk.

172
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:17,711
Who does he think
he is, ignoring you?

173
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:19,580
He makes me so mad.

174
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:23,784
Thinks he's better than
us 'cause he's doing OK.

175
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:25,786
Well, I guess he's
doing better than OK.

176
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:26,887
Darn.

177
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,754
-Hey, guys.

178
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:30,057
-Hi.

179
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,726
-What's the matter with you?

180
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,362
-I wont just catch up to him.

181
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:36,630
I'll be better than him.

182
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:37,498
Mr. High and Mighty.

183
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:41,802
-There he is.

184
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:42,703
-Huh?

185
00:10:42,736 --> 00:10:43,804
Ah, Toya.

186
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:49,576
Have you seen the pairings
for the Otayai yet?

187
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,845
The office should have
sent them out by now.

188
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,747
Maybe you didn't get your copy.

189
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,783
You'll never guess who your
first opponent is going to be.

190
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,922
-I know.

191
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:03,957
-Uh, testing, testing.

192
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,927
In a few moments, we will
begin the awards ceremony

193
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,762
and the presentation
of certificates

194
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:10,797
to the new One-Dan players.

195
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:13,400
If everyone could please start
making their way to the--

196
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:22,075
[applause]

197
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:28,649
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I'm
going to catch up to him.

198
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,419
And I'm going to
be better than him.

199
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:35,656
-Well, there's not
much else to go over.

200
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:39,059
The association is glad to
welcome the three of you.

201
00:11:39,092 --> 00:11:41,528
MAN: Now, if you'll open up
the packages in front of you,

202
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:44,331
we can go through each of the
items and explain them to you.

203
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:56,443
-This is cool.

204
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:58,879
The Otayai pairings
chart, right?

205
00:11:58,912 --> 00:11:59,913
-Yes, that's right.

206
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:02,049
It's a list of all
the Otayai opponents

207
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:03,984
you'll be facing
in the year ahead.

208
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:04,718
-Huh?

209
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:05,852
Where am I in here?

210
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:07,621
-Near the end of the list.

211
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:10,424
-The name of your first opponent
can be found immediately

212
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:12,960
to the right of your own name.

213
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:14,528
-Now, let's see.

214
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:15,495
Shindou.

215
00:12:15,495 --> 00:12:16,496
Yeah, here we are.

216
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:24,605
My first opponent is
going to be-- Toya?

217
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,983
(VOICEOVER) My first
opponent is going to be Toya?

218
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:40,420
MAN: We'll be sending
you confirmation

219
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:41,922
of the actual dates
of your games,

220
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:44,057
but lower ranked players
usually play on Wednesdays.

221
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:45,592
-Akira Toya.

222
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:47,694
MAN: The higher ranked players
meet on Thursdays, so make sure

223
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:50,664
you keep your Wednesdays
free for the future.

224
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:51,999
-Your first game against Toya.

225
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,868
You couldn't ask
for a better start.

226
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:59,706
-Do you think he
knows about this?

227
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,507
-Yes.

228
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,009
He's declared war on you.

229
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,076
Think back.

230
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,979
You saw that look in his
eyes as he walked past.

231
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:08,849
It appears he already knew
he was going to play you.

232
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:11,518
He's preparing himself for
the long awaited battle.

233
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,895
Here's your chance to
show him your strength.

234
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,030
Are you ready, Hikaru?

235
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:29,803
-Yes, I'm ready!

236
00:13:29,836 --> 00:13:30,404
-Hm?

237
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:31,772
-Hm?

238
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:34,427
-Just you wait, Toya!

239
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:03,753
-Although you
forced me to resign

240
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:08,057
in the first game, Sensei, now
we're even at one win each.

241
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:10,460
-I'm already looking
forward to our third game.

242
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:19,802
HIKARU: Hi, Mom!

243
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:20,803
I'm home!

244
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:22,038
MITSUKO: Hikaru,
you've some mail here

245
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:23,940
from the Go association.

246
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:24,794
HIKARU: Huh?

247
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:30,446
SAI: It's finally happening.

248
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,014
-Yeah.

249
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:35,051
My game's on April the 4th.

250
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:37,954
My first game as a
pro-- against Toya.

251
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,465
Huh?

252
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:50,466
Mr. Saeki?

253
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:51,767
-You're late.

254
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:52,935
-No, I'm not.

255
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,505
There's half an hour
to go before it starts.

256
00:14:55,738 --> 00:14:57,373
-I got here early, just for you.

257
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:59,108
I figured it might
help calm your nerves

258
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:00,877
to have a friendly face around.

259
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,178
-Oh.

260
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:05,815
I remember on my first day, I
got here hours ahead of time.

261
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:07,116
When we actually
started playing,

262
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,851
I was so nervous my
fingers could hardly

263
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:10,186
pick up the stones.

264
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,288
That doesn't seem to be
the case with you, Shindou.

265
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:18,027
-It's not like I've never
met my opponent before.

266
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,795
I'm not really nervous.

267
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:20,763
Excited, yeah.

268
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,832
But I'm not nervous.

269
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:25,902
-You're playing Toya?

270
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:27,057
-Mm-hm.

271
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:38,981
(VOICEOVER) Doesn't look like
Waya or Ochi have games today.

272
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,986
-Shindou, what are
you doing for lunch?

273
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,221
-What?

274
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:48,057
-If you want to order
something, you do it over here.

275
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:50,960
-We can order food?

276
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,028
Wow.

277
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:55,364
-Or if you want, you
can eat out with us.

278
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:55,965
-Sure.

279
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,006
-The match room is set up
the same as when you're here

280
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,008
as an Insei, but
with one difference.

281
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:07,176
Tea is provided.

282
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,911
Although if you don't
want to drink tea,

283
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:11,314
they let you bring in your own
coffee, or whatever you want.

284
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:11,914
-Cool.

285
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:17,787
I guess that's another
benefit of being a pro.

286
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,022
So, who's your opponent
going to be today?

287
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:22,091
-A woman called Sakurano.

288
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:25,094
You seem a lot more
relaxed now, Shindou.

289
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:27,296
Which is good because you
were looking a little tense

290
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,331
when you first arrived.

291
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:29,065
-What?

292
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:30,299
You really think so?

293
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,902
-It's not good to be too
relaxed before a game, either.

294
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:34,804
So let me teach you a
little trick of mine.

295
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:35,838
-Kay.

296
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,074
-Get a picture of
Morishita in your mind.

297
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:40,876
-Stop Akira Toya at all costs!

298
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,510
-Oh, man.

299
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:42,445
That pressure's too intense!

300
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:02,331
-This is the moment
you've been waiting for.

301
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:04,200
You're a much
stronger player now.

302
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,268
You must be very excited.

303
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:14,477
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I'm
ready for you, Toya.

304
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:21,450
-Huh?

305
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:22,051
Hikaru?

306
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:45,207
(VOICEOVER) This reminds
me of Akira the last time

307
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:45,775
they played.

308
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:08,331
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
That was a while ago.

309
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:09,865
During the summer tournament.

310
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:13,336
The third round game between
Haze and Kaio Middle School.

311
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:16,205
Back then, Toya was
chasing after Sai.

312
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:20,309
Now I'm the one
chasing after Toya.

313
00:18:20,343 --> 00:18:23,245
And I think I understand
what he was feeling.

314
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,315
What he was going
through at that moment.

315
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:28,851
SAI (VOICEOVER): You're about
to confront the opponent who

316
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:30,286
intimidates you the most.

317
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,855
You'll never know how
much I envy you right now.

318
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:41,063
I long for the day when I can
be in that position once again.

319
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:43,099
To face the one I fear the most.

320
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,937
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): My
first professional game,

321
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,239
and this time you're
playing me, Toya.

322
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:51,807
Not Sai.

323
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:53,023
Me!

324
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:07,823
Where is he?

325
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:16,966
He's late.

326
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:26,475
[buzzer]

327
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:27,209
-Onegai shimasu.

328
00:19:52,027 --> 00:19:53,028
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Toya.

329
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,302
-Shindou.

330
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:02,338
May I have a word with you?

331
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:03,605
-Sure.

332
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:06,608
[heartbeats]

333
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:22,358
-Toya won't be able
to make it in today.

334
00:20:25,027 --> 00:20:27,329
We just got a phone call.

335
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:29,765
The office is in a total panic.

336
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:31,467
Toya Meijin collapsed
and has been

337
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,435
rushed to the hospital
in an ambulance.

338
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:49,351
-No!

339
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:55,691
[theme music]

340
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,680
SAI: Toya Meijin has to stay
in the hospital for a while.

341
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:26,348
HIKARU: He's got a
computer with him

342
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:27,883
and it's connected
to the internet.

343
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:33,555
SAI: That means we could
have a game against him!

344
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:34,890
HIKARU: I don't know, Sai.

345
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,826
Last time we played online, we
almost got in a lot of trouble.

346
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,594
SAI: Please.

347
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:41,029
You must challenge him!

348
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,297
HIKARU: Next time.

349
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:44,967
The Acknowledgement of Sai.

350
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,804
SAI: This could be my
chance at the Divine Move!
