00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:22,612
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Toya.

3
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:24,516
You and I have to
play each other.

4
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:32,768
I know that you've always
wanted to play against Sai,

5
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:35,874
but he isn't here anymore.

6
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:38,346
Except he is in my game.

7
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,518
He's in every one of my moves.

8
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:43,490
But I can't expect you
to understand that.

9
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:46,231
I'll make myself strong
enough to beat you.

10
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm gonna play at
your level now.

11
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:59,894
Oh, hey Toya.

12
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:03,969
We finally get to
play each other again.

13
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:05,840
-The last time the
two of us played

14
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:09,481
was in a school Go
club tournament.

15
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:11,386
Two years and four months ago.

16
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:16,397
-It's been a long
time since then.

17
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,534
-I know.

18
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:20,906
It's been too long.

19
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,345
-Now it's your chance to
see how strong I've become.

20
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:37,543
If he counters with an approach,
I'll use a pincer attack.

21
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:39,246
Then I'll spread
across the board

22
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,415
ready for an all out battle.

23
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,304
Here I am, playing him at last.

24
00:03:57,252 --> 00:04:00,559
It's our first game since
the Go club tournament.

25
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:03,967
No, Sai actually played the
first half of that game.

26
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,470
Toya.

27
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,439
This is it.

28
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:12,685
Our first real match
against each other.

29
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,474
He's made a pincer move.

30
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,478
It's time for me
to break through.

31
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:39,611
So that's how he's
gonna play it.

32
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,485
Even if I can squeeze him out,
once we get into a battle,

33
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:45,424
I'll be one move short.

34
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:46,427
I'll slide instead!

35
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,771
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): He's reading
the game all in one moment.

36
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,511
It feels like I'm up against
one of the top ranked players.

37
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:20,501
Huh?

38
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,418
Mr. Yun, are you sure?

39
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:30,756
This is one of Shindou's games.

40
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,960
It sure is.

41
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:34,030
I happened to be at the Go
salon when he was playing

42
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:36,069
and brought a copy out with me.

43
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,041
-From what I can see,
both black and white

44
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:41,547
are playing like pros.

45
00:05:41,547 --> 00:05:43,785
But there's something
about white.

46
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,589
Shindou was the
one playing white.

47
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:48,796
Black was played by a Korean
Insei named Su-yeong Hong.

48
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,567
I wanted you to see
this game record.

49
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,535
-Hm?

50
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:52,704
-I know how truly
disappointed you

51
00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:56,580
were when Shindou played
so poorly against you.

52
00:05:56,613 --> 00:06:01,824
But now, he is a
much better player.

53
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:02,660
-Oh, hello.

54
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:04,530
This is Amano.

55
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:05,700
How's the pro exam going?

56
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,174
Mm-hm.

57
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:12,080
Ah.

58
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:13,951
-It's been decided?

59
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:15,120
All three of them?

60
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,459
You mean there's
not even a playoff?

61
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,065
So that must mean that
Waya's beaten Fuku,

62
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:21,902
and Shindou must've beaten Ochi.

63
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,848
-You're always setting your
sights on players above you.

64
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:29,485
Maybe you should
pay more attention

65
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:31,590
to who's coming up from below.

66
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:32,726
-From below?

67
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,596
-There's someone else
you should worry about,

68
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,001
and he's right behind you.

69
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:38,872
There are only two
young pros out there

70
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:40,642
who I feel threatened by.

71
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:45,019
You're one of them, and
the other's Hikaru Shindou.

72
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:47,625
I suggest you keep
an eye on him.

73
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:57,012
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): I wanted to
find out how strong you were,

74
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:58,816
and now I know.

75
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:01,823
There's no doubt in my mind.

76
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:02,557
You're my rival.

77
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:45,585
Sai.

78
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:58,012
[phone ringing]

79
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,749
-Hello, publishing division?

80
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:01,620
Ah, thanks for getting
back to me so quick.

81
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:03,624
So, is everything in order?

82
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:04,693
Good, thanks a lot.

83
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,905
-Does anyone here know Korean?

84
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:13,011
I'm not sure how to
pronounce this kid's name.

85
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:15,784
Looks like the first part
of the character for flood.

86
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:17,655
Hong, perhaps?

87
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:20,896
-Do you mean the boy who
defeated [inaudible]?

88
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,031
I know his name.

89
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:24,169
It's Su-yeong Hond.

90
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,172
-Su-yeong Hond.

91
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,775
Age 14.

92
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:29,915
Seems Korea's produced yet
another young superstar.

93
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:31,719
-A player from Korea
just set a new record

94
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:33,055
for most consecutive wins.

95
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,160
A 16-year-old named Yong Ha Ko.

96
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:37,733
-It's amazing what the players
in Korea are accomplishing.

97
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:39,168
They have a lot of
young talent there.

98
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:41,875
-Hm.

99
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:44,914
Su-yeong Hong, Yong Ha Ko.

100
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:48,088
I wonder if they'll be on the
team that's coming from Korea.

101
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:49,792
-What team's that?

102
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:52,698
I haven't heard about it.

103
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,005
-Well, nothing's
been confirmed yet,

104
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,079
but there's talk of a new
junior cup tournament.

105
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,284
A big corporation
wants to sponsor it.

106
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:02,921
It'll be an
international competition

107
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:05,325
with teams from China,
Korea, and Japan.

108
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,130
And all the players
who are on the teams

109
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:09,368
have to be 18 years or under.

110
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:13,811
-A China, Korea,
Japan junior cup?

111
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,181
-Just 18 and under?

112
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:16,784
-We don't stand a chance.

113
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:18,722
Japan doesn't have any
players that age who

114
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:21,895
can compete against China and
Korea at that high a level.

115
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,833
-What about Akira Toya?

116
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:24,936
-Oh.

117
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:26,740
-Toya won't be enough.

118
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,710
We're gonna need
more than one player.

119
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,114
-Ochi's been doing well.

120
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:31,249
I'd choose him.

121
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,120
-Well, that's an idea.

122
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:34,823
Is he still undefeated?

123
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:35,793
-Yeah, I think so.

124
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,396
And I heard he's only 14.

125
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,969
That's pretty impressive
for a kid his age.

126
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,304
-I agree, but don't
you think Ochi

127
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:42,941
is a bit out of their league?

128
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:45,046
He'd have a tough time
competing against the Chinese

129
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,115
and the Koreans.

130
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:48,954
Nope, we've only got Toya.

131
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,691
AMANO: There's always Shindou.

132
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:51,460
-Hm?

133
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:52,143
-Huh?

134
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,217
-Shindou should be on the team.

135
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:33,853
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Shindou.

136
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,837
Sai's shadow is here.

137
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:07,560
The shadow fades and reappears.

138
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,238
There's someone else within you.

139
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,036
All this time, that's
what I've been watching.

140
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,401
I've been watching that shadow.

141
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:28,303
MAN: Hikaru Shindou?

142
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:29,874
-Wha--

143
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:31,644
-Are you sure?

144
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:33,414
-Surely you can't
mean the same boy

145
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:36,220
who was skipping
all of his games?

146
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,429
-You really think
he's that good, Amano?

147
00:12:40,463 --> 00:12:41,532
-Yes.

148
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:43,637
I believe he has a
lot of potential.

149
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,474
He'll be right at the
top with Akira Toya.

150
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,557
-What makes you so sure of that?

151
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,364
-Prominent players like
Koyo Toya, Kuwabara Honinbo,

152
00:12:56,364 --> 00:13:00,140
and Ogata Judan have all been
keeping an eye on his progress.

153
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:02,244
They must be interested
in him for a reason.

154
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,677
-Ah.

155
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:19,983
Now you mention it, I
remember Toya-sensei

156
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:22,255
asked to have Shindou as his
opponent in the Shinsho Dan

157
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:23,257
Series.

158
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,695
-But he played
terribly in that game.

159
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:28,034
No sign of a strong
player there.

160
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,136
-Mm-hm, yes.

161
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:30,439
But you know what's interesting?

162
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:33,078
Kuwabara-sensei and the others
didn't lessen their opinion

163
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,586
of him because of how
he performed that day.

164
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:39,225
And ever since I found
out Toya considers Shindou

165
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:41,029
to be his rival,
I can understand

166
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,000
why they feel that way.

167
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:44,704
And if they've all got
high hopes for Shindou,

168
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,443
I can see no reason
to doubt them.

169
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,378
-You're kidding?

170
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,682
His rival?

171
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:53,156
-You know, that says a lot
about how good a player he is.

172
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:54,058
-Hm.

173
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:55,327
You know what?

174
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,032
I've heard that rumor too
about Kuwabara-sensei thinking

175
00:13:58,032 --> 00:13:59,736
there's something
special about Shindou.

176
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,974
-You know, just the
other day I overheard

177
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,215
Kurata talking about him, too.

178
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:06,184
-Oh!

179
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:07,319
Shindou's playing
Toya this week.

180
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,326
That's a game I gotta see.

181
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:12,498
-From the way he
reacted, he obviously

182
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:13,734
thinks highly of Shindou.

183
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:15,037
-Really?

184
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,774
Is it just me, or is
everyone keeping an eye

185
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:19,646
on what this kid's doing?

186
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,290
-So, what's his game record like
since he started playing again?

187
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:26,628
-He's gone undefeated
for eight games now.

188
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:29,535
-Oh wow.

189
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,239
-I think this is great.

190
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:33,644
We need more youngsters like
him to give the higher ranked

191
00:14:33,677 --> 00:14:35,515
players a run for their money.

192
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:37,218
-You know how the
older guys are.

193
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:39,557
They won't go down without
a fight, that's for sure.

194
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,029
-But Ogata-sensei's already
started the onslaught

195
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:43,432
by winning the Judan title.

196
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,570
And it won't be long before
Kurata makes his mark.

197
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:46,272
MAN: No, no.

198
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:47,374
Forget those two.

199
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:49,412
Young Toya's the one
to watch out for.

200
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:52,752
He's got champion
written all over him.

201
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:54,122
MAN: Wait a minute.

202
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:56,394
Isn't today the day Toya
and Shindou play each other?

203
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:02,540
-When I think about
the future, my heart

204
00:15:02,574 --> 00:15:04,545
pounds with excitement.

205
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:05,380
-Eh?

206
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:06,316
-Ah?

207
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:06,798
-Huh?

208
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:10,123
-Mr. Amano?

209
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,368
-We all know of Akira Toya.

210
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:23,353
But there's also Shindou.

211
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:25,825
And Ochi.

212
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,464
And with Waya and the
others filling up the ranks,

213
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:32,673
there's bound to be a huge burst
of energy into the world of Go.

214
00:15:37,384 --> 00:15:38,352
-That's right.

215
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:39,454
The power of youth.

216
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,560
The dawning of a new age.

217
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:42,528
-You bet.

218
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:44,499
And Toya will be
leading the way.

219
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:46,570
-And Hikaru Shindou could
have enough potential

220
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:49,443
to be as good a player as him.

221
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:51,648
-At last, Japan will be able
to compete with the world!

222
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,452
And we can make a comeback.

223
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,191
Right, Mr. Amano?

224
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:57,360
-This is great.

225
00:15:57,393 --> 00:15:59,332
Think how many more copies
of Go Weekly we'll sell.

226
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,322
-We don't know
anything for sure.

227
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:11,791
We'll have to see
how things turn out.

228
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:25,756
That's enough dreaming for now.

229
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:26,424
All right.

230
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:27,226
Back to work!

231
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,515
[buzzer]

232
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,977
-I'm having a good game so far.

233
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:22,781
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Wow.

234
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:25,854
They've been
playing really fast.

235
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:27,525
OCHI (VOICEOVER):
This is complicated.

236
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:28,960
They're attacking
all over the board.

237
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:35,441
SAEKI (VOICEOVER): It's
quite a battle going on,

238
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:38,448
but Shindou seems to be holding
his ground against Toya.

239
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:40,018
Good for you, Shindou.

240
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,621
-Hey, Saeki.

241
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:43,493
You want to join me for lunch?

242
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:45,029
Food tastes better with company.

243
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,632
That's what I always say.

244
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,571
I'd ask Akira, except
I know he doesn't

245
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:49,906
like to eat during a big game.

246
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,875
So come on.

247
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:52,880
-Uh-- uh, but I--

248
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,480
Mr. Ashiwara!

249
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:55,886
No, no--

250
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,430
-So much for us Morishita
students sticking together.

251
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:02,500
-Hm.

252
00:18:02,534 --> 00:18:02,984
-Hm.

253
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:13,524
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): We
stopped for the lunch break

254
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:15,529
just after Toya
played a shoulder hit.

255
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:26,620
It looks like he's gonna leave
the battle in the upper right,

256
00:18:26,654 --> 00:18:28,791
and work on building
up the lower left.

257
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,063
When we start again,
I'll play a knight's move

258
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:35,439
and attack him where
his defense is thin.

259
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:36,943
Then Toya will to
connect, so I need

260
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:39,315
to make sure I stay
alive on the inside.

261
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:41,085
The lower left is too
small to help with that,

262
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:44,559
so the question is how can
I approach from the top?

263
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:53,746
I could be at a disadvantage
here No, it's still close.

264
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:56,085
We have a long way to go.

265
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:56,953
Oh!

266
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:59,826
Everyone's left for the break.

267
00:18:59,826 --> 00:19:01,931
Toya, what are you
doing for lunch?

268
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,850
OK.

269
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,553
Well, I think I'm gonna head
out before we run out of time.

270
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,477
He's not even gonna eat?

271
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:31,844
-Sai.

272
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:36,179
-Hm?

273
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:46,528
-While we were
playing this morning,

274
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:47,897
I thought of Sai
from the internet.

275
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:53,945
-Toya.

276
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:59,556
I'm sorry I'm not
Sai, but I wish I was.

277
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,458
-It is you.

278
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:04,501
-What do you mean?

279
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,113
-He's a part of you.

280
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:12,619
There's another side to you.

281
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:14,623
Another player.

282
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:19,968
And the Hikaru Shindou I
played when we first met,

283
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:21,504
that was Sai.

284
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:29,822
-Toya.

285
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:30,758
Toya, listen, I--

286
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,640
-There's someone
else within you.

287
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,748
I can see him.

288
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:57,116
[theme music]

289
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:23,572
HIKARU: For years, no
one knew who Sai was.

290
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:24,808
I kept him a secret.

291
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:26,648
He could never be
connected to me.

292
00:22:26,648 --> 00:22:28,983
Until now.

293
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:30,652
Has Toya really seen him?

294
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:35,490
I didn't think I'd
ever see him again,

295
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:37,358
but I'm going to
get one more chance.

296
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:45,266
Next time, A Nostalgic Smile.
