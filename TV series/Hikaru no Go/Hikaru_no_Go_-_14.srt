1
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:07,649
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a go board,

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,491
a spirit from the past known as
Fujiwara no Sai has returned.

3
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,998
Visible only to Hikaru
Shindo, a master of go,

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:18,138
Sai seeks to play
the divine move.

5
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:20,142
[theme song]

6
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,230
-I'm sure that Toya
does feel guilty.

7
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,467
Think he'll quit
the go club when

8
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,639
the tournament is finished?

9
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:57,278
-Sai?

10
00:01:57,312 --> 00:02:00,619
You should play him.

11
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:02,890
-Are you sure?

12
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:06,831
You were so eager to
play in this tournament.

13
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:07,834
-He's all yours.

14
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,738
Good luck.

15
00:02:09,772 --> 00:02:12,844
-They really want to win,
so they're working together.

16
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:14,548
Mitani said he's gonna
try as hard as he

17
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:15,884
can to beat Kaio's captain.

18
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:17,621
I don't think he
likes them much.

19
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:41,939
-Are you ready?

20
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:43,341
-I think so.

21
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:45,212
Let's give it all we've got.

22
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:46,348
-Let's choose for color.

23
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,811
-Two, four, six.

24
00:03:00,844 --> 00:03:02,448
-I'm black.

25
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:03,851
-Then I'm white.

26
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:07,659
Hikaru, you're playing black.

27
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:08,261
-Huh?

28
00:03:20,886 --> 00:03:23,425
-Onegaishimasu.

29
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,762
-Onegaishimasu.

30
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:26,464
-Onegaishimasu.

31
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,701
-Onegaishimasu.

32
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:28,302
-Onegaishi--

33
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:28,836
-At last.

34
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,438
-Huh?

35
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:33,914
-I finally get to
face you again.

36
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:34,682
You're mine.

37
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:40,226
-Huh?

38
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,918
-Huh?

39
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:11,493
[rattling]

40
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:40,019
-[sigh]

41
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:45,029
-Onegaishimasu.

42
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,438
-All right.

43
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:51,342
Let's begin.

44
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,346
3-4 point in the
upper right corner.

45
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:05,639
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
That was fast.

46
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,313
It's like he already knew
where he was going to play.

47
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:10,582
SAI (VOICEOVER):
I'm sure that he

48
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:12,854
has prepared every
one of his moves.

49
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:17,898
In his mind, he's already
faced me 1,000 times.

50
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:18,866
-We mustn't falter.

51
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:19,735
Enclose at 15-4.

52
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,895
SAI (VOICEOVER): 3-5 point
in the lower left corner.

53
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:28,645
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): You've got
that same look in your eyes

54
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,451
as when you challenged Sai.

55
00:06:31,484 --> 00:06:33,088
I've wondered what it
would be like to have

56
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:36,662
that kind of intensity,
and now I've come this far.

57
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,700
My goal is to
surpass you someday.

58
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:48,420
Sai?

59
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:55,502
How come you're taking so
long to call the next move?

60
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:56,904
It's still early in the game.

61
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,723
Why aren't you saying anything?

62
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:09,130
You know, if you ask me,
I say we should play 11-8.

63
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:10,867
What do you think?

64
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,470
That's a pretty
good move, isn't it?

65
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,881
-Have I gotten better since
our last game, Shindo?

66
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:35,986
-Huh?

67
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,623
[sigh]

68
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,494
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
What's he worried about?

69
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,163
He's already an awesome player.

70
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:42,867
AKIRA (OFFSCREEN):
You've changed too.

71
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,037
-Huh?

72
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,776
-You've learned how to
properly place your stones.

73
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:48,479
-It's no big deal.

74
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:50,784
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I don't
get why that's so surprising.

75
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:54,625
I've been playing against
Kimihiro and Mitani every day.

76
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:57,030
It's been tough, but I've
really gotten better.

77
00:07:59,936 --> 00:08:04,011
There is one thing
I'd like to know.

78
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:06,783
Have I got any closer
to catching up to you?

79
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:25,590
-You've gotta realize by
now, I am a lot better

80
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:26,892
than your average
go club player.

81
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,646
It's your move.

82
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,822
MITANI (VOICEOVER):
This guy's a joke.

83
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,993
I bet you're wishing you
had taken me more seriously.

84
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:46,334
I'm no ordinary
seventh grader, am I?

85
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,771
I already know you're a
better player than I am,

86
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:51,577
but I'm forcing you
to play at my pace.

87
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:54,049
If I can confuse
you by making fast,

88
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,688
unexpected attacks,
then I might actually

89
00:08:56,688 --> 00:09:00,162
have a chance at
winning this game.

90
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:02,968
What's taking you so long?

91
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:03,737
Hm.

92
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,571
You're up to something.

93
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:55,111
-Is something wrong?

94
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,148
Please, take as much
time as you need.

95
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,887
At least try to make this game
worthy of the first position.

96
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,864
You're being far too aggressive.

97
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:08,304
You should try to make your
attacks a little less obvious.

98
00:10:08,304 --> 00:10:11,043
-Are you trying to give me
advice in the middle of a game?

99
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,179
Because I don't need it.

100
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,319
If you don't want to
take me seriously, fine.

101
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:17,023
But I'm the team
captain for a reason,

102
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:18,759
and I didn't come here
to learn from you.

103
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:19,661
I came here to win.

104
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,438
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
He's taking forever.

105
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:27,278
This guy's the most cautious
player I've ever seen.

106
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,950
KIMIHIRO (VOICEOVER): Last year
I took advantage of a mistake

107
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,821
my opponent made and
managed to win the game.

108
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:32,956
But this guy's tough.

109
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:34,125
He's playing flawlessly.

110
00:10:34,158 --> 00:10:35,929
He's not giving
me any opportunity

111
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:37,432
to gain the upper hand.

112
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,726
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I want to play.

113
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,098
Akira, you've never
stopped chasing after Sai.

114
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:57,106
Well now it's time for
me to chase after you.

115
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:59,077
I've got to catch up to you.

116
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,560
-All right.

117
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:01,397
13-4.

118
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:03,068
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I'll play at 11-8.

119
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:07,443
But then how would
I follow that up?

120
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:11,218
-Hikaru, I said 13-4.

121
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,921
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I have to find out.

122
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:13,890
Sorry, Sai.

123
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,259
I know Akira's more
skilled than me,

124
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:18,934
but I'll never know how big that
gap is until I play him myself.

125
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:22,475
I have to make my move!

126
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:24,078
-He played 11-8?

127
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:25,849
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I'm going to play now.

128
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:37,339
SAI (VOICEOVER): Fascinating.

129
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,350
AKIRA (VOICEOVER):
What's he done?

130
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:45,489
Is he fooling around and
trying to confuse me?

131
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:50,934
Or is this some kind
of new strategy?

132
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:15,568
-Hm.

133
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:22,983
SAI (VOICEOVER): Amazing.

134
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:26,357
Hikaru's strategy
holds great promise!

135
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,964
It's unfortunate that he lacks
the skill to properly follow it

136
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:33,238
up, but I can feel
his determination

137
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:35,141
growing with each move.

138
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:38,415
Hikaru is allowing
his will to guide him.

139
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,653
He's found the strength
to trust himself!

140
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,637
From now on, I shall stand back.

141
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,075
His game will develop
and mature on its own.

142
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:57,756
-Stop messing around!

143
00:12:57,989 --> 00:12:58,432
-What?

144
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:00,034
What's wrong?

145
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:00,536
-Enough, Akira!

146
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:06,682
-No one is trying
to mess with you!

147
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:07,651
-That's right!

148
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:10,189
Hikaru has been
playing a serious game.

149
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,461
Akira, you're so obsessed
with chasing my shadow

150
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:15,734
that you failed to notice
Hikaru's true abilities.

151
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:18,072
You don't realize that
with every footstep,

152
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:20,143
he is heading
straight toward you.

153
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:28,127
-Young man, you can
either continue your game

154
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,529
or you can choose to resign.

155
00:13:29,562 --> 00:13:31,199
It's up to you.

156
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:41,087
I told you earlier that you'd
find out when you play him.

157
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:49,104
-Your move!

158
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:38,674
MITANI (VOICEOVER):
What an idiot.

159
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:42,615
Why would anyone get so
worked up over Hikaru?

160
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,419
He's nothing special.

161
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:47,292
I mean, he's driven, but his
skills need a lot of work

162
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:48,695
before he gets better.

163
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:54,307
Kimihiro's not doing
so good either.

164
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:56,177
But I can still win.

165
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,583
MITANI (VOICEOVER):
What's he doing?

166
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:32,820
Why is he battling
me stone for stone?

167
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:35,526
Is he trying to rattle
me or something?

168
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:51,627
I can't figure out why
he wants this point.

169
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,497
It doesn't mean that much.

170
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:05,856
Fine.

171
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:07,727
Two can play at
this game, you know.

172
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:29,939
Go ahead.

173
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,445
Just take it already.

174
00:16:32,478 --> 00:16:35,786
-You slipped up.

175
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:38,324
I can tell you've become strong
by playing a type of power

176
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:39,994
go that's self-taught.

177
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:42,366
If I'm right, you
shouldn't have backed off.

178
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,505
You probably think fighting
over one stone is insignificant,

179
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:46,642
but you're wrong.

180
00:16:46,675 --> 00:16:48,278
I know what kind
of player you are.

181
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,783
By backing off, you've
lost the initiative.

182
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:55,326
From now on, your game is going
to fall down and break apart.

183
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,295
-Are you finished?

184
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:58,299
Because I'd like
to keep playing.

185
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:59,435
It's your move.

186
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:33,806
-I resign.

187
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,375
-Toya?

188
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:42,792
-Thank you very
much for the game.

189
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:43,527
-Same to you.

190
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,462
It was a good match.

191
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,807
TOYA (OFFSCREEN): Now I know.

192
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,788
I used to think that you were
capable of the divine move.

193
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:13,522
I was wrong.

194
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:27,419
-[crying]

195
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,615
-Hm.

196
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:43,585
I must resign.

197
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:44,621
-Thank you for the game.

198
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,630
-This game has been
a pleasant surprise.

199
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:23,135
I honestly didn't expect
you to be this good.

200
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:24,238
It was fun.

201
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:27,144
-Stop it.

202
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:28,546
It's not over yet.

203
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:33,857
-Really?

204
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:36,897
You want to keep playing
me through to the end?

205
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:54,534
-I resign.

206
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,168
-Thank you.

207
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:58,909
It was an interesting match.

208
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,181
-[whimpering]

209
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:04,054
[crying]

210
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,774
-[crying]

211
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,828
-Kaio versus Haze.

212
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:43,169
Kaio wins three to nothing.

213
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,173

214
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:24,113
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Check this out, Sai!

215
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,813
You can play Go on the internet!

216
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:28,382
SAI (VOICEOVER): I don't
know how this device works.

217
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,784
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): It's
pretty easy to figure out.

218
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:30,384
You'll see.

219
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:35,456
SAI (VOICEOVER): Can we play
against Akari and the others?

220
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:36,524
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Come on, there's

221
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:37,925
like thousands of
other opponents.

222
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,894
Anyway, it's almost
summer, and the go club's

223
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:42,530
probably taking a
break for a while.

224
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:45,499
Next time, The Ghost In The Net.

225
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,601
SAI (VOICEOVER): OK,
let's go on the line!

226
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:49,737
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
You mean online.
