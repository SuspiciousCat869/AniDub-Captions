00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:07,250
[theme music]

2
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,811
-I ain't gonna win
unless I play my best,

3
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:51,582
and I play my best
when I'm calm.

4
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:54,154
You play when you're all tense,
and you're not gonna win.

5
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,826
So, I took a break for a
half-hour just to chill out.

6
00:01:56,861 --> 00:02:00,168
But you seem to be getting
more and more wound up.

7
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:02,272
-Hikaru is completely
intimidated!

8
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:05,446
There's no way he can win now!

9
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,918
-I win by four
and a half points!

10
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:09,555
-Thanks, you played
a strong game.

11
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:18,742
INSTRUCTOR: When you're
ready, please begin.

12
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,503
-Hikaru, why are
you still so tense?

13
00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:58,264
-No!

14
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:03,876
-Hmm.

15
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,917
If you start to lose
your concentration now,

16
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,787
your game is going
to fall apart,

17
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:10,824
just like it did
during the Insei test.

18
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,644
You aren't playing as
well as you normally do,

19
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:21,950
because your nerves have
gotten the better of you!

20
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:32,975
-Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for lunch.

21
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:34,377
Please stop your clocks.

22
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:41,793
TSUBAKI: Hey!

23
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:42,896
You hungry, kid?

24
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,600
Want to go get some lunch?

25
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:48,274
-Thanks for the offer, but I
brought my own lunch today.

26
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:50,446
-Hey!

27
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:51,015
Hm.

28
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:51,850
'Sup with him?

29
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,466
-What's the matter,
Shindou, lost your appetite?

30
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,284
-I always wondered if he'd be
able to cope with the pressure.

31
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:09,790
If he loses this game,
that'll be two in row!

32
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:11,025
One more and he'll be out.

33
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:15,436
Not that it's any
of my business.

34
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:18,910
-Hikaru!

35
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:20,480
So, I, uh--

36
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,549
-Shut up!

37
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:22,952
Can't you see I'm trying
to concentrate here!

38
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:32,740
I resign.

39
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:44,567
-Hey, kiddo, how'd you do?

40
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:47,039
I've won two games out of two!

41
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,375
Don't talk to me, then!

42
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,449
Guess that means you
lost another game, didja?

43
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:52,551
The pressure's on now.

44
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,937
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: Hikaru, what
do you think you're doing?

45
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,439
HIKARU: What does it look like?

46
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:04,946
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: You have your
third preliminary match today,

47
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,783
and you've already
lost two games.

48
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:09,489
Are you sure it's a good
idea to be sitting around?

49
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:12,362
HIKARU: Oh, it's OK.

50
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,101
I'm not going inside until
just before the exam starts.

51
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,110
That way, I can avoid
running into Tsubaki.

52
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:22,651
I want to make sure I win!

53
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,690
I'm going to be
playing Fuku today.

54
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,560
I've only ever played
him twice before,

55
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,799
once in a study session,
and once for fun.

56
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:30,669
I was able to beat them
in one of the games,

57
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:32,540
and I'm pretty sure
I can do it again.

58
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:39,923
As long as I play my usual game,
there's no way I'm gonna lose!

59
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:49,177
-When the pressure's
on, it can be

60
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,416
difficult to play
your usual game.

61
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,808
-Right, let's go!

62
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,483
INSTRUCTOR: When you're
ready, please begin.

63
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:26,159
Shindou!

64
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:27,663
Where on earth have you been?

65
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:28,765
Never mind.

66
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:29,901
You'd better go and
take your seat quickly.

67
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:30,770
It's over there.

68
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:31,638
-Yes, sir!

69
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:32,807
-You almost didn't make it.

70
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:34,044
-Yeah, uh, sorry.

71
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:36,149
-I had to start
your clock already.

72
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:37,084
-OK, OK.

73
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:37,953
BOTH: Onegaishimasu!

74
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:42,596
-Keep your emotions
under control, Hikaru.

75
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,812
MITSUKO: You know,
Dad, I don't understand

76
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:51,115
what's gotten into him lately.

77
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,788
HEIHACHI: I thought
mothers knew everything

78
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,893
about their children,
but this sure

79
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:59,768
seems to have taken
you by surprise!

80
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:01,806
Uh.

81
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,612
Didn't you tell me a while back
that he asked you for money

82
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:06,683
so he could take the pro exam?

83
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:08,955
-Well, he told me the
Insei don't have to pay.

84
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:12,095
-Ah, I see.

85
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:14,099
-A few months ago,
he said he was

86
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,240
going to miss school so he could
spend more time playing Go.

87
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:20,514
He said he got the OK from
this teacher to do it,

88
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:24,523
but I thought he was taking
it a bit too seriously.

89
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:26,227
That's really why I'm here.

90
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:28,097
I don't know too much
about professional Go,

91
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:29,869
so I'm wondering
do you think Hikaru

92
00:07:29,902 --> 00:07:31,572
should be involved in it?

93
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:33,910
-You know I like a
game of Go, but you're

94
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:35,681
asking the wrong person.

95
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,986
Did you talk to Massou about it?

96
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,024
-Yes, but all he said
was how difficult it

97
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:42,162
is to become a pro at anything.

98
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,933
He said I should
let him go ahead,

99
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,737
if that's what he really wants.

100
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,775
He's got to give it a try
because he'll probably

101
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:50,013
fail anyway.

102
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:51,583
-I think that's good advice!

103
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:53,588
It's healthy for the
boy to have a hobby!

104
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,940
MITSUKO: Hikaru seems to
have changed recently.

105
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:03,075
Mm.

106
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,715
I'm worried about him.

107
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:07,686
-Any idea what it
was that made him

108
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:10,291
decide he wanted to
become a professional?

109
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:13,131
-Well, I remember him telling me
about this one game he played.

110
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:15,035
The other kids shouted
at him for losing.

111
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:21,750
-After the match, he looked
so disappointed in me!

112
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:23,922
Next thing I know
he's turned pro!

113
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:25,692
I gotta catch up to him!

114
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:27,162
Then he'll know how good I am!

115
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,795
I remember that
look of anticipation

116
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:43,832
on Touya's face when we
played at the tournament!

117
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:46,873
If I want to see that look
again, I'll have to win!

118
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:59,935
-How fortunate that you
know this opponent so well.

119
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:04,011
You're playing your
usual game again!

120
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,848
-Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for lunch.

121
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:06,951
Please stop your clocks.

122
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:21,884
A-ha!

123
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:24,156
They're nearing the end game.

124
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,993
You boys want to continue?

125
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:26,995
BOTH: Yes, please!

126
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:29,935
-All right, then.

127
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,439
-I was getting
concerned about Shindou

128
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,143
after he lost his
first two games,

129
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:36,717
but now it looks like he's
back to his usual form.

130
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:39,122
FUKU: 50 points for me.

131
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:41,194
HIKARU: 59 for me!

132
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,766
I won!

133
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,804
Thanks for the game, Fuku!

134
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,007
-(sadly) Thanks for the game.

135
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:52,359
BOTH: Yes!

136
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:54,197
Win number one!

137
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:55,066
-Win number one?

138
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:56,970
You mean you lost the first two?

139
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:58,072
-You didn't know?

140
00:09:58,106 --> 00:10:00,177
I had to win this one or
I'd've been out for good!

141
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,282
It was a life and
death situation!

142
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:05,489
And I made it out alive!

143
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,028
I guess that means
we're even now?

144
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:11,067
One win, two losses?

145
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,805
-Mm-hmm.

146
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:13,339
-Sorry.

147
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:14,509
I gotta get going.

148
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:16,814
I want to be outta here
before Gorilla Man gets back

149
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,317
from lunch.

150
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,959
-Is that's why you rushed in at
the last minute this morning?

151
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:23,362
-Yeah, that's right.

152
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:25,400
-Are you going to do
that tomorrow too?

153
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:28,240
Don't forget, they're
drawing to see who plays who!

154
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,210
-Yeah, I know.

155
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:32,549
Makes sense for the winner
to record the results.

156
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:37,493
If you lose, you don't really
want to be reminded about it.

157
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:40,199
Fuku, Fuku-- oh!

158
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:41,369
There!

159
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:42,838
And now for mine.

160
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:52,526
Win by 3 and 1/2 points!

161
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,428
There, done.

162
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:54,832
Onto the next win!

163
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:05,122
Tomorrow, I'm going to
get myself another win!

164
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:09,131
-Tomorrow is another day,
but it won't change the fact

165
00:11:09,131 --> 00:11:11,369
that you're still down
two matches to one!

166
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,005
-I give up.

167
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,877
This game is so over.

168
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,411
-Whaddya know?

169
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:47,449
Jinguchi went and lost!

170
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:48,351
-To this guy?

171
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:49,620
Who is he?

172
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,291
-So, kid, what's your secret?

173
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:53,195
You're not one of them
professionals, are ya?

174
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:54,064
-No.

175
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:55,968
Just an Insei.

176
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:59,275
Playing in a Go salon like
this is good practice for us.

177
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:01,347
-Wow, so he's an Insei!

178
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,549
JINGUCHI: Practicing on us!

179
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:03,986
Ergh!

180
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,356
You know what?

181
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,561
I got a friend who
turned pro a while back.

182
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,233
I remember him telling me,
if they didn't have that age

183
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:13,039
limit for the pro exam, I
could have been a contender!

184
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:14,944
But I'm not 30 anymore.

185
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:16,948
You're as good as any
pro I've ever played,

186
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:18,451
that's what he told me!

187
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:19,654
The big liar.

188
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:23,229
I'm guessing he was just
saying it to be nice.

189
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:26,135
Sorry I wasn't able to give
you a better practice match.

190
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:27,705
-Hey, it's no problem.

191
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,942
I enjoyed the game.

192
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:30,378
WAYA: Excuse me,
but do you remember

193
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:32,049
the move you played here?

194
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,688
If you'd attached with the
diagonal at this point,

195
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,458
I'd have been in
some serious trouble!

196
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:38,295
-I see that now.

197
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:41,069
-Hey, Waya, finish
up, would you?

198
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:42,706
We'd better get a move on!

199
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:44,710
-OK.

200
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,150
-Hold on a minute, guys.

201
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,556
You should try out this place.

202
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:53,329
Stronger opponents there.

203
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:54,198
-Thanks for the tip!

204
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,400
That's awesome!

205
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:56,637
-(SIMULTANEOUSLY) Thanks
very much for helping, sir!

206
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,307
-I don't mind these Go
salons, but why does everyone

207
00:12:58,307 --> 00:13:00,211
have to smoke?

208
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:02,716
-You can always come to
my place and play there.

209
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,453
-You know where we
should try next?

210
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,225
The Go Association!

211
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:08,730
-You want to check out how
they're doing in the prelims?

212
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,367
WAYA: It's day three, right?

213
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:12,305
If Shindou managed
three straight wins,

214
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,042
then he's already
through to the finals!

215
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,686
HIKARU: What?

216
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,391
Isumi and Waya were
here yesterday?

217
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,461
-Yeah.

218
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:25,500
They came here to check
out the match records.

219
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:28,207
I told them that you and Fuku
had already finished your match

220
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,443
and gone home.

221
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,650
Waya didn't believe you guys
could have played so fast!

222
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:35,289
-Believe it or not, we actually
took longer than normal,

223
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:36,525
and we were still pretty quick!

224
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,705
-Anyone who's won or lost
three games is already gone.

225
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,679
-And everyone's who's got only
one or two wins so far are

226
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:48,451
left to battle it out!

227
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:49,788
-You should've seen Waya.

228
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:53,229
He got all antsy when he saw
that you were two down already!

229
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:55,534
But you're not the only one.

230
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,806
I'm two down.

231
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,311
Fuku's two down.

232
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,717
We're in big trouble!

233
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,254
-Hey, howya doing?

234
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:05,456
-Good, thanks!

235
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,428
Apart from the fact
that Ryou and the others

236
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,165
already made it
through to the finals.

237
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:09,699
-(FEARFULLY) Oh!

238
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:10,802
Where us he?

239
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:12,272
Gorilla man!

240
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:13,374
-You mean Tsubaki?

241
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:14,309
He's won already.

242
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:15,646
We don't see him
until the finals.

243
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,514
-Oh!

244
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:18,151
So he's not going to be around?

245
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:18,585
Whew!

246
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:19,187
-Ugh.

247
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,301
-Now, if I could have
everybody's attention, please,

248
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:28,307
It's time to begin drawing
for the next pairings.

249
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:30,312
Please come forward when
your name is called.

250
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:32,382
If you're paired with an
opponent you have already

251
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,788
played earlier in the
preliminaries, please let us

252
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:38,296
know immediately so
you can draw again.

253
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:40,835
-If players with two losses
are matched against each other,

254
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:43,207
then one of them
will be eliminated!

255
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,245
All right, then let us begin!

256
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:58,240
-That move he just made
seems to be a good one,

257
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:01,214
but it's a big mistake!

258
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:03,686
Now if Hikaru sees
it, he can take

259
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,723
full advantage of the board!

260
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:06,292
-Huh?

261
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:15,780
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: One more
move, and it's all over!

262
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:18,485
-Aw!

263
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,191
I resign.

264
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,530
-Yes!

265
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:25,635
-What did I tell you?

266
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:27,639
If you'd played like
that from the start

267
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:29,242
you wouldn't be
in this mess now!

268
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,648
But no, you let that
bearded man intimidate you--

269
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:32,516
-Enough already!

270
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:35,290
-Sometimes you make me so mad!

271
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:39,633
-I see Fuku won his game, and
now we're both two and two!

272
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:42,740
ASUMI: Could you mark
my game down for me?

273
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:43,441
-Great!

274
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,777
You won, too?

275
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,514
-The other guy resigned.

276
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:48,184
I'm so relieved!

277
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:51,191
-You, me, and Fuku,
all at two games each!

278
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:54,432
-We might end up playing
each other tomorrow.

279
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,871
There are not that many
people left anymore.

280
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:58,809
OK, I'm going to go
watch the other matches!

281
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:03,953
-Just one more day
of the prelims.

282
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:12,873
And tomorrow is
gonna be another win!

283
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:30,412
Just two boards left, and
everything to play for!

284
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:32,484
Uh, hey.

285
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:33,285
-Hi, Shindou!

286
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:37,896
-How's it going?

287
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:38,530
-Good!

288
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:39,633
How are you?

289
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,035
INSTRUCTOR: Looks
like everyone's here!

290
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,624
-Five of of us left in the race!

291
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:53,898
And only two of us will make it!

292
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,338
INSTRUCTOR: Let's start the
draw to see who plays who.

293
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:59,677
Now I see that Fukui
and Shindou have already

294
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,482
played each other
on the first day.

295
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:03,753
What about everyone else here?

296
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:05,691
Have any of you
played each other?

297
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,461
In that case, if
Fukui and Shindou

298
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:08,898
are paired up
against each other,

299
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:11,838
they'll have to draw
for another opponent.

300
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:13,341
Everyone please come forward.

301
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:23,931
-I got table B!

302
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,301
-I got B as well.

303
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,537
-Your name, please.

304
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,007
-It's Hirabayashi.

305
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,414
INSTRUCTOR: So, Fukui
versus Hirabayashi.

306
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:35,624
-Table A.

307
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:36,960
-She is playing me!

308
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,334
INSTRUCTOR: OK, Nase
verses Matsura--

309
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:43,375
which means you advance to the
finals with a bye, Shindou!

310
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:44,110
-What?

311
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,412
A bye?

312
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:47,350
Woo-hoo!

313
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:50,089
Through to the finals, and
I didn't even have to play!

314
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:52,395
Just how lucky can you get!

315
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:53,363
-It's not lucky!

316
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:54,967
If anything, it's the opposite!

317
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:58,943
You need to play as many games
as you possibly can, Hikaru!

318
00:17:58,976 --> 00:17:59,945
HIKARU (MEEKLY): Really?

319
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,481
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI:
Don't forget, you

320
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,085
might have to face
the bearded man again!

321
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:04,722
-I got a whole
month before I have

322
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:07,127
to worry about playing
him in the finals!

323
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,698
I'll train extra hard!

324
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:10,535
-And how are you
going to do that?

325
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:11,604
-I don't know yet.

326
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:13,141
I'll worry about that later!

327
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,747
-Hikaru, you need to think
about it here and now!

328
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,753
-Get off my back and
stop bugging me, willya?

329
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:20,458
I nearly forgot!

330
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:22,628
It's Morishita-sensei's
study session tonight!

331
00:18:22,662 --> 00:18:24,366
That'd be a great
place to practice!

332
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:26,069
I haven't got time to
go all the way home

333
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:27,807
and then come back again.

334
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,544
Want to kill some
time with a game of Go

335
00:18:29,578 --> 00:18:31,048
on this little
magnetic travel board?

336
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,017
-Oh, yes!

337
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:32,985
Yes, yes, yes!

338
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:42,540
-If Shindou and the
others survived yesterday,

339
00:18:42,573 --> 00:18:46,516
they'll be here playing their
final matches right now.

340
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:48,420
But he could've been
eliminated yesterday.

341
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:52,429
And I bet he wouldn't
be in the mood

342
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:53,631
to come to a study session.

343
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,733
There's Fuku and Nase
playing, but where's Shindou?

344
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:10,769
Is he out already?

345
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:14,845
Buh?

346
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:15,446
Shindou?

347
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:20,624
You nicknamed him "Gorilla Man"?

348
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:22,996
And it's because of him you
lost the first two games?

349
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,566
-Well, yeah.

350
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,568
-Whatever.

351
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:26,671
You made it through
to the finals

352
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:29,177
now, even if it was with
a bye in the last round.

353
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,514
I'm surprised, though.

354
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:31,949
The way you've been
playing recently I

355
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:34,054
thought you'd get through
with three straight wins.

356
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:35,558
I guess I didn't
take into account

357
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,562
the effect Gorilla
Man would have on you.

358
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:40,636
-Yeah, but it's not like I
wanted him to intimidate me.

359
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:41,838
-I got it!

360
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:44,210
Next time Isumi and
me visit a Go salon,

361
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:45,813
you're coming with us!

362
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:46,850
A Go salon?

363
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,052
-Yeah!

364
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:49,856
So you can play against
other guys like Gorilla Man!

365
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,729
That way he won't bother you
once we get to the finals.

366
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:55,068
The other guys should have
finished their matches by now.

367
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:56,137
Let's go see how they did.

368
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:01,816
ASUMI: Oh, hi Mom!

369
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:03,787
It's me.

370
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,729
Mm-hmm, it just finished.

371
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:10,669
Yeah, I won!

372
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:11,771
-Hear that?

373
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:12,908
ASUMI: Thanks, Mom!

374
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:13,743
OK, bye!

375
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:16,148
-Oh, hi there, Waya.

376
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,921
-So, how'd it go?

377
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:20,157
-I won!

378
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:21,660
-All right!

379
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:22,830
-Way to go!

380
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:24,634
All three of you made it
through the preliminaries!

381
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:30,914
I gotta say you guys had me
worried there for awhile.

382
00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:32,117
HIKARU: It was no big deal!

383
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,857
I knew we were all
going to make it, right?

384
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,959
-Right!

385
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:37,629
-No big deal, are
you sure about that?

386
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:38,899
(MOCKINGLY) Where's Gorilla Man?

387
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:39,768
Where's Gorilla Man?

388
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:40,836
Where's Gorilla Man!

389
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,175
Didn't sound like
"no big deal" to me.

390
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,181
-Why'd you have to go
and tell them that for?

391
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:47,785
Oh, c'mere!

392
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:48,754
Gah!

393
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:52,662
-Ah, well done, Hikaru.

394
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:57,039
I'm glad you found
the way to win.

395
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:58,843
[theme music]

396
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:28,276
HIKARU: So the guys are going to
take me to play in a Go salon!

397
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:30,981
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: The opponents
there don't seem very friendly!

398
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:33,086
HIKARU: The three of us
are playing as a team!

399
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,759
Kinda reminds me of back
when I was in the Go club.

400
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,329
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: But
just look at how much

401
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:38,389
you've improved since then!

402
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:39,323
HIKARU: You know what?

403
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:41,225
Coming here was a great idea!

404
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:43,694
Gorilla Man's got
nothing on these guys!

405
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:45,529
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI:
That's the spirit!

406
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:47,798
HIKARU: Next time,
"We're a Team"!

407
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:49,433
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI:
Being part of a team

408
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:52,903
should give you all the
strength you need, Hikaru.
