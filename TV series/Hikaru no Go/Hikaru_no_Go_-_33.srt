00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:54,563
-I resign.

3
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,438
FUKUI: 50 points for me.

4
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:03,939
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): 59 for me.

5
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:07,410
I won!

6
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,978
Thanks for the game, Fukui.

7
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:10,179
-Thanks for the game.

8
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:28,531
-Aw.

9
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:29,932
I resign.

10
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:31,600
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Yes.

11
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:34,670
-If Shindou and the
others survived yesterday,

12
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:37,573
they'll be here playing their
final matches right now.

13
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:39,542
-What?

14
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:40,417
[inaudible]?

15
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:49,852
-You can't be serious.

16
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:51,554
You mean to tell me
you've never played

17
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,889
against adults in a Go salon.

18
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,825
-Not really.

19
00:02:55,858 --> 00:03:00,996
I mean, I've been to a Go
salon, but I kinda just watched.

20
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,732
Sai was the one who
actually did the playing.

21
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,103
-What was that?

22
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,571
-What about this place?

23
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:11,407
It looks pretty big.

24
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:12,675
-Get ready.

25
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,844
There's gonna be a lot of
cigarette smoke in this place.

26
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:16,011
-OK.

27
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:18,414
Isumi, aren't you supposed
to be in a Go class now?

28
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:20,082
-You mean the Nine Stars club?

29
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:21,450
They gave us the day off today.

30
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:26,956
-OK, guys.

31
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,457
There's three of us.

32
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,559
If we each play on our own,
it's gonna be kind of boring.

33
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:31,627
-What do you mean boring?

34
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:40,503
-There's three of you?

35
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:41,403
-Yeah.

36
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:42,571
-That's right.

37
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,073
Who are the strongest
players you've got in here?

38
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:46,742
Because whoever they are,
we want to play them!

39
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,878
-If there's one thing I
hate worse than bratty kids,

40
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,746
it's bratty kids
who are all talk.

41
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:52,548
MAN: They're all
talk until they play.

42
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:53,616
Huh?

43
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,084
-If you want, I'm
happy to take you on.

44
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:56,051
You want strong?

45
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:58,120
Well, you're not
gonna be disappointed.

46
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,588
-Hey, that's great.

47
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:01,957
But let's wait until we've
got three opponents lined up.

48
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,059
-What do you want three
of them for, Waya?

49
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:06,162
-Then it'll be like
a team competition.

50
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:07,663
You know, us against them.

51
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:08,831
-Team competition?

52
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:11,567
-It'll be way more fun
than us playing separately.

53
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,802
Isumi, you can be
our team captain.

54
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,804
I'll be number two, and Shindou.

55
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,139
you're number three.

56
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,040
-Yeah!

57
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:19,108
This is gonna be totally cool!

58
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,142
-Course it is.

59
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,044
Just make sure you
don't lose, Shindou.

60
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:23,078
-Hm.

61
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,614
Who do these kids
think they are anyway?

62
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:27,383
MAN: A team competition, huh?

63
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:28,717
Great idea!

64
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,585
-What?

65
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:30,953
-I'll be part of the team.

66
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:31,954
-Fine by me.

67
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:33,389
-And that makes two of you.

68
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:34,490
-And tell you what.

69
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,659
If you boys win, I'll
wave your table fees.

70
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,117
-What?

71
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:38,027
-All right!

72
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,795
-Well, OK, but if
you lose, you're

73
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:41,797
gonna clean every single
stone in the salon

74
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,831
until it shines, got it?

75
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,934
And what's more, you
pay for your tables.

76
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:45,801
-OK.

77
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,403
-You can count me in, boss.

78
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:49,939
I wanna see these bratty
kids washing stones.

79
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:50,906
-All right.

80
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,641
Now we've got three
against three.

81
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,176
-This table OK with everyone?

82
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,110
-Sure.

83
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:56,745
Soga, want to be
our team captain?

84
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,948
-Oh, no, that
should be you, boss.

85
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:00,082
-What's going on?

86
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:01,450
-Something's about to start.

87
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:06,088
-Ready?

88
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:07,456
Let's choose for color.

89
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:08,031
-OK.

90
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:18,033
-Four, and that's five.

91
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,735
Looks like I'm going
to be starting.

92
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:20,903
MAN: Yep.

93
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:24,640
-Soga, you play white, and
Domoto, you play black.

94
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,609
-You mean we don't get
to choose our own color?

95
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:28,544
The team captain just tells us?

96
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:29,778
I never knew that.

97
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:33,549
Guess I never played
on a team before.

98
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:34,917
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
It's been awhile

99
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,952
since I've been in
a team competition.

100
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:40,656
I always seem to be number
three, in the Go club

101
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:41,156
and now here.

102
00:05:44,026 --> 00:05:45,594
-Onegai shimasu.

103
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:46,128
-Onegai shimasu.

104
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:12,788
-A bunch of school kids waltzing
in here all high and mighty.

105
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,456
I bet they just play for fun.

106
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,158
Except one of them
looks a bit older,

107
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:18,794
so maybe he takes Go classes.

108
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:20,696
They need to be taught a lesson.

109
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:39,715
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I can do this.

110
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:42,951
If I just play my usual
game, I can beat this guy.

111
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,954
I may be our number three, but
I'm gonna start with a win!

112
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:50,793
-I resign.

113
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,065
-I guess I resign.

114
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,671
-I resign too.

115
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:04,139
-Even the boss resigned?

116
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,809
-And once he beat a pro
with a two stone handicap.

117
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,010
-Who are you guys anyway?

118
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,712
-That was pretty
good as a warm up.

119
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,113
Now let's start the real match.

120
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:12,648
-The real match?

121
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,983
-My friend here, he's never
played grownups in a Go salon

122
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,052
before, so I wanted to
let him get the hang of it

123
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:19,488
by playing an even match first.

124
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:23,058
So, now we'll give you
two stone handicap.

125
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:24,526
-Two stones?

126
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,995
-Same as before, if we win,
we play for free, if we lose,

127
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,464
we wash all the stones.

128
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:29,998
-You mean you were
planning to give them

129
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,067
a two stone handicap
from the start?

130
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:35,137
-You bet I. We are
Insei after all.

131
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,804
-What?

132
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:36,805
-You're Insei?

133
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:37,539
-Huh?

134
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:38,841
Did he just say Insei?

135
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:40,542
-Uh, that changes everything.

136
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:42,745
These guys are way
out of my league.

137
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:44,947
Hey, have you seen Kawai around?

138
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:46,548
-Nope, I don't know where he is.

139
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,052
-Onegai shimasu.

140
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:50,786
-Onegai shimasu.

141
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,388
[groaning]

142
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:52,921
-Onegai shimasu.

143
00:07:55,657 --> 00:08:00,562
[humming]

144
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:01,830
-Wait! Whoa.

145
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,399
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

146
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:05,501
Ah, just made it.

147
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:07,102
Sure is hot out there today.

148
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:10,406
-For a cab driver, you seem
to get a lot of time off.

149
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,776
Didn't I see you in
here yesterday as well?

150
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:15,644
-So I slack off more than most.

151
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:16,678
Who cares?

152
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:18,580
Hey, did you hear
the news about Ogata?

153
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:20,582
-The guy in the
Honinbo title match?

154
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:24,553
-Yeah, in the end, he
couldn't beat Kuwabara.

155
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:25,654
-I'm not surprised.

156
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:27,423
Kuwabara's a tough champion.

157
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,724
-But you know what?

158
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:32,094
It's not gonna to be long before
Ogata wins himself a title.

159
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:35,564
He's got himself a lot
of momentum going, right?

160
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:36,712
-Huh?

161
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:40,502
What's this?

162
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:41,904
What's going on here?

163
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:43,071
-Hi there, Kawai.

164
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,673
-A bunch of Insei are playing.

165
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:46,041
-Those kids are Insei?

166
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:48,744
-That's 40 there, 50, to 51.

167
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:49,511
Yes!

168
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:52,080
I win by three points!

169
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,149
-I won and Shindou won.

170
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:54,983
-Yeah!

171
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,518
That means we don't have to pay!

172
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:58,120
-What does he mean
they don't have to pay?

173
00:08:58,153 --> 00:09:00,022
What kinda scam are these
kids trying to pull?

174
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,124
MAN: I resign.

175
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:03,692
-Isumi won his game, too!

176
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:05,160
That's three out of three.

177
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:06,795
-All right, then.

178
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,897
That's a start.

179
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,532
Now we're all warmed up.

180
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:12,734
Let's try with a
three stone handicap.

181
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,102
-Uh, but Waya--

182
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,537
-Not so fast.

183
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,739
Giving them a three stone
advantage is gonna be tough.

184
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,675
Watch out you don't
underestimate these guys.

185
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,677
You know, they're all
pretty solid players.

186
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,579
-I'm not underestimating them!

187
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:25,481
The pro exam is right
around the corner.

188
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:27,082
We need to get some
practice like this

189
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:29,751
if we want to stand a
chance of making it through.

190
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:30,819
-Yeah, we can do it.

191
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:32,488
We can beat a bunch
of guys in a Go salon

192
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:34,389
by three stones no problem!

193
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:36,124
-Who does that kid think he is?

194
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,161
So, we're not good
enough for you, are we?

195
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:41,597
Take that, you little punk.

196
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,665
-Why don't you take
over for me, Kawai?

197
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:46,869
You're a much better
player than I am.

198
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:48,403
-Let's do it.

199
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,606
You still think you can
beat me three stones up?

200
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,675
-Yeah, let's get started!

201
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:56,578
-You do realize what'll
happen if we lose, don't you?

202
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:58,480
We'll have to pay for
the table and then

203
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,082
we'll have to wash
all the stone.

204
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:02,017
-Number three, you gotta win.

205
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,618
-OK.

206
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,683
-Onegai shimasu.

207
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,741
-Hmph.

208
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:28,009
A three stone handicap
for Mr. Kawai?

209
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,143
Those kids must be crazy.

210
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,094
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Giving
him a three stone handicap

211
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:24,032
means I can't play
my usual game.

212
00:11:24,065 --> 00:11:26,401
I've gotta think up some new
tactics if I'm going to win.

213
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:33,141
-(VOICEOVER) Me playing
with a handicap?

214
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:35,376
I can't remember the
last time I did that.

215
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:18,486
Oh!

216
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,388
Didn't expect that.

217
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:21,856
-Interesting.

218
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,992
This is a good place
for Hikaru to learn.

219
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,960
I've been his main
opponent for so long now,

220
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:27,362
but against all
these other players,

221
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,464
his game will gain new strength.

222
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:32,367
In the game of Go, a mere half
point lead over your opponent

223
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,868
is all it takes to win.

224
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:35,269
When the match is
even, both players

225
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:36,804
start the game as equals.

226
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:39,007
Once you have the slightest
lead, all you have to do

227
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,008
is protect it.

228
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,976
But giving a handicap
to an opponent

229
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,147
can be the equivalent of losing
20 to 30 points of territory.

230
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,883
In that case, your game
must rise to a new level

231
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,351
to steal that territory back.

232
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:54,789
There's no choice.

233
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:56,057
You have to go on the offensive.

234
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,863
Once you've developed
that ability,

235
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,865
it can be used during
an even match when

236
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:05,333
you need to make a comeback.

237
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,149
-Here, these are on me.

238
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:21,716
-Really?

239
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:22,483
Thanks.

240
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:23,351
There you go.

241
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:26,087
-Thank you.

242
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,122
-To think that I lost with
a three stone handicap.

243
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:29,857
You're something else, kid.

244
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,859
-We were defeated quite easily.

245
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,128
We look forward to seeing
you guys on the pro circuit

246
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:34,962
someday.

247
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:36,898
-Yeah, best of luck to you.

248
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:37,365
-Thanks.

249
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:38,066
Appreciate it.

250
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,272
Shindou, you showed a
lot of guts back there.

251
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:45,473
-Well--

252
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,875
-Hey, Waya, things only
turned out OK 'cause Shindou

253
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,377
and I managed to win our games.

254
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,845
How come you lost yours?

255
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:52,513
-Well, the old guy was good.

256
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:54,348
He was a really tough opponent.

257
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:57,218
-Remember next time, we could've
spent the night washing stones,

258
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:58,853
and that wouldn't
have been much fun.

259
00:13:58,853 --> 00:13:59,787
-Yeah, yeah, I know.

260
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,756
But we didn't have to, did we?

261
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:03,424
-I had a really great
time in there tonight.

262
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,258
Thanks, guys.

263
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:08,396
Can we do it again tomorrow?

264
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:08,996
Waya?

265
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,098
Isumi?

266
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:12,200
WAYA: I gotta go for
my study session.

267
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,935
ISUMI: And I've got
the Nine Stars club.

268
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:15,736
But we could do it next week

269
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:16,471
-Sounds good to me.

270
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:17,738
I'll see you guys then.

271
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:19,273
-See you later!

272
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:21,375
-It looks like your idea
of making Shindou get over

273
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:24,278
his fear of playing
adults has worked.

274
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:27,081
Plus he's having a lot of fun
being part of a team again.

275
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,015
-See?

276
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:31,719
Didn't I tell you it would work?

277
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:34,088
I think we should try
someplace else next week.

278
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:36,724
Maybe we can have
ourselves even more fun.

279
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:37,978
ISUMI: Oh, Waya.

280
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:50,938
-What?

281
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:52,140
You mean you've been
back to that Go salon

282
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:54,175
every day since we
were there last week?

283
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,343
-Mm-hm.

284
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,079
-Oh, so that's why you
skipped our study session.

285
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:00,014
-I wasn't really
skipping the session

286
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:01,849
I just kind of forgot about it.

287
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:02,316
-Whatever.

288
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,484
So how was it?

289
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:04,252
-You know what?

290
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:05,386
It was totally awesome.

291
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,388
All the guys wanted to play me.

292
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:08,923
-I want to play him next.

293
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:11,192
-I heard even you
lost to him, Kawai.

294
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:13,728
-The kid caught me
off guard last time.

295
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:14,996
-Tell me about it.

296
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:15,963
-Don't worry.

297
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:17,031
This time it's going
to be different.

298
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:18,132
-I want a game, too.

299
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,234
-You played him yesterday,
so wait your turn.

300
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:22,737
HIKARU: The owner of the Go
salon's a really cool guy.

301
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:24,505
-I'm gonna waive your
fee for the table.

302
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:25,740
-What?

303
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:27,875
-So many of these
guys want to play you.

304
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,410
-The kid's good
for business, huh?

305
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:30,378
Is that it?

306
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:31,946
If that's the
case, I'm surprised

307
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:33,981
you haven't started
charging us to play him.

308
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:36,317
-Remember, he's not here
to play any teaching games.

309
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,818
Maximum handicap is four stones.

310
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:41,122
I won't allow him to play
anyone who can't match that.

311
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:42,056
You've got that, Nimi?

312
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,094
-I'll play a two stone handicap.

313
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,196
MAN: All right, Soga.

314
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:50,765
But you can't smoke when
you're playing the kid.

315
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:51,732
-OK.

316
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:52,266
-Onegai shimasu.

317
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:01,509
-Whoa.

318
00:16:01,742 --> 00:16:03,044
You've been busy.

319
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:05,413
-Don't suppose you guys want to
play as a team again, do you?

320
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:06,747
-Sure.

321
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:08,082
But we'll need to find
three opponent first.

322
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:09,150
-Let's see.

323
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:11,719
There's a big Go salon
around here somewhere.

324
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,420
Ah-ha.

325
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:14,055
There it is.

326
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:16,190
-Why don't we make things
a little more interesting?

327
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:17,725
Whoever loses his
match will have

328
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:19,126
to treat the others
to some sushi.

329
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,860
-Ramen!

330
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:21,162
Let's make it ramen.

331
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:22,997
-Hey, what are you
two talking about?

332
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:24,465
-We just decided
that whoever loses

333
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:26,133
has to buy the other sushi.

334
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:26,968
-Not sushi.

335
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:27,835
Ramen!

336
00:16:27,868 --> 00:16:29,270
-This is just between us, right?

337
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,871
We don't have to
buy it for everyone?

338
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:31,372
-Yep.

339
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,139
That's right.

340
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:33,374
And it's sushi, not ramen.

341
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,176
-We should let
the winner decide.

342
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:36,177
How's that sound?

343
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,311
-Just wait a minute!

344
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:39,046
Whoever's captain is
at a disadvantage,

345
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,815
because he plays their
strongest player.

346
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:43,084
We got to choose for captain,
or else it won't be fair.

347
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,118
-All right.

348
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,153
We'll decide with
rock, paper, scissors.

349
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:46,921
-Great.

350
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:48,122
Rock, paper, scissors.

351
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:53,761
-Welcome, come in.

352
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:54,862
For three?

353
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:56,163
-Yeah.

354
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:59,066
We want to play against the
strongest players you've got.

355
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,201
-You're very competent.

356
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:02,136
If you could just
write your names here.

357
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:03,170
-Here's the deal.

358
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:05,239
If two of us lose,
we'll stay and wash

359
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:06,907
all the stones in the salon.

360
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:11,879
But if we all win, we want you
to waive the table fees for us.

361
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:13,347
-A team competition, huh?

362
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:16,317
-We'll let you have a
three stone handicap.

363
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,918
-Three stone handicap?

364
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,086
Who are you?

365
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,087
-Oh, we're Insei.

366
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,989
-He's our team captain,
so match him up

367
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,491
with your strongest player.

368
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:27,862
I'm number three on the team,
and he's our number two.

369
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:29,163
-Three stoned again.

370
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:29,897
-Insei?

371
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,766
-Did you say Insei?

372
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,267
-A team competition?

373
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,770
Then I'm going to be our
team captain, of course.

374
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:36,737
MAN: You, captain?

375
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:38,005
Come on.

376
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,107
I'm way better than you.

377
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:41,375
-Get real, Tsuchiya.

378
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:42,943
You're a number two at best.

379
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,245
-How dare you!

380
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:45,880
-Let me take a shot at it.

381
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:47,315
-I want to play, too!

382
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:48,983
-Funabashi, I beat
you yesterday.

383
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:50,351
Sit down and shut up.

384
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:51,385
-What about me?

385
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:52,820
I've got as much right
to play as anyone.

386
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:54,455
-We don't care who we play.

387
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:55,756
-Doesn't matter to us.

388
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,457
-What are you doing?

389
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,858
Stop talking like that.

390
00:17:57,892 --> 00:17:59,126
-You hear that?

391
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,995
They think 'cause they're
Insei, they're too good for us

392
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,164
-They said they'd wash the
stones if they lose, right?

393
00:18:03,197 --> 00:18:04,999
-We'll make 'em
wash 'em, all right.

394
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,201
MAN: Everyone, calm down.

395
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:09,003
You better keep
your promise, kid.

396
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:11,498
WAYA: Sure
MAN: What?

397
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:12,057
ISUMI: Waya.

398
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:17,011
-Onegai shimasu.

00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,979
-Onegai shimasu.

400
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:22,283
-I'm not going to lose today.

401
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:23,050
-Me, neither.

-Oh!

405
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,100
-We did it!

406
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,501
We won all three games!

407
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:49,837
Yeah!

408
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,905
-Huh?

409
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:53,808
If we all won, then
who's buying the ramen?

410
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:56,277
-As we didn't have to pay any
table fees, I'll treat you.

411
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:57,011
-Thanks, Isumi!

412
00:19:57,011 --> 00:19:57,745
Sushi!

413
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:58,746
We want to have sushi!

414
00:19:58,746 --> 00:19:59,280
-Ramen!

415
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,748
It has to be ramen!

416
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:02,883
-I was team captain, so
I'm deciding on sushi!

417
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,952
-I don't care if you were
team captain or not--

418
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:06,787
-OK, let's use Rock,
Paper, Scissors again!

419
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:15,196
-Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

420
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:16,430
I wanted to have that tuna.

421
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:19,133
-There's more, so
quite complaining.

422
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,301
-Hmph.

423
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,870
Anyway, I thought you said
you didn't like sushi.

424
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,838
-I never said that.

425
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:25,139
I said I wanted ramen!

426
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,874
WAYA: You should
stick to the pudding.

427
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:27,975
HIKARU: Yeah?

428
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:31,078
Then you should stick
to the pickled ginger.

429
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:34,081
-Hey, that was my squid!

430
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:38,352
I'm not gonna let you get
any of this squid or tuna.

431
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:40,020
Chef, some tuna over here!

432
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:41,322
CHEF: Sure.

433
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:44,124
HIKARU: You sneaky--
More tuna for me too!

434
00:20:44,124 --> 00:20:45,092
CHEF: Yes, sir.

435
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,160
WAYA: And then some
of your shrimp.

436
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:46,994
CHEF: Coming up.

437
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:47,728
HIKARU: I want some eel next.

CHEF: Yes, sir

439
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:49,430

I want some abaloney!

CHEF: You betcha.

441
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:51,365
HIKARU: More tuna!

442
00:20:51,398 --> 00:20:52,399
-That's enough!

443
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:53,834
I'm gonna have to pay
for all this food!

HIKARU: Akira's playing
four games simultaneously?

446
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:27,127
SAI: Yes, but he's been asked
to lose to the city councilor.

447
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:28,862
HIKARU: Why is
Ashiwara so upset?

448
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:30,831
It's got nothing to do with him.

449
00:22:30,864 --> 00:22:32,967
SAI: He just hates seeing
people waste their talents

450
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,069
on games that don't
really matter.

SAI: It's not difficult to lose.

454
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,012
What's difficult
is to make it look

455
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:47,147
as though your opponent won.
