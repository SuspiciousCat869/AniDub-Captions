00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,608
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,644
a spirit from the past,
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai,

3
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:13,514
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindo.

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:17,551
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the divine move.

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,520
[theme music]

6
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,045
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): This guy
sure takes a long time to play.

7
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,046
-Hm.

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,147
I resign.

9
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,682
[sigh]

10
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:59,519
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I won.

11
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,388
This is much easier.

12
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,023
I remember sensei
being impressed

13
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,092
with how I played
three games at once.

14
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,161
Maybe I play better this fast.

15
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,129
-Whoa.

16
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,397
I won by half a point.

17
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,032
That's two wins in a row now.

18
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,367
-No need to rub it in.

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,167
-Oh.

20
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,104
Sorry.

21
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,472
-I resign.

22
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,740
-Huh?

23
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,708
-You did it, Hikaru.

24
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,144
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): That's
three straight wins.

25
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,345
[laughter]

26
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,680
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
It was great.

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,416
I thought I was on my way.

28
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,519
But then, I lost game
after game and started

29
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,988
to wonder if I was
getting worse, not better.

30
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,289
It was pretty depressing.

31
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,359
-He set himself a difficult goal
and he managed to achieve it.

32
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,161
Why can't you be happy for him?

33
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,096
-I don't do that sort of thing.

34
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,232
-So when does the Young
Lions tournament take place?

35
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,333
Do you Toya--

36
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,402
-Do you ever think about
anything else but Toya?

37
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,137
It's starting to get annoying.

38
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,505
-The tournament
starts next month.

39
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,241
It takes place on Saturdays when
there aren't any insei classes.

40
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,076
-It doesn't just happen one day.

41
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,111
Because there's 16
pros and 16 insei,

42
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,180
that's a lot of matches
that have to be played.

43
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,316
-All the first round matches
are the insei versus the pros.

44
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,618
Without a handicap, of course.

45
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,687
-It's awesome you got
that far against the pros.

46
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,721
OCHI: No, It's not.

47
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,022
-Huh?

48
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,691
-You've got to be able
to beat some of them

49
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,426
if you want to
pass the pro exam.

50
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,695
The Young Lions is a good
way to see if you're ready.

51
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,549
-Which of the insei
aren't here yet?

52
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,750
-Uh-- let's see.

53
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,285
There's Nozaki, Shindo--

54
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,052
-No, wait.

55
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,253
Shindo's just arrived.

56
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:40,728
Hey.

57
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:41,388
You're late.

58
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,023
-Hey there, Waya.

59
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,691
I can't believe I'm here.

60
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,159
This is so great.

61
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,562
-Calm down, before you
start embarrassing yourself.

62
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,163
-Where's everyone else?

63
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:50,630
Huh?

64
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,998
The other insei?

65
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,967
I thought only the top
16 were going to be here.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,668
-We're here to watch.

67
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,136
You have a problem with that?

68
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,571
-Now we're not going
to cheer for you.

69
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,138
-Sorry.

70
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,106
Sorry.

71
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,174
I'm really, really,
really sorry.

72
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,509
Where are all the pros?

73
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,010
-Gyah.

74
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,245
WAYA: They're over there.

75
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,513
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): That's them?

76
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,515
They don't look like pros.

77
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,717
ISUMI: Just because they're
not wearing suits and ties

78
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,486
doesn't mean they're
not professional.

79
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,588
The Young Lions is a
pretty laid back event.

80
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,425
-Hey, guys.

81
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,527
Long time no see.

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,529
-Aw, just our luck.

83
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,331
It's Mashiba.

84
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,032
-Hm.

85
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,401
-I sure hope you've
all been studying hard.

86
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,536
-Who's he?

87
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,671
-He's one of the insei
who turned pro last year.

88
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,008
-I just came to wish
you luck, Isumi.

89
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,511
You'll go easy on me, won't you?

90
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,179
-Isumi's going to
be playing him?

91
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,280
-Yup.

92
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,349
They've been drawn to
play in the first round.

93
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,550
-Oh.

94
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,087
And Isumi, I highly recommend
making the move to pro.

95
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,556
Once you've passed the test,
all the pressure's gone

96
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:54,027
and you can just sit back
relax and play your game.

97
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,163
Of course, I wouldn't
expect you to understand

98
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:59,032
how it feels, because you
keep failing your test.

99
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,334
But believe me, it's great.

100
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,538
See you at the game.

101
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,739
-What a loser.

102
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,474
-What is his problem?

103
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,277
-He's been like that ever
since he became a pro.

104
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,278
-He makes me mad.

105
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,687
-OK.

106
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,689
I'm totally going to make
it through this first round.

107
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,524
SAYAKI: Waya, Shindo.

108
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,158
-Hi.

109
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,426
Mr. Sayaki.

110
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,994
-I'm so glad none
of us are playing

111
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,429
each other in the first round.

112
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,732
As fellow students of Morishita,
we need to stick together.

113
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,501
Best of luck there, Shindo.

114
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,602
Hope you beat Toya.

115
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,203
-Thanks.

116
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,140
-Later.

117
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,008
-Hm.

118
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,676
Where is Toya?

119
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,550
Can't see him.

120
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,618
I wonder where he could be.

121
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,563
-Good morning, everyone.

122
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,698
-Good morning, Toya.

123
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,532
-Good morning.

124
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,633
-Hm.

125
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,534
-Hm?

126
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,101
-Huh?

127
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,076
-Well, it looks like you're
not the only one who's

128
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,410
focused on Toya.

129
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,313
No one could care less
about us insei anymore.

130
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,682
-Especially your
opponent, Mr. Murakami.

131
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,684
If he beats you in
the first round,

132
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,354
he'll go on to play
Toya in the second.

133
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,556
-Do you know this Murakami guy?

134
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,357
Where is he?

135
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,992
What does he look like?

136
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:32,626
-Over there.

137
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,660
-Huh?

138
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,328
-The one with the
glasses and his hair

139
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,530
parted down the middle.

140
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,699
-Hey.

141
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,234
Hey, Shindo.

142
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,004
You're not going to play
well if you don't calm down.

143
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:47,540
See how you're clenching
your your fists?

144
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,143
And look how much
you're sweating already.

145
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,678
You need to chill out a bit.

146
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,313
No one's expecting you to win.

147
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,216
You are the lowest
ranking insei here.

148
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,417
-Huh.

149
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,347
ANNOUNCER: If I could
have everyone's attention.

150
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,491
I'd like to take
this opportunity

151
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,395
to welcome you all to the ninth
annual Young Lions tournament.

152
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,732
The matches will begin shortly,
so please make your way

153
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,434
to your assigned seats now.

154
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:42,028
-There'll be no handicaps,
but the insei will play black.

155
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,397
I think that covers
everything, so when

156
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,366
you're ready, please begin.

157
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,067
-Onegaishimasu.

158
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,340
[chuckling]

159
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,141
-Look at you insei watching me.

160
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,509
You're making me nervous.

161
00:07:56,543 --> 00:08:00,113
[chuckling] I mean,
Isumi's only an insei amd

162
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,281
I'm one of the pros.

163
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:05,218
It'll look real bad if I
don't pull off a win here.

164
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:05,719
-Onegaishimasu.

165
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:26,897
-The big story at this
year's Young Lions

166
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:28,666
is going to be Akira Toya.

167
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,868
He's been undefeated
since his debut in April,

168
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:34,739
so everyone wants to see
how far he can progress.

169
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:35,339
Over there.

170
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:41,412
that's Ogata 9th Dan.

171
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:45,583
What on earth's he doing at
the Young Lions tournament?

172
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:48,319
He is a student of Toyota
Meijin's so maybe he's

173
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,888
here to keep an eye on the kid.

174
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,523
-Why would he do that?

175
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:53,824
-What do you mean?

176
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:56,927
-You said Akira Toya hasn't been
beaten since he became a pro.

177
00:08:56,961 --> 00:09:00,965
So why would Ogata be worried
about him playing the insei?

178
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:01,565
-Huh.

179
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:10,941
Hold on.

180
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,276
-Shot of Murakami?

181
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,910
-No.

182
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:14,812
That insei looks familiar.

183
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:16,280
Now where was it?

184
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:17,291
Yes.

185
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:17,965
Of course.

186
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:20,667
It was during
Shincho-dan series.

187
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,703
-How's Toya doing?

188
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,004
-Something else coming to watch?

189
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:33,947
The game's concluding, but it's
difficult to tell who'll win.

190
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:35,182
-Come on, Toya.

191
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:36,550
-Huh?

192
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,052
-He's been playing such
an awesome game up to now.

193
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:40,954
He can't let it end like this.

194
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:42,589
If he can just hang on.

195
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,257
I know he's got enough
strength inside of him

196
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,225
to win this match.

197
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:48,962
-I don't get it.

198
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:50,263
I don't understand
why Ogata would

199
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:53,200
be interested in that kid.

200
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:57,704
Is there something we
don't know about him?

201
00:09:57,704 --> 00:09:59,106
-Excuse me, but I
think you'll find

202
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,542
Akira Toy sitting over this way.

203
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,111
Just kidding.

204
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:07,781
It would appear Hikaru's the
one you're really interested in.

205
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:08,615
Yes.

206
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,917
I remember.

207
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:13,520
You were there when Hikaru
played that key move

208
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:14,621
In the Youth Go tournament.

209
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,023
You should have
played it one higher.

210
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:16,623
-Huh?

211
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,691
-Ah.

212
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:18,558
-Easy There.

213
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:19,926
Everybody, please calm down.

214
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,562
-Uh-- Ogata-sensei.

215
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:25,198
-You were also there when
Hikaru played a few moves

216
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:26,533
against Toya Meijin.

217
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:34,708
-Sa-- Sai?

218
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:43,183
-Both times they were my moves.

219
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:07,708
These days, the only games
I have are against Hikaru.

220
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,078
I enjoy them for what
they are, but sometimes I

221
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:13,947
wish I could play
against other opponents.

222
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,949
Opponents like you, Ogata.

223
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:19,986
What sort of strategies
would you use?

224
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,825
I've had so many games against
so many people in the past,

225
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,828
both as Fujiwara-no-Sai
and as the spirit

226
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:30,564
behind Honinbo-shusaku.

227
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,765
[chuckle]

228
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:33,567
That brings back
so many memories.

229
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:37,637
Dozens.

230
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:42,275
hundreds, even thousands
of different games.

231
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:45,078
I can remember every
single one of them.

232
00:11:55,655 --> 00:12:03,553
The cool touch of the stones in
my fingers -- a board's opened up.

233
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:07,668
Why don't you and I take a
seat and play a game together?

234
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:09,303
[murmuring]

235
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:20,080
But with no physical
body how can I play?

236
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:30,724
However, I must be thankful that
Hikaru and I were able to meet.

237
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:35,362
I couldn't have asked
for anything more.

238
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:39,333
So, what's your
opinion of Hikaru?

239
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:40,734
Watch him closely.

240
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,007
Because one day, he may
become a worthy rival

241
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,210
to any of the players in
this room, including you.

242
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:31,819
This opponent may be a pro,
but from when I can see,

243
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,355
he's not much better
than an insei.

244
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:37,257
Still, even if Hikaru
manages to beat him,

245
00:13:37,257 --> 00:13:42,096
I'm not sure how far he
could go in this tournament.

246
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,732
Given time, that could change.

247
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:47,134
And maybe it will happen
sooner than I thought.

248
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:53,307
-Hm.

249
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,242
-Huh?

250
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:56,176
Whoa!

251
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:57,887
Hikaru!

252
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,422
That was a terrible move.

253
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,424
You've got to
remember, he's young

254
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,026
and he still has
a long way to go.

255
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,861
You mustn't judge
him on this one game.

256
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:06,196
I know he can do
better than this.

257
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:07,363
You have to believe me.

258
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:09,465
I know, because I play
him every single day.

259
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:12,168
Hikaru is getting better and
better at reading the board.

260
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:15,071
And his strategies are
becoming more and more complex.

261
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,340
He really is improving
all the time.

262
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:20,610
[laughter] I know he can still
make the occasional mistake

263
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,111
like the one you saw just now.

264
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:23,279
But nobody's perfect.

265
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:25,582
We all make mistakes, right?

266
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:27,183
-Ah.

267
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:28,184
-What?

268
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:31,120
[gasp] Ah.

269
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:31,595
Oh.

270
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:43,499
Although he made a mistake,
he didn't let it throw him.

271
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:46,903
He drew his opponent
in and managed

272
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:49,038
to turn a bad move around.

273
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:50,656
Hikaru.

274
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,916
-Yes.

275
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:00,966
-Hm.

276
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,004
-See here?

277
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:23,573
I think you rushed yourself
into making that move.

278
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:24,207
-Yeah.

279
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,408
You're right.

280
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,910
-You have a tendency to
play fast without thinking.

281
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:29,979
Now, there's nothing
wrong with playing fast,

282
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,849
but sometimes you've got to
take time to think ahead.

283
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:33,516
-Well, well.

284
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:34,584
Looks like you've won.

285
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:35,952
Congratulations.

286
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:37,487
Offering some of your wisdom?

287
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,037
-Oh. Come on.

288
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,702
[laughter]

289
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:42,537
Thanks for the game.

290
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:45,741
I'm going to go and watch Toya.

291
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:47,609
That looks like Ogata 9th Dan.

292
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:48,844
What's he doing here?

293
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:52,481
And why's he watching them?

294
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:53,348
Whatever.

295
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:54,783
I'd still prefer to watch Toya.

296
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:58,286
-Uh-- I'll watch Isumi.

297
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:04,760
Excuse me.

298
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:05,360
Excuse me.

299
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,898
-How goes it?

300
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:11,466
-I lost.

301
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,235
-I wasn't asking about you.

302
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:14,469
I want to know about Isumi!

303
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:22,844
[groaning]

304
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,556
-I resign.

305
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:36,525
-Thank you very
much for the game.

306
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:38,360
You've gotten a
lot stronger, Waya.

307
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:40,529
Maybe this'll be the year
you pass the pro exam.

308
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,264
-I know I've gotten stronger.

309
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:43,899
It's been two years
since you were an insei.

310
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:45,767
When I found out
I was telling you,

311
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,369
I was sure I was going to win.

312
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:48,670
[laughter]

313
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:50,772
-What I really want to
do is see Toya in action.

314
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:51,373
Oh.

315
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:51,907
Good.

316
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:52,441
He's still playing.

317
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,776
See you.

318
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:58,914
-I know I didn't win, but for
a while it was real close.

319
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:01,183
I'll be a pro before long.

320
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:03,251
This is the year.

321
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:04,653
I wonder how Isumi's
getting along.

322
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:11,660
[groaning]

323
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,233
-Whoa.

324
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:18,867
Look at that.

325
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,268
-I know.

326
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:22,504
Isumi's pretty much in
charge of the game right now.

327
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:25,674
Mashiba did try a counterattack,
but Isumi fought him off,

328
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:27,509
and now look at him.

329
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:29,444
-Way to go, Isumi.

330
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:30,946
-Serves Mashiba right
for being a jerk.

331
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:40,756
-It's no good.

332
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:44,960
Even if I keep playing, I'll
never make up the difference now.

333
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:45,627
OK.

334
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,428
I resign.

335
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:47,395
-Thank you.

336
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:48,363
Good game.

337
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:50,232
-It hasn't finished
already, has it?

338
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:51,399
-It was a push over.

339
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:53,502
Toya didn't even look like
he was trying that hard.

340
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:56,738
-Maybe he was saving
strength for the next round.

341
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:58,540
-Yeah, but he doesn't
play full out,

342
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:00,642
how are we going to
find out how good he is?

343
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:12,921
[groaning]

344
00:18:12,954 --> 00:18:15,524
-I resign.

345
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:18,660
-Thank you very much.

346
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,396
-Isumi controlled the
board from the beginning.

347
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:21,863
-Yeah.

348
00:18:21,897 --> 00:18:22,831
I knew he'd win.

349
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:23,899
You know, I thought
Mashiba would

350
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:25,634
have put up a better
fight than this.

351
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:27,769
Makes you wonder if he's
really cut out to be a pro.

352
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:34,709
-Winning in a competition like
this doesn't mean anything.

353
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:36,378
Just like it
doesn't mean a thing

354
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:39,247
if you happen to be the top
insei for years and years,

355
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:41,650
and never actually
pass the pro exam.

356
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:42,617
-Hm.

357
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:43,652
-Wait a minute.

358
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,787
Isumi, aren't you one
of those top insei

359
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:47,255
who can't pass the test?

360
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:50,392
Who cares if you beat me now if
you can't win when it matters?

361
00:18:55,297 --> 00:18:56,298
-Waya!

362
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:57,165
[whimper]

363
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,266
-You're going to pay for that!

364
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,634
-What's going on here?

365
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:00,235
-Over there!

366
00:19:00,268 --> 00:19:01,369
-Waya!

00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:02,204
[whimpering]

368
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:02,838
WAYA: Take that!

369
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:03,905
MASHIBA: Stop, please. stop!

370
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:04,873
WAYA: And this!

371
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:06,374
-Is that Isumi and Waya?

372
00:19:06,408 --> 00:19:08,677
WAYA: You make me so mad!

373
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,578
See my fist!

374
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:16,351
[GATHERING AND DROPPING OF
STONES]

375
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:10,772
SAI (VOICEOVER): Toya has
come to watch the game.

376
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:12,941
It's unfortunate he missed
what happened earlier.

377
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,545
At least somebody
saw Hikaru's move

378
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:21,383
and appreciated it for what
it was-- a stroke of genius.

379
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,788
Although he wasn't here
when Hikaru actually

380
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:29,891
played the stone, I wonder
if Toya can work out

381
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:33,828
what happened simply by
looking at the board.

382
00:20:33,828 --> 00:20:34,763
Will he see the move?

383
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:43,738
[gasp]

384
00:20:43,772 --> 00:20:46,741
[theme music]

385
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:22,649
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I
feel like I've really

386
00:22:22,682 --> 00:22:24,651
improved since the
Young Lions tournament.

387
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:26,219
I want to play some more!

388
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:28,488
SAI (VOICEOVER): Even though
you didn't get to play him,

389
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,190
Toya hasn't forgotten about you.

390
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,392
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): There's
an awesome match coming up--

391
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:34,093
Mr. Ogata against
Kuwabara Honinbo.

392
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:35,428
SAI (VOICEOVER):
I wonder why he's

393
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:37,163
been taking such
an interest in you.

394
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:38,598
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
That's because he

395
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:41,534
knows he may have to challenge
me for a title before long.

396
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,325
Next time-- Kuwabara Honinbo.

397
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:46,711
SAI (VOICEOVER): Look, Hikaru.

398
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:47,345
There he is!

399
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,047
-That's him?
