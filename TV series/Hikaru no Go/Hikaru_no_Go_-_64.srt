2
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,713
-Hello, everyone.

3
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,281
Good to see you again.

4
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,248
Forgotten me already?

5
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,217
I'm Sai!

6
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,520
Today, we have a fantastic
bonus episode of "Hikaru No Go"

7
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,155
especially for you.

8
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,724
We're going to
travel back in time

9
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,226
and see Hikaru when he
was in seventh grade.

10
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,395
I know you're going to
enjoy watching this one.

11
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,029
What?

12
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:09,596
Will I be in it?

13
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,031
Of course I'll be in.

14
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:15,135
I'll be looking better than
ever because, after all, I

15
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:15,969
am the star.

16
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:16,536
Isn't that right?

17
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,273
I'm off now.

18
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,408
Hope you enjoy the show!

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,756
-It's not fair.

20
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,424
That teacher is
always picking on me.

21
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,025
-Hm.

22
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,159
Let me see.

23
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,627
Could that have something
to do with the fact

24
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,696
that you fell
asleep in his class?

25
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,564
-You did too.

26
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm supposed to be at the
Go club meeting right now,

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,969
but Tane's beat me
three times in a row,

28
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,637
so maybe I should
just skip it today.

29
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,505
-What?

30
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,006
You can't do that, Hikaru.

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,008
You told me you were
going to train extra hard

32
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,544
since Kaio beat your team three
to zero in the last school

33
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,312
tournament.

34
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,147
You have to go.

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,082
They're all waiting for you!

36
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,750
Tsutsui, Akari.

37
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,880
You can't let them down.

38
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,362
-Hmph.

39
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,122
Ah.

40
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:09,623
-Sorry about that.

41
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,691
-Don't apologize.

42
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,160
It's his own fault for
not paying attention.

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,428
-What do you mean it's my fault?

44
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,997
Don't blame me if you can't
hit the ball properly.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,998
You guys are so useless.

46
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,566
I'm in the Go club
and I bet you I

47
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,101
can hit a lot better than you.

48
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,369
-Oh, is that so?

49
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,538
See if you can hit
this one, then.

50
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,706
-OK.

51
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,541
Get ready, 'cause it's gonna
go right over the fence.

52
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,142
-Oh, this looks like fun.

53
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,411
What are you going to do
with that big stick, Hikaru?

54
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,512
-Are you ready?

55
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,515
This is how we pitch
the ball on this team!

56
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,550
-Look!

57
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,020
He's throwing the
ball straight at us.

58
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,121
That was amazing.

59
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,524
The ball landed straight
in that man's glove.

60
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,726
-Take you by surprise?

61
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,394
Go club doesn't belong here.

62
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,162
-Oh yeah?

63
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,430
Sai, get out of the way.

64
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,632
That was just strike one.

65
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,600
Come on.

66
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,406
All right!

67
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,678
-Hey, what kind
of throw was that?

68
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,014
-It looks like
it's gonna be foul.

69
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,584
[crashing]

70
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,160
-Uh oh.

71
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,565
-It's Kaga.

72
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,135
-He's not the sort
of guy you mess with.

73
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:31,071
-Oh man.

74
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,705
-You go.

75
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,372
-Yeah.

76
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,140
It's your fault.

77
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,641
Move it.

78
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,176
-Kaga.

79
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,144
How are you?

80
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,678
-You're the one
who hit the ball?

81
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,714
You got any idea of
what you've done?

82
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,182
Well?

83
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,351
HIKARU: Whoa.

84
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,020
Sorry, it's a bit of
a mess in here, huh?

85
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,588
Did I break all the trophies.

86
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,158
-I don't care
about the trophies.

87
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,627
What I care about is right here!

88
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,629
-That's just an ordinary teacup.

89
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,264
What's so special about it?

90
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,665
-This is not just any teacup!

91
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,168
This is my favorite
teacup, loser!

92
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,102
-OK, I hear you.

93
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,671
I'll buy you a new one tomorrow.

94
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,374
-And don't bring me junk,
or you're gonna regret it.

95
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,546
-Oh boy.

96
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,748
How on Earth am I supposed
to know what kind of teacup

97
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,283
Kaga wants?

98
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:20,754
And I've only got 200 yen left
of my allowance to spend on it.

99
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,621
-Hm?

100
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,223
Look Hikaru!

101
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,191
There's one!

102
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,026
-Where? Let me see.

103
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,093
It's OK.

104
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:27,661
What?

105
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,029
5,000 yen?

106
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,096
No way.

107
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,331
I can't afford that.

108
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,433
We gotta look somewhere else.

109
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,502
MAN: This is a
Keicho flower bowl?

110
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,404
-A Keicho flower bowl?

111
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,040
-Sai?

112
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,509
-Back in the early Edo
period of the Keicho era,

113
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,211
there was a famous
ceramic artist

114
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,179
by the name of San Gai Yaimon.

115
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:46,713
-Yes, yes.

116
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,248
I've heard of him.

117
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,216
-Oh.

118
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,483
What else do you know?

119
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,587
-Well, I know that flower bowls
were one of his specialties.

120
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,022
Isn't that why the
bowls made by Yaimon

121
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,024
are called Keicho flower bowls?

122
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:58,692
-My, my.

123
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,094
You seem to be well informed.

124
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,997
-Hey, uh, Sai.

125
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,632
-This is quite a rare find.

126
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,668
It's a charming piece
of superior quality.

127
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,537
MAN: You have a good eye, sir.

128
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,506
MAN: No, not really.

129
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,584
-Sai, what's wrong?

130
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:17,919
-These don't come on
the market very often.

131
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:18,753
Are you interested?

132
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:22,560
-Hikaru.

133
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,596
That bowl he has is fake.

134
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:25,530
-Huh?

135
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,664
-Yaimon's flower
bowls were something

136
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:28,933
that Torajiro was very
knowledgeable about.

137
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:31,903
As a result, I became fairly
familiar with them too,

138
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:34,305
and this isn't one of them.

139
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,508
It lacks the brilliant
indigo color.

140
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,376
The glaze is poorly applied.

141
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:41,479
Even the shape doesn't
have Yaimon's elegance.

142
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:43,381
-I'll give you a deal.

143
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:45,383
1 and 1/2 million yen.

144
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:47,285
-1 and 1/2 million?

145
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:49,888
-That much for a fake?

146
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:51,456
-What?

147
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:52,323
-Uh, here.

148
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:53,424
Let me have a closer look at it.

149
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,759
-No. No, no.

150
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:55,660
Keep your hands off.

151
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:01,332
It wasn't me!

152
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:02,500
I didn't do it!

153
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,669
I'm not responsible!

154
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:06,738
-First Kaga's tea
cup, and now this?

155
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:07,972
-What's next?

156
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:10,909
-All breakages must be paid
for, even if you're a kid.

157
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:11,509
1.5 million!

158
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:15,213
-Hikaru, quick!

159
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:16,381
Tell him about the bowl.

160
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,783
-This bowl, it's not a
Keicho flower bowl at all.

161
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:19,717
It's a fake.

162
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:20,785
-Ha!

163
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:23,421
OK then, expert in
antique flower bowls.

164
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:24,923
Tell me why you think
it's not genuine.

165
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,792
-Well, it's because,
it's like, uh--

166
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:30,528
-The color isn't the brilliant
indigo typical of the period.

167
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:33,565
-The color isn't the brilliant
indigo typical of the period.

168
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:35,266
And the glaze isn't
applied very well.

169
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:36,834
And if this was a
real Keicho bowl,

170
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:38,937
its shape would be
a lot more elegant.

171
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:39,904
-Well, well.

172
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:41,873
Aren't we the little expert?

173
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:42,473
Impressive.

174
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:49,247
-That smile makes him look
like a big, ugly bullfrog!

175
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,716
You don't know how
much I hate bullfrogs.

176
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:53,251
-Have I got this right?

177
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:56,421
-It's a fake and you wanted to
charge me 1 and 1/2 million?

178
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:57,655
-Oh, my mistake.

179
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:59,724
Sometimes when I see
a sucker, these things

180
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:00,825
just seem to slip out.

181
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:01,759
-A sucker?

182
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:03,561
A-- Are you referring to me?

183
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:05,263
-But I've got a lot
of time for people

184
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:06,664
who know what they're
talking about.

185
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:07,832
-Be careful of him, Hikaru.

186
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:09,534
He's dishonest and
can't be trusted.

187
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,736
-Only 'cause you made me
interfere in the first place.

188
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:17,308
-Do you want to know the
secret to this business?

189
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:19,644
You need to know your
stuff about antiques, sure,

190
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:21,779
but you also need to
know about people.

191
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,881
You see, there
are only two types

192
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,383
of customers in this world.

193
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,253
The ones who know what they're
talking about and the fools who

194
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:29,787
don't.

195
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:32,390
-Uh.

196
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,891
-Guess which category you're in?

197
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:41,466
[phone ringing]

198
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:42,500
-Listen, kid.

199
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:43,668
Because you've got
such a discerning eye,

200
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:46,537
I won't make you
pay for the bowl.

201
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,339
Hello?

202
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:49,941
Yes.

203
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,909
Yes, I remember you buying that.

204
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:52,877
Charming piece.

205
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,712
You had it valued at 1,000 yen.

206
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:56,981
Why are you telling me?

207
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:59,817
I didn't make you
pay 200,000 for it.

208
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,753
Is it my fault you
didn't do your research

209
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:02,854
before you bought it?

210
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:04,989
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

211
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:07,492
People who buy things without
knowing their real value

212
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:08,760
deserve what they get.

213
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:12,530
So hey, quit your complaining
and talk to somebody who cares.

214
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,265
-Hey, uh, don't go.

215
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:21,506
-This is grampa's special bowl!

216
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:22,807
-Hey, you!

217
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,509
Put that down.

218
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,511
You're not allowed to
touch the merchandise.

219
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:27,945
You can't afford it.

220
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,814
-But this is my grampa's!

221
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:30,915
It's his bowl.

222
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:34,218
Someone stole it from
him six months ago.

223
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:35,553
Give it back!

224
00:09:44,228 --> 00:09:45,997
-That bowl.

225
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,409
-Sai?

226
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:05,216
-Hikaru.

227
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:08,820
I know that bowl.

228
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,556
-You sure this is the bowl that
was stolen from your grandpa?

229
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:12,290
-Yes.

230
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,491
It was his favorite.

231
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:15,426
-I don't know
anything about that.

232
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,730
All I know is someone offered
it to me, and I bought it.

233
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:23,434
-I remember seeing this
bowl in the castle in Kyoto.

234
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:27,538
Torajiro and I were visiting
the castle to teach Go.

235
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:30,308
Without a doubt.

236
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:34,245
This is the very same
Keicho flower bowl.

237
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:36,447
-So you mean it's
the real thing?

238
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,415
-Please, sir!

239
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:38,783
Please give it back!

240
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:39,851
-Hmph!

241
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:41,853
It's probably a piece
of junk, but I'm not

242
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:43,354
gonna let you have it for free.

243
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:44,622
-He thinks it's a piece of junk.

244
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:45,957
He hasn't got a clue.

245
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:48,226
-That flower bowl is special.

246
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:48,993
It hides a secret.

247
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:51,429
This man has no
idea what a treasure

248
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:53,564
he's holding in his hands.

249
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:55,400
-You want to give it
back to your grandpa?

250
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:56,434
Then buy it.

251
00:10:56,434 --> 00:11:00,705
100,000.

252
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:02,473
-Uh, what's wrong, Sai?

253
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:04,675
-I told you how much
I hate bullfrogs.

254
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:05,943
Look at him.

255
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:07,412
-100,000?

256
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:09,881
Just a few moments ago you
said this was a piece of junk.

257
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:11,649
-You're in my store now.

258
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:13,951
And in my store, I
charge what I like.

259
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:15,553
If customers think
it's expensive,

260
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:16,554
they don't have to buy.

261
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:17,388
-Come on.

262
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:20,291
Be reasonable.

263
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,959
-That bowl is my grandpa's!

264
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:22,894
Give it back!

265
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:23,561
-Hey!

266
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:24,262
Hey!

267
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:24,962
Get off!

268
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:25,930
Let go!

269
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:26,531
-Careful!

270
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:32,637
-Are you all right?

271
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,805
-No, I'm not all right.

272
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:35,239
She smashed one of my tea cups.

273
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:37,308
And she's gonna pay for it!

274
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:38,276
-It's not her fault!

275
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:39,577
You're the one who
pushed her over.

276
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:41,379
It doesn't matter
about the teacup.

277
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:43,281
You should be checking on her.

278
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:44,882
-Don't seem scared of
him now that he's not

279
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,219
smiling like a bullfrog.

280
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:49,821
-Did he hurt you at all?

281
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:50,788
-I'm fine, sir.

282
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:52,857
-This teacup is
worth 50,000 yen.

283
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,925
Pay up!

284
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,359
-Why should we believe you?

285
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:57,862
You've lied about everything
else in the store so far.

286
00:11:57,895 --> 00:11:59,564
-What do you think, Sai?

287
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:00,698
-Why are you asking me?

288
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:02,633
I don't know anything
about tea cups.

289
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:03,601
Hikaru!

290
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:04,836
Look over there!

291
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:05,570
HIKARU: Where?

292
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,304
SAI: There.

293
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:07,472
A Go board.

294
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:10,341
It appears the owner of
this place likes to play.

295
00:12:10,374 --> 00:12:10,808
HIKARU: Yeah?

296
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:12,276
So?

297
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,278
-Time for you to
pay up, young lady.

298
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:14,979
Or I'll call the cops.

299
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:16,681
50,000.

300
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:18,249
Hand over the money.

301
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:20,485
Come on.

302
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:22,553
Well, if you haven't
got the money,

303
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:24,822
then maybe it's time to
talk to your mom and dad.

304
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:26,757
What's your phone number?

305
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,758
HIKARU: Hey, mister.

306
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:28,659
-Huh?

307
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:30,294
-You play Go, don'tcha?

308
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:31,562
Want to play me?

309
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:32,630
-What?

310
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,565
Why do you want to play
Go all of a sudden?

311
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:37,969
-Well, I figure we could play
for the cost of the teacup?

312
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:38,603
-Wait.

313
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:39,470
Hold on, there.

314
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:40,638
What do you think you're doing?

315
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:42,640
-I'm beginning to like you, kid.

316
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:43,774
All right, then.

317
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:46,377
We'll decide this
over a game of Go.

318
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:51,749
-Sai?

319
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:54,385
Are you sure you can play
when you're like this?

320
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:56,787
-Did you see that
hanging on the wall?

321
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:58,689
This guy's got a
Five Dan certificate.

322
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:01,459
There's no way you
can beat him at Go.

323
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:03,794
-And that certificate
is no fake, either.

324
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:06,597
It's 100% genuine.

325
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:07,565
-You know what?

326
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:09,834
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

327
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,335
Are you OK, Sai?

328
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:13,604
-If you're too scared to
play, that's fine by me, kid.

329
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:15,640
We can forget the game.

330
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:16,507
-Too scared to play?

331
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,842
Who does he think he is?

332
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,712
-But if you do play, I'm not
going to take it easy on you.

333
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,514
Don't say I didn't warn you.

334
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:24,949
I don't know why
I said I like you.

335
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:27,218
You're an arrogant
little smart-alec!

336
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:28,219
-Hikaru.

337
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:29,353
-All right, then.

338
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:30,755
Let's play.

339
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:32,857
Sai, are you sure
you can do this?

340
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,426
What if he smiles
like he did before?

341
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:36,794
-Don't worry.

342
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:39,430
He won't be smiling when
I'm finished with him.

343
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:43,634
MAN: So I'll be going first.

344
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:44,802
Heh, heh.

345
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:46,971
It's been quite a while
since I played black.

346
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,310
So, what are we waiting for?

347
00:13:52,343 --> 00:13:53,778
Let's get the game started.

348
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:55,913
-Hikaru, are you ready for this?

349
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:58,482
-Yeah.

350
00:13:58,516 --> 00:13:58,950
-Upper right.

351
00:13:58,983 --> 00:13:59,984
3, 4 point.

352
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:01,485
Go.

353
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,820
Next, 18, 5.

354
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,689
Hane.

355
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:05,723
8, 18.

356
00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:07,224
The tiger's mouth.

357
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,574
Now, 2, 17.

358
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:26,310
Push in.

359
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,979
-(VOICEOVER) How can
this kid be so strong?

360
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:48,733
-What's wrong?

361
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:50,768
-This game's so one sided.

362
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:52,436
He's not giving him a chance.

363
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:55,272
I don't play much Go
myself, but even a beginner

364
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:58,476
like me could see
how good he is.

365
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:02,813
This kid is a much
stronger player.

366
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:03,748
[groan]

367
00:15:03,781 --> 00:15:05,783
-I resign.

368
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:07,585
-Hm?

369
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:08,319
-Wow.

370
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:09,453
This kid's amazing!

371
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:10,688
-I don't believe it.

372
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:11,789
Beaten by a kid.

373
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:15,993
-Hm.

374
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:17,895
What a coincidence.

375
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:20,898
The same flower bowl I
saw all those years ago,

376
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:24,335
and here it is in
a place like this.

377
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:25,770
I've heard the palace
was running out

378
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:27,438
of money at the time.

379
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:28,973
Perhaps the bowl
was secretly sold

380
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:31,809
by someone in the royal court.

381
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:33,911
Yaimon's flower bowl
was so beautiful

382
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:37,715
that it distracted Torajiro
and I from playing Go.

383
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:41,552
We couldn't help but look at it.

384
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:45,222
Hikaru, you want to know the
secret of the flower bowl?

385
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:46,098
-What?

386
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:49,960
Hey, mister.

387
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:50,895
-Huh?

388
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:52,997
-Pass your Go stones
over this way.

389
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,964
-You want my stones?

390
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:55,332
What are you going to do?

391
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:56,600
-And the captured stones, too.

392
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:57,935
We'll continue the
game from where

393
00:15:57,968 --> 00:15:59,570
we left off, only
we switch sides.

394
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:01,338
If I can turn this
game around and manage

395
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:03,407
to win while I'm
playing black, will you

396
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,843
promise to give back the
flower bowl to the girl?

397
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:06,677
-Huh?

398
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:07,912
What's that?

399
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:09,613
You want to try and
win with my stones

400
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:12,316
after I've already conceded?

401
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:13,617
That's impossible!

402
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:14,485
It can't be done!

403
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:17,321
You sure are one arrogant kid!

404
00:16:17,354 --> 00:16:18,622
I'd like to see you try.

405
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,494
-That was a great idea.

406
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:24,662
Let's do it.

407
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:25,763
-Here we go.

408
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:29,600
-16, 2.

409
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:30,401
The knight's move.

410
00:17:00,297 --> 00:17:01,298
Next, 3, 9.

411
00:17:01,298 --> 00:17:03,139
Cut.

412
00:17:24,255 --> 00:17:24,955
-(VOICEOVER) No way!

413
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:29,460
This is impossible.

414
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:55,619
-Deal's a deal.

415
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:56,954
Give her the flower bowl.

416
00:17:56,954 --> 00:17:57,855
-You mean it?

417
00:17:57,888 --> 00:17:59,824
He's gonna give it back to me?

418
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:02,893
-Where'd you learn
to play like that?

419
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:04,995
-Darn it all!

420
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:06,864
Take the flower bowl
and get out of here.

421
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:09,533
-But first, pour some of
the water from that vase

422
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:12,303
into the flower bowl.

423
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:13,737
-OK.

424
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,373
This one?

425
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:18,742
-What do you think
you're doing now?

426
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:20,644
-Why are you filling
it with water?

427
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:22,746
Grandpa never actually
used it for anything.

428
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,617
He just had it out for show.

429
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,388
He promised to give it to me
as a wedding present one day.

430
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:34,592
-(VOICEOVER) Seeing this flower
bowl again brings back happy memories.

431
00:18:37,428 --> 00:18:41,966
Like me, this bowl has survived
through the generations,

432
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:44,835
experienced the passage of time.

433
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:47,972
-Look! an you see that?

434
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:48,572
-Wow.

435
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:50,841
-Oh!

436
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,310
MAN: How'd those flowers
start appearing in the bowl?

437
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:06,557
-So pretty.

438
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,493
-It can only be a flower bowl
when there are flowers in it.

439
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:11,629
People say it was Yaimon's
final masterpiece.

440
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:16,433
It looks different from
his other pieces because

441
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:17,902
of the special
glaze which changes

442
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:19,970
when it comes into
contact with water.

443
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,706
-But that's one of his
most famous pieces.

444
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,462
And you're saying that
this is it, right here?

445
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:27,441
Oh!

446
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:28,640
It's mine! All mine!

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,362
-No!

448
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:29,880
-Not so fast, mister.

449
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:31,815
Earlier, you said there
are only two types

450
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,317
of people in the world.

451
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,353
Those who know what they're
talking about and the fools who

452
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:38,555
don't.

453
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,658
And guess which
category you fall into.

454
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:42,226
Hand it over.

-You're welcome.

00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:54,438
See you!

That was awesome.

forgot something.

HIKARU: Yeah?

00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:14,458
Ah!

466
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:15,426
Kaga's tea cup!

467
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:24,422
KAGA: For real?

468
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,123
-Yep.

469
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:26,724
It's known as a Keicho teacup.

470
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:29,994
A masterpiece of the
early Edo period.

471
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,596
Not only that,
but the design was

472
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:33,998
painted by Songa Yaimon,
one of the finest

473
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:35,667
ceramic artists of his time.

474
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,968
-Oh, yeah.

475
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:38,770
And it's genuine?

476
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:39,704
-Yeah.

477
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:40,905
You can tell by
the elegant shape

478
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,674
and quality of the design.

479
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:44,576
Pieces like this
are hard to find.

480
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,479
-Huh.

481
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,781
How dare you mess with me!

[theme music]

483
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,107
HIKARU: I haven't been
playing Go for a while,

484
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:24,842
but then I run into Waya.

485
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,912
He wants me to start up again
and join the study sessions.

486
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,583
I also find out that Isumi's
gone to play in China.

487
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:35,386
He's gonna challenge some of
China's best young players.

488
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,888
One of them even
looks a lot like Waya.

489
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,125
Isumi better do
well on this trip.

490
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,994
If he doesn't, he could
lose the confidence

491
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:45,763
he needs to pass
the next pro exam.

492

Next time, Isumi No Go!
