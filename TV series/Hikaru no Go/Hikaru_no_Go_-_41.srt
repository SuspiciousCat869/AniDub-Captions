00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:51,636
-The reason I lost my match
today was all because of Isumi.

3
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:52,970
How could he do that to me?

4
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:54,939
He completely ruined
my concentration.

5
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:56,340
He ruined everything!

00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:58,376
-Hikaru. Hikaru!

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,545
-I wanna be strong.

I'm never gonna
play another match

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,285
like the ones I played
yesterday or today ever again.

-You lost your nerve
against Shindou, huh?

11
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:12,423
I wonder if you were
thinking about Toya,

12
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,392
so you lost your concentration
and made a mistake.

13
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,994
Isn't that it?

14
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:17,728
-Waya?

15
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,297
I'm worried about Isumi.

16
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,933
He lost again today.

17
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,534
He was playing Fuku.

18
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,940
-I was kind of disappointed.

19
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,575
You haven't even recovered
from that game against Shindou,

20
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,877
have you?

21
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,680
I don't know why I ever thought
of you as a serious threat.

22
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,717
My goal of staying undefeated is
much easier now, thanks to you.

-Shut your mouth.

OCHI (VOICEOVER): He's managed
to invade this deep already?

27
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:13,584
If he does anymore damage,
I'm gonna lose territory.

28
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:15,953
I'm not gonna let him
take control that easily.

29
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:23,794
He'll see.

ISUMI (VOICEOVER): I've always
known what a strong player

31
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,048
Ochi is, but I never once
thought he could beat me.

32
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,613
So that's your strategy.

33
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:45,042
OCHI (VOICEOVER): Isumi's
playing like himself again.

34
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:46,644
It doesn't matter.

35
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:47,812
I'm still going to win.

36
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:13,404
-Huh.

37
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,009
OCHI (VOICEOVER):
He's going there?

38
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:35,693
That move.

39
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:36,994
It was brilliant!

40
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:38,662
He crossed under perfectly.

41
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:54,011
He stopped me from
cutting him off!

42
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:57,748
I'm losing on the right side.

43

No!

much for the game.

HIKARU: How did
they play this part?

53
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,592
Wait, let me think.

54
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,794
From here, it went like this.

55

-Yeah.

56
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,630
And after that it was
all downhill for black.

57
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,799
-I-- I-- I need to clear up.

Thank you, Ochi.

You helped me
refocus on my game.

-Hey, Isumi.

You're back in the running.

00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:54,458
-Thank you, Waya.

00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,327
Feels like I haven't
seen you for days.

65
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,696
-You're the one
who's been hiding.

66
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:00,464
It's all good with Shindou?

67
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:01,338
-Hm?

68
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:11,008
-We've got a long way to go
before the pro exam's finished.

69
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:17,314
-Mhmm.

70
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,551
-The real race is only just
beginning, for you and me.

71
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:31,662
I don't know if Shindou's a
better player than me or not,

72
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:34,798
but I'm gonna keep
getting stronger.

73
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:38,936
He isn't the only
one who can improve.

74
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:40,738
I need to believe
that I can do it too.

75
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:51,548
-That's it.

76
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:52,883
It was right here!

77
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,987
When white attached, I made a
stupid mistake by playing hane.

78
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,925
I should've just pulled back and
not let him gain any territory.

79
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:03,727
If I had done that,
white wouldn't

80
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:06,764
have taken control so easily.

81
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:10,601
This move was fine,
and so was this one.

82
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:13,404
Next time, I'm not gonna lose.

83
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,671
I'm not gonna lose!

don't underestimate Shindou.

You're into the final

-Our match is set for
the very last day.

Watch out, because by then
I'm gonna be much stronger.

much for the game.

96
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:23,908
(VOICEOVER) All right.

97
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:25,175
I needed that win.

98
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,144
I was afraid I was
gonna lose two in a row

99
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:29,313
after that shock of
losing to Isumi yesterday.

100
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:36,053
But both Shindou and Waya
won their games today.

101
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:39,757
So did Isumi and Hondo.

102
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,994
If they keep playing like
that, I may not pass the test.

103
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,062
Naw, that won't happen.

104
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:45,796
I'll be fine.

105
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,301
Huh?

00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:51,635
Shindou.

107
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,772
-I just Ijima leaving, and
he looked pretty upset.

108
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:57,741
Guess that means you must
have beaten him, huh?

109
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:58,809
-And you won your match.

110
00:12:58,842 --> 00:12:59,743
You're playing well.

111
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:01,712
Still only two losses.

112
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:03,681
You played Isumi today, right?

113
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,316
Easy win?

114
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:06,784
-No, not really.

115
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:08,352
Well, sometimes I
make mistakes when

116
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:11,055
I'm way ahead because I'm
so focused on winning.

117
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,856
Maybe it's the pressure
of the pro exam.

118
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,659
I don't really know.

119
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:17,428
And if I get too
worried about losing,

120
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,964
then it's hard to
play my usual game,

121
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:23,000
and I end up playing badly.

122
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:24,802
Emotions are a tough
thing to deal with.

123

OCHI (VOICEOVER):
There's definitely

124
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:37,915
something different
about Shindou.

125
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:42,820
And it's not just his
technique that's improved.

126
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:44,955
I can't be intimidated by him!

127
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,331
Huh?

128
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,900
Shindou lost to Honda?

129
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:57,968
Great.

130
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:00,938
That takes Shindou
up to three losses.

131
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:04,842
He's starting to fall
behind, just like I hoped.

132
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,678
I wonder if Honda left already?

133
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,246
Honda.

134
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,314
You beat Shindou.

135
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:11,782
Congratulations.

136
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:13,917
Quite the competition going
on between you, Isumi,

137
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:16,920
and Shindou, now that you've
each got three losses.

138
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:19,923
I'm kind of relieved Shindou
went and lost another game.

139
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,925
Everyone's making such
a big deal about him.

140
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:22,993
How strong he's gotten.

141
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:25,262
Like he's some kind of favorite.

142
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:27,731
So, how did the match go?

143
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:28,932
[grunt]

144
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:29,733
-Come on, Honda.

145
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,402
Tell me.

146
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:33,003
-I barely won the game.

147
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,973
In fact, I was sure
I was going to lose.

148
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:38,409
At the end, when we finished
counting, there was only half

149
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:39,710
a point between us.

150
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:45,783
I thought I was playing
really well at the beginning.

151
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,818
I was building some solid
territory on the board,

152
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:50,854
and let me tell you, I wasn't
going to budge for anything.

153
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,657
But then Shindou kept coming
at me again and again.

154
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,327
He kept pushing and
pushing, and never let up.

155
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:00,197
I tried my hardest to hold
him back, and by the time

156
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,899
the match ended, I
thought I'd lost.

157
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:07,671
As it turned out, I had
half a point to spare.

158
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:10,174
But it really doesn't
feel like I won the game.

159
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:21,185
HIKARU: 10.

-I dreamt that I was
just a half point short.

164
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:50,180
-That loss yesterday
is obviously

165
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:53,817
troubling you more
than you thought.

166
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:55,919
Still, at least you
don't have to play today.

167
00:15:55,953 --> 00:15:57,654
You have time to get over it.

168
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,023
-I don't need to get over it.

169
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:01,225
I'm fine.

170
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:02,793
I could play today if I wanted.

171
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:10,234
(VOICEOVER) Every
match that he wins,

172
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:14,004
every match that he loses, they
all leave their mark on him,

173
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:15,672
and help nurture
his development.

174
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:22,779
He is growing in strength
with every game he plays.

175
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:33,257
-Hi, Grandpa.

176
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,324
It's Ochi.

177
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:35,826
I would like you
call Toya Tudan.

178
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:50,674
-We've only got three weeks
left before your final game,

179
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:53,277
but I'll do whatever
I can to help you.

180
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,180
-I can't tell you how grateful
I am to hear you say that.

181
00:16:56,213 --> 00:17:00,250
And next time you come, there's
no need to dress so formally.

182
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:02,920
Excuse me, but I'll
leave you to it.

183
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,655
I've got a lot of work to.

184
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,757
I'll make sure you
get some tea later.

185
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:16,157
-With only three
weeks left, I don't

186
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:18,626
know how much difference
you're going to make.

187
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,561
But Grandpa insisted
that you were the guy

188
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:22,363
to come and do these sessions.

189
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:23,665
-For the next three
weeks, I would

190
00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:25,033
like you to call me Sensei.

191
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:26,434
-Huh?

192
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:27,902
-How can I expect
you to learn anything

193
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:30,138
if you don't start showing
a little respect for me?

194
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:35,376
Once the pro exam is
over, you can call me

195
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,711
Toya, or whatever you like.

196
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:43,918
So, you said three
weeks wasn't going

197
00:17:43,952 --> 00:17:46,921
to make much of a difference.

198
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:47,922
Well, you're right.

199
00:17:47,956 --> 00:17:49,357
If all it took to
improve your game

200
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,559
was a few lessons from
a pro, then everyone

201
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,061
would be doing it.

202
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:56,798
But when it comes to your
specific match against Shindou,

203
00:17:56,831 --> 00:18:00,468
I believe I can be of
some assistance to you.

204
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:02,804
-Your mind is always
stuck on Shindou.

205
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:06,007
I plan to take full advantage
of that obsession, Sensei.

206
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,009
-I'm going to be here
as much as I can,

207
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:10,011
but there are days when
I have other commitments

208
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:11,512
and matches to play.

209
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:12,580
On those days, I want--

210
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,015
-Just let me know
when, and I'll just

211
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:15,817
get another pro to
come in for those days.

212
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,918
-No.

213
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,586
That's exactly what I
don't want you to do.

214
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:20,054
They'd get in the way right now.

215
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:21,689
-Get in the way?

216
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:24,625
-Instead, I want you to study
some of Shusaku's games.

217
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:25,893
-Shusaku?

218
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:28,129
-Mm-hm.

219
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:30,932
You'll find that records of
nearly 400 of his matches

220
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:32,767
have survived.

221
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,636
I want you replay dozens, if
not hundreds of those games,

222
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:36,971
over and over again.

223
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:39,874
-What's this got
to do with Shindou?

224
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,642
(VOICEOVER) He thinks
he knows everything.

225
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,614
-All right.

226
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,615
Take a look at this.

227
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,517
-But aren't we going
to play a game?

228
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,786
-Yes, but first, I
want to know if you're

229
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:54,822
familiar with this match.

230
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:56,958
Black was played
by a Korean Insei

231
00:18:56,991 --> 00:19:00,128
by the name of Su-yeong
Hung, and Hikaru Shindou

232
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:01,596
played white.

233
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:03,064
-What was he doing
playing a Korean,

234
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:05,633
and how do you know about it?

235
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,602
-The coach from my
middle school Go club

236
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,771
happened to be at the Go
salon when they played.

237
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,410
The coach memorized the match,
and then replayed it for me.

238
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,567
-Huh?

239
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,738
Hold on.

240
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:47,508
You said Shindou
was playing white?

241
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:48,489
-Mm-hm.

242
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:53,514
-I thought he made a mistake
earlier on in the game.

243
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:56,918
But he was really anticipating
the game over here.

244
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:59,020
-I was told that some of
Shindou's Insei friends

245
00:19:59,053 --> 00:19:59,854
were also watching.

246
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:14,635
OCHI (VOICEOVER): If Isumi
was there to see the match,

247
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:19,607
no wonder he was so cautious
when he played against Shindou.

248
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,375
So the final count at
the end of the game

249
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,515
was Shindou by one
and a half points.

250
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:28,950
If this match shows
the kind of level

251
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:31,719
Shindou's playing at right
now, then three weeks

252
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:32,954
won't be enough!

253
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:35,156
It won't be enough time!

254
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:37,758
-I think you've
got plenty of time,

255
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,927
especially now that I'm
here to work with you.

256

[theme music]

257
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:25,433
HIKARU: Only a few matches
left and the competition's

258
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:26,567
getting intense.

259
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:28,970
SAI: Some people are
starting to lose their grip.

260
00:22:29,003 --> 00:22:30,504
HIKARU: The one
match I've really

261
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:34,775
gotta worry about is
still ahead, against Ochi.

262
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,778
SAI: Honda looks very upset.

263
00:22:37,812 --> 00:22:40,381
HIKARU: And Asumi
looks really happy.

264
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:42,550
Could she actually beat him?

265
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:43,651
Next time.

266
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,419
The First to Pass.

267
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:47,989
SAI: Who do you think
it's going to be?
