00:00:05,245 --> 00:00:07,449
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a go board,

2
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:11,557
a spirit from the past known as
Fujiwara no Sai has returned.

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,198
Visible only to Hikaru
Shindo, a master of go,

4
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:18,305
Sai seeks to play
the divine move.

5
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:20,276
[theme song]

6
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:49,093
-You actually won!

7
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:51,732
-(LAUGHING) Yep, I did it!

8
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,559
-Akira?

9
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:04,339
Hey, Toya!

10
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,754
He came here check up on me.

11
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:13,225
-What are you talking about?

12
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:16,532
In case you didn't notice, he
just completely ignored you.

13
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:20,607
There's no way you
and him are rivals.

14
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,613
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He said
I'd never see him again.

15
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:25,750
But he's waiting for me.

16
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:29,391
He's waiting for me to
rise up to his level.

17
00:02:29,424 --> 00:02:31,630
-OK, just a few more.

18
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:34,235
-This calls for
a change of plan.

19
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:35,638
I'm going to destroy him.

20
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:30,585
-They're so lucky.

21
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:31,887
They've finished,
and now they're

22
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,357
going to watch Akira's match.

23
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:34,426
-Huh?

24
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:35,561
-I know we played
against him, what is it?

25
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:36,631
A total of four times now.

26
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:37,967
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Yeah, but we've

27
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,504
never seen him play anyone else.

28
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:42,643
And now he's playing the
[inaudible] and I'm stuck here!

29
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:46,852
-Hikaru, Hikaru, why don't you
let me play this game for you?

30
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:47,854
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Huh?

31
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:49,590
-I'll finish it
off as quickly as I

32
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,629
can so we can go and
watch Akira's match.

33
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:53,331
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Don't be silly.

34
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,067
[knocking]

35
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,701
-Hello.

36
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,639
May we come in?

37
00:03:56,672 --> 00:03:57,974
-Oh, hey there, Waya.

38
00:03:57,974 --> 00:03:59,511
Good to see you, Sumi.

39
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:01,850
-Mashiba.

40
00:04:01,883 --> 00:04:03,486
-Nice to see you both.

41
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,856
So how have you been?

42
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:06,493
-Pretty good.

43
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,831
-We can replay the game for
you so you're up to speed.

44
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:14,676
-You want me to be white?

45
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,482
-All these extra spectators
because Toya's playing.

46
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:25,465
-So Isumi, think this will
be the year you finally

47
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,536
get to pass the pro exam?

48
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:28,638
-Uh, hope so.

49
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,643
-Isumi's a pretty good player.

50
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:31,979
Maybe better than me.

51
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:34,618
I guess luck was on
my side when I passed.

52
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:36,989
WAYA (VOICEOVER): I'd like to
wipe that smile off his face.

53
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:39,027
Then he might stop gloating.

54
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,431
-Making your own luck
is part of the game.

55
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:43,637
I suppose you want to be
one of the first players

56
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:44,504
to take down Toya?

57
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:45,741
-Uh-huh.

58
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:48,045
The thought certainly
crossed my mind.

59
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:50,082
-No offense, Mashiba,
but but you're

60
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:52,688
never going to be good
enough to defeat Toya.

61
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:56,563
Even Zama-sensei is
finding it tough.

62
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,531
See?

63
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,070
He had to use a
double hane here.

64
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:01,139
-Hm.

65
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:03,043
That's a very strange
move for an oza

66
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:05,148
to make against a new 1-dan.

67
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,485
It strikes me as
a bit desperate.

68
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,861
-He should have made a
good solid connection here.

69
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,968
Maybe he's just trying out some
new tactics against the rookie.

70
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:17,473
-Isumi, want to replay the game?

71
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:18,942
-Sure.

72
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:22,951
-Toya has been playing a
superb match up to this point.

73
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,454
-Yeah.

74
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:27,794
What do you bet Zama-sensei is
chewing on the end of his fan?

75
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,997
-Oh, yeah.

76
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,802
That's such a weird habit
for someone of his standing.

77
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:32,704
Tell you what.

78
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:33,640
I'll go take a look.

79
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:37,949
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
At last, it's over!

80
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,686
Let's see, how'd I do?

81
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:40,554
-All right, Hikaru!

82
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:42,825
You won by 2 and 1/2 points!

83
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:43,460
That's great.

84
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:44,529
Let's go!

85
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:45,598
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Yeah, yeah.

86
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:46,767
I kind of got distracted
thinking about Akira

87
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,802
during the game.

88
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:50,876
-OK, 20 and 40 and 50.

89
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:51,576
58.

90
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,445
-It's no good.

91
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,483
I'm 2 and 1/2 points short.

92
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:55,852
So you won.

93
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:57,723
-Thanks a lot, and good game!

94
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:59,060
-You know this move?

95
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,562
-Huh?

96
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:02,132
-Do you think I made the right
counter-move to your attack?

97
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:05,573
You really seemed like you
knew what you were doing there.

98
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:07,009
-Uh, well, I, uh--

99
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,144
-Hurry, hurry!

100
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:10,048
Don't you want to see
the end of Akira's match?

101
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:10,650
Hurry!

102
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:12,019
Let's go!

103
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:12,887
-Hm.

104
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:13,990
Yes, you played that very well.

105
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,961
But if your opponent had
responded differently,

106
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:17,832
you might have been in trouble.

107
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:19,234
-He's not going to--

108
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:21,205
NARRATOR: HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Analyze the game!

109
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:22,641
-Now in this situation--

110
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,579
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Why'd
he have to come and give us

111
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:25,748
a lesson now?

112
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:27,685
We need to get out of here!

113
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:28,955
-Please, sensei!

114
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,859
I promise I'll go
over the game with him

115
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,094
later on when we get home!

116
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:33,831
Just please let him go now!

117
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:36,804
Please please please please
please please please!

118
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:02,925
-Huh?

119
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:03,726
Whoa.

120
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,530
He's really going for it.

121
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:41,672
-That throw in by black
was a very aggressive move.

122
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:44,745
It certainly puts the
pressure on white.

123
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:48,252
How he responds now could change
the whole course of the game.

124
00:07:48,286 --> 00:07:50,089
If he cuts black off,
the next few moves

125
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:51,559
could be costly for both sides.

126
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,279
-He captured instead
of cutting it off!

127
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:18,882
He felt threatened
and compromised.

128
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:32,243
-I don't believe it.

129
00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:33,178
Did you see that?

130
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,917
The oza shied away
from a battle.

131
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:38,323
-What would have happened
if he played a cut here?

132
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:39,325
Or here?

133
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:40,627
-Hm.

134
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,765
Both sides would be in
a dangerous position.

135
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:45,037
-Zama-sensei probably
just avoided the battle

136
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:47,041
because he knew he
could afford to.

137
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,209
-I don't think so.

138
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:50,080
He's not the sort of
person to take chances,

139
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,019
especially against
someone like Toya.

140
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:56,760
He seems flustered to me.

141
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:58,965
-Imagine the
humiliation if he lost.

142
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,301
Now he's backed into a corner.

143
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:01,971
He's trying a
different approach.

144
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:05,312
-He may not even get the
opportunity to fight back.

145
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,183
-I can't believe Toya's leading.

146
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,050
Come on!

147
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,420
Hang in there to the finish!

148
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:10,856
-Calm down.

149
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,693
The oza's bound to have a
few more tricks up his sleeve

150
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:13,796
before he's done.

151
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:36,978
TOYA (VOICEOVER): I won't go
on the defensive just yet.

152
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,682
I'm still in a good position.

153
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:42,288
There's going to be a
public record of the game,

154
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:47,833
and it's a safe bet
Shindo will see it.

155
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,701
I'll show him.

156
00:09:58,221 --> 00:10:00,860
He'll be jealous
of my every move.

157
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:10,480
-A knight's move?

158
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:12,852
-I don't understand
what he's trying to do.

159
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:15,056
He should be protecting the
lower half of the board.

160
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:22,471
-He's gone and left himself
wide open to an attack.

161
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:23,741
-Nah, don't worry.

162
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:25,945
-I'm sure he knows
exactly what he's doing.

163
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,214
-Why is he still attacking?

164
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:29,253
I've never seen anyone
play like that before.

165
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,355
-He's vulnerable.

166
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:32,894
Zama-sensei will take
full advantage of that.

167
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:35,298
-But he's having
to think about it.

168
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:37,168
I've never seen
anything like it.

169
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:41,010
-How's Toya doing?

170
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:41,878
-Huh?

171
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:43,282
-Someone else coming to watch?

172
00:10:43,282 --> 00:10:43,882
-Shindo.

173
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,386
About time.

174
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:46,221
-Hey, guys.

175
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:47,290
How's the game been going?

176
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,458
-We'll show you if you like.

177
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:50,362
We can replay it
from the beginning.

178
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:56,475
-Toya's playing black
and the oza is white.

179
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:59,515
Not only did he start first,
but they gave black a 5 and 1/2

180
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:00,417
point komi.

181
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,022
-Why'd they give him a komi?

182
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:05,126
-A top pro playing a new 1-dan?

183
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,300
They've got to have one
to keep it competitive.

184
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,237
-Although such a small
handicap still makes it

185
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:11,506
tough for the new guy.

186
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,446
But none of the top pros take
these games too seriously,

187
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:17,185
so it kind of balances out.

188
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:19,957
-Are you saying the
oza might let Toya win?

189
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:20,926
-Normally, yeah.

190
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,463
But it doesn't
look like it today.

191
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:25,335
The oza's giving
it all he's got.

192
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:26,804
-Whoa!

193
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,274
He played there?

194
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:29,343
-Yeah.

195
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:30,947
Then white captured
instead of cutting.

196
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,886
The oza's not taking any
chances in this game.

197
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,090
He's being real cautious.

198
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:38,162
-He knows it's a tough match.

199
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:40,968
He's biding his time, waiting
for the smallest error.

200
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,303
Then he'll pounce
and take control

201
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:44,074
of the board when he's ready.

202
00:11:44,107 --> 00:11:46,946
It's a dangerous strategy,
but he wants to win.

203
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,552
-Hm.

204
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,356
-Then instead of
protecting his territory,

205
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:54,162
Toya went and played here.

206
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:54,930
-What?

207
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:57,034
Why'd he go and do that?

208
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:59,005
It's an interesting
choice, but I

209
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:01,977
don't understand why he'd
leave himself wide open.

210
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:04,850
-Huh?

211
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:07,022
He's decided to go
in for the attack!

212
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:16,608
-Black must've known that white
would attack sooner or later.

213
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:20,216
The question is, how's
he going to respond?

214
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:23,122
What are you going to do, Toya?

215
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:27,364
And what about you, Zama-sensei?

216
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:32,007
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Akira,
you're playing an awesome game.

217
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,411
-If he only played
defensively, Toya

218
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:35,547
might have been able to win.

219
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,652
But he keeps on attacking.

220
00:12:37,886 --> 00:12:42,295
There's got be something
driving him on.

221
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,900
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I think
I know what's driving him.

222
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,144
Akira, there's a message for me
in here somewhere, isn't there?

223
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,451
I'm going to keep improving my
game and then catch up to you!

224
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:54,554
Just you wait!

225
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:55,989
It's going to happen!

226
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:57,927
For sure, it's gonna happen!

227
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:07,948
-Huh?

228
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:08,649
It's snowing!

229
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:31,931
-1,000 years may have
passed, but some things

230
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:34,068
remain the same.

231
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:37,542
Snowflakes falling, fierce
battles on the board.

232
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:43,588
Every move tells
a story revealing

233
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:47,362
the innermost thoughts of
those who play the game.

234
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:51,171
The clatter of stones on the
board echoes through the air.

235
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:52,440
The tension is exciting!

236
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:06,736
-How could he be a threat
to me at his level?

237
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,994
But even if it is true
that he's chasing after me,

238
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:21,233
I'll move so far ahead
of him that he'll never

239
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,135
catch up to me.

240
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:32,623
He won't even come close.

241
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:41,007
TOYA (VOICEOVER): I don't
care who might be chasing me.

242
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:48,022
There are 500 pro players,
and my sights are set on them

243
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,391
and them alone.

244
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,362
I'm going to beat them all.

245
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:58,109
You don't matter to me, Shindo.

246
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:03,120
-Don't underestimate me.

247
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,057
-Huh?

248
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,061
-Did you think
I'd fall for that?

249
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:10,769
Take a look at
this move, junior.

250
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,706
-[gasp]

251
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,621
-You were planning to play
your stone in that position

252
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,560
after securing this
area, weren't you?

253
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:25,366
You were too slow.

254
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,672
One of your father's students
might have gone for it,

255
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:31,813
but not me.

256
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:35,487
Hey, have you've forgotten
who you're playing?

257
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:37,056
Did you think you
could outwit me?

258
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,418
I think you'll find
the game is even.

259
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,307
-He got caught off guard.

260
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,246
-The oza's last move has
made it extremely hard

261
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,550
to predict the outcome.

262
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:43,862
You've got to hand it to him,
he's playing like a champion.

263
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:45,832
-Now for the end game.

264
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:48,405
-This is going to
be really close!

265
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:48,887
-Hm.

266
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:00,712
-Hikaru?

267
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:04,253
The game's concluding, but it's
difficult to tell who will win.

268
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:04,988
-Come on, Toya!

269
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:06,357
-Huh?

270
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,597
-He's been playing such
an awesome game up to now!

271
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,933
He can't let it end like this!

272
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,970
If he can just hang
on, I know he's

273
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:15,776
got enough strength inside
of him to win this match!

274
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:21,521
-[gasp] He's forcing the play.

275
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:23,425
He'll get cut off.

276
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,895
-You think so?

277
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:26,532
-He's pushed it too far.

278
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:27,601
It could be over.

279
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:29,003
It all depends on
how the oza responds.

280
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:53,855
-He resigned.

281
00:17:58,398 --> 00:17:59,033
-OK.

282
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:00,669
Let's review the game.

283
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:03,843
Even though he lost, I thought
he played a respectable game.

284
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:05,345
Very proficient.

285
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:08,586
-Yes, he certainly had the oza
on the right there for a while.

286
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:11,625
-We should go and offer our
congratulations on a good game.

287
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:38,348
-Isumi, um, do you
think they'd mind

288
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:40,018
if we snuck in and
said hi as well?

289
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:44,894
-Next year, I'll be in there.

290
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:49,077
-Yeah.

291
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:49,678
Sure.

292
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:53,420
-It's getting late.

293
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:54,822
We should go.

294
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:59,031
-Hey, Shindo, we're leaving.

295
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:00,835
-I think I'm gonna
stay a bit longer.

296
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,092
-Whatever.

297
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:05,894
See you.

298
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:16,081
-Akira went for the
knockout and it didn't work.

299
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:18,654
I guess you're not the only
one who can beat him, huh, Sai?

300
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,134
You know what?

301
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,671
I'm gonna remember
everything about this match

302
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:27,539
for a long time.

303
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,675
-Indeed.

304
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:32,282
The way Akira played
today was truly memorable.

305
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:34,186
-Yeah!

306
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,088
I really liked it.

307
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:36,524
It was cool.

308
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:46,612
Wow, look at all this
snow! [laughing] Woohoo!

309
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,284
Woohoo!

310
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:51,655
If Akira keeps playing
as good as this,

311
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:54,261
he's really going to be worth
pursuing as an opponent,

312
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,831
don't you think?

313
00:19:55,831 --> 00:20:01,008
[laughing] Yeah!

314
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:04,582
-Don't forget that you've
come a long way too, Hikaru.

315
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:07,922
-Yeah, but it's all
thanks to Akira.

316
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,327
Maybe with him
ahead of me, I could

317
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:14,970
become a meijin, or
an oza, or anything!

318
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:18,244
TOYA (VOICEOVER): If Akira
Toya had never met Hikaru,

319
00:20:18,277 --> 00:20:20,048
he would have walked
the path destined

320
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:21,718
for him without any diversions.

321
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,828
But now when he
stops and looks back,

322
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:30,002
he pulls Hikaru along
the path with him.

323
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:33,676
It's almost as if--
as if fate had put him

324
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,918
here to help Hikaru develop
and grow stronger as he

325
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:40,590
walks his own path through life.

326
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:45,367
[theme song]

327
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:20,831
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I've got
to make it into the A League!

328
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:23,036
SAI (VOICEOVER): Why are
you in such a hurry, Hikaru?

329
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:24,615
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): If
I'm not in the A League,

330
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:27,018
I can't compete in the
Young Lions Tournament.

331
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:29,620
That's where Akira
will be playing next.

332
00:22:29,654 --> 00:22:31,756
SAI (VOICEOVER): Are you
sure you're ready for that?

333
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:33,090
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Bring it on!

334
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:39,564
Next time, Fear and Impatience!

335
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:41,465
SAI (VOICEOVER): Turn
your fear into courage.

336
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:44,402
Then you'll be in
a position to win!
