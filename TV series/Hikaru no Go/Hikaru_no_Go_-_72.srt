[theme music]

2
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,483
BOY: I faced him before, in
the Young Lions tournament

3
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:57,752
last year.

4
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:01,191
He played a good game, even
gave me a bit of a scare.

5
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:03,327
But his end game
wasn't strong enough,

6
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:06,332
and I beat him by
6 and 1/2 points.

7
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:09,771
Afterwards, Toya kept
asking me about Shindou,

8
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:12,408
wanting to know
how he had played.

9
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:14,078
At the time, it
really ticked me off

10
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:16,481
that he didn't want to
know about me and my game.

11
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:20,121
But is Shindou
really was his rival,

12
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:22,224
that'd explain why
he was so interested.

13
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:24,194
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): All right!

14
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,563
I can win this.

15
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,347
AKIRA (VOICEOVER):
The only way I

16
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,251
can measure Shindou's
true strength is

17
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,486
by playing him myself.

18
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:44,826
I knew it the moment
he came running up

19
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,329
to me the other night.

20
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:48,766
There was something
different about him.

21
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:52,104
All I have to do now is wait.

22
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,473
The match is set.

23
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,782
We're going to face
each other once again.

24
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:35,573
-Looks like he's managed to
fend off Shindou's attack.

25
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:43,618
But maybe that's exactly what
Shindou expected him to do.

26
00:03:56,772 --> 00:04:00,645
Murakami was trying to
keep Shindou at bay,

27
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:02,448
but its taken him too
many moves to do it,

28
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:04,317
and it's cost him
a lot of territory.

29
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,327
-That's it.

30
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:10,794
I resign.

31
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,672
-He simply lost
the will to fight.

32
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,708
-Thank you very
much for the game.

33
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,716
-Now I can see why Toya
thinks of him as a rival.

34
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:39,306
MAN: Excuse me, Shindou.

35
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:46,851
Could I have a
quick word with you?

36
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:49,555
So, does this mean you're going
to be coming to all your games

37
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:50,490
from now on?

38
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,158
-Yeah!

39
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,193
Yeah, of course.

40
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:53,696
I don't want to
miss a single one.

41
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,469
-Fine.

42
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:01,574
Now, did you know the pairings
for the first around the Meijin

43
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:03,712
tournament qualifiers
have been sent out.

44
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:04,546
-Yeah.

45
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,317
I got the notice yesterday.

46
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:08,685
-In that case, you already know.

47
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:10,723
Your first opponent's
going to be Toya Three-Dan.

48
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:22,340
-Yes.

49
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,477
-Right now, Toya has
a very busy schedule,

50
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:26,881
so I'm not sure exactly when
you two are going to be playing,

51
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:29,218
but whenever it is,
I'll let you know.

52
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:30,320
Anyway, good luck.

53
00:05:30,353 --> 00:05:31,689
There are a lot of
people out there

54
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:33,658
who've got high hopes
for your success.

55
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:34,826
-Thank you.

56
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,596
Sorry for missing so many games.

57
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:44,308
-Who are these
people you say have

58
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:45,878
got high hopes for Shindou?

59
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:46,645
-Ah, Mr. Amano.

60
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,920
For starters, there's Kuwabara.

61
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:55,192
I heard him talk about
Toya and Shindou as equals.

62
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:56,828
That kind of took
me by surprise.

63
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,364
-Really?

64
00:05:58,397 --> 00:06:01,969
-Don't tell me you
think that way too?

65
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:02,905
-Well, yes.

66
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:03,505
I do.

67
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:12,719
-I don't understand what's
so special about him.

68
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:16,492
He has a lot to learn about
how to properly act like a pro.

69
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,796
Don't get me wrong, I'm happy
to see young people getting

70
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,570
involved in the game, especially
if they have real talent.

71
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:25,941
The pro exam start
this week, doesn't it?

72
00:06:25,974 --> 00:06:29,713
I wonder who's gonna make
it through this year.

73
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:32,417
Whoever it is, I hope they
take things more seriously

74
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,387
than Shindou and
actually show up.

75
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:50,479
That Shindou kid-- what
do you think, Mr. Amano?

76
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:52,649
Does the game
really have a future

77
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:54,919
in the hands of
players like him?

78
00:07:58,553 --> 00:07:59,387
-All right.

79
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,856
When you're ready, please begin.

80
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:01,591
-Onegai shimasu.

81
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:08,302
-Shinoda-sensei.

82
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:09,803
Got the pro exam underway?

83
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:10,839
Everything good?

84
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:11,874
-Yes.

85
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:13,443
It's the preliminary
rounds right now,

86
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,045
and the finals start
in a month or so.

87
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,949
-So, who are the
favorites this year?

88
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:19,386
Karawaki And Isumi?

89
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,722
-Isumi's definitely going to
be one of the front runners.

90
00:08:21,756 --> 00:08:23,458
He looks very confident.

91
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:26,630
Not at all like last year.

92
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:27,532
-Oh.

93
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:29,302
That sounds very promising.

94
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:31,571
He used to have this fragile
side, which always let him

95
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:33,875
down.

96
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:36,946
-Mr. Amano, there are
people in the world of Go

97
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,716
who believe that,
unless someone's talent

98
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:41,354
flourishes at an early
stage, they'll never make it.

99
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,855
But I've always
felt that players

100
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,595
should be allowed to
develop at their own pace.

101
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:49,666
On life's journey, sometimes
a detour's the best route.

102
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:55,443
-Mind if I quote you
on that, Shinoda?

103
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:57,579
It'd be perfect for an
article in Go Weekly

104
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:58,915
if Isumi passes the exam.

105
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:04,890
Ochi and Waya seem to
be making good progress

106
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:07,595
since they became
pros last year.

107
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:10,967
Even Shindou's doing well
since he made his come back.

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,469
-And I hope the
players that pass

109
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,038
this year will follow
in their footsteps.

110
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,703
-He's not fooled
by any of my moves.

111
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:18,372
I have to try a
different tactic.

112
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:19,341
This is gonna be tough.

113
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:49,522
No!

114
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:51,057
How could I have missed that?

115
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:52,927
I should've stuck back
when I had the chance.

116
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:07,951
He's got himself out of
trouble with that contact play.

117
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:09,520
There's nothing I can do.

118
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:13,927
Black has no weak spots.

119
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,596
The game is
completely one sided.

120
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:30,887
-Uh, see you.

121
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,457
-OK, see you later.

122
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,861
First he beat Murakami,
and now Tsujioka.

123
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,872
Does thia mean the
new wave is coming?

124
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:45,543
I know Shindou's strong,
but is it the real thing?

125
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:13,520
-I resign.

126
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:09,843
-I resign.

127
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:16,887
AMANO: Toya is taking down
one high ranking player

128
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,588
after another.

129
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:25,534
The new wave is
coming, and Akira Toya

130
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,470
is definitely leading the way.

131
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:56,650
-I resign.

132
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:07,533
-Congratulations on
your win, Ogata-sensei.

133
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:10,205
First the Judan title,
now this one as well?

134
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:11,706
-Yes, thank you.

135
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:14,177
-Nogi-sensei, perhaps you'd be
willing to share your thoughts

136
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:16,214
on the game with us.

137
00:14:16,214 --> 00:14:18,684
-He was hanging
in there, waiting

138
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:19,919
for the right opportunity.

139
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:21,789
Then he took it.

140
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:23,592
KUWABARA:
Disappointing, Mr. Nogi.

141
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,927
-Huh?

142
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:28,233
-10 years ago you won the Meijin
title three times in a row.

143
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,669
Now look at you, letting
yourself be pushed around

144
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,638
by the likes of Ogata.

145
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,841
-Kuwabara-sensei!

146
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,711
-I was watching the
game in the other room.

147
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,952
Mr. Nogi, we veterans
have a position to uphold,

148
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:44,157
and you've let the side down.

149
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:46,494
-I know you were successful
in defending your Honinbo

150
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,965
title against Kurata
recently, but can you

151
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:53,038
guarantee you're going to
be able to keep on winning?

152
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:55,676
-We've got the Meijin
tournament coming up next month,

153
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,246
and Mr. Ichiryu is going
into battle with Hatonaka.

154
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,082
But not to worry.

155
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,785
I'm sure that an old
timer like Ichiryu

156
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,723
who knows how to deal with
a young pup like Hatonaka.

157
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:09,030
We're not going to let these
greenhouses take over just yet.

158
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:11,501
-With all due respect,
Kuwabara-sensei, Ogata

159
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:13,003
here isn't exactly a greenhorn.

160
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,773
He has won two titles.

161
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,041
-Hm.

162
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:18,946
I've always been content to
stick with the Honinbo title

163
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:21,182
up to now, but
now that Ogata has

164
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:22,885
won a couple of
other titles, maybe I

165
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,721
should branch out and
make a serious try

166
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:26,223
for the Judan and the Gosei.

167
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:31,265
I've always done rather well
in my games against Ogata.

168
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,534
Haven't I?

169
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:33,016
Well, Ogata?

170
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:40,929
-As defending champion, I'll
be there waiting for you.

171
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:48,340
KUWABARA (VOICEOVER):
This isn't good.

172
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:52,213
He's beginning to look
and sound like a champion.

173
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:52,847
-Ogata-sensei?

174
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:01,829
-Good morning, sir.

175
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:02,262
-Good morning.

176
00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:10,007
You've made impressive progress.

177
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,710
Two years ago I
was your opponent

178
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:14,715
in the Shinsho Dan series, your
first game as a professional.

179
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:21,326
I seem to recall having a 5
and 1/2 point reverse handicap

180
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:24,364
in that game, but I
still managed to win.

181
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,701
It was clear which one of
us was the stronger player.

182
00:16:30,273 --> 00:16:32,710
Today, however, is an even game.

183
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,780
I'll be interested to
find out how much you've

184
00:16:34,814 --> 00:16:38,152
improved since then.

185
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:40,289
-I did the recording for
that Shinsho Dan match.

186
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:45,731
It's amazing. back then
Toya was just a One-Dan,

187
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:50,405
and now he's made it
to the Honinbo league.

188
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,907
[buzzer]

189
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,653
-Onegai shimasu.

190
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,256
[phone ringing]

191
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:02,925
-Hello?

192
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,226
Publications.

193
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,228
Mr. Miyake.

194
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,864
How are you?

195
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:07,398
What?

196
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,134
Are you serious?

197
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:11,137
You heard this from where?

198
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,174
Yeah, OK.

199
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:13,808
Of course.

200
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:15,644
I understand.

201
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:16,846
-That was Miyake?

202
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:19,083
The reporter from [inaudible]?

203
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:20,752
What was he calling about?

204
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:23,791
-He wanted to let us know that
Koyo Toya has signed a contract

205
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:25,727
to play for Beijing in China.

206
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,997
-To play for Beijing?

207
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,733
If he really has
signed with them,

208
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,204
then he's going to be playing
in the Chinese team league.

209
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:33,872
-So what is the team league?

210
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:36,711
-It's the equivalent of the J
League we have here in Japan.

211
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,447
Each city has its own team.

212
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,085
-I've heard of teams signing
some of the top Korean pros,

213
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:42,721
but this is the
first time I've heard

214
00:17:42,754 --> 00:17:44,857
of them signing one from here.

215
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,791
Wait a sec.

216
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:46,293
-Huh?

217
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:46,927
What?

218
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,062
What is it?

219
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:50,132
-Now that Toya-sensei
has retired,

220
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:51,868
is schedule isn't
tied up with all

221
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:54,672
the matches for the association.

222
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,176
Compared to here, the contracts
in China don't pay much.

223
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,345
But he'll have more freedom.

224
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:00,715
Plus, he gets to play some
of the best Go players

225
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:01,751
in the world over there.

226
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,787
No wonder he agreed to sign.

227
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,821
Yoshikawa.

228
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:05,957
-Yes?

229
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,893
-Get Toya-sensei on
the phone right away.

230
00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:09,696
We need to get an
interview with him.

231
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,709
BOY: Yang Hai!

232
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:19,010
-Huh?

233
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,713
-Guess what I just heard.

234
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:24,018
Beijing have signed Toya Sensei
of Japan to be on their team.

235
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:24,987
-I know.

236
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,190
The news is all
over the internet.

237
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,928
-With him on board, Beijing's
gonna be a way better team.

238
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:32,031
And I bet it's going to
make the whole league more

239
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:33,400
exciting to play in now.

240
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:35,470
You know me and Wan
Sing play for Shanghai,

241
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,807
so we're gonna have to
toughen up our game.

242
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:39,776
-The way you're going,
anyone would think you're

243
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,980
a big Koyo Toya fan.

244
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:43,315
Yes!

245
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:45,953
He is the closest anyone's ever
got to playing the Divine Move.

246
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:47,055
-I wouldn't be so sure.

247
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:52,797
When the Divine
Move finally comes,

248
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,367
it's gonna come from here.

249
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,836
-From a computer?

250
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,137
-Yeah.

251
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,073
-They say it'll take another
100 years before they build

252
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:02,212
a computer program that's strong
enough to beat a human at Go.

253
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:04,348
-I'm not going to
need 100 years.

254
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:06,352
I found a sponsor who
can fund my research,

255
00:19:06,352 --> 00:19:08,188
so I can do it much sooner.

256
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:10,325
There are people already
working on inputting data

257
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,894
for the program.

258
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:12,962
-Now I get it.

259
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:15,133
No wonder your team is
the worst in the league.

260
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,736
You're spending all
your time on this.

261
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,174
-This project has nothing
to do with my team's record!

262
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:22,377
Have you seen what my
winning percentage is?

263
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,213
-It's worse than mine, isn't it?

264
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,383
-O-- Ugh.

265
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:29,822
[phone ringing]

266
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:30,924
-There's no answer.

267
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:32,827
No matter how many times
I try to get through,

268
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,296
no one picks up.

269
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:36,499
-I've been checking out
a few Chinese websites.

270
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:40,005
It looks like the story
is true after all.

271
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:43,410
-I saw Akira this morning, but
he didn't mention anything.

272
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:46,315
Maybe even he doesn't
know about it yet.

273
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:48,151
-I just thought--
if Toya Sensei's

274
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,188
going to be playing for
Beijing from now on, that

275
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,523
means he's going
to have to travel

276
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,858
to China on a regular basis.

277
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,394
We'll need to get the
results from there.

278
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,397
I wonder how many games
he'll play each year?

279
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:57,866
I'd better check it out.

280
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,103
-"Go Weekly" is gonna have to
follow him and report on his

281
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:01,371
progress.

282
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:04,243
Things are gonna get busy
around here, right, Mr. Amano?

283
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:05,312
-Hm.

284
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:05,912
-Mr. Amano?

285
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:12,155
-Yoshikawa?

286
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:13,958
-Yes, sir?

287
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:17,096
-I get a sense that there's a
momentous change on the way,

288
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:19,534
don't you?

289
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:22,304
Something's about to
happen in the world of Go.

290
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:34,223
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Toya.

291
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:44,172
I want to play you
as soon as possible.

292
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:53,487
I'm ready to face you.

293
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,492
[theme music]

294
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:24,196
HIKARU: What's gonna happen when
Toya and I finally come face

295
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:25,398
to face?

296
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:30,499
It's time to find out if
I've caught up to him.

297
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,501
We've had lots of time
to prepare for this game.

298
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:38,674
But without Sai around, I
could use some extra help,

299
00:22:38,674 --> 00:22:39,408
even from Akari.

300
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,284
Next time, Shindou Versus Toya!
