2
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,218
SAI: Interesting.

3
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:52,353
This is a good place
for the Hikaru to learn.

4
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:54,255
I've been his main
opponent for so long now,

5
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:55,857
but against all
these other players,

6
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,558
his game will gain new strength.

7
00:01:57,592 --> 00:02:00,528
In the game of Go, a mere half
point lead over your opponent

8
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:01,863
is all it takes to win.

9
00:02:01,863 --> 00:02:03,397
When the match is
even, both players

10
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:04,532
start the game as equals.

11
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:07,101
Once you have the slightest
lead, all you have to do

12
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:08,102
is protect it.

13
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:10,037
But giving a handicap
to an opponent

14
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:14,242
can be the equivalent of losing
20 to 30 points of territory.

15
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:16,978
In that case, your game
must rise to a new level

16
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,513
to steal that territory back.

17
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,450
There's no choice.

18
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:23,918
You have to go on the offensive.

19
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:29,857
Once you've developed
that ability,

20
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:31,626
it can be used during
an even match when

21
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,127
you need to make a comeback.

22
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,842
-Good morning everyone.

23
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,843
-Good morning!

24
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:52,246
-Oh, here you are.

25
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:53,114
Well, come on.

26
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:53,948
Let's get started.

27
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:55,416
-Huh?

28
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,984
But what about the table fee?

29
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:58,085
-Oh, don't worry about it.

30
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,487
It's fine.

31
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,956
-Hey, hey.

32
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:03,257
I guess it's OK.

33
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,492
-What's OK, dear?

34
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:05,993
-Hm?

35
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:08,963
Oh, waving the table
fee for the kid.

36
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:10,865
-Onegai shimasu.

37
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:11,720
-You bet.

38
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:12,420
Onegai shimasu.

39
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:27,569
-Good morning, Toya sensei.

40
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:28,737
It's good to see you.

41
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,405
-We're very glad
you could make it.

42
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:32,407
-Thank you for
inviting me today.

43
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:33,675
MAN: Have you got no respect?

44
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,877
What do you think you're
doing, putting your cup down

45
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,811
on the Go board?

46
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:38,613
Put it on the table.

47
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:39,581
-Yes sir.

48
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:40,882
We're sorry.

49
00:03:40,915 --> 00:03:43,418
-It's so nice to see everyone's
playing each other for fun

50
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:45,720
even though the festival
hasn't started yet.

51
00:03:45,754 --> 00:03:48,590
-They're only here
because they love to play.

52
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:50,558
-So, who are the
four people I'm going

53
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:52,727
to be playing
against this morning?

54
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:55,864
-One of the city councilors,
his secretary, and two

55
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:57,532
of his financial supporters.

56
00:03:57,565 --> 00:03:59,300
-Just to let you in
on a little secret,

57
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:00,935
the councilor's not
very good at go.

58
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:02,771
I know this is
unusual, but could you

59
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:04,539
fix the game so he wins?

60
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:07,375
He can be very difficult
to deal with if he loses.

61
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:10,011
-The thing is, he's one of the
major sponsors of the festival,

62
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:11,679
so we need to keep him happy.

63
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:14,049
He likes to show off by
insisting on a low handicap.

64
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:16,951
It'll be hard to let him
win, but do what you can.

65
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:18,420
-I'm sure it'll be fine.

66
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:19,521
MAN: Hey!

67
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:20,955
Why was there no one
to meet me at the door?

68
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:24,893
-Oh, sir.

69
00:04:24,926 --> 00:04:26,294
Please forgive me.

70
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:28,530
I had no idea you'd be
arriving this early.

71
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,534
-I came early because I wanted
to see Ms. Chieko Sakurano.

72
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:34,602
Perhaps you can tell
me where she is.

73
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,704
-I'm sorry, there's
been a change of plan.

74
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:38,440
Ms. Sakurano couldn't
make it today.

75
00:04:38,473 --> 00:04:39,808
-What's that?

76
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:42,410
-She only told us at
the very last minute.

77
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,645
We have a replacement.

78
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:45,980
-Toya Tudon has agreed
to play in her place.

79
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:47,749
-Toya Tudon?

80
00:04:47,782 --> 00:04:50,552
I'm not gonna play against
some snotty-nosed kid.

81
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:53,688
-He's one of the rising stars
in the world of Go right now,

82
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:55,390
and his father is Toya Meijin.

83
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,057
-Hmph.

84
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,525
So he's the son of a champion.

85
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,793
Big deal.

86
00:04:58,827 --> 00:04:59,761
Never mind.

87
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:01,296
Can you get me some iced tea?

88
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:01,830
-Yes, sir.

89
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:04,532
If you'll come this way.

90
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:05,900
-I'm sorry about that.

91
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:06,835
-That's OK.

92
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:08,269
-Now that you know
what he's like,

93
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:09,938
you can see why we asked
you to lose to him.

94
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:14,042
-Right.

95
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,543
Let's get this show on the road.

96
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:21,316
-Hm?

97
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:27,755
-Ladies and gentlemen.

98
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:28,823
Thank you all for coming.

99
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:30,425
And now we're ready to begin.

100
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:30,959
-Onegai shimasu.

101
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:39,501
-Five stones.

102
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,569
-In that case, I
guess I'll need six.

103
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:43,271
-And what's your handicap?

104
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:44,272
Three stones?

105
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:45,373
-Yes.

106
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:46,741
I was once told by a
pro in a teaching game

107
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:49,043
that three was appropriate
for my skill level.

108
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:50,912
-Well, if you're
playing with three,

109
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:53,748
then I'm playing with
three, and not a stone more.

110
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:55,650
-Are you sure three's
going to be enough?

111
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:56,718
-Yes.

112
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:58,620
I beat pros all the
time with five stones.

113
00:05:58,653 --> 00:05:59,487
-Very well, then.

114
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:00,054
Onegai shimasu.

115
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:00,822
-Onegai shimasu.

116
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:06,694
MAN: Stop looking so serious.

117
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:07,762
-Huh?

118
00:06:07,795 --> 00:06:09,664
-Professional Go is
a very social game.

119
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:12,534
You gotta learn to be
a little friendlier.

120
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:14,369
MAN: Could you fix
the game so he wins?

121
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,941
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Four of them.

122
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:23,578
-Is there something the
matter, Toya Sensei?

123
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:24,312
-No.

124
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:27,682
Shall we start the game?

125
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:30,685
-64 points.

126
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:32,687
You have finished, haven't you?

127
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:33,655
-Now it's my turn.

128
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:35,490
-Do you find it hard
counting points?

129
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:36,791
-What?

130
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:39,527
-Don't tell me the boy wonder
here wasn't even counting.

131
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:40,929
-Of course I was counting.

132
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:42,964
I know roughly
how much I've got.

133
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:45,533
-Knowing roughly
isn't very precise.

134
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,335
Next time, try and end in a tie.

135
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:50,271
I want you to intentionally
end the game in a draw.

136
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,306
-Intentionally?

137
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:52,807
-That's right, intentionally.

138
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,542
You need to watch
your opponent's moves

139
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:56,611
and take into
account any handicap

140
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:58,513
so the game can end in a draw.

141
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:01,883
It helps if the
game's even, got it?

142
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,052
Once your mid-game
formations are set up,

143
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:06,321
you'll have to start
calculating what the end game

144
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:07,055
score will be.

145
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:08,723
You'll see it's quite difficult.

146
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:11,426
The situation is going to change
with every move your opponent

147
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:15,029
makes, so you'll have to keep
readjusting your calculations.

148
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:16,998
And, since your goal
is an exact draw,

149
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:19,367
you can't afford to
be even one point off.

150
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,808
To make things harder, it's not
enough to simply end in a draw.

151
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:29,277
You have to play the
game at your normal pace.

152
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:31,846
No slowing down to
think too much about it.

153
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,714
-Hikaru!

154
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:34,482
This sounds like fun!

155
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:35,650
MAN: One more thing.

156
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,051
-You mean there's more?

157
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:38,920
-You're not allowed to
play badly on purpose

158
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:40,788
and then try to make
it up at the end.

159
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:43,291
You need to play the game
well enough that your opponent

160
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:45,593
doesn't realize
you're forcing a draw.

161
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:47,295
-But I do know.

162
00:07:47,295 --> 00:07:48,529
Play your usual game.

163
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:49,964
This can be a practice run.

164
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:51,660
-Hikaru, let's do it!

165
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:52,628
-OK.

166
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:54,286
MAN: Why don't you give it try?

167
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:55,367
-All right.

168
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,522
Onegai shimasu.

169
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,251
-Hm.

170
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:01,086
Playing for an intentional draw?

171
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:03,955
-If you manage to do it, then
we'll play with two boards.

172
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:04,790
-Two?

173
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,758
And try and draw both games?

174
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:07,959
-Aw, come on, Boss.

175
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,995
That's asking too much.

176
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:13,098
-Then, if you succeed with
two boards, move on to three.

177
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,467
-And if I do that, try four?

178
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:16,935
-It's easier said than done.

179
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:18,403
Believe me.

180
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:22,908
-Boy oh boy, don't let
that head get too big.

181
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:26,111
-You'll never be able to force
a draw without exact counting.

182
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:29,815
Let's see how well you do
against Domoto, for starters.

183
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:30,816
-Oh man.

184
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:32,884
-Feeling a little
bit nervous, are we?

185
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:34,920
Imagine what it'll
be like with two.

186
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:36,288
Next to impossible!

187
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:37,355
-No it isn't!

188
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,857
Hikaru, you can do it!

189
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,092
You can do it!

190
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:51,002
AKIRA (VOICEOVER):
After only 10 moves,

191
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:53,038
I can tell how strong they are.

192
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:55,807
The two guys on either
side are average players.

193
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,111
Their handicaps are about right.

194
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:00,846
As I suspected,
this guy's nowhere

195
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,948
near as good he thinks he is.

196
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:04,082
Now him.

197
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:05,851
He's the strongest
one of them all, ready

198
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:08,053
to take full advantage
of any openings.

199
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:13,425
-(VOICEOVER) You've only
just turned pro this year.

200
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,360
You've probably been
given instructions

201
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:18,964
to lose to my boss.

202
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:22,701
I bet this is the last place
you want to be right now.

203
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:24,136
How does it make
you feel knowing

204
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:27,973
you've been told to let him win?

205
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:30,375
But unfortunately,
you have no choice.

206
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:32,878
You may be just a kid,
but you're still a pro,

207
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:35,013
so you better make sure it
looks good when you lose.

208
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:46,024
-I managed to get a draw!

209
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:48,727
-Well done, Hikaru.

210
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,895
-Atta boy!

211
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:52,831
-Lay off the hair, would you?

212
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:55,400
You know, I guess it's not as
hard as I thought it would be.

213
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:58,036
-You might be interested to know
that every pro I've ever met

214
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:00,338
can force a draw,
and they can normally

215
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:02,774
do it 100 times out of 100.

216
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:04,209
-The boss has a point there.

217
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:05,677
You know, I said atta boy.

218
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,678
I take it back.

219
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:08,180
You're an Insei, right?

220
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:10,715
So it's no big deal if you
force a draw against one.

221
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:11,850
-Come on.

222
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:12,717
-All right.

223
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,152
Let's take it to the next level.

224
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:15,353
-Two boards.

225
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:16,087
-Great!

226
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:16,922
That means I can play.

227
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:18,356
-Hold on a minute.

228
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:19,925
-Where am I gonna sit?

229
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,293
Domoto, you've already played.

230
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:22,828
Let me take your place.

231
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:23,995
-Aw, come on.

232
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,463
MAN: You don't have to be
a strong player, right?

233
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:26,932
So I could play, too.

234
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:27,866
-Come on, guys.

235
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,301
I don't care who I play.

236
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:30,936
-Remember that
against two opponents,

237
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:33,038
you have to double
the calculations.

238
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:34,739
It's not going to be easy.

239
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:36,208
-And against three,
it'll be triple.

240
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,075
I know.

241
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:38,310
I think I got it.

242
00:10:38,343 --> 00:10:40,078
-You sound fairly
confident about dealing

243
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:41,680
with two opponents.

244
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:43,815
But three's going to be
a whole different game.

245
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:44,850
-Hurry up!

246
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,351
I can't wait to see
you play three at once.

247
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:46,985
Hikaru!

248
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:47,853
-Calm down.

249
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:49,955
I haven't even played two yet.

250
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:51,957
-Then hurry up and
begin the game.

251
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,791
-Oh, boy.

252
00:10:58,163 --> 00:10:59,764
OK, two boards.

253
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:00,966
Here I go.

254
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:17,148
-(VOICEOVER) Even though they've
all got different handicaps,

255
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:21,019
I seem to be closing the gap.

256
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:26,873
I'm 15 points behind him, and
10 points behind this one.

257
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:29,861
If I sacrifice some stones
on the right hand side,

258
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:32,964
that should be enough here.

259
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:36,768
But this guy, I'm only six
or seven points behind him.

260
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:38,082
-Hm?

261
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:45,076
(VOICEOVER) Why is he
looking so serious?

262
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:54,119
He seems to be focusing all
his attention on my board.

263
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:55,787
He's going all out against me.

264
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,291
I can see it in his eyes
He's not holding back.

265
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:01,092
Oh, now I get it.

266
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:03,862
He has no choice but
to let my boss win,

267
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:07,032
so he's going to make it up by
trying to beat the rest of us.

268
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:11,236
The other two won't be a problem
for him, but I'm no pushover.

269
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:13,905
That's why he's decided
to concentrate on his game

270
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:14,406
with me.

271
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:20,679
It seems being forced to
lose really annoys him.

272
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,247
Now that I've
figured it out, I'm

273
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,117
going to do all I can to
beat him, and humiliate him.

274
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:26,985
Yeah.

275
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:29,721
The son of the Meijin.

276
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:32,223
-Young Toya is very impressive.

277
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:33,758
He's the same age
as my grandson,

278
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,894
but there's a world of
difference between them.

279
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:38,229
-I'm a bit concerned he's
going to be too good.

280
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:40,098
our guests came here
for a teaching game,

281
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:43,201
and they won't appreciate it if
he decides to really beat them.

282
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:45,370
-I'm sure he knows
better than to do that.

283
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,906
Remember, he is a professional.

284
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:50,675
-Yes, I know but,
I'm still worried.

285
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,377
(VOICEOVER) I'll let him
get two points closer

286
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,447
by forcing him to
attack and capture.

287
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,084
Here I can gain four points
with a reverse sentei,

288
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:05,223
and here -- I've got every
move figured out right

289
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:06,458
through to the endgame.

290
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:09,327
If I play it right, everything
should go as planned.

291
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,468
But he's not gonna
let me do that.

292
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:21,206
I'll have to adjust
my plans each time.

293
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:23,975
Adjust.

294
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:25,550
Adjust.

295
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:41,026
OK.

296
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:45,840
And with that last move
of his, the game is over.

297
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:48,900
-There's nowhere else to go.

298
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,214
-Nope.

299
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:56,908
(VOICEOVER) It looks
like I've lost.

300
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:57,675
No.

301
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,177
I've won.

302
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,679
AKIRA: Black, 63 points.

303
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:03,948
-White, 63 points.

304
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:05,250
It's a draw?

305
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,117
-I did it!

306
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:08,253
Both games finished in a tie.

307
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:11,289
-Why, you-- I guess you're
not an Insei for nothin'.

308
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:12,190
-Stop doing that.

309
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,691
I hate it!

310
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,827
-So now he'll play three games,
and I get to be in one of them?

311
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,694
-No.

312
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:17,829
You're not going to do that.

313
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:19,264
-Oh, and why not?

314
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:21,366
-Because I'm the one
who's gonna be playing.

315
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:21,966
-Who says?

316
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,268
No way!

317
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:24,235
That not fair, Soga.

318
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:25,837
-Life's not fair.

319
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,673
You just be patient
and wait your turn.

320
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:30,075
-Hikaru, this is
so much fun. you'll

321
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:31,342
be playing against four next.

322
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:32,210
Imagine.

323
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:33,678
-Give e a break.

324
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:36,381
I haven't even played three yet.

325
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,084
-And here, you went for
atari on these two stones

326
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:43,088
too soon, which meant white
was able to secure territory

327
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:44,355
in the center of the board.

328
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:46,057
Except for those
couple of things,

329
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:49,227
you played a really good game.

330
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:51,863
-(VOICEOVER) In the end,
he failed to beat me.

331
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:54,432
But the other games should
be no problem for him.

332
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:02,340
He's still got that look
of intense concentration.

333
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,241
What's going on?

334
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,620
-Oh.

335
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:09,788
Look, it's a draw.

336
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:10,482
-Hm?

337
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:12,884
-Well, I was really close
to winning the game.

338
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:15,120
Bet you didn't expect to lose
those four stones I took,

339
00:15:15,153 --> 00:15:16,621
did you?

340
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:17,589
-You're right.

341
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:19,057
When you made that
move, I thought

342
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,626
you were going to return
here with another move.

343
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:22,928
-(VOICEOVER) A draw?

344
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,763
Again?

345
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,498
Could he have done
it intentionally?

346
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:32,804
There was nothing in my game
that was out of the ordinary.

347
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:37,142
In fact, it should have been
difficult for Toya to beat me.

348
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:40,712
I was told a three stone
handicap in a one on one match

349
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:42,847
should be enough.

350
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:44,749
But for him to do it
while playing four games

351
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:47,619
simultaneously, and still
finish the game with a draw?

352
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:52,824
It's impossible!

353
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:54,726
It has to be a coincidence.

354
00:15:54,759 --> 00:16:01,866
-So, that's 20, plus 20
is 40 My total is 77.

355
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,668
You've got 77, too?

356
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:05,270
A draw?

357
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:06,171
-Huh?

358
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:07,572
-Aw!

359
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:10,575
All I needed was one more
point and I would have won.

360
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:12,877
And there was me thinking I'd
played a pretty good game,

361
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:14,612
gave even if I say so myself.

362
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:17,115
-Don't tell me your game
ended in a draw, too?

363
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:19,751
-You mean he tied against you?

364
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:22,053
I hope you're not suggesting
you're as good as me.

365
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,888
I started with a
handicap of three.

366
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:25,023
You started with six.

367
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:26,157
-No, no, no, no.

368
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:28,560
I just thought it was a
bit unusual, that's all.

369
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:31,794
-Unusual or not, from
now on when I play a pro,

370
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:34,029
I can reduce my handicap
to three stones.

371
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:38,133
[laughter] Oh, I nearly forgot.

372
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,102
Your handicap was three.

373
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:42,504
How did you do?

374
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:43,772
-Ended in a draw.

375
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:44,807
-Oh, dear.

376
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,344
That's just so-- what?

377
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:50,412
-An interesting coincidence.

378
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:51,814
-Coincidence?

379
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:52,882
-Let's see.

380
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:55,117
It looks like you caught
up in the endgame.

381
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:57,920
Let me check and see
if I've got anymore.

382
00:16:57,953 --> 00:16:59,521
I think gonna be close.

383
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:04,026
Now, 10, 20-- oh, no.

384
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,281
It's a draw.

385
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:06,262
Too bad.

386
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:07,797
I thought I stood a
chance of winning there.

387
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:08,464
What?

388
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:09,465
What's the matter with you guys?

389
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,172
-All four of us?

390
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:19,909
Do you think something so
unusual could possibly be-- no,

391
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:20,443
no, it couldn't.

392
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:22,178
Or could it?

393
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:25,948
Could someone really
do something like that?

394
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:28,351
I just can't figure it out.

395
00:17:28,384 --> 00:17:30,786
I mean, I played the
way I always play.

396
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,321
No different.

397
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:33,823
Ah!

398
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:37,026
-Let's back up and go through
the game from the first move.

399
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:37,960
When you're ready.

400
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:45,334
-We hope you're not
too angry with us

401
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:47,069
about what happened in there.

402
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,070
-Don't worry about it.

403
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,171
It's fine.

404
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:51,374
I think they were more
amazed than angry.

405
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:54,110
Between you and me, it's not
a bad thing for the counselor

406
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:56,979
to be humbled
every now and then.

407
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:58,047
-Hm.

408
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:00,883
I'm very sorry.

409
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,284
-Well, I hope you
learned your lesson

410
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:04,920
from all this,
young master Toya.

411
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,956
If you have to make
a point, try and be

412
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:08,424
a bit more subtle about it.

413
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:10,426
-Yes, sir.

414
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:13,129
COUNSELOR: I can't wait to
tell everybody I played a pro

415
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:16,031
and got a draw, with only
a three stone handicap.

416
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:17,833
MAN: Oh, yes, sir.

417
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:20,202
MAN: Well, sir, perhaps I
could challenge you to a game

418
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:21,437
sometime.

419
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,841
COUNSELOR: I think I've had
my fill of Go for a while.

420
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,042
MAN: You know what?

421
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:29,412
COUNSELOR: What?

422
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:34,116
MAN: Those pro players
are quite impressive.

423
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,817
-Hey, Toya.

424
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,185
There you are.

425
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:37,420
-Mr. Ashiwara.

426
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:39,054
-What's this I hear
about you playing

427
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:41,390
four boards simultaneously
this morning?

428
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:42,191
-It was nothing.

429
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:42,792
-Nothing?

430
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:43,793
Yeah, right.

431
00:18:43,793 --> 00:18:45,227
What were you thinking?

432
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:47,463
-Well, they needed
a replacement.

433
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:49,799
So when they asked
me, I said I'd do it.

434
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:51,934
-You just don't get it!

435
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:53,536
There's no reason
for you to be wasting

436
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:55,237
your talents in a
place like this.

437
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,510
You should be concentrating
on your Dan promotion matches.

438
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:03,212
And you know the
Honinbo tournament

439
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:04,113
prelims have started.

440
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,317
If you advance in
those, then you're

441
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:10,319
going to have to be ready
to play in a lot of games,

442
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:12,087
so you shouldn't be
putting your energy

443
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:13,422
into festivals like this.

444
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:17,059
You'll tire yourself out for
the important matches ahead.

445
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:19,428
Has something been
bothering you recently?

446
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:20,796
-No, not really.

447
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,898
I'm fine, thanks.

448
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:24,009
-OK.

449
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:25,010
If you say so.

450
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,678
But I'm afraid I
don't believe you.

451
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:29,148
I've been watching you, and
you seemed a little preoccupied

452
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:30,215
lately.

453
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:32,117
Like you've got something
big on your mind.

454
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:33,785
-Oh, really?

455
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:34,553
-Relax.

456
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:35,821
It's not a huge deal.

457
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:37,656
It's not like you've got someone
chasing after you, is it?

458
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:44,496
-Maybe.

459
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,864
Now he's passed the
pro exam prelims.

460
00:19:57,876 --> 00:19:59,478
It doesn't matter.

461
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:08,554
-You're one point away
from a draw on my board.

462
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:09,988
-Just one point?

463
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:11,523
-One measly point.

464
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:13,025
But that's all it takes to fail.

465
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:14,126
Too bad.

466
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:15,894
-Well, if you just kept
your big mouth shut!

467
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:18,463
-Are you trying to blame
me for the fact you failed?

468
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:19,665
-Yes I am!

469
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:20,666
-Why you--

470
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:26,738
WOMAN: I know he only
missed out by one point,

471
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:29,241
but he did manage to draw
on the other three boards.

472
00:20:29,474 --> 00:20:30,742
Isn't that good enough?

473
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:33,145
-Plenty good enough, I'd say.

474
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:34,913
In all my years
running this place,

475
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:37,749
I've never seen anyone improve
as much as this kid has,

476
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:40,886
and he's done it right
in front of our eyes.

477
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:41,620
-All right.

478
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:42,454
That's enough of that.

479
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:43,655
Let's have another game!

480
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:44,990
-Wha--

481
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,725
-How about a draw
on all four boards?

482
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:47,893
-Oh well.

483
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:50,562
Guess we'll have to keep
playing until he does it.

484
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:52,531
-Mm-hm.

485
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:53,799
Onegai shimasu.

[theme music]

487
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:24,056
HIKARU: A new player
on the scene, huh?

488
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:25,857
SAI: And he's from Korea.

489
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:26,858
Just imagine!

490
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:30,294
People travelling from all over
the world to play Go with us!

491
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:32,669
HIKARU: He's sure got
an attitude problem.

492
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:34,070
I wonder why.

493
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,072
SAI: Try not to antagonize him.

494
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:43,913
HIKARU: Next time,
Only One Can Win.

495
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:47,150
SAI: We know very little
about this opponent, Hikaru.

496
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:48,718
Beware.
