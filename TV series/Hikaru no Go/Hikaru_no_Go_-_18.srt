00:00:05,076 --> 00:00:07,113
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:10,453
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:13,291
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:17,599
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

5
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:21,206
[theme music]

6
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:51,474
-It's Sai.

7
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:55,649
He's challenging me
to an online game.

8
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:59,522
-So far, this game is exactly
the same as our previous match.

9
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:00,691
-Previous match?

10
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:02,161
It must be him.

11
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:03,630
-I agree.

12
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,102
He's mirrored his opening
moves from our second game.

13
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:07,404
Do you remember that day?

14
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:09,441
I struck him down
with a single move.

15
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:16,621
-I can always challenge
Sai to a rematch.

16
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:17,757
-Where is Toya?

17
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:19,627
-He hasn't shown up yet?

18
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,697
-(VOICEOVER) That kid's
got a lot of nerve.

19
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:24,836
He obviously doesn't care
if he loses his first match.

20
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,272
He's so full of himself!

21
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,245
-I've been waiting for my
chance to play Akira again.

22
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:49,650
-I promise, I'm not gonna
interfere during your game.

23
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:51,386
You were pretty
upset when I decided

24
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,490
to play him at the
team tournament.

25
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:54,792
SAI (VOICEOVER):
It's time for me

26
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,397
to discover how skilled he is.

27
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:59,201
-It's 10:00.

28
00:02:59,234 --> 00:02:59,801
Get ready.

29
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,346
MAN: Is he as good as the pros?

30
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,414
-He's better.

31
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:26,919
Sai's the strongest
player I've ever seen.

32
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:28,722
-If Shusaku had
learned modern Joseki,

33
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:32,161
I bet he'd play a lot like Sai.

34
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:35,836
-Is Sai a god, or is he a ghost?

35
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:38,707
-I think this guy
is actually a kid.

36
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:39,743
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): A kid?

37
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:45,654
It can't be him.

38
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,435
He's not online yet.

39
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:14,207
Hm.

40
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:16,919
Finally.

41
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:24,593
I'll play first.

42
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:42,359
It's time to find
out who you are.

43
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,504
Make your move.

44
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:38,731
[clearing throat]

45
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,970
-(VOICEOVER) Toya's
an hour late.

46
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:24,416
He just took a loss
on his first game.

47
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,457
I guess he'd rather stay at
home and play on the internet.

48
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:31,763
How does a kid like that get
away with being so arrogant?

49
00:06:31,797 --> 00:06:32,364
Argh!

50
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:50,999
-Excellent move.

51
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:04,391
He's stronger than anyone
I've ever faced before.

52
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,561
He's put up a wall
in front of me.

53
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:15,612
But if it's not
Hikaru, then who's

54
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:16,947
on the other side of this board?

55
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:21,355
I'll move here.

56
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,958
That should threaten
white's eye shape.

57
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:52,781
He saw right through me.

58
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:57,757
It can't be.

59
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:03,134
I won't give up.

60
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:26,075
Sai is using a
different strategy.

61
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:30,852
But he hasn't lost to anyone
online, so why would he change?

62
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,190
This isn't like the other
matches I've played before,

63
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:40,570
but some of the moves-- They're
the kind that Hikaru makes.

64
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:08,622
I can still attack
from a few positions,

65
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,792
but it looks like
I'm going to lose.

66
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:15,001
I should've cut him off
when I had the chance.

67
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:20,176
Now he's able to control the
center and the left side.

68
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,514
My stones in the center
are already dead.

69
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:23,650
How did this happen?

70
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:38,144
There's nothing I can do.

71
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,146
The game is over.

72
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:50,834
-You're still undefeated.

73
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:58,581
Whew.

74
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:00,919
I couldn't tell if that
was actually Akira.

75
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,223
You think it was him?

76
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:04,760
-Mm-hm.

77
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:05,260
It's him.

78
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:06,964
I'm sure of it.

79
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:08,033
-How'd he do?

80
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,034
Was he a tough opponent?

81
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:13,743
Sai?

82
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:14,511
-Yes.

83
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:15,780
He played a strong game.

84
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,653
His instincts for the
game are quite developed.

85
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:21,658
He's a patient opponent and
doesn't make impulsive moves

86
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:25,031
when his stones are in danger.

87
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:29,005
-It sounds like he's
gotten a lot better.

88
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,547
-He played well, but I am the
one who has become stronger.

89
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,883
-Huh?

90
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,654
-You too, Hikaru you're
much stronger now.

91
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:38,856
-Seriously?

92
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,125
-You've learned a lot.

93
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,129
You spent the entire summer
watching all of my matches.

94
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:46,805
We've both matured.

95
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:51,013
I have to say, this past month
has been extremely productive.

96
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:52,215
OGATA: So that was Sai.

97
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:56,055
Akira didn't have a chance.

98
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,028
He was outplayed at
every move I wonder

99
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:01,799
if I' even have a
chance against Sai.

100
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,839
It's hard to believe
he's an amateur.

101
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,110
But I've heard he's
online almost every day.

102
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,948
How could a pro have
so much free time?

103
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:11,985
The internet's allowing
him to remain anonymous.

104
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,765
Now that I've seen him
play, I'm sure of one thing.

105
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:22,071
He is much too
disciplined to be a child.

106
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:23,907
He was able to read
the entire board,

107
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,245
and never lost his focus.

108
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:27,982
Even the most
talented child ends up

109
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:30,753
making mistakes during a game.

110
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:32,824
And there were no
flaws in Sai's game.

111
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:34,226
It takes a lifetime
of experience

112
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,729
to achieve that level of skill.

113
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:46,316
-(VOICEOVER) Is it him?

114
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:51,299
No.

115
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,195
It can't.

116
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,934
There's no way it
could be Hikaru.

117
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:58,605
He came at me with everything
he had in the school tournament,

118
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:01,377
and I won easily.

119
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,382
I've been chasing after
him for so long, but why

120
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:07,255
does it feel like I've
finally caught up to him now?

121
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:07,889
No.

122
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:09,191
It's not Hikaru.

123
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:11,062
And it's not a kid, either.

124
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,969
But the, who?

125
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,137
Who just beat me?

126
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:24,253
Why would such a strong player
stay hidden in the shadows?

127
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:47,195
-I haven't seen you in a while.

128
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:50,302
So, how'd it go yesterday?

129
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,137
-Uh--

130
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,906
-Was the pro exam any fun?

131
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,775
How did you do?

132
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:54,810
-Uh--

133
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:55,912
-You won.

134
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:58,750
I shouldn't even bother asking.

135
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:02,290
-Well, I-- I missed
the first match.

136
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,059
-Great.

137
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:06,198
You missed the-- huh?

138
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:08,803
-I had already made plans
to play an online game,

139
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,807
so that took top priority.

140
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,345
-What were you thinking?

141
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:14,947
-Don't worry about it.

142
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:16,851
The exam hasn't finished.

143
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:18,187
I didn't fail.

144
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,925
There's another match tomorrow,
and I'm not going to miss it.

145
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,401
-Oh.

146
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,662
OK.

147
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:24,966
-Akira-sensei.

148
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,902
-Oh, hello, Mr. Hirosei.

149
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,206
-Good afternoon.

150
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:29,341
-How was the pro exam?

151
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,977
I hope that you won
your first match.

152
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,248
-Uh--

153
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:34,417
-That was a little rude of me.

154
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,186
I should know better
than to ask you

155
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,224
about the results of your match.

156
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:39,727
-Leave him alone.

157
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:42,198
He's got to stay focused on his
exams, so stop bothering him.

158
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:42,999
All right?

159
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,168
Now pay the entrance fee.

160
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,137
-No problem.

161
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,374
Here's your money.

162
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:48,309
Akira-sensei!

163
00:13:48,343 --> 00:13:49,945
One more thing.

164
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,248
-Yes?

165
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,853
-I happened to see a friend
of yours on my way down here.

166
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:56,124
It was the same boy that
beat you a while back.

167
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:58,695
What was his name?

168
00:13:58,729 --> 00:13:59,998
-Hikaru.

169
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:01,267
-Yeah, that's right.

170
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,273
I saw him in one of those
cafes that's full of computers.

171
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:09,082
You know, one of those places
people go to use the internet.

172
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:14,859
-Ah-- I've got to know!

173
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:16,261
Tell me, where did you see him?

174
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:17,263
-(MUFFLED) It was by--

175
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:38,737
AKIRA: I hope he's still there.

176
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,738
Is it him?

177
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:05,119
Hikaru!

178
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:06,054
Are you Sai?

179
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:16,040
-Huh?

180
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,328
Akira!

181
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:28,229
Why are you here?

182
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,112
-What is that?

183
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,147
-Huh?

184
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,783
I'm reading comics
on a manga website.

185
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:42,789
What's with the questions?

186
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:45,461
-Uh-- Huh?

187
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:47,298
-Is this a friend of yours?

188
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:48,200
-Yeah.

189
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:49,869
I guess we're friends.

190
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:50,336
Come on, Akira.

191
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,940
Let's go outside.

192
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,213
[nervous laughter]

193
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:02,993
-Man, what is your
problem, anyway?

194
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:04,062
Is this fun for you?

195
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,398
You always keep
sneaking up on me,

196
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,502
and it's really
starting to bug me.

197
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:08,837
Well, what is it today?

198
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:15,817
-Hm.

199
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,886
-(VOICEOVER) This is bad.

200
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,458
He thinks that I'm Sai.

201
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:21,561
-Have you ever played Go
on the internet before?

202
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:23,832
-Nope sorry.

203
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,402
-But you do know about it.

204
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:26,036
-Sure.

205
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,838
Who doesn't?

206
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:27,973
I saw a demonstration once.

207
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:29,844
Kimihiro took me to a
pro match, and some guy

208
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:31,080
had a computer set up.

209
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:35,621
(VOICEOVER) Huh?

210
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:36,924
He's backing off.

211
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:40,197
Maybe he doesn't know
who Sai is after all.

212
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,300
-Does the name Sai
mean anything to you?

213
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,970
He's an internet player.

214
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,274
I had a game against
him yesterday.

215
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:47,143
-Sai?

216
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:48,044
That sounds Japanese.

217
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:50,415
Doesn't it mean rhinoceros?

218
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:52,386
-It's his online name.

219
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:54,623
Every player on the
internet is looking for him.

220
00:16:54,857 --> 00:16:58,163
People all over the world are
trying to figure out who he is.

221
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:01,936
-What's this got to do with me?

222
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,876
Oh, man.

223
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:06,145
I see what you're getting at.

224
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:09,584
You came here because you
thought I was, uh, Sai, right?

225
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:11,889
I guess I can't really
blame you for thinking that.

226
00:17:11,922 --> 00:17:13,324
After all, I did beat you.

227
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:16,531
You remember that game, right?

228
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:18,267
-Correct me if I'm
wrong, but didn't

229
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,271
I defeat you at the
school tournament?

230
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:22,408
I had overestimated your skill.

231
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,343
-Ah!

232
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,512
That game?

233
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,449
I didn't care much about
it, so I lost on purpose.

234
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:28,386
-Why even play if
you don't try to win?

235
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:30,957
If you had the talent and
ability of a player like Sai,

236
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,161
you'd turn pro and
win a title or two.

237
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:36,167
Instead of wasting your time
reading comics on a computer.

238
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,436
-I couldn't have said it better.

239
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,172
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

240
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:49,158
So, what else you want to know?

241
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:50,594
-My instincts were right.

242
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:53,233
There's no way you could be Sai.

243
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:54,435
-What's that supposed to mean?

244
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:56,171
You don't think I'm
good enough to beat

245
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:58,375
all those players
on the internet?

246
00:17:58,408 --> 00:17:59,544
-I'm sorry.

247
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:02,450
I shouldn't have started
an argument with you.

248
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,921
I'll leave you alone.

249
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:06,457
I'm not going to
bother you anymore.

250
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,327
You'll never have
to see me again.

251
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:09,930
-Huh?

252
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,667
[car horn]

253
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,188
-Oh, no.

254
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:28,565
Hey, wait up!

255
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:29,199
Akira!

256
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:42,090
Now, listen!

257
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,370
If you keep on chasing
your phantom image of me,

258
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,274
one day I'm gonna
catch up to you!

259
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,954
-Is that so?

260
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:09,374
Why wait until then?

261
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:10,977
Why don't we play
a game right now?

262
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,382
-Hmph.

263
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:50,451
What a jerk.

264
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:08,016
-Huh?

265
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,094
Your friend?

266
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:16,600
Where'd he go?

267
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,667
-I gotta go home.

268
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:20,073
It's late and I'm tired.

269
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:22,176
-Really?

270
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:24,180
HIKARU: Akira said that
people all over the world

271
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:25,716
are looking for you, Sai.

272
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:28,688
We should stop playing
on the internet.

273
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:29,290
I'm sorry.

274
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:35,735
I want to thank you for
all the help you gave me.

275
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,574
-Hikaru.

276
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:40,610
-I won't be coming
here for a while.

277
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:43,048
Summer break's almost done,
and school's starting soon.

278
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:56,841
[theme music]

279
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:27,377
HIKARU: Akari's been taking
Go classes all summer.

280
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,148
SAI: She's become quite
a talented player.

281
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,733
HIKARU: Yeah, maybe

282
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,535
SAI: And everyone will
be surprised to see

283
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:35,637
how much you've
improved, Hikaru.

284
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,839
HIKARU: I could be the best
player in the Go club now.

285
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:41,576
SAI: Yuuki and Kimihiro
may not agree with you.

286
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:44,780
Next time, Hikaru's
True Strength.

287
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:49,184
HIKARU: Then I'm gonna challenge
them and show them who's best.
