[theme music]

2
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,413
-It's Toya.

3
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,218
I can't believe it.

4
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,587
I have finally made it.

5
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,023
We're both pros now.

6
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,192
I wonder what he
thinks about that.

7
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,126
Toya!

8
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,294
Over here!

9
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,195
Finally we--

10
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,601
-That guy is such a jerk.

11
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,336
Who does he think
he is, ignoring you?

12
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,372
He makes me so mad.

13
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:22,009
Thinks he's better than
us 'cause he's doing OK.

14
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,043
Ahem.

15
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,645
Well, I guess he's
doing better than OK.

16
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:25,245
Darn.

17
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,556
-I won't just catch up to him.

18
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,158
I'll be better than him.

19
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,026
Mr. High and Mighty.

20
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,997
-This is cool.

21
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,267
The Otayai pairings
chart, right?

22
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,702
-Now, let's see.

23
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,670
Shindou.

24
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,071
Yeah, here we are.

25
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,007
Our first opponent
is gonna be Toya?

26
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,280
My first opponent
is gonna be Toya?

27
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:07,554
-Toya won't be able
to make it in today.

28
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,423
We just got a phone call.

29
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,658
The office is in a total panic.

30
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,694
Toya Meijin collapsed
and has been

31
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,362
rushed to the hospital
in an ambulance.

32
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,178
-Yes?

33
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,080
Yes.

34
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,748
-No one has ever come
closer to playing

35
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,451
the Divine Move than him.

36
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:41,088
-Next time we play, let's
make it an even game.

37
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,423
SAI (VOICEOVER): Yes, next time.

38
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:47,761
Now I wonder if I'll ever
have that chance to play him.

39
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,564
-And what's the name
of the hospital?

40
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,200
OK, got it.

41
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,003
Thanks for all your help.

43
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:57,537
-Well, Hikaru.

44
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,472
What did they say?

45
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,973
Is he going to be all right?

46
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,242
Tell me he's going
to be all right!

47
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,443
-Yeah.

48
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,145
But they're keeping him in
the hospital for a while.

49
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,179
-We have to go.

50
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,615
We have to make sure
he's going to be OK.

51
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:09,316
-Sure.

52
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,117
We might as well.

53
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,191
This is it.

54
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,093
Um.

55
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,728
-We haven't got time
for you to um and ah!

56
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,130
We need to find him!

57
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,598
-How am I supposed
to know where he is?

58
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:28,535
-You're absolutely sure this
is the right place, Hikaru?

59
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,171
-This is the hospital the
Go Association told me

60
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,272
about when I called.

61
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,575
-He is going to be
all right, isn't he?

62
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,444
-Excuse me.

63
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,842
Can you tell me the place where
I can find one of the patients?

64
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:41,448
-Yes! Where is it?

65
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,082
-Sure.

66
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,150
Which unit?

67
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,352
-Which unit?

68
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,686
Sai, do you know?

69
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,420
-Hm?

70
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,288
You're asking me?

71
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,389
How on Earth should I know?

72
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,124
-If you tell me the
name of your friend,

73
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,425
I'm sure I can find out.

74
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,627
-Toya Meijin.

75
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,728
You heard of him?

76
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,597
He was brought to this
hospital three days ago.

77
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,300
HIROSE: I got such a shock when
I heard you had a heart attack.

78
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,004
I can't tell you how relieved I
am that it's not that serious.

79
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,405
-We were so concerned.

80
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,641
-You're not as young as
you used to be, Sensei.

81
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,143
You should really start
taking things easier.

82
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,311
-I know.

83
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,380
And I apologize for making
you worry, Mr. Hirose.

84
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,448
-It wasn't just me
that got a shock.

85
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,417
All the players at
the Go salon have

86
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,186
been worried sick about you.

87
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,087
-As soon as your wife
phone us with the news,

88
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,422
the whole place
went into a panic.

89
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,491
I've never seen
anything like it.

90
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,594
-The panic went far beyond
your Go salon, Ms. Ichikawa.

91
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,095
It was headline news.

92
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,665
The entire world of Go
was holding its breath

93
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,732
for some time.

94
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,568
-And didn't this happen
the day before you

95
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,704
were supposed to play the
third game in the Judan series?

96
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,007
-You're his opponent in
that series, Ogata-sensei.

97
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,742
What did you do when
you heard he collapsed?

98
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,644
It must've been difficult.

99
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,680
-First of all, I made
sure someone brought me

100
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,748
frequent updates
on his condition.

101
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,717
Then the staff and I
decided to head out

102
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,752
to the championship
venue over in Ehime.

103
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,591
We were hoping his
condition would improve

104
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:01,027
and he'd be able to
continue the series.

105
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,697
So I waited there, and the
next day, the staff finally

106
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,699
decided that Toya
Meijin would have

107
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,300
to lose the game by default.

108
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,305
-If the venue had been closer,
somewhere like Shizuoaka,

109
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,373
I could have made it.

110
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,708
That was the first
thing I thought

111
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,576
about when I came round.

112
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,644
-Oh my.

113
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,346
-Sensei, you've just
had a heart attack.

114
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,647
You've got to take it easy.

115
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,215
-Game four's coming.

116
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,283
Soon.

117
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,019
Sensei, do you think
you'll be playing?

118
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,487
-Of course I will.

119
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,257
Although the doctor didn't look
very pleased when I told him

120
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,625
I had to be out of here by then.

121
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,525
[knocking]

122
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,426
-Huh?

123
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,461
ICHIKAWA: Come in.

124
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,428
-Hi.

125
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,597
I hope you don't
mind me dropping by.

126
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,732
Whoa!

127
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,033
This is some hospital room.

128
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,137
Uh, hello.

129
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:44,738
-Hikaru Shindou.

130
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,306
-I remember you.

131
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,442
-Well, I think it's time you
and I headed out, Ms. Ichikawa.

132
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,677
-Please don't go because of me.

133
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,178
I won't stay long.

134
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,281
I just dropped by because I
wanted to see if you were OK,

135
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,248
Toya-sensei.

136
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,017
-I never expected
someone like you

137
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,518
would come here and visit him.

138
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,587
-Well, the thing
is, I-- (VOICEOVER)

139
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,089
I can't tell them I'm here
because Sai begged me to come.

140
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,395
-Ogata-sensei, that wasn't
a very nice thing to say.

141
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,431
After all, the boy made
the effort to see him.

142
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,399
-Oh!

143
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,566
I didn't bring you anything.

144
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,334
Uh, hold on!

145
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:16,269
-Come back. It's OK.

146
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,505
-I hear you're a pro now too.

147
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,706
-What?

148
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,374
-Don't you remember me?

149
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,244
I work at the Go salon where
you had a game against Akira.

150
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,279
I know it's been a
long time since then.

151
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,456
Is this your first time here?

152
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,159
-Yeah, everything in
this place is new to be.

153
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,427
Can anybody play?

154
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,761
-Certainly.

155
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,463
Just write your name
down here, please.

156
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,169
-Hey, there's a kid over there.

157
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,370
Can I play him?

158
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:56,109
-I know he's your
age, but-- Considering

159
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,211
how you managed to beat
Akira way back then,

160
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,281
it's hardly surprising you
decided to become a pro.

161
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,317
-I wish I could have been
there to see that game.

162
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,987
Akira won't tell me
anything about it,

163
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,356
and none of the customers who
were there watching the game

164
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,623
remember much.

165
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,292
They just knew who the winner
was, and that's about it.

166
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,494
-It looks like Toya-sensei
and Ogata-sensei

167
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,230
don't have a clue what
actually happened.

168
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,631
-I was the one who
played that game.

169
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,166
Not you, Hikaru.

170
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,004
-Yeah, if they found that
out, I'd be in big trouble.

171
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,672
-I suggest you
change the subject.

172
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,407
-Right.

173
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,010
The guys at the Go
Association told me

174
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,181
you'd had a heart attack
or something, so uh--

175
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,984
-That's true, but there's
nothing wrong with me now.

176
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,353
They want me to stay in here
for another 10 days or so,

177
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:44,224
just to be on the safe side.

178
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,325
-Sensei.

179
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,093
You should consider taking
the whole month off.

180
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,995
Not just 10 days.

181
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,296
-Absolutely.

182
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,198
If you need, you can always
travel to the championship game

183
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,266
from here.

184
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,634
-It's not like you
won't be able to play

185
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,369
Go while you recuperate.

186
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,671
Isn't that right, Sensei?

187
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:03,043
-How is he going to
be able to do that?

188
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,310
-With this.

189
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,147
I persuaded the hospital to
allow me to set this up for him

190
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:07,580
yesterday.

191
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,549
-A laptop?

192
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,651
-I thought it would help
relieve some of the boredom

193
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,620
if he could play
Go on the internet,

194
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,256
and he quite liked the idea.

195
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,392
-Toya-sensei, do you even
know how to use a computer?

196
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,693
-No, not really.

197
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,030
He taught me how to play Go
on it, but that's all so far.

198
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,231
-Well, well, well.

199
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:29,202
Even the great Toya
Meijin is playing online.

200
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,005
Maybe I should give
it a try some time.

201
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,608
-So, you've been playing
Go on the internet?

202
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:39,446
-I don't see why you're
all so surprised.

203
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:43,316
Go is my game, after all.

204
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,017
-Internet Go.

205
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,218
Hm.

206
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,220
HIROSE: Well, Ms.
Ichikawa, I think

207
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,555
it's time we were on our way.

208
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,290
ICHIKAWA Yes, I
suppose you're right.

209
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,526
OGATA: I'd better
get going, too.

210
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,462
-Do you want me to drop
some of these presents

211
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,763
off at your house
on my way home?

212
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,565
I've got a car with me today.

213
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,567
It wouldn't be any trouble.

214
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,235
-That'd be very helpful.

215
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,069
Thank you.

216
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,137
OGATA: I'll give you a hand.

217
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,538
-Thanks.

218
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,439
Well, goodbye for now.

219
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,018
-Since Ms. Ichikawa is stopping
by Toya-sensei's place,

220
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,287
how about I drive
you home instead?

221
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,555
-That's very kind of you.

222
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,023
I appreciate that.

223
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,726
-I've got a feeling that Shindou
plays a bit of internet Go,

224
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,627
himself.

225
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,295
-What do you mean?

226
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,465
Is there something unusual about
him playing Go on the internet?

227
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,535
-I was just thinking of the
time when Mr. Hirose saw him

228
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,137
in an internet cafe.

229
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,271
-Oh, yes, I remember.

230
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,672
That was a long time ago.

231
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,442
And I only got a glimpse
of him from the outside.

232
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,210
I didn't actually go in.

233
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,146
-When Mr. Hirose came
back to the Go salon,

234
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,648
he happened to mention
that he'd seen Shindou.

235
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,551
Akira overheard him telling
me, asked where the cafe was,

236
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,019
and then rushed out.

237
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:53,686
-Yes.

238
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,555
That's right, that's right.

239
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,992
He ran out of the place like
his life depended on it.

240
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,060
-This is the first
I've heard of it.

241
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:05,165
So did Akira happen to get
to the cafe and see Shindou?

242
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,466
-I've got no idea.

243
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,700
-You don't know?

244
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,335
-Akira didn't say
anything about it

245
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,437
to me when he got
back to the Go salon.

246
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,140
-Can you remember how
long ago this was?

247
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,375
-Oh, let's see.

248
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,210
About two years ago.

249
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,412
Akira was at the Go
salon during the daytime,

250
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,714
so it must have been
during the summer break.

251
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,049
Yes, that's it.

252
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,319
Two summers ago, near the
end of the summer break.

253
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,123
OGATA: Two summers
ago, playing Go online.

254
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,992
That was around the
time Akira played Sai.

255
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,296
When he heard Shindou was in the
internet cafe, he rushed out.

256
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,000
Did he think there was
some sort of connection

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,604
between Sai and Shindou?

258
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,740
Perhaps he even suspected
that Sai and Shindou

259
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,008
were one in the same!

260
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:07,319
-It was very good
of you to come.

261
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:11,223
Sit down, make
yourself comfortable.

262
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:13,291
You were scheduled to
play a game with Akira

263
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:15,260
on the day I collapsed, right?

264
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:17,496
I'm sorry if it caused
you any trouble.

265
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,531
-It's OK.

266
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:22,067
-It's unusual for
Akira to skip a game.

267
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,203
I guess he thought he
couldn't concentrate properly.

268
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:29,875
I feel bad for making
him worry about me.

269
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:33,311
-So, you've started
playing Go online?

270
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:35,080
-I would never have
even considered it

271
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:38,850
if I hadn't been lying in
this hospital bed for so long.

272
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,852
I only learned how
to use it yesterday,

273
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,355
but I managed to play
Akira this morning.

274
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,857
It's nice to be able to
have a game, despite being

275
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,125
stuck in here.

276
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,294
But you don't actually get
to feel the stones when

277
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:52,130
you play on the computer,
and I miss that.

278
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:54,499
It's not really my thing.

279
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:57,502
I doubt I'll much use for
it once I'm back home.

280
00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,504
-You're not going to
play online again?

281
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:01,106
Just while you're in here?

282
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:01,840
-That's right.

283
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:11,483
-I-- um-- I don't play Go
on the internet, either.

284
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:14,219
But the thing is, there's
this friend of mine

285
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,320
who's played lots of times.

286
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,225
And I know he'd
love to play you.

287
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,193
He's wanted to forever.

288
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:30,402
And the name he uses
when he plays is Sai.

289
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,972
S-A-I. calls himself Sai.

290
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:38,977
-Hikaru--

291
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:45,784
-I've already heard of him.

292
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,160
I remember Ogata showing me a
game Sai played against Akira

293
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:58,930
on the internet a
couple of years ago.

294
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,532
AKIRA: There's
nothing I can see do.

295
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:01,500
The game is over.

296
00:14:06,104 --> 00:14:09,975
-And you say he's
a friend of yours?

297
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,209
-Yes.

298
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,979
-But Hikaru--

299
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:16,515
-Please don't tell
anyone about me and Sai.

300
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:18,250
Don't tell anyone
that I know him.

301
00:14:18,283 --> 00:14:20,118
It's just that Sai's
been wanting the chance

302
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,520
to play against
you, Toya-sensei,

303
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:23,355
for a very long time.

304
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:26,124
The problem is he only
ever plays on the internet.

305
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:27,392
So maybe you could--

306
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:29,494
-Why does he only play online?

307
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,495
-Uh--

308
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,998
-Why is he hiding
behind a computer?

309
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:36,201
I'd like to know his real name.

310
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:38,303
-His real name?

311
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,905
-Does he intend to
remain anonymous?

312
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,479
He's not a pro, is he?

313
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,915
-No, just a friend.

314
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:51,383
-It's quite normal
for players who

315
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:54,119
think they've reached a certain
level to want to try their hand

316
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:56,521
playing against a
professional, but I

317
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:59,024
don't like being kept in
the dark about your friend's

318
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:00,125
identity.

319
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,526
There's no reason for it.

320
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:08,433
Tell your friend I'd
be happy to play him.

321
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:09,801
But only in person.

322
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:10,898
Not online.

323
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:14,839
-I blew it, Sai.

324
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,107
I'm sorry.

325
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:18,476
-But I am here in person!

326
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,945
Bring out a Go board and stones.

327
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:22,781
I have to play him
while I'm here.

328
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:29,788
-But Sai-- You said
you saw the game

329
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:31,990
Sai played against Akira, right?

330
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,393
So you kind of got an idea
how strong a player he is.

331
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,295
-Yes, I could see his strength.

332
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:39,464
But the main reason
Akira lost was

333
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:42,067
because he read the game wrong.

334
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,237
If I'd been playing,
I'd have won.

335
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:48,373
Of course, there's only one way
to find out his true strength,

336
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,175
and that's to play him myself.

337
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,410
-Then go ahead and
give him a game!

338
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:55,080
Just one game is all I'm asking.

339
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:57,249
But online.

340
00:15:57,282 --> 00:16:02,287
Because he-- well, he-- He can
only play Go on the internet.

341
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:12,230
-All right, then.

342
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:13,531
-Huh?

343
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,201
-It'll be a nice distraction
from the pressure of the Judan

344
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:17,235
championship games.

345
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,979
-I recall Sai.

346
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:30,515
The player who caused such
a sensation when he went

347
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,117
online a couple of summers ago.

348
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:38,189
Why are the players so restless?

349
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:40,225
-It seems there's a great
player on the internet,

350
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:41,259
and nobody knows his name.

351
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,193
-Is that so?

352
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:44,229
-He calls himself Sai.

353
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:46,798
-His strategies
are really unusual.

354
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:50,502
His playing style reminded me
a lot on the Honinbo Shusaku.

355
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:53,371
-Are you joking?

356
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:55,073
-Shusaku's abilities
were unmatched.

357
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:56,775
-I've seen a lot of Sai's games.

358
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,243
The more I study him,
the more I notice

359
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:00,345
how much he's like Shusaku.

360
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:02,981
I bet you're all thinking
I'm totally crazy.

361
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,416
After reviewing
all of his matches,

362
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,451
I discovered he was
getting stronger.

363
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,453
It's hard to predict
how good he'll become.

364
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,389
He hasn't been defeated yet.

365
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,825
If Shusaku had
learned modern joseki,

366
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,760
I bed he'd play a lot like Sai.

367
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:21,166
OGATA (VOICEOVER): When I
heard that Sai might be a kid,

368
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,903
it crossed my mind that
it could be Shindou.

369
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:31,876
But then again-- when I saw
Shindou play in the Young Lions

370
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,481
tournament, I got no
sense of Sai's ability.

371
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,851
I'm convinced Shindou isn't Sai.

372
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,954
But in that case, who is he?

373
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:45,857
Once, some guy showed up
online pretending to be Sai,

374
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,525
but he didn't last long.

375
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,028
The real Sai has kept
a very low profile

376
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:51,296
these past couple of years.

377
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:57,168
I don't normally give players
who don't show for two years

378
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,471
a seconds thought, but
I'm intrigued by him.

379
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:00,839
Where has he gone?

380
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,341
The question is, does he
even play Go on the internet

381
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,777
anymore?

382
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,545
-A nice distraction, am I?

383
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:17,288
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai, I got
you a game with him, didn't I?

384
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:19,124
Huh?

385
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:19,891
Thanks.

386
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,059
That's great.

387
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:23,528
But promise you won't tell
anyone that I know Sai.

388
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:25,530
I need you to keep
it a secret, OK?

389
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,799
-I won't tell anyone.

390
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:30,001
Your friend obviously
has his reasons

391
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:32,971
for wanting to remain
anonymous, but I don't approve.

392
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:35,840
I have to say it makes
me very suspicious.

393
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:40,078
I'm only agreeing to do this
because you're so insistent.

394
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,881
So, when would your
friend like to play?

395
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,549
HIKARU: Any time you like.

396
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:45,784
What about tomorrow?

397
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:47,419
Is that OK with you?

398
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:48,853
-Hold on.

399
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:51,222
I need a bit more time to
get used to the computer.

400
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,558
Clicking buttons is nothing
like having a proper Go

401
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:54,926
stone in your hand.

402
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,961
-Uh, next week, then?

403
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,463
TOYA MEIJIN: Yes,
that should be fine.

404
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:01,266
The fourth game of the
Judan series is on Thursday.

405
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,134
How does the following
Saturday sound?

406
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:06,070
It'll give me a day to rest.

407
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,840
That way it won't interfere
with the important fifth game

408
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:11,376
of the series the
following week.

409
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:13,211
SAI: Who does he think he is?

410
00:19:13,244 --> 00:19:14,546
I don't want to
play if he's just

411
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:18,016
going to consider me
as an afterthought.

412
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:20,018
-Sai.

413
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:23,021
Toya Sensei, you're going to
play your best against Sai,

414
00:19:23,021 --> 00:19:23,455
right?

415
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:25,123
-But of course.

416
00:19:25,156 --> 00:19:27,559
-'Cause I don't want to make
you to make the excuse that you

417
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,861
weren't taking it seriously
when you lose the games.

418
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:32,997
-Oh, I'm going to
lose the game, am I?

419
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:33,932
-Sorry.

420
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,467
I meant if.

421
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,202
-There's no if.

422
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:40,171
I'm not going to lose this game.

423
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:44,409
If I lose, I'll retire
from professional Go.

424
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,010
-You're just joking, right?

425
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:49,914
I mean, you wouldn't
seriously retire if you lost?

426
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:53,251
-You honestly seem to believe
that I might lose this game.

427
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:56,354
If you're serious
about it, then so am I.

428
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,890
-No, I didn't actually
mean it like that!

429
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,925
-I've made up my mind.

430
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,994
If I lose to your
friend, then I will

431
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,363
retire as a professional player.

432
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:06,865
I won't play again.

433
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:08,933
-He'd actually retire?

434
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:10,869
-Why are you making
such a big deal of it?

435
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,104
I never asked you to do that!

436
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:15,440
-The game will take place
one week from today.

437
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:17,075
We will begin at
10:00 in the morning

438
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:19,244
and have a time limit
of three hours each.

439
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:23,848
I'll ask the hospital staff to
bar all visitors for the day.

440
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:25,850
How does that sound to you?

441
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:28,152
-But, Sensei-- I
didn't mean that!

442
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:30,321
-Do you want me to play
your friend or not?

443
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,023
This is the deal,
take it or leave it.

444
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,292
You really should
keep your voice down.

445
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:36,094
This is a hospital, remember?

446
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:37,495
-But--

447
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:38,096
SAI: Hikaru.

448
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,401
HIKARU: Sai.

449
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:44,502
-Thank you for doing this.

450
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,313
[theme music]

451
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:22,834
SAI: It appears
that the Meijin will

452
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,235
use his real name while online.

453
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:25,536
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
But we wanted

454
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,871
to keep the game a secret.

455
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:28,773
Now everyone's gonna
find out about it.

456
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:29,874
SAI: And not just here.

457
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:31,142
All over the world!

458
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:34,846
Just imagine how many people
could be watching our game.

459
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:36,214
HIKARU: If this
gets to be too much,

460
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:38,216
I just might have
to cancel the game.

461
00:22:41,252 --> 00:22:44,155
Next time, The
Excitement Mounts!

462
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:48,292
SAI: Only when I face him will
my true strength be revealed.
