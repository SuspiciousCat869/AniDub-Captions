Shindo all of a sudden?

Is there something
I should know?

later in the finals.

On the last day, right?

Tell you what, Ochi,
if it's OK with you,

7
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:01,534
I could tutor you as
often as you like.

You're just using me!

Using my game to measure
Shindo's skill level.

11

-The pressure's really on
for me to make it this year.

12

You see, this is my last chance
to take the test as an insei.

Sai?

16
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:23,415
You should really start
paying more attention

17
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:24,718
or you're going to lose.

of greeting is that?

Well, you know, this

00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,310
is a really important
match for both of us.

Isumi's still undefeated.

And I've only lost
one game so far.

27

that'll be two against me.

Adachi, Waya, and Ochi.

Shindo's game has improved.

one of the top insei,

happen like that.

get on the roll at just

the right moment and
somehow make it through.

I went over and had
a look at your board.

You seem to be playing
very cautiously.

being a little cautious?

do with you, Ochi?

-I was just wondering
if maybe we've

overestimated how
good Shindo really is.

159
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,566
-You heard Ijima and
Komiya say that Shindo

160
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:47,237
has gotten a lot stronger.

161
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,142
I know they're not in
the same league as him,

162
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,914
but their opinion should at
least count for something.

163
00:11:51,914 --> 00:11:53,918
-I don't really care
what those two say.

164
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:56,625
But to care about Toya's
opinion is a different matter.

165
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:58,262
-You met Toya?

166
00:11:58,295 --> 00:11:59,464
-It's no big deal.

167
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:01,602
My grandfather always setting
up study sessions for me

168
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:02,704
with the pros.

169
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:04,642
Toya 2-Dan was over at
our house for a session

170
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:05,544
just the other night.

171
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:13,060
The only thing he was
interested in was Shindo.

172
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:16,067
It was like he was trying to
get some inside info on a rival.

173
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,938
When I told him the
last time I played

174
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,710
Shindo was about three
months ago, he got all snooty

175
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:23,951
and said that was
a long time ago.

176
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:25,956
It just doesn't make any sense.

177
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:26,958
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Toya.

178
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,574
-Hm?

179
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:36,511
Isumi?

180
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,717
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): It
was a long time ago.

181
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,621
I guess Toya's right.

182
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:43,995
I think I remember.

183
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,298
-He wanted to play against me.

184
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,570
So he forced them into
letting him play third.

185
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:48,572
-Huh?

186
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:50,109
-Huh?

187
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:51,244
-Forced them?

188
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:51,712
-You got it.

189
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:52,581
I'm telling you.

190
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:54,385
That's the sort of guy he is.

191
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:56,523
I'm Toya's rival, and he's mine.

192
00:12:56,556 --> 00:13:00,464
Why would I ever make
something like that up?

193
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:02,001
ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
Everyone assumed

194
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,738
he was just trying to
show off because he

195
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:05,142
was the new guy in class.

196
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:10,553
Back in the Young
Lions tournament,

197
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:14,262
I remember Toya was watching
Shindo's game for a while.

198
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:17,502
I thought it was just a
coincidence he was there.

199
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:20,575
But if what Ochi says
is true, then maybe

200
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:22,112
it wasn't a coincidence at all.

201
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:30,097
Maybe he really does
see Shindo as his rival.

202
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,337
It can't be true.

203
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:35,308
But then again,
I've had a suspicion

204
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:38,448
that there's more than
meets the eye with Shindo

205
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:41,722
ever since he played
against that kid Su-Young.

206
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:45,463
At one point, we all thought
he made a big mistake.

207
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:46,298
-Huh?

208
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:46,782
Huh!

209
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:50,223
ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
That move Shindo

210
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:52,528
made earlier wasn't
a mistake at all.

211
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:57,338
He was anticipating battle
for the upper left corner.

212
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,278
If he plays as well as
he did in that game,

213
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:02,416
I don't know if I can beat him.

214
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,721
I'm not even sure if I could
play as well as Su-Young.

215
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:10,166
When Shindo first
became an insei,

216
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,776
no one ever imagined
he'd make it this far.

217
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:18,485
Unless Toya-- could he?

218
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:20,757
Could he have known?

219
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,396
Did he see Shindo's potential?

220
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,335
Has Toya been chasing after
the player Shindo would become?

221
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,581
-The last guy I
played was so bad,

222
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:33,351
it made me wonder
why he was bothering

223
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:35,856
to take the pro exam
in the first place.

224
00:14:35,856 --> 00:14:37,460
We've all noticed it.

225
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:39,764
It's almost like he was
only allowed into the finals

226
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:42,738
so everyone could have a chance
to win at least one game.

227
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:44,575
He was terrible.

228
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:45,677
-Isumi!

229
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:46,513

Hey there, Waya.

231

-I think we should
head back now.

The afternoon session
will be starting soon.

ISUMI (VOICEOVER): OK,
got to keep confident.

-Hm?

236
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:10,332
Something's bothering him.

237
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:12,637
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): That game
against Su-Young was a fluke.

238
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:17,313
Shindo was just having
a lucky day, that's all.

239
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:19,485
Stay focused.

240

OCHI (VOICEOVER): Hm.

253
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:50,753
Now, that's done, I wonder how
Shindo and Isumi are doing?

They're still at it.

Isumi definitely
has the advantage.

Shindo must be
getting desperate.

Isumi's used up all
of his allotted time.

262
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,556
Now, he's only got
one minute per move.

263
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:27,801
I doubt the time factor
will affect his game.

264
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:30,506
But you never know what might
happen when the pressure's on.

265
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,732
Shindo has definitely gotten
stronger, but not strong enough

266
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:44,571
to be a threat to Toya.

267
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:49,015
I don't need extra study lessons
with Toya to beat Shindo.

268
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,818
Isumi's the one I
need to worry about.

But I don't play him
till the next week.

In the meantime, I've
got Waya to deal with.

He's definitely one
to watch out for.

He's already beaten Honda
and seems to be playing well.

Don't panic.

Shindo to make a comeback now.
