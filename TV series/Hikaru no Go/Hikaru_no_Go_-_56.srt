[theme song]

2
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:53,464
TOYA (VOICEOVER): So this
is the notorious Sai.

3
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,889
Amazing.

4
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:20,624
-Toya.

5
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,426
-Toya Meijin.

6
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,828
-And he's playing Sai.

7
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,935
-Your big game isn't
until next week.

8
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:33,704
You know, I don't mind you
dropping by and spending time

9
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:38,676
with me, but you could at least
pretend you like being here.

10
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,479
You don't have to be so
serious all the time.

11
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,315
-Yeah, but right now,
I have to focus on go.

12
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:47,685
-You're no fun.

13
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:50,388
Being all tense isn't
going to help you win.

14
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:51,455
But it's your choice.

15
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:53,858
I'll still be cheering for you.

16
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,727
-I bet you don't even remember
what title I'm playing for.

17
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,671
OGATA (VOICEOVER): I let
the Honinbo Series slip

18
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,741
away from me in the final
game against Kuwabara-sensei.

19
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:13,477
I don't intend to
let it happen again.

20
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:16,047
-I think I'll swing by the
hospital on my way home.

21
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,948
Pay my Judan Series
opponent a quick visit.

22
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:19,450
See how he's doing.

23
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,363
-He's not allowed any visitors?

24
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:37,935
Excuse me.

25
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,303
Is everything OK?

26
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:41,338
Is Toya-sensei all right?

27
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:43,707
-Oh, you mean
because of the sign?

28
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,543
Everything's fine with him.

29
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,580
We only put the sign up because
Mr. Toya asked us to yesterday.

30
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,848
-He asked you to?

31
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:53,417
-He said he didn't want to be
disturbed by anyone all day,

32
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:55,319
not even his family.

33
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,855
He's been taking this
internet go very seriously,

34
00:04:57,888 --> 00:04:59,857
especially today.

35
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:00,858
-Internet go?

36
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:02,560
-Yes.

37
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,261
He's involved in a game.

38
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:06,497
I went into his room to
pick up the lunch tray,

39
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,666
but he hadn't touched his plate.

40
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,835
Are all professional
go players like this?

41
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:20,377
-Who could he be playing with
that would be important enough

42
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,746
to turn away visitors?

43
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,717
And he asked them to put up
a sign for him yesterday.

44
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:28,519
Which means he
knew ahead of time

45
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:29,920
that he'd be playing this game.

46
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,692
When did he arrange it?

47
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,260
And with who?

48
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,698
Oh, there it is.

49
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:46,757
Sai.

50
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:14,698
-Toya-sensei is taking
his time with this one.

51
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:15,900
-I don't see why.

52
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,768
They're already in the early
stages of the end game.

53
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:20,404
Wouldn't expanding here be
the safest move for him?

54
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:20,938
-Hm.

55
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:23,040
You could be right.

56
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:24,308
-So why the delay?

57
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,576
We must be missing something.

58
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:28,679
Hey, why don't we set
up the game on a board?

59
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:29,280
-Sure.

60
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:37,655
-You're not going
down to the hospital?

61
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,691
-Your father told me
not to bother him today.

62
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:41,458
-Hm?

63
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:43,561
Really? How come?

64
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:45,963
-He said he wants to play a
game of go on the internet

65
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:48,032
without any interruptions.

66
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:52,970
-He didn't just log on
randomly and start playing.

67
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,307
He arranged the game
with Sai ahead of time.

68
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,274
-Huh?

69
00:06:57,308 --> 00:06:59,009
Toya-sensei is
threatening a cut?

70
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,010
-From that side?

71
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,011
-Interesting.

72
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,513
-You mean here.

73
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:06,350
You know, that seems
a bit unusual to me.

74
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:07,418
-Not really.

75
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:08,786
I bet he's going to
return to this spot

76
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,322
after he's taken more territory.

77
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:12,690
-That's a possibility.

78
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,558
Unless he wants to settle
this area in Sentei,

79
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:16,594
then shift to the
right hand side.

80
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,929
-I still think expanding
is the way to go.

81
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:21,332
-Either way, looks good to me.

82
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:22,433
-I don't know.

83
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:24,768
I think Toya has the
right idea on this one.

84
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,270
-Whatever.

85
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,706
Black's got this game in the
bag as long as he plays safe.

86
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,874
-It does look like
black's got the advantage,

87
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,810
but the game's still very close.

88
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,312
Toya Meijin knows that he
won't beat his opponent

89
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:37,982
by playing conservatively.

90
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:40,284
-I bet he wants to
attack white's territory

91
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:42,319
at the top of the
board before moving on

92
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,821
to gain some of his own.

93
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,322
-Could be.

94
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:47,791
I can't believe the way Sai's
managing to read this game.

95
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:50,327
It's like he's got a sixth
sense about what his opponent is

96
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:51,795
going to do, and
is able to come up

97
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:54,698
with a plan to stay in control.

98
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:56,467
He's always in control.

99
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,502
There's no way he'd let
this game come to an end

100
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:01,438
without fighting back
to regain the lead.

101
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:05,709
That's how he plays, always.

102
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:08,946
-The way you're talking
sounds like you know Sai.

103
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,019
-I played an online game with
him a couple of summers ago.

104
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:18,022
As soon as the game was over,
he disappeared off the internet.

105
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:21,725
No one knew if or when he'd
ever show himself again.

106
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,462
-The Sai you played is the
same guy who's playing today?

107
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:27,264
-And here he is,
playing your father.

108
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:42,646
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): My father
made plans to play against Sai.

109
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,953
Does that mean he
actually knows him?

110
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,689
The only time he
left the hospital

111
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:53,424
was when they allowed
him to be released

112
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:56,593
for the fourth game
of the Judan Series.

113
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:58,329
Was that when he met
up with Sai to make

114
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:00,798
the arrangements
for a game online?

115
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,500
If not, it must
have been someone

116
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,569
who came to visit
him at the hospital.

117
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:07,004
He's had lots of visitors.

118
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:09,673
Was Sai one of them?

119
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:12,910
-Oh, I forgot to tell you.

120
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,846
I met one of your
friends at the hospital.

121
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,847
Nice boy.

122
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,849
He came to see if
your father was OK.

123
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:23,387
I think his name was Shindo.

124
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,924
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Shindo
was at the hospital.

125
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:27,558
No!

126
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:28,425
It can't be!

127
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,694
It's not possible!

128
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:33,464
There can't be a connection
between him and Sai.

129
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:40,738
OGATA (VOICEOVER): How could the
Meijin have arranged this game?

130
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:43,640
He must have done it in
person by meeting someone face

131
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:44,975
to face.

132
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:46,276
But how?

133
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,546
He doesn't have any
idea how to use email.

134
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,383
So it was either someone
who bumped into him when

135
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,518
we were playing at
the Judan Series,

136
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:57,721
or it was someone who paid
him a visit at the hospital.

137
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:02,960
No.

138
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,895
Shindo can't be Sai.

139
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:07,664
When I saw him play at the
Young Lions tournament,

140
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:11,769
his game was nowhere
as advanced as Sai's.

141
00:10:11,802 --> 00:10:14,438
Anyway, if he was
Sai, he would have

142
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:17,474
attracted far more
attention as an insei.

143
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:22,446
Still, even if they
aren't the same person,

144
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:26,817
it's possible Shindo
knows Sai's identity.

145
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,019
And if Shindo doesn't
know Sai, then there's

146
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:32,756
got to be someone else in our
circle who's connected to him.

147
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,560
How does someone play this
well against a major champion

148
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:40,764
with us knowing so
little about him?

149
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:43,567
Sai, who exactly are you?

150
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:01,009
-You've got to have some idea.

151
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,011
You've played him!

152
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:04,445
Who do you think this Sai is?

153
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:11,386
-Hikaru!

154
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:12,453
Are you Sai?

155
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:19,374
-Huh?

156
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:28,236
-I don't know who he is.

157
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:30,038
Nobody does.

158
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:31,539
-Whoever he is,
he must be really

159
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:34,042
good to do this well
against Toya-sensei.

160
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:36,244
He's one of the best
players in the world.

161
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:38,880
-Maybe Sai's a famous
pro in disguise.

162
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:41,883
-He could be from China
or Korea or somewhere.

163
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,151
-Hm.

164
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:44,552
Do you think you
can find out where

165
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:47,288
he's accessing
the internet from?

166
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:49,824
-Yeah, right.

167
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:52,160
If I knew something
more about computers,

168
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:53,394
maybe I could find out.

169
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:55,496
But you've got the wrong guy.

170
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,865
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): It's
definitely not Shindo.

171
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,267
Sai has the strength
of someone who's

172
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,236
been playing the
game for a long time.

173
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,973
When I think back to that game
on the internet two years ago,

174
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:08,309
it's almost like I can picture
him lurking in the darkness.

175
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,448
Yes, I can see you.

176
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:15,950
You're not Shindo.

177
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:17,852
Who are you?

178
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:22,356
And if you're not
Shindo, then-- then

179
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,860
why-- why is there
something about you that

180
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:26,894
reminds me of Shindo?

181
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:34,302
It was that first game
I played against him.

182
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,225
TOYA (VOICEOVER): Black
has the advantage,

183
00:12:57,258 --> 00:13:01,963
and the early part of the
endgame is coming to a close.

184
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:08,503
However, I can't afford to make
even the tiniest of errors.

185
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:12,140
Not against an
opponent like this.

186
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:17,145
I can feel an unusual air
surrounding this game.

187
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:21,382
With every move,
every stone-- hm.

188
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:24,118
I'm sure I've felt
this way before.

189
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:31,859
Yes, this intensity, this
pressure seems familiar.

190
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:32,795
What?

191
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:52,588
Hm?

192
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:06,227
-Now, that's a fantastic move.

193
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,329
-The white stone
can't be captured.

194
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:12,567
All that black territory, gone.

195
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,570
-It was close to
begin with, but now--

196
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:19,440
-I could be wrong, but it looks
like black's lost control.

197
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,910
-That move took a lot of guts.

198
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,412
Now that it's been
played, we can all

199
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:27,315
see how it was the best
possible move to make.

200
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:30,551
But how many people would
dare to play it, or even

201
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,254
have the foresight to see
the move in the first place?

202
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:19,433
-Toya-sensei is under pressure.

203
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:23,271
It's not like he's been playing
badly or anything, but now--

204
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:34,348
-The match has suddenly
become wide open!

205
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:36,017
-It's anyone's
game at this point!

206
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:37,418
-Oh, boy!

207
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:40,187
Is this possible?

208
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:42,556
-The game's even.

209
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,993
No, wait.

210
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:48,496
Toya Meijin-- he's losing!

211
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:25,366
TOYA (VOICEOVER):
We're approaching

212
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,201
the final part of the end game.

213
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:34,942
By my calculations, if we
play through to the end,

214
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:40,848
I'm going to lose the
game by half a point.

215
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:43,884
Unlike the battle
that preceded it,

216
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:46,320
the end game is
just a one way path.

217
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:49,423
The moves are still complex.

218
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:52,259
But barring any
careless mistakes,

219
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:55,363
there's only one
correct path to follow.

220
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:58,566
This opponent will
not make a mistake.

221
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:03,658
He already knows how the
game will end, and so do I.

222
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:19,220
-He resigned?

223
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:22,423
-Toya-sensei's been beaten?

224
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:23,958
-I don't believe it.

225
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,192
Sai won!

226
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:26,034
But that's--

227
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:31,932
-What did he resign for?

228
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:33,934
They were neck and neck!

229
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,070
-I know they were in the
final part of the end game,

230
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:37,605
but things were still so close.

231
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,306
I don't understand.

232
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,076
-He already knew how
it was going to end?

233
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:43,878
But there was only
half a point in it!

234
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:45,212
He could have fought back!

235
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,387
Unreal!

236
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,584
I can't get my head
around the fact

237
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:53,320
that Toya-sensei
actually resigned.

238
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,322
Unbelievable.

239
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:58,325
-Toya Meijin played a careful
game like he normally does,

240
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,428
and he didn't make any mistakes.

241
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:03,964
And yet Sai still defeated him.

242
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:07,134
Everything hinged on that
one big move he made,

243
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:10,204
and the way he
followed through on it.

244
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:11,505
Strange, though.

245
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:13,307
Was there really no way for
Toya-sensei to turn it around?

246
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,843
Maybe not.

247
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:20,114
No, there must have been a way!

248
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:21,482
Sai.

249
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:22,550
Who are you?

250
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:25,986
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Shindo.

251
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,561
It's certainly a possibility.

252
00:18:33,594 --> 00:18:35,529
It's the old Shindo.

253
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,031
I can see him in Sai.

254
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,103
But that doesn't
explain everything!

255
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:04,992
-It is finished.

256
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:06,460
Koyo Toya.

257
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:10,965
I could feel myself trembling
at each one of your moves-- not

258
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:16,570
out of fear, but with
excitement and joy.

259
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:19,106
I feel honored to have
had the opportunity

260
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:22,376
to play such a great player.

261
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,345
Thank you, Koyo Toya.

262
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,317
And thank you, Hikaru.

263
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:40,194
Hikaru?

264
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:41,161
-This move.

265
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:42,863
-Huh?

266
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:46,333
-Toya-sensei was anticipating
a cut here, in which case

267
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:50,404
it would totally be
the right place to go.

268
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:53,607
But what would have
happened if before that--

269
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:54,341
-Huh?

270
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:55,843
-He'd played inside.

271
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:57,311
The group in the corner.

272
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:58,312
You see?

273
00:19:58,345 --> 00:19:59,947
White would have
been forced to block.

274
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:04,318
That way, he'd have gained
more ground during the game.

275
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:06,520
So if black had played
inside the group first,

276
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:08,122
instead of protecting
his territory,

277
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:10,157
the game would have
been turned around.

278
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,492
You would have lost, Sai.

279
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:16,330
SAI (VOICEOVER): He's right.

280
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:18,599
Hikaru's right.

281
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:19,600
-Well, then?

282
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,569
What do you think?

283
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:30,144
SAI (VOICEOVER): Hikaru.

284
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:39,053
Now I understand.

285
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:44,925
The reason my spirit has
endured for a millennium

286
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:48,462
is so I could show
Hikaru this one game

287
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:52,933
and guide him toward
the divine move.

288
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,602
[theme song]

289
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:22,556
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Uh-oh.

290
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:24,224
Ogata's getting really mad.

291
00:22:24,258 --> 00:22:25,993
SAI (VOICEOVER): What
could have happened

292
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:27,161
to make him this upset?

293
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:29,063
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He
found out that I know you,

294
00:22:29,096 --> 00:22:30,931
and now he's asking
for a game against you!

295
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:33,167
SAI (VOICEOVER): He
won't be the only one.

296
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,468
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
So who do you

297
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:36,336
want your next opponent to be?

298
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,939
SAI (VOICEOVER): I don't know
how much longer I'll be here.

299
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:41,608
The sands of time
are calling me.

300
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:44,411
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Next
time, Let Me Play Sai.

301
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:48,048
SAI (VOICEOVER): I feel
my time is running short.
