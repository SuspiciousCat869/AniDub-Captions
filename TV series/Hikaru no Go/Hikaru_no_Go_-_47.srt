[theme music]

2
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,483
-It's raining?

3
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,990
[excited whispering]

4
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,065
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Waya won.

5
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:21,141
If Shindou loses, then I get
one final chance in a playoff.

6
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:29,349
[excited whispering]

7
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,317
-I think they're done!

8
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,507
HIKARU: Isumi quit
the study group?

9
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,511
-And that's not all.

10
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,713
He also quit being an Insei too.

11
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,748
Usually everyone who
graduates the program

12
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,084
stays around until
the end of March.

13
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,419
-How could he quit
his study group?

14
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,020
He's been going there forever.

15
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,188
He can't just give it up!

16
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,557
And if he's not going to
the Insei classes either,

17
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,060
then what's he
gonna end up doing?

18
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,661
Waya, did you try
talking to him?

19
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,163
-I couldn't?

20
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:19,599
I thought calling him would
be kind of awkward, you know?

21
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,168
I knew I should
say something, so I

22
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,737
tried to catch him at one
of the Insei sessions.

23
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,672
When I got there, I
couldn't see him anywhere,

24
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,542
and that's when Shinoda-sensei
told me Isumi had quit.

25
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,010
-Well, does he know why?

26
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,678
-What did he say?

27
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,181
He seemed to think it wasn't
such a bad idea for Isumi

28
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:34,681
to quit.

29
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,682
-Well, how come?

30
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,488
-Here.

31
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,556
Areful, it's hot.

32
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,256
-Sure.

33
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,391
Thanks a lot.

34
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,326
-Everyone has to deal
with it their own way.

35
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,602
In Isumi's case, he just
needs a bit of time and space

36
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,038
to figure out where he stands.

37
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,212
-Ah huh.

38
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,010
-Just because he's not playing
with other people right now

39
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,378
doesn't mean that
he can't continue

40
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,581
to study the game in other ways.

41
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,149
For a player at
his level, there's

42
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,585
a lot he can learn by
replaying and analyzing matches

43
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,520
from the past.

44
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,455
And it's important
to realize when

45
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,658
you should take some time off.

46
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,460
-That's what he thinks.

47
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,263
I don't know if it
makes any sense, though.

48
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,466
-Sounds like Sensei's
just making excuses.

49
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,569
I wonder if Isumi's really gonna
give up trying to become a pro.

50
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,139
WAYA: Sensei did say he
was pretty sure Isumi would

51
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,741
be taking the pro
exam again next year.

52
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:35,542
-Really?

53
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,409
-Yeah.

54
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,612
And he was totally serious.

55
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,481
He told me his future as a
Go player isn't in doubt,

56
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:45,752
and he's going to be playing
the game for a very long time.

57
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,154
-Don't worry about Isumi.

58
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,555
He can take care of himself.

59
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,558
Focus on doing the best
you can in your own game.

60
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:55,729
You're a pro now, after all.

61
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,198
-That was pretty much it.

62
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,633
-And you're a pro as well.

63
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,634
-Mhmm.

64
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,202
-So, anyway.

65
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,371
If you're interested, I
thought I could teach you

66
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,006
how to be a recorder today.

67
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,974
-What, like recording matches?

68
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,075
-Yeah.

69
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,144
As new pros, we might
get called in to do it,

70
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,147
although they don't often ask
kids who are still in school.

71
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,149
All pro matches are
officially recorded

72
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,051
from the third
qualifying round on.

73
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,520
-But I already know how
to keep a game record.

74
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,489
-It's different for the pros.

75
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,223
Look.

76
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,125
Here's an example.

77
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,426
-Whoa, what's all this?

78
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,229
You've got to record the time
they took for each move as well

79
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,697
as the total time for the game.

80
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,267
-Hikaru, are you
sure you're up to it?

81
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,269
-Then they also
need a time keeper.

82
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,103
-Waya.

83
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,471
You know how to do all this?

84
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,573
-Yeah, of course.

85
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,608
-How does someone like
you know about it, huh?

86
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,343
-What are you saying?

87
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,679
-Was this the only reason
you wanted to meet up today?

88
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,981
-I'm doing this as a
favor to help you out!

89
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,416
Do you understand me?

90
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,417
-But I--

91
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,152
-Do you want me help or not?

92
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,286
-OK, OK.

93
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,454
-Hikaru's on his way.

94
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,592
He's finally stepped into
the world of the pros.

95
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,428
-I thought being a pro was all
about playing lots of matches.

96
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,430
-When do you think I'll
get to play Toya, huh?

97
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,165
Any idea, Waya?

98
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,433
-No!

99
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,134
-But I'll get to play lots
of different people, right?

100
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,705
Like you or Mr. Saeki?

101
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,641
Or maybe even someone
like Toya Meijin.

102
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:15,810
-Yes.

103
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:17,012
What about him?

104
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,814
Do you really think we'll
get a chance to play him?

105
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,316
-Listen, Shindou.

106
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:23,652
It's gonna be at least five
years before you get anywhere

107
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,053
near people like that.

108
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:26,988
-But what if I keep
winning and winning?

109
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,590
Don't I get to play them then?

110
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,791
-Well, Waya?

111
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,493
-Well, of course if
you keep winning,

112
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:34,729
you're gonna reach
the top eventually.

113
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,731
But get a reality check.

114
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,733
Any player lower
than a Four-Dan never

115
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,869
gets past the second round.

116
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:41,703
-But now we're pros.

117
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:42,671
We've got a connection.

118
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:45,440
Me and Toya, me
and Toya's father!

119
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:46,708
-Yes, yes!

120
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:49,277
-We're all a part of
the same world now,

121
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:50,712
and one day I'll be
able to play them.

122
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:53,448
Me!

123
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,391
-Me?

124
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,055
-I wanna play Murakame Two-Dan
from the Young Lions Tournament

125
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:01,423
again.

126
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:02,857
And then there's Ogata
Nine-Dan, and that old guy

127
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,759
who's holding on to
the Honinbo title.

128
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:06,828
-Don't get carried away!

129
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,330
-Hikaru.

130
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:12,033
-But the one I want to play more
than anyone else is Akira Toya.

131
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:14,336
-What about me?

132
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,304
-At least he's a
lower ranked pro,

133
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,707
so you might actually have
a chance of playing him.

134
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,409
But we don't get to choose
any of our opponents.

135
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:22,811
-It's done by a draw?

136
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:24,446
-Where do I fit in?

137
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,480
-Hey!

138
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:26,748
I'll get to go head
to head in matches

139
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:30,318
against Shirakawa-sensei
and Morishita-sensei.

140
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:31,920
-You don't listen, do you?

141
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:34,422
The high Dan players are
way off in the future.

142
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:36,324
-But we're all connected, right?

143
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,660
Which means I'll get
to play them one day!

144
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:43,398
From now on, I'm living
in the world of the pros.

145
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:45,333
-He's right.

146
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:49,704
I'm not the one
connected to that world.

147
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:51,306
It's Hikaru.

148
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,809
It's him, and him alone.

149
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,978
What will happen if he
doesn't let me play anymore?

150
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:57,712
-All right, all right.

151
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:58,980
You've made your point.

152
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,716
-I bet you I'll get to the
level of Two-Dan before you.

153
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:15,664
-(VOICEOVER) I've got 10
minutes before the match starts.

154
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,420
Hm?

155
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:31,813
-Good morning, to
you, Zama Sensei.

156
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,982
-And a good morning to you, too.

157
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:52,334
You know, I don't think
I ever congratulated you

158
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:55,937
on winning your sixth
Meijin title in a row.

159
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,441
Allow me to offer my
congratulations now.

160
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:00,909
-Why, thank you.

161
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:02,844
-It's a shame you
let the opportunity

162
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:05,947
to challenge the Kisei title
slip through your fingers.

163
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,316
Perhaps you wore
yourself out by playing

164
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:10,585
too many matches, Toya-sensei.

165
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:13,321
-It's entirely possible
fatigue played a small part

166
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:14,656
in losing that final match.

167
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,926
But even if I didn't add the
Kisei title to my collection,

168
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,295
I can assure you, I'm
in very good shape,

169
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:23,398
mentally and physically,
for today's match.

170
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,633
-And what about your son?

171
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,069
I hear he's also
in very good shape.

172
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,637
He's managed to stay undefeated?

173
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:32,273
-Yes, He's currently
at 20 straight wins.

174
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:34,843
-Oh really?

175
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:37,545
-His last defeat was in
the Shincho Dan series

176
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,981
just before he
turned professional.

177
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:41,449
That was against you.

178
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:44,319
I'm sure you remember
the match well.

179
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:46,621
-So today is your
opportunity for revenge

180
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:47,756
on behald of your son.

181
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,732
-Please, after you, Zama Osa.

182
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:58,733
I insist.

183
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:14,015
KUWABARA: Ah!

184
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:16,985
-What is it, Kuwabara-sensei?

185
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:19,754
Something interesting
in the paper?

186
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:22,757
-I was just looking at the
results of the pro exam.

187
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:24,893
-Why are you looking at that?

188
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:27,429
KUWABARA: I see that
kid managed to pass.

189
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:30,799
So, his name is Shindou.

190
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:32,066
-I don't know him.

191
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,635
Who is he?

192
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:36,538
-He's just a kid I passed
in the hall a while ago.

193
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:39,808
-So, you don't really
know him, then?

194
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,777
-Well, it was right over there.

195
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,712
Let's see, about six months ago.

196
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:47,482
I was coming out
of the elevator,

197
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:49,017
and I saw a group
of kids standing

198
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:50,652
around who looked
like they were Insei.

199
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:54,823
[gasping]

200
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:09,437
KUWABARA: As I
walked past that boy,

201
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:14,008
I sensed there was something
extraordinary about him.

202
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,411
-That's quite a first
impression you had.

203
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,513
So you think the
kid shows promise?

204
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:19,047
-Yes.

205
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,882
Very promising.

206
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:25,720
He might be part of the new wave
that Ogata once talked about.

207
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:29,757
The new wave sweeping
across the country.

208
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,894
Very promising, indeed.

209
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:36,030
HIKARU: I can't
wait to get started!

210
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,365
The spring.

211
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:39,067
It all starts in the spring.

212
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,636
I wonder who's going to
be my first opponent?

213
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,339
Any ideas, Sai?

214
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,007
Huh?

215
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,609
Sai?

216
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,676
What's the matter?

217
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,345
Come on, let's play.

218
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:58,019
SAI (VOICEOVER):
Just as Hikaru is

219
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,022
anxious to start
playing other pros,

220
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:04,893
they're also anxious
awaiting his arrival.

221
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:06,928
They're not waiting for me.

222
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,836
They're waiting for Hikaru.

223
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:17,472
Hikaru.

224
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:18,840
Hikaru is the one.

225
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:30,818
KAWAI: You only came to see us
now to tell us you turned pro?

226
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:32,887
We've known about
that forever already.

227
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:34,055
-That hurts!

228
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:37,025
-How come you took so
long to come and tell us?

229
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:38,560
Don't forget it's
all thanks to me

230
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:40,662
you were able to turn
pro in the first place.

231
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:42,497
-What do you mean,
it's all thanks to you?

232
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:43,031
That's crazy!

233
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:44,766
-Why, you ungrateful--

234
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,934
-What's this?

235
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,870
-I can't believe a kid his
age passed the pro exam.

236
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,439
-I guess you never Shindou,
do you, Mr. Tarouchi?

237
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:54,008
He was playing here every
day during the summer break.

238
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:56,010
-You're not the only
person I played, Mr. Kawai.

239
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,613
-What was that?

240
00:12:58,613 --> 00:12:59,948
-All the resultts
from the pro exam

241
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:02,750
were published in Go
Weekly a while back.

242
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,019
Here, it's all in
that article there.

243
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,354
-Ah.

244
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:08,723
So this kid is Hikaru Shindou.

245
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:11,492
-Make sure you remember
me when you win a title.

246
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:14,729
I want you to say, I got where
I am today because of Mr. Kawai!

247
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:17,378
-I'll never say that!

248
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,314
-Yeah, win a title for us.

249
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:22,584
Better yet, win four,
like Toya Meijin.

250
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:23,718
-Oh, no.

251
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:25,553
He's going to be the
holder of five titles soon.

252
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:26,854
-What's that?

253
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:28,590
Toya Meijin's got five?

254
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:30,858
-He will if he
wins the Oza title.

255
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:32,994
-He won both the first
match and the second match,

256
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:34,963
so his chances are
looking pretty good.

257
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:36,998
Zama Oza seems to be struggling.

258
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:38,533
-Really?

259
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:40,735
And how many wins do you
need to become the Oza?

260
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,371
-The Oza championship is
the best of five matches.

261
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:45,740
You win three, and
you get the title.

262
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,876
-Remember, he's defending his
Tengen title at the same time.

263
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:52,614
It can't be easy
for him right now.

264
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:53,648
-Tengen?

265
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:56,918
Is that another
championship title?

266
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,554
[confused chatter]

267
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:01,623
-How's this kid ever going
to win a serious title

268
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:02,890
if he doesn't even
know the names

269
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:04,826
of the major championships?

270
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:08,463
-Makes you wonder if he's really
got what it takes to be a pro.

271
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:09,731
-Yow!

272
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:12,033
I don't want you
embarrassing me, do you hear?

273
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:13,334
-Would you get off of me?

274
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,603
This has got nothing to
do with you, Mr. Kawai!

275
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:16,604
-What's that?

276
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:17,739
-All right, you
two, that's enough.

277
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:19,507
If you're interested,
you can read these old Go

278
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,510
Weeklys I've been collecting.

279
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:23,611
-Thanks, Mr. Fukawa.

280
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:30,952
-Oh, look.

281
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,388
There's Toya's dad
on the front cover.

282
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:35,857
It says he's competing
for the Oza title.

283
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,992
And here's the game record.

284
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:40,328
He's playing Zama Sensei.

285
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:41,663
Wow.

286
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:43,765
I never knew he was the Oza.

287
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:46,467
-Hikaru, this is only
part of the game record.

288
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:47,268
-Huh?

289
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,270
Let's see.

290
00:14:49,303 --> 00:14:49,871
Here it is.

291
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:52,974
The rest of it's on the back.

292
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:55,710
There's another
match in this one.

293
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,814
The first game of the
Tengen championship.

294
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:02,016
Defending the championship
is last year's winner,

295
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:03,284
Toya Meijin.

296
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:04,852
Challenging him for the
title is Achiryu Kise.

297
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,924
Hm.

298
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:10,792
Oh.

299
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:12,960
Toya's dad's also in this one.

300
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,562
-Hikaru-- turn the page.

301
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:15,563
Turn it!

302
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:17,532
-Hmph.

303
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:20,468
Hm.

304
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:21,936
Now, let's see.

305
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:23,705
Toya Meijin.

306
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:25,873
Six straight wins?

307
00:15:25,873 --> 00:15:26,607
Wow.

308
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:27,608
He's doing pretty well.

309
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,613
-How can I read
this article if you

310
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:35,750
keep putting things
on top of it?

311
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,952
-Better for ya?

312
00:15:37,985 --> 00:15:39,020
Now, let's see.

313
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:40,888
What else do we have here?

314
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:43,791
I wish these were in
some sort of order.

315
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:45,493
The dates are all mixed up.

316
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:48,463
There's August, and
then there's May.

317
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:52,600
What's this one right at
the bottom of the pile?

318
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,535
Last January?

319
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,738
So out of date.

320
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:57,605
Huh?

321
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:59,574
It's Akira.

322
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:03,478
And that guy he's standing
next to is Zama Sensei.

323
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:05,313
I know what this is!

324
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:07,415
It's the Shincho Dan series.

325
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:08,549
-Hikaru, turn the page.

326
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:13,588
-We were there for that match.

327
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:14,989
Do you remember?

328
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:17,992
We watched it on TV
in the next room.

329
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:20,695
Ah, the Shincho Dan series.

330
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:21,929
So cool.

331
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:24,966
I'd forgotten I get
to play in that.

332
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:25,900
Wow.

333
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:28,002
I can't wait for
my first pro match.

334
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,504
What about you?

335
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:31,472
-Hikaru, spread this
paper out, would you?

336
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:44,552
-Yeah, the Shincho Dan series.

337
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:47,522
It snowed that day.

338
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:50,458
Huh?

339
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:51,826
The snow had just started.

340
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:57,365
This time it's my turn.

341
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:58,733
This match is going
to be the start

342
00:16:58,733 --> 00:16:59,901
of my professional career.

343
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:05,706
Just as soon as
the new year comes.

344
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:19,420
AMANO: We really
appreciate you giving us

345
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:22,423
the time for this interview
so early in the year.

346
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:25,326
As the holder of five titles,
you must be busier than ever.

347
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,697
And also, there's your son's
achievement this past year.

348
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,533
We were all sorry when your
winning streak ended at 26

349
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:33,968
matches, but I'm
sure we can expect

350
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:37,638
even greater things
from you this year.

351
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:38,639
-I'll try my best.

352
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:39,874
-Hm.

353
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:42,643
-Well, I think we've managed
to get everything we need.

354
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,912
Thanks.

355
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:46,280
-Mr. Amano.

356
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:47,849
Yes?

357
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:50,351
-You know that event where
one of the top professionals

358
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:52,486
plays someone who's
just starting out?

359
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,821
-The Shincho Dan series?

360
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,490
You mean you'd take part?

361
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:57,959
The last couple of
times we asked you,

362
00:17:57,992 --> 00:18:00,728
you turned us down because
you had such a busy schedule,

363
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:02,997
so we didn't really want to
bother you again this here.

364
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,334
But if you're interested,
we'd be delighted to have you.

365
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:12,273
-I'll do it on the condition
I get to choose my opponent.

366
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:13,608
-Huh?

367
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:14,775
-Oh.

368
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:16,744
Um, did you already have
somebody particular in mind?

369
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,884
-There's a player I haven't
seen for nearly two years,

370
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:24,352
but he's become a pro now.

371
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:26,854
-It can't be.

372
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:27,889
-Hikaru Shindou.

373
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:28,890
[gasp]

374
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:51,913
-I see.

375
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:54,916
That means by moving there,
my counterattack is blocked.

376
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,521
Hm?

377
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:02,590
Hey, what's up, Sai?

378
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:04,692
That look in your
eye's kind of scary.

379
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:09,263
You know what?

380
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:10,798
We should tidy up these papers.

381
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:12,900
You know how my mom gets
when she sees a mess.

382
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,303
She'll yell at me if she
sees my room like this.

383
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:17,004
I know you need them
spread out to read them,

384
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,374
but, uh, you don't want to
see me get in trouble, do ya?

385
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:20,942
-Go ahead.

386
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:23,344
You can put them away.

387
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:25,780
I've memorized all the
game records I need.

388
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:30,351
I know his game much better now.

389
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:33,321
[phone ringing]

390
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:35,323
-Huh?

391
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:35,990
I'd better get it.

392
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:37,692
Mom's out shopping somewhere.

393
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,331
Hello.

394
00:19:43,364 --> 00:19:46,567
Shindou residence.

395
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,002
Yeah, what do you want?

396
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:51,272
I mean, yes, it's me.

397
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:53,374
The Shincho Dan series?

398
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:55,509
Yeah, I've heard of it.

399
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:56,777
Why?

400
00:19:56,777 --> 00:19:58,045
Really?

401
00:19:58,045 --> 00:19:59,880
And who would I play against?

402
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,018
Toya Meijin?

403
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:07,989
Yes.

404
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:09,023
Yes, of course.

405
00:20:09,023 --> 00:20:09,824
Yes, I understand.

406
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,599
Did you hear that?

407
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:22,269
They want me to play against
Toya Meijin in the next Shincho

408
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,372
Dan series.

409
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:25,740
Remember last year?

410
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:28,376
Toya was playing Zama Osa?

411
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:32,780
Hey, I wonder-- Do you think
he's gonna come watch it?

412
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,516
Yeah, 'course he'll be there.

413
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:36,617
OK.

414
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:38,386
This is my chance to
show him how strong I am!

415
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,488
To show him I'm his equal.

416
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:41,022
-Hikaru.

417
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:42,423
-Yeah, what is it?

418
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,794
Please.

419
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:49,530
Allow me to play for you.

420
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:52,366
I want to play that man.

421
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,634
Let me play!

422
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:55,970
[theme music]

423
00:22:23,557 --> 00:22:26,894
-This is gonna be my match, Sai,
and I can't let you interfere.

424
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,028
-Please I must play!

425
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:31,565
Stop being so selfish!

426
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,668
-This one that could be
my greatest challenge.

427
00:22:34,702 --> 00:22:37,004
HIKARU: But everyone is
coming to see me play.

428
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:38,739
Waya, Ochi.

429
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:42,810
And one top player
thinks I'm gonna win.

430
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:46,514
Next time, Sai versus Meijin.

431
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:48,649
SAI: He's waiting for us.
