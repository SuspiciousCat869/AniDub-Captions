00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:07,515
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:10,521
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:13,659
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:18,202
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

5
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:21,575
[theme music]

6
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:00,697
HIKARU: The spring is awesome.

7
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:03,102
I've just started classes
at Haze Middle School.

8
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:52,596
GIRL: You gonna join
a club this year?

9
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,266
GIRL: I don't know yet.

10
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,671
GIRL: There's a bunch of posters
up on the bulletin board.

11
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:57,706
You wanna go check it out?

12
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,814
GIRL: Oh!

13
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,150
This one looks like
it might be fun.

14
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:03,617
BOY: Hm.

15
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,221
I'm not sure.

16
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:05,754
Maybe.

17
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:07,225
-We should hang it here.

18
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:08,327
-Good idea!

19
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,431
Loads of people walk
by this spot every day.

20
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
-Aw.

21
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:14,404
-What is this?

22
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:16,308
A Go club?

23
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:17,177
BOY: I guess go.

24
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:18,279
It must be new.

25
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:20,183
BOY: This thing is
taking up a lot of space.

26
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:22,387
BOY: So what are you
gonna do about it?

27
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,758
-Hey, what are you guys doing?

28
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,359
-Huh?

29
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:26,427
-Who's he?

30
00:03:26,427 --> 00:03:27,563
-I saw you tear up my poster!

31
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:28,565
Come here.

32
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:29,166
Argh!

33
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,575
-That's disgusting!

34
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:34,510
-Stop it.

35
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:35,712
They clean toilers
with that mop.

36
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:36,446
-Hikaru!

37
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:38,584
-What's happening?

38
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:40,488
Why did you freak out?

39
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:44,896
HIKARU: These guys ripped
up our poster for no reason.

40
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,600
-Nobody's interested
in playing Go.

41
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,202
Stop wasting your time.

42
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:50,240
-The Go club hasn't
even been approved yet.

43
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:53,813
Besides, your huge poster was
taking up way too much space.

44
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:57,186
-These guys have a
lot of power, kid.

45
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,390
Our basketball team's
pretty popular.

46
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:00,860
Better get with the program.

47
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:02,229
-Oh yeah?

48
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:04,667
-Seems your Go Club's
off to a rough start.

49
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:05,736
That's a real shame.

50
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:08,274
Over at the Shogi
club, things are great.

51
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:09,978
If you ever get tired
of playing with stones,

52
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:12,382
you're always welcome to
join us for a game of Shogi.

53
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,892
-Listen to your friend.

54
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:19,228
Have fun with your Go club.

55
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:20,732
Try not to bore yourself.

56
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:28,480
-Oh, what a bunch of jerks.

57
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,749
-It's no big deal.

58
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:30,751
It's just a poster.

59
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:32,888
-You could always
make another one.

60
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,292
-I don't know, maybe.

61
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,663
Nobody's gonna notice
it here, you know?

62
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:39,367
-It's better than nothing.

63
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,371
Oh, I have some good news.

64
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:42,339
-Hm?

65
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:44,343
-I just got a Go board for free.

66
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:46,948
Miss Tamako, the science
teacher, gave it to me.

67
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,451
She said we can
play in her class

68
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:51,424
after school, as
long as it's empty.

69
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,628
HIKARU: That's
awesome, Kimihiro!

70
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,965
Doesn't that mean that
now we have a real club?

71
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:58,537
KIMIHIRO: Almost, but we
still need a few more members

72
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,407
so the school will approve us.

73
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:02,645
Think you can find a few more
players and sign them up?

74
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:03,914
HIKARU: Oh, you can count on me.

75
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:05,316
Just tell me what I have to do.

76
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:07,287
I'll pass out fliers,
put up more posters,

77
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,322
whatever it takes.

78
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,928
I wanna get started
on this right away!

79
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,564
AKARI: That sounds really cool.

80
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:13,866
I'll go with you.

81
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,937
KIMIHIRO: Why are you so
interested in helping us?

82
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,276
AKARI: Because, it
sounds like fun.

83
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:21,714
HIKARU: Do you think
Tetsuo would help us out?

84
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:23,551
KIMIHIRO: Hm.

85
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:24,520
I doubt it.

86
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:25,989
He wants to focus on Shogi.

87
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:27,426
Says he doesn't have time.

88
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:28,528
HIKARU: Aw, that's too bad.

89
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:35,808
-Thanks for the ride.

90
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:37,043
-Always happy to help.

91
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,549
How come you wanted to
come to Haze middle today?

92
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:42,320
I can wait here a few minutes
and give you a ride home,

93
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:44,525
as long as you're not
going to take too long.

94
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:45,560
-That's OK.

95
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,297
I can always catch the bus.

96
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,801
-Oh, well, I'll see you!

97
00:05:58,485 --> 00:05:59,987
-That's a Kaio uniform.

98
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:03,327
-I wonder what he's doing here.

99
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,730
-Hello?

100
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,731
Sorry to bother you.

101
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,335
I'm trying to find
a seventh grader.

102
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:08,938
His name his Hikaru Shindou.

103
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:09,973
He's new to this school.

104
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:11,577
I think he's in your Go club.

105
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,415
Would you be able direct
me to their club room?

106
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:17,922
-Sorry, do you know if
Haze even has a Go club?

107
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:19,091
-We might.

108
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:22,063
I think I saw their poster
on the bulletin board.

109
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:24,735
GIRL: Really?

110
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,404
-Thanks, I'll find it.

111
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:27,708
-A Go club?

112
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:29,644
There's a bunch of
guys who play chess.

113
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:30,846
Can you help this guy?

114
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,681
-Wish I could.

115
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,585
-I'll keep looking.

116
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:34,487
-You heard of it?

117
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,591
-It's news to me.

118
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,492
-Hm.

119
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:37,942
Hm?

120
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,602
Excuse me, miss.

121
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,606
-Yes?

122
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,344
Well, we don't see many
Kaio students around here.

123
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:48,648
What can I do for you today?

124
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:50,852
-I've been asking everyone
where your go club meets,

125
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:53,356
but no one seems
to know about it.

126
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,494
Does it even exist?

127
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:56,763
-A Go club.

128
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:59,502
Oh, I know who
you're talking about.

129
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,806
There's a few students
playing Go in the science lab.

130
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,444
I lent them my father's old
board and chipped Go stones.

131
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:06,047
If you can get
there quickly, you

132
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:08,151
might be able to catch them.

133
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,521
-How do I get there?

134
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,823
-Down that way.

135
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:12,392
It's not far.

136
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:14,496
Keep walking until you
see a large window.

137
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:15,932
You'll be able to
see the lab inside.

138
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,836
If you want to go in,
the door's on the right.

139
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:32,665
-I was just thinking.

140
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:34,669
It was hard to lose
that tournament,

141
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:36,806
but the head judge
was pretty nice to us,

142
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:38,943
all things considered.

143
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:41,715
-Mm-hm.

144
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,017
-Gentlemen.

145
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:47,659
I sincerely hope to see Haze
Middle School here next year.

146
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:49,663
-Hey, didn't Hikaru
lie about his age

147
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:51,934
so he could compete
in that thing?

148
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:54,507
Is Hikaru really that good?

149
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,076
-Could you be quiet?

150
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:56,978
-Hm.

151
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:57,980
You know what?

152
00:07:58,013 --> 00:07:59,416
I'm not even sure
about that myself.

153
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:03,957
I'll tell you this.

154
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:06,430
When he's under pressure,
he plays a great game.

155
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:16,849
But when he's not, I
mean, just look at this.

156
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:18,084
He's gonna lose.

157
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:18,986
-Really?

158
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,094
Then he's not that
good after all.

159
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,568
-Looks like I won the game.

160
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:28,939
Hm.

161
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:30,508
HIKARU: Akari,
what's your problem?

162
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,847
How am I supposed concentrate
on the game if you're always

163
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:33,714
blabbing away!

164
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:34,951
-Stop yelling!

165
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:36,520
It's not my fault
you lost the game!

166
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:38,724
-Do'nt you ever stop talking?

167
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:39,191
AKIRA: Hikaru.

168
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,034
-Akira?

169
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:45,704
What are you doing here anyway?

170
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:49,143
-Why?

171
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:50,647
Why is a player
with your ability

172
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,055
wasting his time in a
middle school Go club?

173
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,927
You're never at the
Go salon these days,

174
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:00,131
and I'm always down there.

175
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,568
I have to be honest.

176
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:03,705
It doesn't matter who
I play against anymore.

177
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:05,108
Every minute of
every game, you're

178
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:07,479
always in the back of
my mind, tormenting me.

179
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:14,560
I just keep wondering
to myself, how

180
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:18,801
would Hikaru counter this play.

181
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,706
What would Hikaru do?

182
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:25,514
Well, it's your move.

183
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:27,050
-No way.

184
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,787
I'm not gonna compete with you.

185
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:33,162
-Wait a minute!

186
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:35,600
You can't just walk away.

187
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:36,702
-Oh, yes I can.

188
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,639
I promised I'd help get
this Go club started.

189
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,573
Right, Kimihiro?

190
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:40,743
-Mm-hm.

191
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:42,913
-We're already busy,
getting ready to play

192
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,650
in all the tournaments.

193
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,787
-You won't face me?

194
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,156
Hikaru!

195
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,158
You coward!

196
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:26,137
-Hikaru.

197
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,144
-I'm going to make
him wait until I

198
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:37,684
can play as good as him.

199
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:39,588
AKIRA: I don't understand.

200
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:40,590
Why is he running away?

201
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:46,769
Wait.

202
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:47,804
It isn't him.

203
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:48,840
It's me.

204
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,242
I'm the one who's scared.

205
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,845
I'm the one who's running.

206
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:53,148
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I promised I'd

207
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,650
help get this Go club started.

208
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:56,588
We're already busy,
getting ready to play

209
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:59,761
in all the tournaments.

210
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:03,134
-If that's your plan, then I'm
going to do the same thing.

211
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:04,336
I won't back down.

212
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,686
BOY: Did you hear the latest?

213
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:31,153
BOY: Yeah.

214
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:32,155
But is it true?

215
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:34,293
Is Akira Toya really
joining our club?

216
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,261
-You can't be serious.

217
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,632
I heard he's as
good as the pros.

218
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,068
Why would he want
to play with us?

219
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:40,170
BOY: Don't ask me.

220
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:41,841
BOY: He'll get to play
in all the tournaments.

221
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:42,843
It isn't fair.

222
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,312
BOY: Isn't Toya a 7th grader?

223
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:46,316
I wonder if they'll
make him team captain?

224
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:47,284
BOY: Fat chance.

225
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:49,088
Kishimoto's the
only captain I want.

226
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:51,392
Besides, the 9th graders
would a throw a fit.

227
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:52,695
BOY: Mm-hm.

228
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:53,897
I heard the principal
pushed him into joining.

229
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,635
Said it would encourage
all of us to try harder.

230
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:57,972
-BOY: You gotta be kidding me.

231
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,921
-If you spent less time
thinking, and more time

232
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,025
playing, you might
actually improve.

233
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:27,027
-Sorry.

234
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,062
-Yamada.

235
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:29,298
What do you think you're doing?

236
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,101
It shouldn't take you
more than 10 seconds

237
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:32,771
to solve a life
and death problem.

238
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:33,272
-Right.

239
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:34,875
I'll play faster.

240
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:36,412
-Everyone seems
really mad today.

241
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:38,281
It's kind of hard
to focus on playing.

242
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:38,883
-Shh!

243
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,956
Be quiet.

244
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:43,926
-Why isn't that
Toya guy here yet?

245
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,831
-He probably thinks he's too
good for us, or something.

246
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:47,800
BOY: Stop talking!

247
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,368
-Sorry abou that.

248
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,336
-Calm down, Nakai.

249
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,906
If they're scared,
then how are they

250
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:52,776
supposed to focus on
playing their games?

251
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,679
Come on, try to relax.

252
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,950
-I'm relaxed.

253
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:57,426
-Huh?

254
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,289
-Huh?

255
00:12:59,322 --> 00:13:00,323
-You're here.

256
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:02,060
I'm sorry that I'm late, sir.

257
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:03,429
I had some school work.

258
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:04,899
-That's all right.

259
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,106
Your homeroom teacher told me
you'd be having a busy week.

260
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:11,177
I'd like to introduce
you to the Kaio Go club.

261
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:13,916
We have several players
joining us for the first time

262
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,219
this year.

263
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,323
Will our new members please
come to the front of the room?

264
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:22,700
-How's that?

265
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,871
It's all wrong, and
still seems crooked.

266
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,173
-Looks fine to me.

267
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,110
-Hey, no one was talking to you.

268
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,379
-Chill out.

269
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:31,183
I helped color that thing,
I'm entitled to an opinion.

270
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,320
It's a lot better
than the last one.

271
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,723
Kimihiro, what do you think?

272
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:35,858
-It's great.

273
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,094
AKARI: Told you so.

274
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:38,998
-Maybe we should head
down to the science lab

275
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:40,801
and play a few practice games.

276
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:41,736
-Yeah.

277
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:42,871
-Well, wait for me!

278
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:45,377
-We have the pleasure of
welcoming 17 new members

279
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,446
this year.

280
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,948
I'd like you to help
each of these players

281
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:50,152
develop so we'll all be prepared
for the tournament in June.

282
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:52,156
Try your hardest,
that's all I ask.

283
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,362
-Yoroshiku onegai shimasu.

284
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:57,165
MR. YUN: Everyone,
please return your seats

285
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,502
and continue your games.

286
00:13:58,735 --> 00:13:59,838
STUDENTS: Yes, Mr. Yun.

287
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,942
-The seventh graders are
playing against each other

288
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,946
so I can determine
their skill level.

289
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:05,281
Now we need to find you a game.

290
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:06,250
-I'll play him.

291
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,886
I've been practicing a lot, sir.

292
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:09,155
-Miwa?

293
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:10,892
Not today.

294
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,163
How about some other time, OK?

295
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:14,232
Akira, come with me.

296
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:19,909
-Oh, well.

297
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,044
-What's up?

298
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:23,415
-Mr. Yun's protecting
me from the mighty Toya.

299
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:24,184
-Why?

300
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:25,219
-He's a seventh grader.

301
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,123
If a ninth grader
like me lost to him,

302
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,559
it would look pretty bad.

303
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:37,776
-To speed things
along, I'll play white.

304
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:38,411
AKIRA: All right.

305
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,415
Onegai shimasu.

306
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:42,419
-I heard that you're
Toya Meijin's son.

307
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:43,353
Is that right?

308
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:44,355
-Yes, sir.

309
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:46,193
-Well, this should
be interesting.

310
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:48,197
I'm curious to see what
your skill level is.

311
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,410
-Amazing.

312
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:58,549
You've really improved at
placing your stones down.

313
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,484
-Hm.

314
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:01,222
No one's signed up
for our club yet.

315
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:03,492
I hope we can get enough members
to play in the tournament

316
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:05,162
this June.

317
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,331
-Don't worry about it.

318
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,435
I'm gonna start asking all
the smart kids in school

319
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:10,239
to sign up.

320
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:12,443
-You don't have to be
smart to be good at Go.

321
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:13,478
-I don't know.

322
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:14,947
You should probably
be kind of brainy

323
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,818
if you want to
play with the pros.

324
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:18,454
-I agree.

325
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:20,959
-You're not exactly the
brightest player in the world.

326
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,095
-Bad. move.

327
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:25,368
-When did you become such
an expert on the game?

328
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:26,336
What's the point?

329
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,438
-Wait a minute.

330
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:29,843
Kaio Middle is a school
full of gifted people,

331
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:31,545
and they have a
super strong team.

332
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,082
-They're pretty good, all right.

333
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:35,553
But that still doesn't explain
all pros who get D's in school.

334
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:39,828
Even F students have
turned professional.

335
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:40,497
-That's cool.

336
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:41,999
I never knew that.

337
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,570
Hey, I guess that means Hikaru
still has a chance, doesn't he?

338
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:45,539
-Oh, zip it!

339
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,076
-I bet I could
learn to play, too.

340
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:49,212
Maybe you guys could teach
me the rules of the game?

341
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,114
-You're crazy.

342
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:51,551
You can't learn Go.

343
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,623
-Perhaps you should consider
helping your friend.

344
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:55,458
-No way.

345
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:57,095
-You learned pretty fast.

346
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:58,364
I bet I'd pick it up right away.

347
00:15:58,397 --> 00:15:59,566
Can I try a game?

348
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,535
-Absolutely.

349
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:02,338
We'd be happy to
have you join us.

350
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:03,574
Even beginners are welcome.

351
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:05,945
We can show you everything
you need to know.

352
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:08,316
-I'd like to get started
right away, if that's OK.

353
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,852
-Aw.

354
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,056
I don't have much
of a choice, do I?

355
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,025
All right.

356
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:14,227
Uh, let's say you're
playing white.

357
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,429
If black goes here--

358
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:16,531
AKARI: Mm-hm.

359
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:18,502
HIKARU: This stone
gets captured.

360
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:22,210
Are you following me so far?

361
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:23,445
Let's try it again, OK?

362
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:25,048
It's your turn to move.

363
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:27,552
What can you do to keep your
white stone from being capture?

364
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:34,165
-I think I'd run away.

365
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:36,002
-Why are you always
messing with me?

366
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:38,473
You don't take anything
seriously, do you?

367
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:39,542
-What's up with you?

368
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:41,212
You don't have to
talk to me like that!

369
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:42,648
TSUTSUI: Please,
try to calm down!

370
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,898
MR. YUN: In Korea, I started
out as a school teacher and a Go

371
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:51,900
instructor for children.

372
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,946
When I found out that I had
a chance to move to Japan,

373
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:03,421
I decided I would try
teaching some Go here, too.

374
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,260
But when I got here, I
was a bit disappointed

375
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:08,932
in the level of play.

376
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:11,403
Most of my students
weren't very good.

377
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:17,915
-I understand that Go is
very popular over there.

378
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:19,552
-That's right.

379
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:22,057
The Koreans have
private Go schools,

380
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:24,328
which are sort of similar
to Japanese exam preparation

381
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:24,929
academies.

382
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:32,677
They're great players, but so
are the students here at Kaio.

383
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:34,615
They take the game
just as seriously

384
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:37,019
as their Korean counterparts.

385
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:39,624
Every country has a
Go master among them.

386
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,224
Well done.

387
00:17:57,257 --> 00:18:00,363
That's a fine move, young man.

388
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:02,000
-Thank you.

389
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:03,670
-Have you ever heard
of a boy named Hikaru?

390
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:09,715
I believe he's a student
over at Haze Middle School.

391
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:12,520
He played on their team
during our winter competition.

392
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:15,225
His skill was impressive.

393
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,195
The Kaio team that
played in that tournament

394
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:22,272
has since graduated, but I'll
never forget their last game.

395
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:23,741
AKIRA: I was there.

396
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:25,111
I saw him play.

397
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,589
I know him well.

398
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:54,333
-I'm gonna get this
Go club started.

399
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,404
We're getting ready to play
in all the tournaments.

400
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:02,014
-This boy-- you may
be the only one who

401
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:03,418
is capable of defeating him.

402
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,727
-That's my intention.

403
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:17,143
-Let's call it a game.

404
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:19,414
I already know how good you are.

405
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:22,587
Listen, we usually play
a round robin format.

406
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,793
Opponents are chosen according
to their skill levels.

407
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:28,264
You'd be in our
class A category.

408
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:31,771
We also replay games and work
on life and death problems.

409
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,310
Every Tuesday,
Thursday and Friday,

410
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,246
I hold a lecture
called The Next Move.

411
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,117
Participation isn't
mandatory, but you

412
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,087
can drop in if you'd like.

413
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:40,822
-Excuse me, sir?

414
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,391
-Hm?

415
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:44,062
-We were just wondering
if Akira could

416
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:46,166
play a teaching game with us.

417
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:46,833
-I don't think so.

418
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,570
He's very busy.

419
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,639
-It's no problem, really.

420
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:50,306
I've got time.

421
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,475
[cheering]

422
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:53,246
-I don't think so.

423
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:54,585
I'm a 9th grader.

424
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:55,986
A senior should get
to play him first.

425
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,855
-Aw.

426
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,456
-I'm sorry, but
I've already agreed

427
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,692
to play a game against
these three girls.

428
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:04,361
Look, I can play you
another time, OK?

429
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:05,195
[cheering]

430
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:05,637
-Hmph!

431
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:16,607
-These blossoms.

432
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:20,778
After a thousand years,
they're still the same.

433
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:21,779
It's so peaceful.

434
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,704
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
We'll meet again, Akira.

435
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:58,716
[theme music]

436
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,866
HIKARU: Akira's probably
the best player,

437
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,469
but nobody seems to like him.

438
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:28,472
SAI: Will he let
that discourage him?

439
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,543
HIKRU: Well, the Kaio Go
club can be pretty tough.

440
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:36,313
Some of the guys will try
anything to defeat him.

441
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:38,615
SAI: They may even
conspire against him.

442
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:44,755
HIKARU: Next time,
Rainy Day Strategy.

443
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:48,325
SAKI: I wonder if Akira
can stand up to them?
