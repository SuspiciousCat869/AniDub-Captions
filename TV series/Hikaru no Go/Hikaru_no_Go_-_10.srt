NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:10,490
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:13,631
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:18,208
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

[theme music]

6
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,683
-It'd be great to
find a decent player.

7
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:52,451
Hey!

8
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:53,721
I've got a great idea.

9
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:55,525
We can put up a new poster.

10
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:57,395
It'll have a life and
death problem on it.

11
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:00,536
Whoever solves it gets
invited to join our team.

12
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:02,140
-The person doesn't
have to be good.

13
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,775
We'll take anyone.

14
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:12,463
You guys!

15
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:13,733
I've got news.

16
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,705
Hikaru, remember that
new Go poster you put up?

17
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,813
The one with the life
and death problem on it?

18
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:21,316
-Don't just stand there.

19
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,719
Tell us what happened!

20
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:24,256
-You're never gonna believe it.

21
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,325
See that?

22
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:28,732
Someone knew the correct answer.

23
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:31,205
-Someone at the school
knows how to play Go?

24
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:32,207
-That's right.

25
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:33,577
And they're really good.

26
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,548
They even solved an
advanced problem.

27
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:37,586
-We gotta find this
mystery player.

28
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:38,822
-Shouldn't be too hard.

29
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:40,291
Things are looking up, huh?

30
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,895
-We should split up
and check with kids

31
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:42,865
from different grades.

32
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:44,602
-Sure, good idea.

33
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:47,374
-Uh, hey, you guys?

34
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:50,348
I think I know who
solved that problem.

35
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:50,822
-Well?

36
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:51,684
Who is it?

37
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:52,686
-Stop messing around.

38
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,323
How'd you know, anyway?

39
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,729
-Because I saw them
write the answer.

40
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:57,397
-Go on.

41
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,599
I wanna hear a name.

42
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,704
-Please, tell us who it was!

43
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:01,706
-All right.

44
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,713
It was Yuuki Mitani
from class three.

45
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:05,982
-Gah!

46
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:08,756
Why didn't you walk right up and
ask him to be in the Go club?

47
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,359
-Sorry.

48
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,998
I didn't really think he'd
be interested in joining.

49
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:15,804
If he was, he probably would've
come in already and signed up.

50
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:17,709
-You should've grabbed
him by the shirt

51
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:19,313
and dragged him down here!

52
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:20,783
What's wrong with you anyway?

53
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,851
-Don't yell.

54
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,557
I'm not even a member of
your Go club, you know?

55
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,395
-Wha-- Of course
you're a member.

56
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:27,497
What are you saying?

57
00:03:27,497 --> 00:03:28,968
HIKARU: That's the
problem with you Akari.

58
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,504
Can't you do anything right?

59
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:32,442
AKARI: What's that
supposed to mean?

60
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:33,410
I'm leaving!

61
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:39,758
KIMIHIRU: I think you
might owe Akari an apology.

62
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,261
HIKARU: Ah, what's the point?

63
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,333
It's really no big deal.

64
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:46,640
She'll have forgotten
all about it by tomorrow.

65
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:50,382
Anyway, Yuuki Mitani
from Class Three, huh?

66
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:52,019
Never heard of him.

67
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:53,288
Hm.

68
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:55,460
I'll track him down
and make him sign up!

69
00:03:55,494 --> 00:03:56,896
KIMIHIRO: If he
agrees to join, we'll

70
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,500
finally have three members.

71
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:01,005
Then we can compete in
the next tournament.

72
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,810
Just imagine, Hikaru.

73
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,317
This time, when we beat Kaio
we won't get disqualified.

74
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:07,888
-Here we go again.

75
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:10,427
-I won because my
opponent messed up.

76
00:04:10,427 --> 00:04:13,333
You won because you had this
incredible streak of luck.

77
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,639
Even Akira Toya
wanted to talk to you

78
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,609
after you finished
your last game.

79
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:18,478
-Yeah, yeah.

80
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:21,885
I know I got really lucky, OK?

81
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,994
Calm down, it wasn't that funny.

82
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:27,665
I just thought of something.

83
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,638
Akira goes to Kaio
Middle School, right?

84
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:32,710
I wonder if he's
in their Go club.

85
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,380
-Probably not.

86
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:35,416
-How come?

87
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,353
-His skill level's
so high, he wouldn't

88
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:39,926
compete in middle
school tournaments.

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,599
Let me ask you a question,
Hikaru, haven't you ever heard

90
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:43,834
of the Insei?

91
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:46,106
HIKARU: No, what's that?

92
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:50,015
-The Insei are kids who go
to the Japan Go Association's

93
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:53,757
training institute in
order to prepare to go pro.

94
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,561
Since they're training
to become pros,

95
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,766
they're forbidden from
entering amateur competitions.

96
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:03,445
A lot of kids drop
out of the program

97
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,118
and give up any hope
of ever turning pro.

98
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:07,621
I've just heard this rumor.

99
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,960
People are saying that the Kaio
Go club has a few former Insei

100
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:10,762
students.

101
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:12,432
-Huh.

102
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:14,503
-Akira Toya isn't one, though.

103
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:15,673
He's too good for them.

104
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:19,448
Listen.

105
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:21,385
He's so strong that
he could easily

106
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:23,156
beat any one of those guys.

107
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,024
-Are you serious?

108
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:28,100
-Be careful.

109
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:31,007
Those glass stones chip easily.

110
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,913
Anyway, I wouldn't be
too worried about Toya.

111
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:37,154
He would never join a Go club.

112
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:38,958
HIKARU: I shouldn't
waste my time thinking

113
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,395
about defeating Akira.

114
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:42,165
It's probably impossible.

115
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,534
SAI: Hikaru.

116
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:46,575
There are other things
to worry about right now.

117
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:47,143
HIKARU: Ha.

118
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:48,412
You're absolutely right.

119
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:49,815
There's a tournament
coming up, and I still

120
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,054
have to find a way to beat
Kaio's third best player.

121
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:53,991
-That is not what I meant.

122
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:55,829
-Hm?

123
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:58,702
-You should focus
on beating Kimihiro.

124
00:05:58,702 --> 00:05:59,737
-Good point, Sai.

125
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:00,205
-Huh?

126
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:01,107
What's that?

127
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:02,076
I didn't say anything.

128
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:07,455
You're right about one thing.

129
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:09,493
I do need to get good
enough to beat Kimihiro,

130
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,431
but I wanna find our team
a third member first,

131
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:14,103
or we're not even gonna be able
to compete in the tournament.

132
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:16,843
[gurgling]

133
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,079
-Hm?

134
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,950
I can't think on an empty
stomach I need some ramen.

135
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:30,674
-You enjoy having
this ramen, don't you?

136
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,544
-These are the best
noodles I've ever eaten.

137
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:33,028
Delicious!

138
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,226
-Deliver this for me?

139
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:40,094
-Sure.

140
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:42,868
The Go salon and back, right?

141
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,003
-Did you hear that?

142
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,509
There's a Go salon nearby!

143
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,647
-So, what's the big deal?

144
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,816
-I wanna go!

145
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,019
-Ow.

146
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,023
-You have the privilege
of being able to play Go

147
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:54,761
almost every day
at school, but I

148
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:57,767
haven't enjoyed a game
in quite some time!

149
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:59,839
MAN: There's a middle school
kid down at the salon.

150
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,108
He's pretty good.

151
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:03,714
Well, good enough
to beat me, anyway.

152
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:04,950
-Ah, ha!

153
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:06,053
-I'm serious about this.

154
00:07:06,086 --> 00:07:07,890
I may not be the best
player in the world,

155
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:11,531
but I recognize
talent when I see it.

156
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,534
HIKARU: Thanks a lot!

157
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:17,177
We gotta find this guy
and find out who he is.

158
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:18,180
-Quickly.

159
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,282
We shouldn't waste
any more time!

160
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:22,623
-I don't see a Go
salon anywhere.

161
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:23,625
Down there.

162
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:34,550
This is a Go salon?

163
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,991
-Delivery.

164
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:42,200
-This place is kind of
scary, don't you think?

165
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,005
-It's poorly lit, but
we should be fine.

166
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:52,123
-Here's 700 yen.

167
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:52,858
Keep the change.

168
00:07:58,637 --> 00:07:59,086
-Hm?

169
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:02,980
-Thanks.

170
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,982
See you!

171
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:05,586
MAN: Looking for a game?

172
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,254
-Huh?

173
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:08,726
-It's 500 yen for students.

174
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,862
-500 yen?

175
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:10,631
-Over there.

176
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:11,633
Do you think that's him?

177
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,164
-Hm?

178
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:21,622
-I guess so.

179
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:40,230
-Hey, Shu.

180
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,299
We're out of tea.

181
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,070
Bring us some more, will you?

182
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:44,205
-I'm standing 10 feet away.

183
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,174
You don't have to yell.

184
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:54,896
If you just want to
watch, that's fine by me.

185
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:56,032
-Thank you.

186
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:57,636
-Hikaru, something's wrong.

187
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:58,304
-What's up?

188
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:11,166
-I believe that
child is cheating.

189
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,767
-Huh?

190
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,809
SAI: His hands are quick.

191
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:18,115
He is secretly moving stones,
increasing his own territory

192
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:21,288
and decreasing his opponent's.

193
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:22,057
He's fast.

194
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,295
I couldn't even tell.

195
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:26,701
MAN: Black, 44 points?

196
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,805
YUKI: White, 46 points.

197
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:30,743
-So, I didn't have enough, huh?

198
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:33,716
I could have sworn that I was
ahead by at least a few stones.

199
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:36,222
I guess I owe you
some money, don't I?

200
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:37,725
Here you go.

201
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:44,239
I still wanna win my money back.

202
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:46,879
Don't tell me you're
leaving already.

203
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:48,983
-I really have to get home.

204
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:51,723
My parents think
I'm at the library.

205
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,859
MAN: Some other time, then.

206
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,040
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
That uniform.

207
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:01,144
Does this guy go to
Haze middle school?

208
00:10:01,144 --> 00:10:02,714
I wonder if he's
the same person who

209
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:03,984
solved the problem
on our poster?

210
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,902
Hey Sai, do you
remember his name?

211
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:15,109
I think this is the kid that
Akari mentioned earlier.

212
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:16,880
-You mean Yuki Mitani?

213
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,982
-MAN: Excuse me.

214
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:19,018
-Huh?

215
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,957
-You do know how to
play Go, don't you?

216
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:24,029
We can bet per
game or by points.

217
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:24,864
-What?

218
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:26,268
You're asking me to gamble?

219
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:27,169
-Go easy on the boy.

220
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:29,073
It's his first time here.

221
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:30,810
What are you trying
to do, anyway?

222
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:31,846
Scare him?

223
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,517
MAN: Why don't you
play e a game, Shu?

224
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,386
-Hmph.

225
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:35,421
I work here, remember?

226
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:37,025
Wouldn't look good
if I was gambling.

227
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:37,993
-Uh, hold on.

228
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:39,230
I want to ask you something.

229
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,771
Is your name Yuki?

230
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:43,839
-Hey.

231
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:46,378
Do you go to school
with that young man?

232
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,782
-Kinda.

233
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,485
-MAN: Well, your little
friend is raking in the dough.

234
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,056
-Huh?

235
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,294
-It seems kind of funny to me.

236
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,198
He keeps winning,
but his playing style

237
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:57,470
hasn't improved at all.

238
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:58,940
-That's not fair.

239
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:00,811
Mitani is a very strong player.

240
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,214
There's no denying that.

241
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:04,886
-(VOICEOVER) So that
was Yuki Mitani.

242
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,158
-Hikaru!

243
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:09,430
This young man must
not continue cheating.

244
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,802
It's our responsibility
to help him stop.

245
00:11:11,802 --> 00:11:14,241
You should invite him
to join the Go club.

246
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,212
With our assistance,
perhaps we can

247
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:18,217
show him the error of his ways.

248
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:21,157
It's crucial that we
encourage him to change,

249
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,393
before it's too late.

250
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:33,083
-HIKARU: Yuki.

251
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:34,888
Yuki Mitani, wait up!

252
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:35,856
I want to talk to you!

253
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:46,580
-What is it?

254
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:47,582
-Sign up.

255
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:48,484
Join the Go club.

256
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:49,620
You're an excellent player.

257
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:52,861
-Not interested.

258
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:55,567
-I guess that you only care
about playing for money?

259
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,435
-Yep.

260
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:58,407
That's right.

261
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,876
-I saw you cheat.

262
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:01,480
I saw how you counted
up your territory.

263
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:06,892
-You've got a good eye.

264
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,331
-Is there a reason why
you need that money?

265
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:10,501
-Not really.

266
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,304
My parents cut off
my allowance right

267
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:16,080
after the country's
economy tanked.

268
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:18,317
-Our club doesn't
cost anything at all.

269
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:20,924
You could play as
much Go if you want.

270
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:24,665
-Look, I've got to go buy
some new clothes and CDs.

271
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,169
Later.

272
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:27,572
-You've gotta come check it out.

273
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,543
Come on, at least once, OK?

274
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:31,548
-I really don't have time.

275
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:32,550
-It won't take long.

276
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,224
Check it out.

277
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:38,329
I managed to track down Yuki.

278
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:39,666
-Hey, what's up?

279
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,236
HIKARU: Feel like
a game, Kimihiro?

280
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:42,238
Sure you do.

281
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:45,445
Mitani here is an
amazing player.

282
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:49,487
He's going to make a great
addition to our team.

283
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:50,590
-Be honest with me.

284
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:53,062
Does this guy
always act so pushy?

285
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:54,232
-Uh--

286
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:58,174
-Don't tell me you dragge
dhim down here, Hikaru?

287
00:12:58,207 --> 00:13:01,381
-Well, maybe we could
still play a game or two?

288
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,717
-You're kidding, right?

289
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,622
Man, this club's totally boring.

290
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:06,225
-I know you like Go.

291
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:08,129
You solved the
problem on our poster.

292
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,231
One game won't hurt.

293
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:11,670
-I guess one game
isn't going to kill me.

294
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:12,538
Fine.

295
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:13,608
Let's just get this over with.

296
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:14,209
-Ah.

297
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:15,379
Right.

298
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:18,686
I'll play black, OK?

299
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,588
Great.

300
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:20,657
Onegai shimasu.

301
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:21,392
-Same to you.

302
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:01,081
-Listen, Yuki.

303
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:02,584
There's this Go tournament
that's coming up pretty soon.

304
00:14:02,617 --> 00:14:05,157
A bunch of middle schools
will be competing.

305
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:06,326
-What's your point?

306
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,696
-Well, we want to
play this year.

307
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,433
There's players to a team.

308
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,370
Best two out of
three games wins.

309
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:12,507
YUKI: So what?

310
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,377
HIKARU: We only have
two members right now.

311
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:17,451
But if you join us, we can
sign up and win this thing.

312
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:26,771
-You're kind of a
deep thinker, huh?

313
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:27,373
-Sorry.

314
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:40,469
-This boy is very talented.

315
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:43,342
He has a straightforward,
consistent game.

316
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,812
It's really quite a shame.

317
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:47,485
Why must he play dishonestly?

318
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:51,126
Together, he and Hikaru could
help each other develop.

319
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:58,175
I am reminded of my trouble
from a thousand years past.

320
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,180
Nothing is more
dishonorable than cheating.

321
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:04,756
What does he hope to gain?

322
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:08,231
Why would a child his age ever
dream of disgracing himself

323
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:08,765
like this?

324
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:14,244
-(VOICEOVER) If I'm going
to secure that black group,

325
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:17,118
I'd better do it now,
or it'll get attacked.

326
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:19,155
Would I be better off
securing the center

327
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:20,659
of the board, or the right side?

328
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:21,193
Hm.

329
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:26,471
-Hey.

330
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:27,675
-One sec.

331
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,380
(VOICEOVER) I can't attack
on the lower right side.

332
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:31,517
It's too early.

333
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,752
I'll have to play here.

334
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:40,704
If my hunch was right, Mitani
should respond by descending.

335
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:43,176
If he does, I'll have a chance
to secure the right side.

336
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,755
Yes!

337
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:50,826
I called it.

338
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,429
YUKI: You just lost.

339
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:53,699
-Wha--

340
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,838
-I haven't even placed my stone.

341
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:57,642
-Huh?

342
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:58,510
-Look.

343
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:00,247
I just tapped it on the side.

344
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,282
-Wha--

345
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:03,588
YUKI: You played
two moves in a row.

346
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:05,191
You lose.

347
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,397
Later.

348
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,370
-Hey, don't leave yet.

349
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:14,245
Are you going to
that gambling salon?

350
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:15,916
-It'll be more fun
than playing here.

351
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,397
-So, that was the
great Yuki Mitani.

352
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:23,833
Nice guy, huh?

353
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,604
-That guy's a gambler?

354
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:27,375
Seriously?

355
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:28,410
-Yeah.

356
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:30,949
I bumped into him
yesterday in a Go salon.

357
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:32,419
He won his game by cheating.

358
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:33,756
I saw him move a
couple of stores

359
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:35,727
while he was counting
up his territory.

360
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,361
-What?

361
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,530
He cheated?

362
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,000
-That's terrible!

363
00:16:39,234 --> 00:16:40,604
-But he's still a strong player.

364
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:42,609
I'm pretty sure he'd
make an awesome teammate.

365
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:43,132
Right?

366
00:16:46,217 --> 00:16:48,922
-I don't know.

367
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:51,228
What if he cheats
during a tournament?

368
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,531
-Huh?

369
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:55,905
-If he can do this kind of stuff
to adults in some Go salon,

370
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:58,712
what's going to stop him from
doing it to kids his own age?

371
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:00,916
He'd have no trouble
getting away with it.

372
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,954
I doubt anyone
would even notice.

373
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,658
But I'd know, and so would you.

374
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:06,897
Do you think you could
play on a team like that?

375
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,534
I don't think I could cheat.

376
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:09,435
It's just not right.

377
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,415
-I promise to make him stuff.

378
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:17,954
-That's not going to
be easy, you know?

379
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,257
-He's right.

380
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,796
It's going to be
hard to change him.

381
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,703
But that is precisely
why we must try.

382
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:27,642
He's still a child, and we're
the only ones who can help him.

383
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:29,414
There's not a moment to spare.

384
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:29,855
Let's go.

385
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:41,708
-It's nice to see
you, Yuki I'll be

386
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:42,910
finished in a minute, so You.

387
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:45,315
Can play against this man next.

388
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:47,487
-That's strange.

389
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,792
Pretty rare to find
kids who play Go.

390
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,897
It's a sign of
the times, I guess

391
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,400
[belch]

392
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:58,612
-That boy is quite a skilled
player So, finish your story.

393
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:00,683
You and Akemi had
just gotten somethig

394
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:02,353
to eat what happened next?

395
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:05,360
-We went and had our
picture taken together.

396
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:06,897
Our faces were this far apart.

397
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:08,768
She laughed.

398
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:12,710
-Heh, heh If you
were broke, I doubt

399
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,882
she'd give you the time of day

400
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,552
-(VOICEOVER) This
guy's not very good.

401
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:18,623
He slaps hs stones
down awkwardly.

402
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:23,568
-With the Komi, it looks like
I won by 3 and 1/2 points.

403
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,505
This must be my lucky day.

404
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,644
It's time for you to pay up.

405
00:18:27,677 --> 00:18:31,518
[laughter]

406
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:32,788
-You earned it.

407
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:38,434
-I know I may not be Akemi,
but you bought me a night

408
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:39,636
on the town.

409
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:40,973
He's all yours, Yuki.

410
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,643
I've gotta warn you, though.

411
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:44,414
He reeks of alcohol.

412
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,018
-Here's the entrance fee.

413
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:48,657
[laughter]

414
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:51,898
-(VOICEOVER) A four stone
handicap sounds about right.

415
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,869
I'm going to let him
put two stones down.

416
00:18:53,902 --> 00:18:55,139
Is that all right?

417
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:56,508
-Only two stones?

418
00:18:56,508 --> 00:18:57,611
That isn't enough.

419
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:59,681
I think you should give
him at least three.

420
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:01,553
-I won't accept a
handicap, especially

421
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:02,755
from a young man like you.

422
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:04,559
We'll play an even game.

423
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:05,862
-You gamble?

424
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,833
-How about 500 yen a game?

425
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:09,003
Is that too much?

426
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:12,043
We can have a smaller
bet, if you'd like

427
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:15,651
-I want the same stakes
as your last game.

428
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:16,519
-Huh?

429
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:17,956
You're still in middle school.

430
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:20,762
Do you have 10,000 yen
in your piggy bank?

431
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:22,199
-You're getting carried away.

432
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:24,070
your usual bet is 1,000 yen.

433
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:25,172
-I can cover it.

434
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,542
Don't worry.

435
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:27,845
-That's a lot of money, boy.

436
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:32,489
I tell you, kids these days
never cease to surprise me.

437
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:33,724
Let's choose for color.

438
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:42,177
-I hope that you've
got some kind of plan.

439
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,847
How are we gonna stop him?

440
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:46,148
-I'm not quite sure.

441
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:48,117
We'll have to figure
that out as it goes.

442
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,520
I just hope that we
can get there in time.

443
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:54,023
-Akemi, you're the one I love.

444
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:55,958
You're the only one.

445
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:00,095
She's a real beauty.

446
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:02,264
I'm a lucky guy.

447
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:03,999
-I'm sure she's very pretty.

448
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,745
[humming]

449
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:17,746
-Oopsie.

450
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,814
-Huh?

451
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:20,149
-I'm really sorry
about that, son.

452
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:32,728
-Hm?

453
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:46,709
-Mitani!

454
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:57,486
[theme music]

455
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:25,140
HIKARU: This is turning out
to be a really close game.

456
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:26,508
I don't know who's gonna win.

457
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:30,045
SAI: Hikaru.

458
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,880
I believe Yuki's being tricked!

459
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,183
HIKARU: Then we
gotta do something.

460
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:36,151
SAI: Challenge
that man to a game

461
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:38,020
and we will teach him a lesson.

462
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,156
SAI: But he could
cheat against us.

463
00:22:41,156 --> 00:22:45,027
Next time, A Very
Despicable Act.

464
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,663
SAI: He won't have
a chance to cheat.

465
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:50,032
I'll force him to resign.
