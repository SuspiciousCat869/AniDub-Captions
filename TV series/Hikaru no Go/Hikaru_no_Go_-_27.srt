NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:11,678
a spirit from the past known as
Fujiware-no-Sai, has returned,

3
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,647
visible only to Hikaru Shindo.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,584
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the divine move.

5
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:20,187
[theme music]

6
00:01:58,065 --> 00:01:58,632
-Hm.

7
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:02,703
Winnings not as
easy as you think.

8
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:03,971
-Well, of course, it's not.

9
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:05,539
You're playing
against students who

10
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:07,008
are very dedicated
to the game and who

11
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,544
want to get to the top of
the league as much as you do.

12
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:11,412
-Hey, Shindo.

13
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:12,146
-Hi, Waya.

14
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,414
-Don't forget.

15
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:15,049
We've got our next study
session on Tuesday.

16
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:16,751
-I know.

17
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:20,021
-I never knew you were in
Morishita-sensei's study group.

18
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:21,355
-Oh, sorry.

19
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:22,790
I am.

20
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:23,924
-So what's it like?

21
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:24,759
-What do you think?

22
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,427
He learns a lot, right?

23
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,529
-Mhm.

24
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:30,064
-I guess you could say that.

25
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:31,399
-Wow.

26
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,933
Maybe I should join
the study group.

27
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,368
Do you think there'd be room?

28
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:37,838
-You sure you want to play
Go all day and all night?

29
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:39,073
-Good point.

30
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:41,942
We've got to relax sometime,
or else we'll go crazy.

31
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:47,648
Hey.

32
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,784
How about doing some
karaoke on the way home?

33
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:50,384
-Sure.

34
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:51,385
Why not?

35
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,054
Then maybe we could
go bowling after.

36
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:54,555
-Sounds good to me.

37
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:55,923
Mind if I invite Isumi?

38
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:56,924
-Go ahead.

39
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:57,992
Just give me a
minute to call home.

40
00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:58,759
-OK.

41
00:02:58,793 --> 00:02:59,727
I'll see you outside.

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,996
[sigh]

43
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:13,541
-Karaoke and bowling
does sound like fun,

44
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:15,910
but I kind of missing
everyone in the Go club.

45
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,836
-So if I played here, what
would your next move be?

46
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,704
-Here?

47
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:44,371
Hm.

48
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:44,847
-Mhm.

49
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:45,406
Yeah.

50
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,141
You got it.

51
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:48,742
-Yes.

52
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:49,710
Hm?

53
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:50,164
-Huh?

54
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,117
-Hikaru?

55
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,919
What are you doing here?

56
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,655
I thought you always went
straight home after school

57
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:04,091
the days.

58
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,127
That's where you've been
studying Go, isn't it?

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,361
Every day at your place?

60
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:08,129
-Yes.

61
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:09,463
I've been training
him very well.

62
00:04:09,497 --> 00:04:10,831
-Training me?

63
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:13,868
All you do is play
games with me.

64
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:15,469
I just wanted to say hi.

65
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,438
So what's happening with
the school tournament?

66
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,006
You girls are going
to enter, aren't you?

67
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,541
It's coming up soon.

68
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:21,675
-Mhm.

69
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:23,777
-You don't seem very excited.

70
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:25,079
And where's Yuki?

71
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,047
He didn't quit, did he?

72
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,482
-He did.

73
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:30,784
I tried to tell him he should
stay, but it was no good.

74
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:32,653
-Now we're both in
different classes.

75
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:34,922
I hardly ever get a
chance to talk to him.

76
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:38,058
It's kind of awkward for
me to mention the Go club.

77
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:42,496
It's too bad, but I'm sure he'll
come back and join us some day.

78
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,398
-The Go club isn't the same.

79
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:46,567
Everyone seems to
be so disheartened.

80
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,241
-Hm.

81
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:57,945
Hey.

82
00:04:57,945 --> 00:04:59,079
I know.

83
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,881
Why don't I come and
play for old times' sake?

84
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,052
You must get so
bored having to play

85
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:06,787
girls who don't know
what they're doing.

86
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,356
So let me play all
three of you at once.

87
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,888
OK?

88
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:10,357
Huh-huh?

89
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:10,991
OK?

90
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:12,793
-Hm.

91
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,562
Hikaru?

92
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:17,464
Maybe it'd be better if she
didn't come here anymore.

93
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:17,916
-Huh?

94
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:26,740
[whimper]

95
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:34,782
-Ow.

96
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:35,649
-I'm sorry.

97
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:37,551
But you heard what Natsume said.

98
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:39,820
There's still a
chance that Yuki will

99
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,756
decide to rejoin the Go club.

100
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,559
What if today was the day
that he decided to drop in

101
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:46,727
and he saw you here?

102
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,398
He wouldn't like it.

103
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,767
And then he might just-- he
might just walk out and never

104
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:54,501
come back again.

105
00:05:57,838 --> 00:05:58,405
-Huh.

106
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:06,914
[whimper]

107
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:15,823
-Hikaru.

108
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:16,657
-One game.

109
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:19,493
It'll be OK.

110
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:20,461
Come on.

111
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:21,595
One game's not going
to hurt anyone.

112
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:23,063
Get out another board.

113
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:23,664
Come on.

114
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:24,598
Let's play.

115
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:25,866
-Hikaru.

116
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:26,467
-Yay.

117
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,644
-Hahah.

118
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:38,012
-You're such a jerk.

119
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:40,614
-You girls can have as big
a handicap as you want.

120
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:41,081
-Oh?

121
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,950
We're that bad?

122
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,518
I'm taking a huge handicap.

123
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:45,919
-Go ahead.

124
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,520
-Right.

125
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:54,528
Enough for you?

126
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:55,496
-That's OK.

127
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,464
Sure you don't put any more on?

128
00:06:57,498 --> 00:06:58,399
-More?

129
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,700
But we've almost
filled the board.

130
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,702
How can we put any more on?

131
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:02,157
-Heh.

132
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:02,703
OK, then.

133
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,941
-I'm not sure I want to
go through with this.

134
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,576
-Onegaishimasu.

135
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,077
-Onegaishimasu.

136
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:54,421
AKARI: Oh.

137
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:57,391
Hikaru, you've won.

138
00:07:57,424 --> 00:07:58,592
I hate this.

139
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,362
Even with a really huge
handicap he still beats me.

140
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:02,463
-I know.

141
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,398
Why did we agree to this
game in the first place?

142
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,466
-Hikaru.

143
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,000
You could have shown
them a little mercy.

144
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,435
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Heh.

145
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:13,407
That's how you always play
against me, so why can't I?

146
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:15,776
[door rumbling]

147
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:33,727
-Yuki, wait.

148
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:35,028
It's not what you think.

149
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:36,397
Hikaru just dropped by.

150
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:37,598
We weren't expecting him.

151
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:44,538
-Honestly?

152
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,106
It really doesn't bother me
whether he's there or not.

153
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,375
I forgot my notes
from chemistry class,

154
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,077
so I just came to pick them up.

155
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:51,812
Ah, it doesn't matter.

156
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:53,046
I can get them tomorrow.

157
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,917
Must be nice to have a
hotshot insei in the club.

158
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:57,518
-Huh.

159
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:05,459
You didn't really come here
to get your notes, did you?

160
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:07,761
-They're on the last
seat at the back.

161
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:08,762
By the window.

162
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:12,316
-Huh.

163
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,144
-Akari?

164
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:26,547
-You OK?

165
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,621
-Hm.

166
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:38,392
-They are here.

167
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:39,393
-Listen. I--

168
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:39,893
-It's OK.

169
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:43,797
I found them.

170
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:45,532
He only came back
because he left his notes

171
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:47,134
from the chemistry class here.

172
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:48,936
That was well.

173
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:52,039
-But he didn't have
chemistry today.

174
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:13,794
-Wait a minute.

175
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:15,496
Ms. Tomako had
the day off today,

176
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,931
so there couldn't
have been a class.

177
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:18,532
Man.

178
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:27,508
AKARI: Now look what
you've gone and done.

179
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,141
-What are you doing?

180
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,643
-How could you be so stupid?

181
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:31,879
Yuki's never going to come back
now and it's all your fault.

182
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:33,881
Pick up the stones and
get out of this classroom.

183
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:34,815
-OK!

184
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:35,816
-Don't just lie
there on the floor.

185
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:36,850
Move!

186
00:10:36,884 --> 00:10:37,851
Get out now!

187
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,834
-It doesn't seem like it's
been almost a whole year.

188
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,969
Since Hikaru first
dragged me along

189
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,571
to his silly little Go club.

190
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:03,577
-We put up the poster.

191
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,945
-It didn't work.

192
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:05,946
-No one came.

193
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:07,881
-Yeah.

194
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:10,450
-And I bet we never see
Yuki back here again.

195
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,689
[sigh]

196
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,758
-Anyone got any ideas?

197
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,928
-We could always try
putting up a new poster?

198
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:22,996
That's how we got Yuki
to join last year.

199
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,499
We put a Go problem
up on the board.

200
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:26,500
-Really?

201
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,001
I think we should
concentrate on getting

202
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:29,970
you girls more practices
before the tournament.

203
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,371
It starts next month.

204
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:32,039
-What?

205
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:33,974
You mean we're going to enter?

206
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:35,142
-Of course.

207
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,578
I've asked Kaneko from the
volleyball team to play.

208
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:39,079
That'll make three of us.

209
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,749
We'll be an awesome team.

210
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:45,018
-You girls are so lucky.

211
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,621
I'm the only guy,
so I can't enter.

212
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:50,591
I'll just have to cheer you on.

213
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:53,527
-Hm.

214
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,762
-Uh-- excuse me?

215
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:58,966
Is this were you sign
up for the Go club?

216
00:11:58,999 --> 00:11:59,967
Because I want to join.

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,402
Is that OK?

218
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:07,151
[bell rings]

219
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:20,264
[chuckling]

220
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:20,998
-Sorry.

221
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,300
Have you seen Yuki?

222
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:22,967
-Hey!

223
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,568
Mitani!

224
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:29,774
-Excuse me.

225
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:31,075
Can we talk?

226
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:32,343
-Hm?

227
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:33,077
Oh.

228
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,312
Hey there, Natsume.

229
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:37,114
So what do you want?

230
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:39,317
-Well, it's about the Go club.

231
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,351
-The Go club?

232
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:43,221
I can't believe you're
still doing that.

233
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:45,990
Playing against those useless
little girls all the time.

234
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:47,625
-Hey, you shouldn't
call them that.

235
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:48,926
They've been working hard.

236
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,895
They play a pretty
good game of Go.

237
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:52,063
But that's not the point.

238
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,765
We had a new member sign
up for the club yesterday.

239
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:56,167
-Yeah? So what?

240
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,735
-Well, he's only in
the seventh grade,

241
00:12:57,768 --> 00:12:59,804
so he's not the greatest
player, but he's probably

242
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:00,838
as good as me.

243
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:02,306
Anyway, the point
is that now we have

244
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:04,308
two guys as members of the club.

245
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:05,343
-Like I said, so what?

246
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,278
-The thing is, if
you came back, we'd

247
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:09,146
have enough players to
enter the tournament.

248
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:13,017
[groan]

249
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,318
-Not that again.

250
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:16,787
-You can be our captain.

251
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:17,722
Come on, Yuki.

252
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,356
Think about it.

253
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,225
We need you.

254
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,693
-You, there.

255
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:24,128
Didn't you hear the bell?

256
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:26,030
Haven't you got
a class to go to?

257
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,299
-I'll come back and
see you after school.

258
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:31,168
Wait for me, OK?

259
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,170
-Hey, man?

260
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:34,805
Don't waste anymore time.

261
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,175
I'm not coming
back to your club.

262
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,610
TEACHER: Shut that door, please.

263
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,080
All right.

264
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,982
Let's start with
yesterday's homework.

265
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,758
-OK.

266
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,961
The next experiment we'll
be doing is on page 47.

267
00:13:56,994 --> 00:13:58,896
You can start getting
your equipment.

268
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:01,327
One set per group, please.

269
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:24,216
[shatter] [gasp]

270
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:24,750
GIRL: Oopsie.

271
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,885
MS. TOMAKO: Oh, no.

272
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:27,653
Can't you be more careful?

273
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:28,587
GIRL: It wasn't me.

274
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:30,823
It as her fault.

275
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:33,225
MS. TOMAKO: I don't
care whose fault it was.

276
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:37,129
Just get it cleaned
up, all right?

277
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:40,165
YUKI (VOICEOVER): What's this?

278
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:41,500
Game records?

279
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:44,336
Since when did they
start doing that?

280
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,406
They've playing a lot of games.

281
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:48,440
Huh.

282
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,409
There must be like
five books here.

283
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:51,610
Oh yeah.

284
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,679
They've got five members.

285
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:58,284
The useless girls, Natsume,
Hitoshi Koike, and let's

286
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:00,286
see who else.

287
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:00,742
Hm.

288
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,124
This is mine.

289
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:11,163
-Mitani!

290
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:11,830
Hey, Mitani!

291
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,335
What do you think you're doing?

292
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:17,303
We need you over here.

293
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:34,620
-What?

294
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,389
Why did you give up
so easily, Natsume?

295
00:15:37,423 --> 00:15:38,824
-I tried.

296
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:40,125
-Oh, well.

297
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,394
I guess I could always
try asking him myself.

298
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:45,464
-Maybe it would be better
if we all went together.

299
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:47,399
-We've got to keep
positive, you guys.

300
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,401
Something good is going
to happen in the end.

301
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:50,469
I know it.

302
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:51,704
-I think he's right.

303
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:53,539
After all, Koike's
joined the club.

304
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:55,140
-So, what've you got there?

305
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:55,774
The new poster?

306
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:56,609
-Wow.

307
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:57,643
You've done it already?

308
00:15:57,676 --> 00:15:59,878
-I hope you think it's OK.

309
00:15:59,912 --> 00:16:02,181
I decided to do something
different from last year.

310
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:03,248
-It looks great.

311
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:04,383
Nice job.

312
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,217
[giggling]

313
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:05,638
-Thanks.

314
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,275
Oh.

315
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:14,309
Yuki, you're here.

316
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:16,311
-This means we can
play in the tournament!

317
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:17,879
You will be our captain, right?

318
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:18,847
-Nope.

319
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:19,815
-Huh?

320
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:22,250
-But why not?

321
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:24,252
-If you're not going to
play in the tournament,

322
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:25,587
then why are you here?

323
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:28,623
Did you want to just
play some games for fun?

324
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:29,357
-Sure.

325
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:30,625
I don't see why not.

326
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,527
-We'd love you to.

327
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:33,862
-Wow.

328
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:36,565
In that case, I'd better
get another board out.

329
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:38,867
-Why don't you start by
playing Natsume and Koike

330
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:39,634
at the same time?

331
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:45,774
-Um-- my name's Hitoshi
Koike, in 7th grade.

332
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:46,975
It's so good to meet you.

333
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,344
-Then after that, maybe
you can play the two of us.

334
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:51,480
Show him how much we've
improved since the last time

335
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:52,547
he was here.

336
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,419
-Hiya.

337
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:59,988
[gasp]

338
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:01,289
-Kaneko?

339
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:02,991
-If I'm going to be in
this tournament, than

340
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:05,460
I need to start getting
myself into better shape.

341
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:06,762
And I'm not going
to get in shape

342
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:08,296
unless I practice with you guys.

343
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,731
So, here I am.

344
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:10,799
Well?

345
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:12,267
Which one of you is
the strongest player?

346
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,868
Come on.

347
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:19,608
I see.

348
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:20,509
Come on.

349
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:21,843
Let's start.

350
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:22,644
Choose for color.

351
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:23,779
-Hey, you're really bossy.

352
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:25,213
Did you know that?

353
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,214
And what?

354
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:27,349
You going to play
with no handicap?

355
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:28,316
-It's our first time.

356
00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:29,718
I want an even game with you.

357
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:30,986
Find out how good you are.

358
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:33,355
But if you want to put down
some stones go right ahead.

359
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,289
I don't mind.

360
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:35,357
-What?

361
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,858
What do you mean me
put down some stones?

362
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:37,893
-Oh.

363
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,928
So you think you're
really good, huh?

364
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:40,595
Come on.

365
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:41,863
Let's find out.

366
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:42,564
Here.

367
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:47,235
[groan]

368
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:47,736
-Oh, look.

369
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:48,970
I'm playing first.

370
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,439
Sure you don't want a ten
and a half point handicap?

371
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:51,973
[whimpering]

372
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,309
-Why you little--

373
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:55,710
-Please be nice to Yuki.

374
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,845
We don't want him to leave.

375
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:10,859
-My game's a bit rusty.

376
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:13,228
Haven't played in a while.

377
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:13,895
-Yeah.

378
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:15,363
Well, I'm not trying very hard.

379
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:20,368
-Oh.

380
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:21,369
Did you see that move?

381
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:22,671
She managed to connect.

382
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:24,906
NATSUME (VOICEOVER): Yuki
knows he's got the upper hand,

383
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,442
so he didn't even
try and capture.

384
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:28,977
He let her connect the stones.

385
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:36,251
Even so, she's way
better than me or Koike.

386
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:39,721
No wonder she was so confident.

387
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:42,791
-So you going to resign
anytime soon or what?

388
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:43,692
-Hm.

389
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:44,860
Not just yet.

390
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,828
Although I have to admit,
you're a strong player.

391
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:48,263
-You know you've got to resign.

392
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:49,798
Let's hear the words.

393
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:50,732
-Hm.

394
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,300
Sometimes you come
across opponents

395
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:54,469
who make you want to
fight to the bitter end.

396
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:55,837
[growl]

397
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,273
[whimpering]

398
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:00,542
-Well, it doesn't look
like I've got much choice.

399
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,509
I resign.

400
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:04,379
Happy now?

401
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:08,216
So, next game how about we play
with a three stone handicap?

402
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,284
-Hah.

403
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:10,385
If you think you can
win with that, sure.

404
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:11,419
Give it a try.

405
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:12,687
-You shouldn't be
so sure of yourself.

406
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:14,990
Because it's going to hurt
real bad when you lose.

407
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,591
-We forgot to record the game.

408
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:23,431
-Finally, we've got a game
to put into Yuki's book.

409
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:26,301
-Let's hope it's going
to be the first of many.

410
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:28,336
-Who says I want to
have my games recorded?

411
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,437
-Why not?

412
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:31,673
We'll need to get a
book for Kaneko as well.

413
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:32,307
-Oh.

414
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:33,508
Yes, please.

415
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,243
I want it there
in black and white

416
00:19:35,277 --> 00:19:38,380
for everyone to see when I
start winning against this guy.

417
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:40,782
[whimpering]

418
00:19:43,752 --> 00:19:45,620
-Thanks for coming to
the club today, Kaneko.

419
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:47,255
It was fun having you there.

420
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:50,859
Hey, by the way, Hikaru's in
the same class as you, right?

421
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:52,494
-Yeah. what about him?

422
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:54,529
-Well, can you give
him a message for me?

423
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:56,298
Would you mind
telling him that Yuki

424
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:58,266
started coming to
the Go club again.

425
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,935
So he doesn't need to worry.

426
00:19:59,968 --> 00:20:01,336
-Hm.

427
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:02,304
Sure, I will.

428
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:03,571
But I won't see
him until Monday,

429
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:05,707
because he's got the day
off from school tomorrow.

430
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:06,308
-Really?

431
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:07,275
Why?

432
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,710
-Well, I heard him
ask for the day

433
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,912
off, because he's competing
in some Young Lions

434
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:12,881
tournament or something.

435
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:14,316
-In the Young Lions?

436
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:15,650
-So cool!

437
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:17,385
-Let him play his
tournament in peace.

438
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:19,754
You girls should
leave him alone.

439
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:20,689
[gasp]

440
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:21,990
-See you later.

441
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:23,258
-Bye.

442
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:23,758
-Bye.

443
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:24,626
Thanks for coming.

444
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:25,293
-Yeah.

445
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:25,994
See you later.

446
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:26,962
-Hey, Yuki.

447
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:29,230
Three stone handicap
again tomorrow?

448
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:31,533
-What makes you think
I'm even coming tomorrow?

449
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:33,868
-You don't show,
I'll win by default.

450
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:35,971
-And why do you want to
play three stones again?

451
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:38,840
I mean, you had three stone
today and you lost every game!

452
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,609
-So what! if I lose every
game tomorrow then I'll go up

453
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:42,377
to four.

454
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,311
-What is wrong with you?

455
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:45,480
I never said I'd be there!

456
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:58,793
[theme music]

457
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:22,844
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): The
Young Lions tournament.

458
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:24,712
I can't believe
I'm actually here.

459
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:25,814
I made it!

460
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:26,981
SAI (VOICEOVER): Don't
be disruptive, Hikaru.

461
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,516
Lots of people are watching.

462
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,652
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Do you think
I should've dressed up for it?

463
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:32,320
Some of these guys
looks pretty formal.

464
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:35,457
SAI (VOICEOVER): What matters is
how you play the game, Hikaru.

465
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,459
Just stay calm and
concentrate on that.

466
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:46,234
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Next time--
the Young Lions tournament.

467
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:49,804
Maybe this'll be my
chance to play Toya.
