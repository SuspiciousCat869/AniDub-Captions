00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,343
IJIMA (VOICEOVER):
Shindo's changed

3
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:53,513
since I saw him
play in the prelims.

4
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:57,050
-Hikaru, you're not intimidated
by Gorilla Man at all now.

5
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,118
-I know.

6
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,419
I thought if I gave
him some attitude,

7
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,988
it would take my
mind of the test,

8
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,222
and I wouldn't be so nervous.

9
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,257
-Such a magnificent strategy.

10
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,258
-OK.

11
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,526
Let's go and check
out the room where

12
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,462
I'll be playing the matches.

13
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,464
ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
It's finally begun.

14
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,533
The pro exam is going
to be a tough battle.

15
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,303
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Only three
people can pass the test.

16
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,239
HONDA (VOICEOVER): This
year is going to be my year.

17
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,508
OCHI (VOICEOVER): I'm not
just here to pass the exam.

18
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,244
My goal is to finish
as the number 1 player.

19
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,317
-Six straight wins.

20
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,418
Shindo?

21
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,286
He's won six games in a row?

22
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,971
-Finally, you made it here!

23
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,172
-Hm?

24
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,741
-Today's the day I get to
play my match against you.

25
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,278
I was so excited, I didn't
sleep a wink last night.

26
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,048
Don't get upset when
you lose to me again.

27
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,583
I'm sure you've won all the
games you played up to now.

28
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,118
But I'm going to
show you it's been

29
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,254
nothing more than
a lucky streak.

30
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,255
-Oh, I see.

31
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,456
So if I beat you
today, that's going

32
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,724
to be just another fluke, huh?

33
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,260
Or will that finally prove
that I'm better than you.

34
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,528
-Hm?

35
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,596
So you think you can talk
back to me now, do you?

36
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,331
What happened to the
jittery little punk

37
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,399
I played in the prelims?

38
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,101
You look so relaxed now.

39
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,203
-I might look
relaxed, but I'm not.

40
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,505
Every time I come here,
I get really nervous

41
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,274
just like you, Mr. Tsubaki.

42
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:27,974
-Huh?

43
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,276
What do you mean?

44
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,511
-You feel nervous, so you decide
to bug other people, right?

45
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,246
It calms you down.

46
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,482
And that's what you did
to me back in the prelims.

47
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,717
-No way!

48
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,418
-Well, at first, I thought
it was some kind of strategy

49
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,387
of yours to try and put me off.

50
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,123
-A strategy to put you off?

51
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,258
I never do something
as mean as that.

52
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,026
-[laughs]

53
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,127
You're always shouting.

54
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,595
So can you blame me
for thinking you would?

55
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,229
-Hey, Shindo!

56
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,530
How are you?

57
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,032
-Oh, hey!

58
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,135
You better give me a ride on
that bike of yours, some time.

59
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,503
-Uhh.

60
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,038
Uh!

61
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,707
That kid's really changed
since the prelims.

62
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,377
There's no way I'm
going to lose to him.

63
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,280
OCHI (VOICEOVER):
Shindo's changed.

64
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,751
That's what Ijima
said about him, too.

65
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,505
Hm.

66
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,226
-Ladies and gentlemen,
it's now time for lunch.

67
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,061
So please stop your clocks.

68
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,131
[chatter]

69
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,333
TSUBAKI: So what if you got
the next move after lunch?

70
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,169
It doesn't make any difference!

71
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,537
-But you told me
at the prelims it

72
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,673
was good to have the lunch break
to think about your next move.

73
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,142
-Yeah, but that was the prelims.

74
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,410
We got way more time
to play in the finals.

75
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,114
In the finals, you need to use
your lunch break to chill out.

76
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,116
-You're just saying
that to confuse me.

77
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:43,984
-Hey!

78
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,118
What are you talking about?

79
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,254
I never said anything
to confuse you!

80
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:50,157
BOY: Keep the noise
down, will you?

81
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,691
-You talking to me?

82
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,361
This is a public area, isn't it?

83
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,165
If you don't like the
noise, go somewhere else!

84
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,333
-You don't take
anything seriously.

85
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,369
Must be nice having a
cushy job to fall back

86
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,503
on if you fail the test.

87
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,538
-What?

88
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,107
You think I've got a
job to fall back on?

89
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,275
You're dead wrong!

90
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,477
Sure, I took time off
work during the prelims.

91
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,480
But now we're in the
finals, I had to quit.

92
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,415
The exam goes on for two months.

93
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,285
If I ask for time off
every time I played,

94
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,987
they would have fired me.

95
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,389
-Oh, never mind.

96
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,391
Probably, it wasn't
that good a job anyway.

97
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,426
-Oh, yeah, kid?

98
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,262
-It doesn't matter
how good a company is.

99
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,598
None of them would give
us this much time off.

100
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,066
They don't understand.

101
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,101
That's why I have
always worked part-time.

102
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,369
-Really?

103
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,538
-This is the fifth year
I've taken the test.

104
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:41,474
I thought you would have
recognized my face by now.

105
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,144
Mind you, this is the first time
I've made it past the prelims

106
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,512
to the finals.

107
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,247
MAN: You live here in Tokyo?

108
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,515
-Yeah.

109
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,117
-I've come all the
way from Nagano.

110
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,487
It cost me almost 20,000
yen just to get here.

111
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,656
On Tuesdays, I just
come down for the day.

112
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,625
But on the weekends, I
stay at a friend's place

113
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:02,262
in Tokyo-- saves on
expensive hotel bills.

114
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:06,399
-Yeah, I'm in a hotel, but
money's not the only problem.

115
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,101
I've got too many
things on my mind.

116
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,970
It's hard trying
to get to sleep.

117
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,504
I'd much rather stay
at a friend's place

118
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,273
than some small hotel room.

119
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,976
It'd be a good change of
pace and help me relax.

120
00:06:16,758 --> 00:06:19,027
-Sounds to me like the
students who live here in Tokyo

121
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:22,463
have it real easy, ha?

122
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:24,799
How come you're not studying
for something at college

123
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:26,100
like the rest of them?

124
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:27,335
You're smart enough, ain't you?

125
00:06:27,368 --> 00:06:29,037
-What's the point
of college if you're

126
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:30,471
going to become a professional?

127
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:32,907
-There are a lot of
people who do it.

128
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:35,043
They get into one of
the top universities,

129
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:37,178
and then they focus on
passing the pro exam.

130
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:39,547
-But don't forget the kids who
pass the test while they're

131
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:41,049
still in high school.

132
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:43,351
They often go back to college
and get more qualifications

133
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:44,986
after they've become a pro.

134
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:48,423
MAN: Yeah, remember that one guy
who went on to become a lawyer?

135
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:50,191
Seems like if you
can make it as a pro,

136
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:52,160
you can do just about
anything you want.

137
00:06:52,193 --> 00:06:54,028
-The important word being "if."

138
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:56,264
Let's not talk about it anymore.

139
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:59,100
-Humph, it doesn't really matter
if you're smart or stupid.

140
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:02,170
The only thing that matters
is beating your opponent.

141
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:05,139
-You know, Mr. Tsubaki,
people might listen to you

142
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:07,108
more if you didn't
shout all the time.

143
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:07,582
-What?

144
00:07:07,582 --> 00:07:08,176
-He-he.

145
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:09,377
MAN: He's right.

146
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,180
Sometimes the things you
say really irritate people.

147
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:13,481
-[chuckles]

148
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:15,483
-Come here and say that!

149
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:18,753
-Well, lunch is nearly over.

150
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:20,054
Time to go.

151
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:21,355
-When you're ready,
please begin.

152
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,037
SAI (VOICEOVER):
All these players

153
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:37,305
come from different backgrounds.

154
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:39,540
They have different
strengths and weaknesses.

155
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:43,177
But they all have one
thing in common-- a passion

156
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:45,046
for the game of Go.

157
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,781
The rules of the
finals are simple.

158
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:49,183
The three players who
win the most games

159
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:52,887

-Well done, Hikaru.

163
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:59,060
You've defeated Tsubaki.

164
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:19,347
-Hm, let's see.

165
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,915
Great games.

166
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:27,288
Isumi, Ochi, Waya, and even
Shindo are still undefeated.

-Waya lost a game?

169
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:35,897
His opponent was Adachi.

170
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:36,898
-What about you, Isumi?

171
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:37,532
Did you win?

172
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:38,900
-Yeah.

173
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,501
-We've still got
a long way to go.

174
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:42,904
Waya has done well to get
this far without a loss.

175
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:44,105
I've only lost two.

176
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:45,206
I can still make it.

177

ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Shindo
won his game today.

OCHI (VOICEOVER): I
play Isumi in match 15

00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:07,128
and Shindo on the very last day.

OCHI (VOICEOVER): The
10th match tomorrow.

185
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:17,538
And then I get to
meet with Toya.

[gate closes]

188

AKIRA (VOICEOVER): According
to the scores posted

189
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:43,030
on the internet, Ochi
hasn't lost a match so far.

190
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,433
He obviously has talent.

191
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:49,003
I wonder what he'll
say about Shindo.

192
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:52,974
This is my chance to find out
what level he's playing at now.

193
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:55,810
It could just be my
imagination, but I

194
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:58,012
can sense Shindo's
footsteps behind me.

OCHI (VOICEOVER):
Why does everyone

204
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:29,310
make such a big deal about him?

205
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,444
He seems normal to me.

206
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:34,882
[gasps]

207
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:40,354
This isn't a teaching game.

208
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:41,389
He's playing to win.

209
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:55,202
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Ochi's
game is pretty good.

210
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:57,171
He's probably the best
insei around right now.

211
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,276
But I won't let
him take my place.

212
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,079
If it turns out he's anywhere
near as strong as I am,

213
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:08,182
then his match with Shindo is
going to be very interesting.

214
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:12,753
When they play against
each other, I'll find out.

215
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:14,989
Is Shindo really worthy
enough to be my rival?

216
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:19,427
-Sorry about that.

217
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,429
I didn't mean to
keep you waiting.

218
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:22,964
Are you all right?

219
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:25,433
You ran straight to the bathroom
as soon as the game was over.

220
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,768
I thought you were
never going to come out.

221
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:29,170
-Everything's fine now.

222
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,304
-You sure?

fine, Grandpa!

[door shuts]

227

OCHI (VOICEOVER): So
this is Akira Toya.

228
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:47,088
Now, I know why everyone has
such a high opinion of him.

229
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:51,025
Once I become a pro, he's
going to be my rival.

230
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:53,160
-I was told this was supposed
to be a teaching game.

231
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,962
But it looked like you
wanted a real match,

232
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,197
so I didn't hold anything back.

233
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,099
I played you at full strength.

234
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:01,969
Do you want me to
review the game now?

235
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:04,005
-I think I already
know the reason I lost.

236
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:11,345
I was quite aggressive
when I tried

237
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,814
to surround the right side
with these two moves here.

238
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:15,383
That turned out be a mistake.

239
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,519
Once I was cut off, the game
was pretty much over for me.

240
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:22,023
I should probably
have extended instead.

241
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:24,025
-That's definitely
part of the reason.

242
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:26,427
But you also spent too much
time worrying about territory

243
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,996
when what you should be
doing is using your strongest

244
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,132
areas to attack.

245
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:32,433
AKIRA (VOICEOVER):
Ochi and Shindo

246
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,902
play each other on the
last day of the exam.

247
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:37,071
That means there's still
a month and a half to go.

248
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:40,441
I should be able to raise the
level of Ochi's game by then.

249
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:44,178
-If you moved here,
black would be solid.

250
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:44,779
Huh?

[sighs]

252
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:53,421
I was checking out the
Go Association's website.

253
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:57,024
I noticed only three of you
have won every game so far.

254
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,427
You, someone named
Isumi, and Shindo.

255
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,929
-No, Shindo lost today.

256
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:03,030
-Shindo lost?

257
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,864
Who beat him?

258
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:05,299
-Someone I never saw before.

259
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:06,834
-What was the game like?

260
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,102
-I've got no idea.

261
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,037
You know how long
the pro exam is.

262
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:11,238
It can be pretty tiring.

263
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,174
Maybe he just had an
off day or something.

264
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:15,843
Besides, it's only one match.

265
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,946
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Hm,
so Shindo lost a game.

266
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:24,218
-What's the big deal about
Shindo all of a sudden?

267
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,886
Is there something
I should know?

268
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,821
OCHI (VOICEOVER): Huh!

269
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:28,155
Now, that I think
about it, there

270
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:31,859
was a rumor going around when
Shindo first became an insei.

271
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:36,030
He said he was
Akira Toya's rival.

272
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:40,034
He was stuck way down in the B
league, so no one believed him.

273
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:43,771
But what if the rumor is true?

274
00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:46,207
-I'd be interested to find
out what you think of Shindo.

275
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:51,245
-I don't think he is strong
enough to be a threat.

276
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:52,813
The players I'm
worried about right

277
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:55,783
now are Isumi, Waya, and Honda.

278
00:13:55,816 --> 00:13:59,286
Close behind them, there's
Adachi, Komiya, and then, maybe Shindo.

279
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,025
And just for the
record, so you know,

280
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:07,328
I've never lost a
game against Shindo.

281
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:08,796
-I see.

282
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:11,165
And when was the last time
you and him played each other?

283
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,167
OCHI: About three months ago.

284
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,336
-Three months ago?

285
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:17,238
Not very recent, is it?

286
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:19,874
OCHI (VOICEOVER):
What's with this guy?

287
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:22,042
-You're playing Shindo
later in the finals.

288
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:23,477
On the last day, right?

289
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:25,312
AKIRA (VOICEOVER):
That gives me some time

290
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:28,449
to train Ochi for the games
so he can play as I would.

291
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:30,918
-Tell you what, Ochi,
if it's OK with you,

292
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:34,388
I could tutor you as
often as you like.

293
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:35,890
-Wait a minute.

294
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,892
You're not suggesting I'm
going to need your help

295
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:39,760
to beat Shindo, are you?

296
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:41,228
-Nah, no.

297
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:43,764
I never said you
couldn't beat him.

298
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:46,200
It's just if you want to achieve
your goal of passing the test

299
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:49,069
undefeated, then a few
extra study lessons with me

300
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:49,803
might help.

301
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,071
That's all.

302
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:52,973
-Oh, now, I get it.

303
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:53,841
-Now, you get what?

304
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:54,441
-Rrh!

305
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:55,476
I know what you're doing.

306
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,211
You're just using me!

307
00:14:57,244 --> 00:15:00,181
Using my game to measure
Shindo's skill level!

308
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:01,749
-Hm.

309
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:04,185
-I can beat him on my
own without your help!

310
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:06,453
You understand?

311
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,355
-Kosuke, what's going on?

312
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:11,458
-And besides, why is someone
like you concerned with Shindo?

313
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:14,161
It doesn't make sense!

314
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:15,462
-I'm sorry.

315
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:18,532
I think that's probably
enough for today.

316
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,067
-For today?

317
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,368
You're never coming back!

318
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:22,836
-Kosuke!

319
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,772
-You may not think of me as
much of a player right now.

320
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:26,774
But one day, I am
going to be a rival.

321
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:27,541
Get out!

322
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:31,378
-[grunts]

323
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:36,383
I've got no idea what
this is all about,

324
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:39,420
but I apologize for my
grandson's behavior.

325
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:42,756
Maybe we can give you a call and
arrange another study session

326
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,857
if we need it.

327
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:45,893
We appreciate you coming out.

328
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:47,127
-He won't be coming back.

329
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:48,329
I don't need him.

330
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:50,331
-Kosuke.

331
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:52,299
-I'll wait to hear from you.

332
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:53,467
-Uhh.

333
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,935
Kosuke!

334
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:55,402
-Humph.

335
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,341
OCHI (VOICEOVER): Shindo?

336
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:02,176
Why Shindo?

337
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:04,245
Once he got promoted
to the A league,

338
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:06,313
he kept moving up
in his rankings.

339
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:08,749
Now, he's in the pro
exam with just one loss.

340
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:13,120
-He's changed.

341
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:14,188
He's stronger.

342
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:14,788
-Uh.

343
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:39,213
-Ah, Honda, you're leaving.

344
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:41,081
Anyone still playing in there?

345
00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:42,483
-Just one game left.

346
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:43,450
SENSEI: I see.

347
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:45,319
I wonder how long
their going to be?

348
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,087
Hm.

349
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:48,155
-See you later, sir.

350
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:53,093
That win for me today
means I stay at two losses.

351
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:54,461
You guys are the
front runners now.

352
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:01,402
You and Ochi are the only ones
who have won every game so far.

353
00:17:01,435 --> 00:17:04,104
Shindo and Waya
have only lost one.

354
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:07,308
-The pressure is really on
for me to make it this year.

355
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:12,046
You see, this is my last chance
to take the test as an insei.

356
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,781
HONDA: I totally understand.

357
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:15,549
I'm only one year
behind you, remember?

358
00:17:15,749 --> 00:17:17,284
My parents have told
me if I don't make it

359
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:18,986
by the time I'm
20, then I've got

360
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:21,855
to find something else to do.

361
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:24,758
ISUMI: Hm.

362
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:26,960
I know we can keep taking
the pro exam until we're 30.

363
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:28,529
But I figure if
I don't pass now,

364
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:31,899
I'm never going to be a pro.

365
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:33,934
HONDA: Hey, Isumi, you're
playing Shindo next,

366
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,069
aren't you?

367
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:37,471
No hard feelings, but
I hope he beats you.

368
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:39,039
Because if you and
Ochi don't start

369
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:40,441
losing a game here
and there, I'm

370
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:43,410
never going to have a
chance of passing this exam.

371
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,346
ISUMI: [chuckles]

372
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:49,917
Yeah, but if I let Shindo win,
he might end up overtaking me.

373
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,886
-His run of good luck's
got to come to an end soon.

374
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:54,955
ISUMI: You sure about that?

375
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:56,890
Even though he has
lost a game, he

376
00:17:56,924 --> 00:18:00,361
managed to turn things around
and win a solid match today.

377
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:04,164
-Hm, do you remember what
Ijima told us about him?

378
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:05,399
He said Shindo had changed.

379
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:09,036
And we'd find out when
we played against him.

380
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:11,271
ISUMI: And after
Kamiya lost to Shindo,

381
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:13,006
he said he had
done much stronger.

382
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,279
-Well, it doesn't really
matter how strong he is now.

383
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:24,752
The important thing is none of
us can afford to lose to him.

384
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:25,419
-Of course not.

385
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:46,013
-Tomorrow is your big
match against Isumi.

386
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:48,783
Don't be nervous and give
yourself an upset stomach

387
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:52,186
like you did the day you lost.

388
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,021
It's important for
you to be prepared,

389
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:55,823
both mentally and physically.

390
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:57,691
If you can do that,
then I'm confident you

391
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:58,893
will gain another victory.

392
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:06,235
Hikaru?

393
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:10,771
-It's your turn to move, OK.

394
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,074
Sai?

395
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:15,009
You should really start
paying more attention

396
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,143
or you're going to lose.

397
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:18,079
-[chuckles]

398
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,582
Me lose to you, Hikaru?

399
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:22,683
Tell me something.

400
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,552
In all the time
we've been playing,

401
00:19:24,552 --> 00:19:27,154
when have you ever
won a game against me?

402
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:28,989
Haah!

403
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:31,392
You've got some nerve!

404
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:32,660
I'll cut you down and--

405
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,761
-Hikaru!

406
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:36,831
Now, what in the world
is he doing up there?

407
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:38,933
[hikaru and sai bickering]

408
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:41,469
-Why are you making
such a racket up there?

409
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:55,816
-What do you think of Shindo?

410
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:58,152

2 for Shindo coming up today,

courtesy of Isumi.

412
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:02,156
Let that be your answer, Toya.

413
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:06,927
-Try and stay calm.

414
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:08,829
Play my normal game.

415
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:10,397
It'll be fine.

416
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:11,932
-You know what I just realized?

417
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:13,601
You haven't been
doing that thing where

418
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:15,402
you put the winning
stamp on your hand

419
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:17,571
like you did in
the preliminaries.

420
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:18,672
-Huh, you're right.

421
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:25,546
Yeah!

422
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:27,081
Let's go and mark
me as a winner!

423
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:27,781
Ha-ha!

424
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:30,151
-Great.

425
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:33,554
Uh, Hikaru, your
opponent in today's match

426
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:35,156
is standing before us.

427
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:37,725
-Huh.

428
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:40,728
-Hm?

[music playing]

430
00:22:22,763 --> 00:22:24,932
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): If I can
beat Isumi in this match,

431
00:22:24,932 --> 00:22:26,000
then I'll have the
momentum I need

432
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,735
to make it all the
way through the exam.

433
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:30,004
SAI (VOICEOVER): There seems
to be some other people who

434
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:31,805
are interested in how
this game turns out.

435
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,407
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): It's
weird playing someone

436
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:35,409
you know when there's
so much at stake.

437
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:37,745
SAI (VOICEOVER): Remember
to stay focused, keep calm,

438
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:39,546
and just play like
you normally do.

439
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,422
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Next
time, an ill-fated moment.

440

SAI (VOICEOVER):
Yes, but for who?
