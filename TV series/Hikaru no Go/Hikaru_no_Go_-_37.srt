00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:50,620
-I want to know your name.

4
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:51,754
-Ah.

5
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:52,455
-Tell me.

6
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,523
What's your name?

7
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,793
I need to know
what your name is.

8
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,494
-My name's Hikaru Shindo.

9
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,630
Hope you remember it.

10
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,298
-Hikaru Shindo.

11
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:02,932
I got it.

12
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:09,472
-Shindo.

13
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,474
I won't forget your name.

14
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:14,644
It'll stay in my memory forever.

15
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:15,578
Hikaru Shindo.

18
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:47,744
-Well, Sai, the pro exam
is finally going to start.

19
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:48,444
-That's right.

20
00:03:01,758 --> 00:03:03,293
-I have to pass this exam.

21
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:07,330
Otherwise, there's no way
I'll catch up to Toya.

22
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:08,061
-Hm.

23
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,976
-Hey, Shindo.

24
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:20,777
-Hi there, Waya.

25
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,981
-You've got to calm
yourself, Hikaru.

26
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:25,982
-Yeah. Yeah.

27
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:26,883
I know.

28
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:28,351
-Is everything OK?

29
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,752
You're looking
really tense today.

30
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:30,486
-I'm fine.

31
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:32,422
Everything's fine.

32
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:33,489
-It's OK to be nervous.

33
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,491
We're all a bit that way.

34
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:36,759
-Morning, guys.

35
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,562
-Morning, Fuku.

36
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,532
-We can put our drinks
in this fridge, right?

37
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:44,801
-You think it's OK to
keep my sandwich in there?

38
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:47,637
-Don't see why not.

39
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,771
-Hi, Shindo.

40
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,007
-Good to see you, Isumi.

41
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,909
-Hey kiddo, long time no see.

42
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:53,509
-Oh no.

43
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:54,477
It's you.

44
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:56,980
-Hey, show some respect
for your elders.

45
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:58,414
-Yes, Mr. Tsubaki.

46
00:03:58,448 --> 00:03:59,282
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:00,984
-That's better.

48
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:04,354
I guess that must be the guy
that Shindo was so afraid of.

49
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:05,621
-Yeah, looks like it.

50
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:08,458
-So are you glad you made it
through to the finals, kiddo?

51
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:09,325
-Uhh.

52
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,927
-Well?

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,762
-Hm.

54
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:13,930
-What you looking at?

55
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,003
[groaning]

56
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:21,571
-Hm?

57
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:23,373
-Actually, now that
I think about it,

58
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:25,241
you're not as ugly as Mr. Kawai.

59
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,275
-What's that?

60
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,477
Who's Mr. Kawai?

61
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,612
-Mr. Kawai is the one who
always does this to me.

62
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:30,880
-What do you think you're doing?

63
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,415
You should be
messing up his hair.

64
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:33,583
Not mine.

65
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:36,486
-I'm way too scared of
Mr. Kawai to do it to him.

66
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,588
[laughing]

67
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:43,493
-But when it comes
to playing Go,

68
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:45,795
you're a much stronger
player than Mr. Kawai is ever

69
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,463
going to be.

70
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,932
-Well, nice of you to recognize
talent when you see it.

71
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:52,402
I'm looking forward
to playing you, kiddo.

72
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:56,539
Because I just can't wait to
beat you again. [laughing]

73
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:57,907
-What makes you
think you're going

74
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,276
to win so easily this time?

75
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:01,310
-Hikaru.

76
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,311
-Say what you want.

77
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,646
It won't make any difference.

IIJIMA (VOICEOVER):
Shindo's changed

79
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:08,985
since I saw him
play in the prelims.

80
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:11,421
-If anyone wants to order
themselves a box lunch,

81
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:12,889
we've got a sign-up
sheet over here.

82
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:13,623
-Oh.

83
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:14,323
What have they got?

84
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:14,891
-Don't know.

85
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,325
Let's see.

86
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:19,362
-Just make sure you put your
order in by 10:00 o'clock.

87
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:19,896
-You having some?

88
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:20,696
-Nah.

89
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,564
I brought my own lunch.

90
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:23,266
My mom packed it for me.

91
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,534
-Hm.

92
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:28,504
-Hikaru, you're not intimidated
by gorilla man at all now.

93
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,506
I know I thought if I
give him some attitude,

94
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,874
it would take my
mind off the test,

95
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,609
and I wouldn't be so nervous.

96
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:35,511
-Such a magnificent strategy.

97
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:36,512
-OK.

98
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:37,580
Let's go and check
out the room where

99
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,482
I'll be playing the matches.

100
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:39,982
-Lead on.

101
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,957
[clock ticking]

102
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:04,974
-The finals are played as
a round robin tournament,

103
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:06,576
with matches taking
place three days

104
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:08,878
a week on Tuesdays,
Saturdays, and Sundays.

105
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:10,613
It lasts for over two months.

106
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,982
This year, there's 28 finalists.

107
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:14,617
-Do you have to draw
for your opponent

108
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,652
like you did in the
preliminary rounds?

109
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:17,753
-Yeah, that's right.

110
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:20,356
But only the top three
players pass the exam.

111
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:21,257
-Only the top three?

112
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:27,697
-Look.

113
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,365
That's one of the guys that
beat me in the prelims.

114
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:37,273
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI
(VOICEOVER): Hikaru

115
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:39,775
is more prepared for these
matches than he was before.

116
00:06:44,313 --> 00:06:46,749
Hikaru, your heart is
racing like a warrior

117
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:47,850
about to go into battle.

118
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:56,993
In your battle with Su-Young,
you gave it everything you had

119
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:59,462
and you were victorious.

120
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:01,397
The confidence you
gained in that match

121
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,569
has made you anxious to compete
again and prove your skills.

122
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:07,970
-Hello, Shindo.

123
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:08,905
-Huh.

124
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:11,507
Hey, Iijima.

125
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,210
-I heard that you got through
to the finals with a buy.

126
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:15,578
Pretty close call, huh.

127
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:16,879
-So what if it was a buy?

128
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,681
I made it through, didn't I?

129
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:20,816
Same as everybody else.

130
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,852
ANNOUNCER (ON LOUDSPEAKER):
Ladies and gentlemen,

131
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:24,453
it's time to begin.

132
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,589
Everyone please make their
way to the match room.

133
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:32,528
-All right.

134
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:34,864
We're going to be drawing
names for the matches.

135
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:37,600
Please come forward when
your names are called.

136
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:38,534
Nakamura.

137
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:39,502
-Here.

138
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:40,770
-Next, Hayashi.

139
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,904
HAYASHI: Here.

140
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:42,905
-Sasaki.

141
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:43,940
SASAKI: Here.

142
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:45,374
-I'm number four.

143
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:47,777
-Nakamura, number four.

144
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:50,379
We need you to keep hold
of your piece of paper.

145
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:51,447
OFFICIAL: Shindo.

146
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,550
-Over here.

147
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:56,619
We only draw numbers
on the first day.

148
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:59,789
After that, all the
pairings have been preset.

149
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:02,525
I pick number seven.

150
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:04,627
Once you have your number,
you play everyone else

151
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:06,362
in the order that's
on the pairing chart.

152
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:19,375
And my opponent on the first
day is going to be Iijima.

153
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:22,678
-I got Shindo.

154
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:24,847
-Each player will have
three hours for the game.

155
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,849
Overtime is one minute per move.

156
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,918
White has a five and
a half point Komi.

157
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:30,786
And now, let's begin.

158
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,787
-Onegaishimasu.

159
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:32,488
-Onegaishimasu.

160
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,254
-Ah, the lunches.

161
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:08,357
I better start putting
the orders through.

162
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,926
Huh, let's see.

163
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,495
Hm.

164
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:13,763
Where's he going?

165
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,564
They've only been
playing for five minutes.

166
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:23,773
[sigh]

167
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:27,843
-Just trying to keep the
nerves under control.

168
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:30,479
And another one?

169
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:33,349
[motorcycle revving]

170
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:42,491
-This sort of thing never
happens during a regular match.

171
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:44,460
I suppose it is a pro exam.

172
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:46,228
The stakes are much higher.

173
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:47,763
-Is there something
the matter, sir?

174
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:49,699
-I think the level of
nervous tension in here

175
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:50,966
is starting to get to me.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,469
I don't think I can stand
and watch them anymore.

177
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:55,471
I'm going to go and hang
out in the staff lounge

178
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:56,505
until the lunch break.

179
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:57,824
-All right.

180
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:12,455
OCHI (VOICEOVER): I'm not
just here to pass the exam.

181
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,857
My goal is to finish as
the number one player.

182
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,595
ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
It's finally begun.

183
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:23,466
The pro exam is going
to be a tough battle.

184
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,569
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Only three
people can pass the test.

185
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:29,438
NASE (VOICEOVER): I
have to take my time.

186
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:31,540
HONDA (VOICEOVER): This
year is going to be my year.

187
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,583
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
How can he be so calm?

188
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:43,219
Is it because I'm his opponent,
or is it because he got

189
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:44,687
used to the exam?

190
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,822
Whatever it is, he's
completely different from when

191
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,358
he was playing in the prelims.

192
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,494
I have to start out
strong from day one.

193
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,298
The pro exam only comes
around once a year.

194
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:20,623
-It's time for the
lunch break, everybody.

195
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:23,426
So please stop your clocks.

196
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:28,330
[chatter]

197
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:29,231
-Hey, kiddo.

198
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:30,766
You ready to go for lunch.

199
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,767
-I already told you.

200
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:32,802
I've got my own lunch.

201
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:34,904
-Hey, don't get smart with me.

202
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:36,772
-Those two look like
they're getting along.

203
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:38,507
Hikaru's not scared
of him at all.

204
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,909
-I bet you it's
because we took him

205
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,744
to play all those
matches in the Go salons.

206
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:43,245
-In the Go salons?

207
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,281
-He said he'd never played
in one before, so we thought,

208
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:46,315
why not?

209
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:47,917
Isumi and I decided
to let him practice

210
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,485
at a couple of different places.

211
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:51,754
-But he's your
competition, and you just

212
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,756
made him a lot stronger.

213
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:56,258
-Those destined to become
strong will become strong

214
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,359
no matter what you do.

215
00:11:57,393 --> 00:11:59,662
That's what Morishita
Sensei keeps telling us.

216
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:01,597
-But that's no reason
to go out of your way

217
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,866
to help him right
before the pro exam.

218
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,502
How could you be so stupid?

219
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,471
-We weren't being
stupid, were we?

220
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:11,006
I mean my sensei told me I've
gotten much better since we

221
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,008
started hanging out
with Shindo at the study

222
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:14,610
sessions and stuff.

223
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:15,544
-Yeah.

224
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:17,346
I guess I can see
the connection.

225
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,814
Your game has
definitely improved

226
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:20,382
since we've been helping out.

227
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,484
-Oh really?

228
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:22,985
I'm playing well right now.

229
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,787
I mean I can feel it.

230
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,989
This year's the year
I'm going to pass.

231
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:30,526
Hey, you want to go check
out the pairings chart?

232
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,496
-Now, when am I playing Shindo?

233
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:34,663
Here it is.

234
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:37,666
Right near the very end
on the second to last day.

235
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,803
Looks like me and you are
playing in match 13, Isumi.

236
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:43,639
-And I'm playing Shindo
right before I play you.

237
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:47,610
Shindo in match 12,
and you in match 13.

238
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:48,811
WAYA: Cool.

239
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:51,247
-What Iijima said
about Shindo, you

240
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,617
think we did the wrong
thing, helping him?

241
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,886
-Well if Shindo does
manage to pass the exam

242
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,888
and we don't, we will
look pretty stupid.

243
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,629
[chatter]

244
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:14,570
-I think that's
everyone, so let's begin.

245
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:26,515
[groaning]

246
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:02,451
-Good game.

247
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:03,722
I resign.

248
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:18,734
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
[sigh] There's

249
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:21,370
a total of 27 matches
to play, so I shouldn't

250
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,772
get too excited
about a single win.

251
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:26,775
-Hikaru, your attitude is
really starting to mature.

252
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:43,926
-I resign.

253
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,294
-Well, that's it.

254
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,495
It's over.

255
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:47,496
-I resign.

256
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:58,707
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Time went by so fast

257
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:01,276
that school started up
again before I knew it.

258
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:13,050
And it's a win by six
and a half points.

259
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:22,634
-I resign. Thank you.

260
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:27,505
OCHI (VOICEOVER): The only
players undefeated so far are

261
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:31,442
me, Isumi, Waya,
[gasp] and Shindo.

262
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,347
It doesn't matter.

263
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:38,783
I'm still going to pass the test
without losing a single game.

264
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:48,359
-I resign.

265
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:52,363
-Thank you for the game.

266
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,768
-Looks like you've won.

267
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:02,774
-Only four people have
won all six games.

268
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:03,975
-Yeah.

269
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:07,612
-Isumi, Ochi, Waya, and Shindo.

270
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:09,781
-Waya seems to be
in really good form.

271
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:12,050
You've already played your
game against him, right?

272
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,752
He managed to beat both of us.

273
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:17,689
-I can understand Isumi and
Ochi six games in a row,

274
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:19,991
but Shindo's got be a fluke.

275
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:22,262
-It's still early on, so
I wouldn't worry too much.

276
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:23,630
Even if you lose
the first six, you

277
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,498
can still pass if
you win all the rest.

278
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:28,201
Besides, winning six in a row
isn't always a good thing.

279
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:29,702
A single defeat
after that could lead

280
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,571
to a collapse in confidence.

281
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:32,205
OK.

282
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:32,739
Time to go.

283
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:34,207
See you.

284
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,509
-Winning every game,
isn't always good?

285
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:39,178
How can it not be good?

286
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:42,549
I'm going to go
for a clean sweep.

287
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:44,083
-What's with him?

288
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:46,052
The pro exam's only just begun.

289
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:47,186
-Anything could happen.

290
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,088
But I can't believe
Shindo's winning streak's

291
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:51,090
going to carry on for long.

292
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:53,393
NASE: Iijima, you played
Shindo in the very first match,

293
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:54,227
didn't you?

294
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,162
So, uh, what did you think?

295
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:57,697
-He was really calm
and in control,

296
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,732
which I wasn't expecting,
and it threw me off.

297
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,434
I think that's why lost.

298
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,803
Something's changed about him.

299
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:07,073
You'll see what I mean when
it's your turn to play.

300
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:08,741
It wouldn't surprise
me if he actually

301
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:10,743
ends up passing the exam.

302
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:11,344
-Hm.

303
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:24,324
-Instead of attacking white
with a knight's move here,

304
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:25,692
you could use the
diagonal and then

305
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:27,594
be in a much stronger position.

306
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:29,662
-Yeah, I see.

307
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:31,531
-Well I'd better be going now.

308
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:33,700
-Thank you very much
for coming to see us.

309
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,036
I thought Iwasaki 7-dan
was easy to understand.

310
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,806
He'd be a much better teacher
for you than that Kujiari

311
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,141
8-dan guy who came yesterday.

312
00:17:42,175 --> 00:17:44,243
He was so awful.

313
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:45,144
Tell me.

314
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:46,412
How on earth did
someone as young

315
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:49,015
as you get so good
at playing Go?

316
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:51,384
I remember when I used
to invite pros over

317
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,753
to play teaching games and
you used to sit and watch us.

318
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:56,289
You must have picked up a lot
of good hints from watching

319
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,724
those sessions,
because it wasn't long

320
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:59,225
before you were beating me.

321
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:00,259
[beep]

322
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:01,427
-And look at us now.

323
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:04,230
Here I am inviting pros
around to help you study.

324
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:05,131
Oh, hello there.

325
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:06,399
It's me.

326
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,468
Can you bring in some whiskey
and water to go with it?

327
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:11,437
I can't tell you how proud
I am that my grandson wants

328
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:13,239
to be a pro player.

329
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:14,741
Your father was useless.

330
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:17,276
He wouldn't even
touch the stones.

331
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,279
I'm going to take you to
Go salons to practice.

332
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:22,782
I'll get pros to
teach you every night.

333
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:25,618
I don't care how much it
costs if that's what you want.

334
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:28,554
If we do all that, do you
think you can pass the pro exam

335
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:29,555
and get the top score?

336
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:32,058
-Well, that's what
I'm aiming for.

337
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:34,027
In the last set of
rankings, before we

338
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:36,029
started to doing the
pro exam, I overtook

339
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:40,299
Isumi to become the
number one insei.

340
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,534
-Now, let's see.

341
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,703
We've already got different
pros booked in every night

342
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:44,737
this week.

343
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:46,339
But there's still
space next week for us

344
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:48,408
to invite Toya 2-dan over.

345
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,276
-Toya 2-dan?

346
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,578
-Last year, he finished with
the highest score of anyone

347
00:18:52,612 --> 00:18:54,080
in the pro exam.

348
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:55,715
I was thinking it
might be useful to get

349
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:58,217
some tips from him, you
know, considering he recently

350
00:18:58,251 --> 00:19:00,253
took the exam and he's
closer to your age.

351
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,021
His opinion is
probably going to be

352
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:05,658
more relevant than some
of these older pros.

353
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:07,193
Is it not a good idea?

354
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:08,004
-No.

355
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:09,473
It's OK.

356
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:12,442
I don't mind.

357
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,444
I've never played Toya 2-dan.

358
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:18,582
I've always wanted
the opportunity

359
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:20,050
to compete against him.

360
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,552
Once I pass the test
and become a pro,

361
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:24,454
we'll both be ranked at
about the same level.

362
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:26,123
So the two of us will be rivals.

363
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,569
-Huh.

364
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,171
Six straight wins.

365
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:42,539
Shindo!

366
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:44,975
He's won six games in a row.

367
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,610
It doesn't mean anything.

368
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,513
There's a long way to go before
the pro exam is finished.

369
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:52,716
It's only six wins so
far, but there's still

370
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:56,119
only four people who've got this
far without dropping a game.

371
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,754
And Shindo was
one of those four.

372
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,726
Just how good is he?

373
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:05,962
I have to know.

374
00:20:05,962 --> 00:20:08,632
AKIRA'S MOTHER: Akira, someone
from the Go Association's

375
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,901
on the phone for you.

376
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:14,971
-Uh-huh, they want me to give
him lessons at their home.

377
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:20,443
Well, no, I'm not that
busy, but I-- would you

378
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:22,712
mind telling them no for me.

379
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:24,748
It's just that I need to
spend time concentrating

380
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:25,916
on my own game right now.

381
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:27,651
I hope they understand.

382
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,952
Yes.

383
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:29,986
Thank you.

384
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:30,754
What?

385
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:32,155
He's an insei.

386
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,558
Why didn't you say he
was an insei before?

387
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:36,826
And he's in the middle
of the pro exam.

388
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,661
I'll do it.

389
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,695
I'll do it.

390
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,496
Yes.

391
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,564
Can you set it up for me?

392
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:47,107
Shindo.

393
00:20:48,972 --> 00:20:54,177
This is going to be my chance
to see exactly where you're at.

394
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:59,570
[theme music]

395
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:22,866
HIKARU: Can you believe it?

396
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:25,502
Akira's agreed to
be a tutor for Ochi.

397
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:29,205
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: He must
sense you right behind him.

398
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:31,841
HIKARU: The guys don't
think I'm going to make it.

399
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,810
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: One
game at a time, Hikaru.

400
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:36,146
One game at a time.

401
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,114
HIKARU: I've got
him in my sights.

402
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,617
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: Don't let
yourself get carried away now.

403
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,152
You have to pass the test first.

404
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:43,186
Remember.

405
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:45,155
HIKARU: Next time,
the challengers.

406
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:46,890
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI:
You're not the only one

407
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:49,859
who will be disappointed if
you don't make it through.
