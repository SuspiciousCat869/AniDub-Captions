00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,541
NARRATOR: After many years
inside of a Go board,

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,511
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,580
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:17,584
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

5
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:21,154
[theme music]

6
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,796
-Well.

7
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,933
You want to give up now?

8
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:59,802
Boy, that freezing pool's
gonna cool you down.

9
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:00,803
-I can do this.

10
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:09,445
Stop tossing those stones!

11
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,847
I'm trying to think!

12
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,949
-Heh heh.

13
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,350
SAI: Hikaru.

14
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,885
Once you've placed a
stone on the board,

15
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,487
it cannot be repositioned.

16
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,422
Every move is final.

17
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:20,390
HIKARU: But I thought--

18
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:22,825
-You must remain
calm, understand?

19
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,261
This game is still
far from over.

20
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:30,400
Now, we'll do everything
we can to catch up to him.

21
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,635
-Isn't that Hikaru's
voice I just heard?

22
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:33,403
-Yeah?

23
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,537
Are you sure it was him?

24
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:41,711
Wait!

25
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,046
I get it now.

26
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,681
Isn't that the guy
you tried to invite

27
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,316
before you asked us to come.

28
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:47,617
You like him or something?

29
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,420
-Ooh!

30
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:52,922
AKARI: I have no idea
what you're talking about.

31
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,357
GIRL: Don't deny it.

32
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,725
It's no big deal.

33
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,994
This takoyaki is amazing!

34
00:02:58,027 --> 00:02:59,595
AKARI: Let's go get some more!

35
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,564
The stand is right over there!

36
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,477
[excited chatter]

37
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,521
-We always have a lot of fun.

38
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:26,589
-For sure.

39
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,491
-Hey, you know what
would make it better?

40
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,461
-Isn't that Hikaru
Shindou over there?

41
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:31,943
-Hm?

42
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:34,546
-He came.

43
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,914
-Well, time for us to go!

44
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:36,915
-See you!

45
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:37,515
-Huh?

46
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:37,998
Wait!

47
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:39,900
-Say hi!

48
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:40,867
To Hikaru!

49
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:48,175
-Wha-- Hikaru, what's going on?

50
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,076
I thought you weren't
going to be here today,

51
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,612
so I came with Saiyaka
and my other friend.

52
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:53,980
What you up to?

53
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,750
Playing Go again?

54
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:58,084
-Hm.

55
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:01,821
[groaning]

56
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,089
MAN: I've counted the Komi.

57
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:07,694
Final score, white 68 and
1/2 points, black 68 points.

58
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,563
-Almost.

59
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:12,799
We lost by only a half a point.

60
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:13,900
-No way!

61
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,735
Sai, you said we'd be
able to win this game.

62
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:16,836
What happened?

63
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:17,904
-Hikaru, honestly.

64
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,105
I did the best I could.

65
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:19,839
-You idiot!

66
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,775
It's all your fault!

67
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:23,743
That stupid pool's
gonna be freezing!

68
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:28,648
TSUTSUI: It's incredible.

69
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:31,785
He was way behind, and then
only lost by half a point.

70
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:32,485
-Yeah.

71
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,520
A great come back.

72
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:35,755
I can hardly believe
how good he played.

73
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,624
But he made a bad
decision mid game.

74
00:04:37,657 --> 00:04:40,093
It was a move so stupid, even
you wouldn't have done it.

75
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:41,828
-Don't go dragging me into this!

76
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:42,929
-Listen up.

77
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:43,763
-Huh?

78
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:45,432
-Give me your jacket.

79
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:48,134
-Wha-- What do you
think you're doing?

80
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:50,070
-Do what I tell you to!

81
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:51,605
Come on!

82
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:55,842
-Oh, it's the middle of winter!

83
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,843
-Ah choo!

84
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:58,011
Why'd you do that?

85
00:04:58,044 --> 00:04:59,045
-Tsutsui.

86
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,847
Now we have enough
players on our team

87
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:03,917
to compete in the
upcoming Go tournament.

88
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,721
There's me, you, and this kid!

89
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,657
-Huh?

90
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,558
Huh?

91
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:11,999
-Wha--

92
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:16,563
HIKARU: You can't
tell me what to do!

93
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:19,866
TETSUO: Play Go with us,
or take a dip in the pool.

94
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,868
HIKARU: So, uh, when's
this tournament?

95
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:23,103
TSUTSUI: This Sunday, 10:00 AM.

96
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:25,672
Don't be late.

97
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:26,806
HIKARU: Where is it?

98
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,074
TETSUO: Kaio Middle School.

99
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,036
-I can't believe how
big this school is.

100
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,437
Hm.

101
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:59,105
Please use slippers provided
at the front entrance.

102
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,207
Conference room two is
located on the fourth floor

103
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:03,076
od the main building.

104
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:04,577
Hope I don't get lost.

105
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:06,513
Well, if it wasn't
for this tournament,

106
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:07,914
I'd never get the
chance to see what

107
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,949
one of the best schools
in the country looks like.

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,488
They even practice on Sundays.

109
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,895
Huh?

110
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:24,597
This is it.

111
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:25,080
Huh?

112
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:30,685
-Where are Kimihiro and Testuo?

113
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:32,888
I guess I must be early.

114
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:33,922
-OK you guys.

115
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:35,824
Don't try and play
beyond your skill level.

116
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:38,093
If your opponent is stronger
than you, just remember,

117
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:39,694
there's no shame in losing.

118
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:40,662
Got it?

119
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:41,496
-All right.

120
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:43,198
Let's have some practice games.

121
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:44,900
Mimai against Okara.

122
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,535
Takashita, you'll play me.

123
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:48,570
-You know that Kaio
is obviously the best

124
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:49,805
team competing this year.

125
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:51,773
The real question
in this competition

126
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:53,175
is, who will place second?

127
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,044
-What kind of tournament
is this, Hikaru?

128
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:57,879
-This is a middle
school team tournament.

129
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:59,648
-Oh.

130
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:01,183
-There are three
members on every team.

131
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:03,785
The best two out of three wins.

132
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,955
Only eight boys schools
and six girls schools?

133
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:08,623
Shouldn't there be more?

134
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:10,091
Where's Haze Middle?

135
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,026
Oh hey.

136
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:12,060
There it is.

137
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:14,129
-This is absolutely thrilling.

138
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:15,764
When do we get to start?

139
00:07:15,797 --> 00:07:18,667
My heart is pounding
with excitement.

140
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,736
-Sai, maybe you should
take a nap or something.

141
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,672
I think I'll do the playing.

142
00:07:23,705 --> 00:07:24,206
-Hikaru!

143
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,107
But, I thought--

144
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:27,776
-I've got the hang
of it now, and I've

145
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,778
been thinking about
trying a game on my own.

146
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:31,279
No offense.

147
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:33,081
-But last night,
you said tomorrow's

148
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:34,282
the tournament, help me out!

149
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:36,184
You asked me to do all
your history homework.

150
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:37,719
You must be able to recall that.

151
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:40,021
-I don't seem to remember
ever mentioning anything

152
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:41,256
about letting you play Go.

153
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:43,091
Nice try, though.

154
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:44,059
-You can't do this!

155
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:44,826
It's not fair!

156
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,061
It's not fair!

157
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:48,864
How do you expect to win if
I'm not able to help you?

158
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:49,598
-Who cares?

159
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:50,665
I don't mind losing.

160
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,634
I'm only here to be the
third player anyway.

161
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,735
-You see?

162
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,170
I told you there'd be
lots of people here.

163
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:56,571
-Whoa.

164
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:57,639
-Look!

165
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,607
I didn't know that
Takara's older brother

166
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,774
was coming to the tournament.

167
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:01,977
This doesn't look good.

168
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,044
-OK.

169
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:04,646
Why do'nt we play a
few practice games?

170
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,780
-All right.

171
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,516
-Kaio's Go club is
actually quite impressive,

172
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:08,550
don't you think?

173
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,185
They get to use this
entire room to have

174
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,920
their private practices.

175
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,756
-Yeah, this school has
awesome facilities.

176
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,892
-Rumor has it, their
Go club has 50 members.

177
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:22,497
-I'll just watch these
guys for a while.

178
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,739
-Get a chance to
look at the pairings?

179
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:31,773
-Yeah.

180
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:33,808
We won't face Kaio
until the final round.

181
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:37,145
If we both perform well,
maybe we'll come in second.

182
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:38,880
Competition looks tough, though.

183
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:33,902
Sorry about that.

184
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:35,670
-Why don't you watch
what you're doing?

185
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:37,038
-Uh, Wait.

186
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:39,541
Uh.

187
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:40,275
That look right?

188
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:40,942
-No!

189
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:41,977
Not there.

190
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,278
-What are you talking about?

191
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:44,145
I fixed it.

192
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:45,814
-Yeah, fixed it in your favor.

193
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:46,681
I'm no dummy.

194
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:48,049
-I might be able to help.

195
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,184
-Huh?

196
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:50,719
What do you think you're doing?

197
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:53,188
-HIkaru!

198
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:55,590
-This goes here, and
these stones, they

199
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:57,125
go there, and here.

200
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:32,594
This one.

201
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:33,962
Where was it?

202
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:35,196
Ah, right there.

203
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,031
That's perfect.

204
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:44,039
Right.

205
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:45,106
I'm almost finished, guys.

206
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:49,744
Mm-hm.

207
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:52,013
Mm-hm.

208
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:57,052
Just a few more, guys,
and we'll be done.

209
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:57,786
Have a good game!

210
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:04,526
-You proud of yourself?

211
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:05,694
I could've done that!

212
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:07,662
Any respectable Go player
could replay a game

213
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:08,630
from the first move.

214
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:10,031
Now, if you're
finished showing off,

215
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:12,634
why don't you turn around
and get the heck out of here?

216
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,102
-I'm-- I'm sorry.

217
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:16,771
-I wish we had
misplaced some stones.

218
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:17,972
Looks like I'm in a tight spot.

219
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:18,873
All right.

220
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:19,841
Let's get this game on the road.

221
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:20,775
Whose turn was it?

222
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:27,649
-Do you think you could have
done something like that?

223
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:28,090
-Huh?

224
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:31,886
Hey.

225
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,056
What school did that
kid say he was from?

226
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,057
-What?

227
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:38,126
There's someone
that you know here?

228
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,729
-Yeah, so try not
to stand out, OK?

229
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:41,663
-OK.

230
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:42,497
-We'll be fine.

231
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:43,998
Just stay cool.

232
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:45,867
SAI: It's true that a
competent player would

233
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,269
be able to recreate a
game of Go from memory,

234
00:11:48,503 --> 00:11:51,206
but that still doesn't
explain what I've witnessed.

235
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:55,643
Hikaru only began
playing a short time ago.

236
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:59,514
I could count the number of
times he's touched the stones.

237
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:02,050
I think I'm finally
starting to understand

238
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,719
why I've drawn to Hikaru.

239
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:07,789
He is no ordinary boy.

240
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:08,923
-It's time.

241
00:12:08,957 --> 00:12:10,925
The first round of the
tournament will now begin.

242
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,434
-In the first around
of the girls' division,

243
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:25,770
Kaio Middle versus
Iwana Middle at table A.

244
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:30,275
Iyu Middle versus Kawahagi
Middle at table B.

245
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:32,510
In the first round of the
boys' division, Kaio Middle

246
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,479
versus Hamachi
Middle at table C.

247
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:38,483
At table D, Tai Middle
versus Iwana Middle.

248
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:42,454
At table E, Iyu Middle versus
Suwara Middle, and lastly,

249
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:54,532
Haze Middle versus Kawahagi
Middle at table F. Now,

250
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,067
is everyone in
their proper places?

251
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:01,840
-I've got to make sure
that guy doesn't see me.

252
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:02,522
Huh?

253
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,360
-Hey, don't touch that clock.

254
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:08,228
-Huh?

255
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,830
-We haven't even started yet.

256
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,264
-You mustn't do that!

257
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:13,166
The clock starts when
you push the button.

258
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,668
It's only used during game play.

259
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:15,469
-Really?

260
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:16,870
why do you need to use it?

261
00:13:16,903 --> 00:13:19,806
-Each competitor gets 45
minutes of playing time.

262
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,309
You only push the button
after you've made a move.

263
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:22,909
Got it?

264
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:24,311
HIKARU: Yeah.

265
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:25,612
-Hey, come on, now.

266
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:27,647
Whatever happened to staying
cool and acting inconspicuous?

267
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,718
-Sai, where were you?

268
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:33,320
Why didn't you say something?

269
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:35,322
You could have at least
told me about the clock.

270
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:36,656
I looked like a fool.

271
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,393
-Regrettably, we did not have
such things in Shusaku's time.

272
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:42,162
Besides, you specifically
stated that you

273
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:43,530
wish to play by yourself today.

274
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:45,432
It does seem rather
unusual that you're now

275
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:46,700
asking for my assistance.

276
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:47,467
-What?

277
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,202
I don't believe this!

278
00:13:49,236 --> 00:13:50,570
-I've had it up
to here with you.

279
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,606
Don't bother appearing again.

280
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,440
-That's very rude.

281
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,176
You're on your own.

282
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,612
-Aren't you a member
of the Shogi club?

283
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:01,314
I didn't expect you
guys to show up today.

284
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:02,282
-Huh?

285
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:04,417
-Couldn't even find
three teammates?

286
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,919
I find that very tragic.

287
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:06,786
How sad.

288
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,721
-Enough talking.

289
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,523
Choose for color.

290
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:10,690
-Go stones?

291
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,560
Maybe Shogi would
be more your speed.

292
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:15,795
-Be be glad we're playing Go.

293
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,565
If this were Shogi, you'd be
checkmated in five minutes.

294
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,468
It'll take me 10 minutes
to crush you at Go.

295
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:24,404
You'll suffer a little
longer this way.

296
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:25,805
-Hey, don't talk
to me like that!

297
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,174
You're obviously ignorant
of my superior skill!

298
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,644
-I can tell at a glance
who's strong who's not.

299
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:34,514
A player who yaps like a
dog is hardly superior.

300
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:35,549
MAN: That's enough talking.

301
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:36,416
Choose for color.

302
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:48,194
-2, 4, 6, 8, 9?

303
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:49,796
-I'm playing white.

304
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:50,764
-White?

305
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:52,299
That means I'm playing black.

306
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:53,800
So you'll be white, Hikaru.

307
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,701
OK?

308
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:55,268
-Sure.

309
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:00,307
-Ready?

310
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,342
Please begin your game now.

311
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:02,876
-Onegai shimasu.

312
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:33,206
-Ah!

313
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,642
-Hm.

314
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:36,409
-Idiot!

315
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:37,811
Put that down!

316
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,678
-Hm?

317
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:39,779
-Does this look like a library?

318
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,681
Why are you reading when
you should be playing?

319
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:43,583
-But I haven't broken
any tournament rules.

320
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:45,685
-That book gets in the way
of your ability to focus

321
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,153
and makes your mind weak.

322
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:49,155
What happens if your
opponent plays a variation?

323
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:51,625
Your little manual becomes
completely useless, doesn't it?

324
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:52,459
-I know, I know!

325
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:53,360
Listen!

326
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:54,394
I just feel more
comfortable if I

327
00:15:54,427 --> 00:15:55,595
have it open while I'm playing.

328
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,464
-You two, enough chit chat.

329
00:15:57,497 --> 00:16:00,834
-If these guys keep this
up, I'm gonna get noticed.

330
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,835
-Totally hopeless.

331
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,435
-Fools.

332
00:16:11,544 --> 00:16:14,280
-Hm.

333
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,382
-Hold on a second.

334
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:16,750
You forgot to hit your clock.

335
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:19,319
-Huh?

336
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:22,922
-You're lucky I'm
such a nice guy.

337
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:24,290
-Oh, man.

338
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,792
Their club is pathetic.

339
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:27,293
BOY: You've got
a kid who doesn't

340
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:28,595
know how to use a clock.

341
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:31,398
BOY: Then there's this guy,
with his book of standard plays.

342
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:34,901
BOY: Don't forget the fill
in from the Shogi club.

343
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,403
First round's in the bag.

344
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:51,851
-Good move.

345
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,520
I wish I could play, too.

346
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:55,255
Just one move, please.

347
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:58,591
Hikaru, can you hear me?

348
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,161
-Say that again!

349
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:05,398
-You-- have won the game.

350
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:07,400
-In 10 minutes.

351
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:07,883
-Huh?

352
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:12,788
-Keep playing.

353
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:13,455
-Yes, sir.

354
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:14,523
-It's all right.

355
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:16,391
It takes two
victories to continue.

356
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:19,461
You can both still
win the first round.

357
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:21,630
I feel sorry for
Moriyama, but his opponent

358
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,999
was just too strong.

359
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:26,701
-Now that that's over
with, I might as well

360
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:28,303
check out how the
new guy's doing.

361
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:33,809
What's going on?

362
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,811
This is some of the worst
playing I've ever seen!

363
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:38,013
-That's very true.

364
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:39,981
-Your strategy is
way too reckless.

365
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:41,516
It's hard for me
to believe you're

366
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,652
the same kid who played
me earlier this week.

367
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:44,486
-That was me.

368
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,453
Thanks for the kind words.

369
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:50,659
-Listen.

370
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,961
Stop messing around.

371
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,563
-But I'm enjoying myself.

372
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:56,898
-You aren't realizing your true
potential, and you know it.

373
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:58,733
Did you just come here
to have fun, or what?

374
00:17:58,767 --> 00:17:59,367
-Yeah.

375
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:00,001
To have fun.

376
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:01,870
-What?

377
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:04,306
-Look at this.

378
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:04,788
There.

379
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:07,457
You see?

380
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:09,960
There are nine star
points on the Go board.

381
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:11,862
Just think about
that for a moment.

382
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,602
It's like a universe.

383
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:25,008
And with each move,
with each stone,

384
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:27,577
I'm adding stars,
one at one time.

385
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:31,581
The sky is at my fingertips.

386
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:34,551
It's as if I were
a master builder.

387
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:42,359
Do you see what I'm getting at?

388
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:44,795
I get to do it.

389
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:49,733
I get to design my own
universe on this Go board.

390
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,065
-Are you going to keep playing?

391
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:56,433
-Huh?

392
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:59,703
Well, I-- I'd really like
to, if that's all right.

393
00:19:59,736 --> 00:20:01,972
-Listen, it's obvious
who's won this game.

394
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,306
This is getting boring.

395
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:07,544
-Could it have been mere luck?

396
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:11,314
How did Hikaru manage to replay
that entire game earlier?

397
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:13,817
I thought I sensed
potential in this boy.

398
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,320
His still could equal
that of Akira Toya.

399
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:20,457
-We're at one win and one loss.

400
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:22,092
It's all up to Kimihiro now.

401
00:20:53,990 --> 00:21:04,034
[theme music]

402
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,494
HIKARU: I hope we make it
to the tournament finals,

403
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:27,163
'cause Tetsuo's gonna
be real mad if we lose.

404
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:28,965
SAI: There is much
pressure to win.

405
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:31,534
I will help you stay
focused on the game.

406
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:33,069
HIKARU: How can I stay
focused with Akira

407
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:36,973
watching my every move?

408
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:38,675
SAI: He feels he
must surpass you

409
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,610
before he can achieve
the Divine Move.

410
00:22:43,513 --> 00:22:46,049
HIKARU: Next time,
A Game of Beauty.

411
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:47,217
SAI: Hikaru!

412
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,519
You have awakened!
