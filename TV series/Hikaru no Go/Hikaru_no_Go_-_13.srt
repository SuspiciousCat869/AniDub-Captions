NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:10,455
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:13,562
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:17,603
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

[theme music]

6
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:49,762
AKIRA: That would be me.

7
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:50,831
-Huh?

8
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:53,803
-I'm Kaio's number
three player, Shindou.

9
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,407
Surprised?

10
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,442
-Akira?

11
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:58,346
You're Kaio's number three?

12
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:07,799
-Look!

13
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,605
Toya's wearing a Kaio uniform.

14
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:14,312
-I read that he's gonna be a
huge star once he turns pro.

15
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:16,150
-What's a guy like
that doing here?

16
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:18,889
I thought he was an Insei.

17
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:20,559
-But if he's an
Insei, then he's not

18
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:22,396
allowed enter any
amateur tournaments.

19
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:27,841
Akira's playing
for Kaio this year?

20
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:29,611
You've gotta be joking.

21
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:32,484
-We're facing off against
Kaio in the first round.

22
00:02:32,517 --> 00:02:35,290
-Toya's gonna be playing in
the number three position?

23
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:35,757
-What?

24
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,860
Are you serious?

25
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:38,730
That means he's gonna
be my opponent, right?

26
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:40,266
Oh, I'm dead meat, guys.

27
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:49,720
GIRL: So this is the
great Hikaru Shindou

28
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,891
that Toya keeps talking about?

29
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:53,661
It's nice to finally
meet his rival.

30
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:55,632
I've been looking forward
to watching you play.

31
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:57,703
I wanna see if you're as
good as they say you are.

32
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:10,263
-So you're the ones
on Kaio's Go team.

33
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:11,465
-Hm?

34
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:12,634
-I hear you guys are good.

35
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:16,241
Too bad you lost to Haze
Middle School last year.

36
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:19,749
-Who are you, anyway?

37
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,488
Kaio and Haze are facing
off in the second round.

38
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,860
I'm the guy who's gonna
defeat your captain.

39
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,895
-That's big talk.

40
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,464
Do you really think
you're strong enough

41
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:28,601
to beat Kishimoto?

42
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,736
-Hidaka.

43
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,707
-Matani would do
anything to win.

44
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,575
Even cheat.

45
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,621
-Kimihiro, Yuuki
gave us his word.

46
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:39,624
Don't embarass him.

47
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:41,861
-Kimihiro?

48
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:43,332
I remember the last tournament.

49
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:44,634
You won on a fluke.

50
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,006
Senpai knew that if he hadn't
made that one little blunder,

51
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:49,477
he would've easily defeated you.

52
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,548
Sound like Haze relies
on luck and deception

53
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,918
to come out on top.

54
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:56,625
You've really got quite a team.

55
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,262
Aren't you the
seventh grader who's

56
00:03:58,296 --> 00:04:02,604
been placed in first position
to take a strategic loss?

57
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:03,674
-What?

58
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:07,615
What exactly do you
mean by strategic loss?

59
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,684
Oh, come on!

60
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,588
Yuuki's amazing.

61
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,325
He plays 10 times
better than I do.

62
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,527
You'll see.

63
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:15,866
He's our strongest player.

64
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:18,938
Challenge him and you'll
find out for yourself.

65
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:21,811
-Uh.

66
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,348
-Nice to meet you.

67
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,417
My name's Kishimoto.

68
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:28,626
I'm Kaio's team captain.

69
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,028
I look forward to
having you make it

70
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:32,032
through to the second round.

71
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:34,404
We'll play a game worthy
of the first position.

72
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:41,586
-Come on.

73
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:43,423
Do you honestly think he'll
make it past the first round?

74
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:44,425
Guess we'll find out.

75
00:04:56,784 --> 00:04:57,986
-She's got a point.

76
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,389
The first round's tough.

77
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,909
-I meant what I said.

78
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:13,352
You're ouir captain, and
you're our best player.

79
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:15,089
You can win without
having to cheat.

80
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:22,404
-I think that it's time to
get this tournament started.

81
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:24,742
-Sure, let's begin.

82
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,114
-Please stop your games
and put your stones away.

83
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:28,650
The tournament is
about to begin.

84
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,959
ANNOUNCER: Attention,
all participants.

85
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:34,729
Here are the first
round match ups.

86
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:36,466
When I call out
your school's name,

87
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,571
please go to your
assigned seats.

88
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:42,045
In the boys' division, Iyu
Middle School versus Hamachi

89
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:45,886
Middle School, table A. Kawahagi
Middle School versus Tai Middle

90
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:49,527
School, table B. Haze Middle
School versus Iwata Middle

91
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,568
School, table C. Kaio Middle
School versus Sowara Middle

92
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,185
School, table D.

93
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,771
YUUKI: I'm playing black.

94
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:23,564
-Onegai shimasu.

95
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:05,785
-He's fast.

96
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:11,063
BOY: What did I just do?

97
00:07:17,576 --> 00:07:18,712
YUUKI (VOICEOVER): I am good.

98
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:20,917
And my opponent knows it.

99
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,689
Even Kimihiro,
who hates my guts,

100
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:27,464
thinks that I'm 10
times the player he is.

101
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:30,003
-We'll play a game worthy
of the first position.

102
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:32,474
YUUKI (VOICEOVER): I'll give
him a game he won't forget.

103
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,491
-I resign.

104
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:57,927
KIMIHIRO (VOICEOVER):
That was quick.

105
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:10,152
-I'm gonna go watch Kaio.

106
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,583
The guys at the Go salon
were strong opponents,

107
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:42,253
but they were all self taught.

108
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:49,100
Now.

109
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,576
These students, they
can get this good just

110
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,747
from playing in a
middle school Go club?

111
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:29,284
-I resign.

112
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:32,190
KISHIMOTO: Thank
you for the game.

113
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,696
If it isn't Mitani
from Haze Middle.

114
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,131
Did you learn
anything from my game?

115
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:47,856
YUUKI (VOICEOVER): I get it.

116
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,762
This jerk thinks I'm some
unskilled seventh grader

117
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:54,303
playing as a team captain
for strategic reasons.

118
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,340
That handshake
was just for show.

119
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:58,979
I bet he thinks I'm too
pathetic to talk to.

120
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,653
I don't mean to
upset you, but it

121
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:21,359
doesn't look like
Hikaru's was going to win.

122
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:22,327
All right.

123
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:23,663
I wanna make a deal.

124
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:25,802
I'll stop cheating if
you win your match.

125
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:28,407
I've got my sights on
Kaio's captain, Kishimoto.

126
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,211
So, right now, you'd
better not lose.

127
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:33,384
You got that?

128
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,787
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

129
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:36,356
I'm really starting to mess up.

130
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,392
I've got to do something.

131
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,720
-Looks like you're about to lose

132
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:52,089
-You're laughing at me?

133
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,394
You really shouldn't laugh
until after you've won,

134
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,098
and this game is not over yet!

135
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:00,388
-What?

136
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:32,774
-Something about these
boys has changed.

137
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,979
Hikaru's game has matured.

138
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:37,751
He has really improved.

139
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:39,487
But he is not the only one.

140
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,102
Akira Toya's game
has matured, too.

141
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:05,534
BOY: White, 72 and 1/2 points.

142
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,838
TSUTSUI: Black, 56 points.

143
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:08,840
All right!

144
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,377
I won by 16 and 1/2 points.

145
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,485
Thanks for the excellent game.

146
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,387
BOY: Congratulations.

147
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:18,995
-That was a great match.

148
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:21,267
Thanks.

149
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,067
-Thank you.

150
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,504
You're a skilled opponent.

151
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:24,106
-Yes!

152
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:34,126
-BOY: I resign.

153
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:36,898
-Thank you very
much for the game.

154
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:40,640
-You were playing a lot
slower than you usually do.

155
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:41,323
-Sensei?

156
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,417
I was trying to
stay calm so that I

157
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,254
wouldn't make any mistakes.

158
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:49,625
-Hazi Middle School won
all three of their matches.

159
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:50,227
-Huh?

160
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,268
Did you watch their matches?

161
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,506
I'd like to know
how Hikaru played.

162
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,475
Was he focused?

163
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:02,987
-I suppose you'll
find out soon enough.

164
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:09,433
ANNOUNCER: We will
now break for lunch.

165
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:12,373
The afternoon session
will begin at 1:00.

166
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:14,543
Please make sure
you're back on time.

167
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:16,614
-Wanna go to the cafeteria?

168
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,084
-Good idea.

169
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:20,255
We should ask Toya
to come with us.

170
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:21,325
-What?

171
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:23,696
-Hidaka, can I talk
to you for a minute?

172
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,700
-What's up?

173
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,470
-Hikaru, time for lunch.

174
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,541
-I'm not hungry.

175
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:31,178
-What's wrong?

176
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:31,661
Hikaru?

177
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,589
-That was a great
comeback, Hikaru.

178
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:53,358
-I know!

179
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:54,426
I was awesome, wasn't I?

180
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,230
And nobody can say that
was a fluke, either.

181
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,265
I did it all on my own.

182
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:59,237
Did you notice how
much Ive improved, Sai?

183
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,942
I mean, I'm way better
than I was before.

184
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:02,710
-True.

185
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,717
But you have yet
to defeat Kimihiro.

186
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:07,086
-Hmph

187
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:10,025
-And now your next opponent
shall be Akira Toya.

188
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,729
-Just remember,
I'm gonna play him.

189
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:14,435
-You've already made it very
clear you don't want my help.

190
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:16,539
-We both know that
Akira's dying to play you,

191
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:18,309
but I don't see how
that's my problem.

192
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:23,186
It was the Haze
Middle School Go club

193
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:25,090
that signed up to compete
in this tournament.

194
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,295
Unfortunately, you
aren't a member.

195
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:28,030
-Yes.

196
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:28,731
I know that, Hikaru.

197
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:33,207
-Aw, why couldn't
Akira have waited

198
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,444
until I was a bit stronger?

199
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:38,652
Now he's forced me
into playing him today.

200
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:42,226
HIDAKA: Well, what is it that
you wanted to talk to me about?

201
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:43,495
Let me guess.

202
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:45,232
You've just heard the story
about Toya getting bullied?

203
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:47,404
KISHIMOTO: Did it really happen?

204
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,739
HIDAKA: Yeah.

205
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:50,210
KISHIMOTO: I'm not surprised.

206
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:52,380
Toy's had a lot of
trouble fitting in.

207
00:15:52,414 --> 00:15:54,451
-Three guys put together
a plan to get rid of him.

208
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:56,055
They wanted to
humiliate him so he'd

209
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,558
be too ashamed to
stay in the Go club.

210
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:03,604
-Focus.

211
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:05,508
-His game has started
to fall to pieces.

212
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:10,417
-Those jerks.

213
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:12,356
they should have realized
that no matter what

214
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,293
they did to him, nothing
was going to stop him

215
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:16,531
from competing in
the tournament today.

216
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:18,568
-He doesn't back down.

217
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:20,171
I've seen it before.

218
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:21,608
When he was yelling
at Mr. Yun, he

219
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:23,445
had this intense
look in his eyes.

220
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:25,316
- --me to play in the
number three position!

221
00:16:25,349 --> 00:16:27,487
You were the one that said
I was the only person who'd

222
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,357
have a chance against Hikaru!

223
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,328
Remember?

224
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:32,665
Please, sir.

225
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:34,735
The only reason I joined this
club was so I could battle him.

226
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:40,314
But Sensei--

227
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:41,583
-OK, Akira.

228
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:45,190
You can play as
our number three.

229
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,330
-Toya's aware of how
selfish he's acting.

230
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,568
I bet he feels pretty guilty.

231
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:51,837
HIDAKA: I'm sure he does.

232
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:53,341
Think he'll quit
the Go club when

233
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:54,643
the tournament is finished?

234
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:56,080
KISHIMOTO: Yep.

235
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,286
Everything should go back
to normal once he's gone.

236
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,756
HIDAKA: Sure,
that's what you say.

237
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:03,762
But I know how badly you
wanted to play against him.

238
00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:05,866
You can't kind your
disappointment from me.

239
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:06,668
Come on.

240
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:07,570
We'll get some lunch.

241
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:14,785
-Akira's been gettin'
pushed round, huh?

242
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,622
He probably had it coming.

243
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:20,630
He only thinks about
himself, you know?

244
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,501
-Why would others
choose to hate him?

245
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:29,582
Imagine how difficult it was
for him to play third position.

246
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,720
He was clearly the best
choice for team captain.

247
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:36,296
-Yeah, I know.

248
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,733
Who's go to all that trouble?

249
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,802
You're the one he's after.

250
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:46,350
Sai?

251
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:49,156
You should play him.

252
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,729
-Are you sure?

253
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:55,803
You were so eager to
play in this tournament.

254
00:17:55,838 --> 00:17:56,840
-He's all yours.

255
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:58,810
Good luck.

256
00:17:58,844 --> 00:17:59,846
-There you are.

257
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,816
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

258
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,854
It's almost time for the
second round match-ups.

259
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:04,689
Here.

260
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:05,691
I brought you some lunch.

261
00:18:05,691 --> 00:18:07,828
Don't you want to eat?

262
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:09,565
-Thanks, but I'm
really not that hungry.

263
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,704
What are the other guys up to?

264
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:13,508
-They're playing a
practice game together.

265
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,443
-Are you serious?

266
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,480
I thought they hated each other.

267
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:18,851
-They really want to win,
so they're working together.

268
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:20,321
And Mitani says
he's going to try

269
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:22,559
as hard as he can to
beat Kaio's captain.

270
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:23,829
I don't think he likes him.

271
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,432
And Kimihiro?

272
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:27,269
He's just as
determined as Yuuki is.

273
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:28,605
It's amazing.

274
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,309
They're finally
working as a team.

275
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,313
Can you believe it?

276
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:34,852
We should probably
head back now.

277
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:37,323
[sigh]

278
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:38,192
-Cheer up.

279
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:39,829
I'm sure you'll play awesome.

280
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:42,467
-Yeah.

281
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:43,903
-Well, I guess I'll
see you inside.

282
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:51,887
-You're troubled.

283
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,989
It's OK.

284
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:55,494
I'm fine.

285
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:57,332
Stay focused on the game, Sai.

286
00:18:57,332 --> 00:18:59,637
Akira's going to come at you
with everything he's got.

287
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,345
If you're too busy worrying
about me, you're gonna lose.

288
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:03,879
Let's go.

289
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:10,225
-He's correct.

290
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,831
I must control my emotions
and play cautiously.

291
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:29,532
Hikaru.

292
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:30,534
-Hey, man.

293
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:31,937
What happened to you?

294
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,540
-Hm?

295
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,277
-I heard that you
didn't eat lunch.

296
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:36,914
Are you OK?

297
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:42,359
-Are you gonna be able to
beat Kaio on an empty stomach?

298
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:43,261
-Hm?

299
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:43,728
-Huh?

300
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:51,410
ANNOUNCER: If you're
playing a practice game,

301
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,680
please put it away your stones.

302
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,985
We're about to begin the
second round of matches.

303
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:56,488
When you hear your
school's name,

304
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:58,492
please go to your
assigned tables.

305
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:01,565
Table A, Kaio Middle School
versus Haze Middle School.

306
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,872
Table B, Iyu Middle School
versus Tai Middle School.

307
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:05,507
-Come on.

308
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,809
That's us.

309
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:07,778

division, Table F, Kaio Middle

School versus Sowara
Middle School.

311
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:12,021
-Kaio and Haze,
please take a seat.

312
00:20:21,707 --> 00:20:23,611
-I hope you're ready.

313
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:26,517
We've been waiting a really long
time for this day, haven't we?

314
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,989
Finally, this is our big
chance to defeat Kaio.

315
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:31,661
We'll all do our best.

316
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:32,763
-I'll try my hardest.

317
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:34,434
With a little luck, I
might even win again.

318

[theme music]

319
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,560
HIKARU: The second
round's starting,

320
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:25,966
and we'll finally
get to face Kaio.

321
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:29,573
SAI: Akira has prepared for
this game for a long time.

322
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:30,542
HIKARU: Sai.

323
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:31,844
If you play him,
then I won't know

324
00:22:31,844 --> 00:22:32,686
how much better I've gotten.

325
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,722
SIA: Will you play him instead?

326
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:36,724
HIKARU: I gotta see if I
can beat him on my own.

327
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:39,193
Yuuki and Kimihiro
could win too,

328
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:42,696
and then we'd take down
last year's champions.

329
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,833
Next time, The Third Match.

330
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:49,036
SAI: It's time to show Akira
how far you've advanced.
