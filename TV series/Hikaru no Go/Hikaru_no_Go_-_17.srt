NARRATOR: After many
years inside a go board,

2
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:11,455
a spirit from the past known as
Fujiwara no Sai has returned.

3
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:14,627
Visible only to Hikaru
Shindo, a master of go,

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,733
Sai seeks to play
the divine move.

00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:19,736
[theme music]

6
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:54,476
-Look, it's Zelda!

7
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,112
This guy's Japanese!

8
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:58,183
And I think he
might even be a kid.

9
00:01:58,216 --> 00:01:59,785
-Is he skilled?

10
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,121
-Who's this Sai?

11
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,223
He's good?

12
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:03,760
HIKARU (OFFSCREEN):
Well, what do you think?

13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,098
Is this guy any good?

14
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:06,732
-He's strong.

15
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:09,637
Strong as any I've faced.

16
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,442
-Teacher, do you think this
mystery player could be a pro?

17
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:13,611
-I'm guessing that he isn't.

18
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:16,349
I've never heard of
a professional who

19
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,754
played against
amateurs this often.

20
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:20,557
-How did he get so good?

21
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,160
-Where'd this guy come from?

22
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:23,362
He never loses.

23
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:25,833
-He's better than
anyone I've ever faced.

24
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,705
-I'm leaving for the World
Amateur Championship this week.

25
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:30,308
Once I get to Japan.

26
00:02:30,342 --> 00:02:32,378
-I'm going to track Sai down.

27
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:36,753
-He's not going to be able to
hide in the shadows forever.

28
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:38,322
-It can't be!

29
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:39,691
He's a kid!

30
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,802
-He's good.

31
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:46,538
But not good enough.

32
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,107
It's not him.

33
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,303
-I'm resigning.

34
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:26,210
-Uh, by any chance, do you
play go on the internet?

35
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:27,279
Oh.

36
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:27,913
As Sai?

37
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:30,184
-Hm?

38
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:33,257
-Are you really Sai?

39
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:33,924
-Sai?

40
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,563
Is he actually here?

41
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:38,666
-Everybody is looking for him.

42
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:39,668
-You have to tell me.

43
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,572
Are you Sai or not?

44
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:45,712
-No, but then, you're not the
first person to ask me that.

45
00:03:45,712 --> 00:03:49,286
Another player did the
same thing this morning.

46
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,588
-Sorry.

47
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:52,191
-It's all right.

48
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,894
I'd like to know who he is too.

49
00:03:53,928 --> 00:03:56,165
Nobody has found out who he is.

50
00:03:56,198 --> 00:03:56,832
-Who are you?

51
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:58,569
-Have you played against him?

52
00:03:58,569 --> 00:03:59,772
-Once.

53
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,274
He is unbelievable.

54
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,312
After our game was
finished, I sent him

55
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,849
several messages
asking him who he is.

56
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,419
He never replied.

57
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:09,589
Nobody has a clue who he is.

58
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:11,225
-I guess we're all
in the same boat.

59
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:13,463
It's been a month since I
had my match against him,

60
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:15,901
and I'm still replaying
that game in my head.

61
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:18,572
-I haven't played him yet, but
I've watched his games online.

62
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:19,909
When did that guy train?

63
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:21,345
How did he get so good?

64
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:22,680
-I lost to Sai last week.

65
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,583
I've never faced such
a skilled opponent.

66
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:26,354
-I have to find out who he is!

67
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:28,558
He only showed up on the
internet a little while ago.

68
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:30,260
But look at the
frenzy he's created!

69
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:32,365
It seems like every
player at the tournament

70
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,902
has been wondering if he's here.

71
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:37,942
At least I'm not the only one
who came here to look for him.

72
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,478
-I don't believe it.

73
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:42,316
The whole world is looking for
Sai, and nobody can find him.

74
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,651
-Please lower your voices.

75
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:45,522
Not everyone has finished
their matches yet.

76
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:47,826
-His strategies are flawless!

77
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,629
He's no ordinary go player.

78
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:50,998
-People, please.

79
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,436
-What is going on?

80
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:55,673
-Everyone's talking
about the internet.

81
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:57,477
-That's a coincidence.

82
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,982
Waya had mentioned something
about that earlier today.

83
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:07,929
-Why are the
players so restless?

84
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:09,866
-Ogata-sensei.

85
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,469
-This is a nice surprise.

86
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:12,972
It's been a long time.

87
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,975
-I'm guessing you two
already know each other.

88
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:16,378
How did you meat Shimano?

89
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:18,615
-He used to come to Meijin's
study group quite often.

90
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,352
He was one of our regulars.

91
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,723
I wanted to stop by today
and show him my support.

92
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:25,762
Akira's going to
be stopping by too.

93
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:27,432
I'd really like to
know why everybody's

94
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:29,736
acting so strangely.

95
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,773
-It seems there's a great
player on the internet,

96
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:33,008
and nobody knows his name.

97
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:33,877
-Is that so?

98
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,914
-He calls himself Sai.

99
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:38,385
-Sai, huh?

100
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,654
-Excuse me, gentlemen.

101
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:41,424
I'm Rinshin Lee from China.

102
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:44,930
I played Sai once but
had to resign and lost.

103
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,632
-Really?

104
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:46,533
He must be a pro.

105
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:47,836
-I don't believe so.

106
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,676
Sai is always online, and will
play against almost anyone.

107
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:55,283
Do you think a pro would really
have that much free time?

108
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:56,519
-No.

109
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:58,288
-I'm Kim from Korea.

110
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,857
I've never had a
game against Sai,

111
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,628
but the day before
I came to Japan,

112
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,698
I got a phone call
from Yu 7-dan.

113
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:06,570
He's a pro player and
a good friend of mine.

114
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,340
He lost to Sai.

115
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:10,277
He asked me to find
him once I got here.

116
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:12,281
He sounded worried.

117
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:15,554
He said Sai is certainly
Japan's top player.

118
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:16,421
-No.

119
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:17,523
We don't believe he's a pro.

120
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:20,295
-Well then tell me, how
could Sai beat Yu 7-dan?

121
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:23,568
He's Korea's best, and he'd
never lose to an amateur.

122
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:28,945
-Excuse me.

123
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:29,979
-Waya!

124
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:31,549
What are you doing?

125
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,319
-You're talking
about Sai, right?

126
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,487
I played him a month ago.

127
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,790
I thought I should
say something.

128
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:36,792
-What?

129
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:38,027
Why didn't you
mention that earlier?

130
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,732
-I tried to tell
you, Sai's not a pro,

131
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:43,438
even though he's probably the
best player I've ever seen!

132
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,707
-So we've heard.

133
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:45,574
-Who's this?

134
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:46,576
-You mean Waya?

135
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:48,413
He's one of
Morishita's students.

136
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:49,482
-What's Sai like?

137
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:51,352
-That's kind of a tough
question to answer.

138
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:54,324
His strategies are
really unusual.

139
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:57,329
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but his playing style

140
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:00,001
reminded me a lot
of Honinbo Shusaku.

141
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:01,537
-Are you joking?

142
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,040
-Hm.

143
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:06,813
-Shusaku's abilities
were unmatched.

144
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:08,516
-I've seen a lot of Sai's games.

145
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:10,020
The more I study him,
the more I notice

146
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,357
how much he's like Shusaku.

147
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,362
I bet you're all thinking I'm
totally crazy, but I'm not.

148
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:19,871
It won't be long before
Sai is a legend himself.

149
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:22,375
I've spent all summer
watching him play.

150
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,045
He's online almost every day.

151
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:25,748
After reviewing
all of his matches,

152
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:29,054
I've discovered that
he's getting stronger.

153
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:31,793
It's hard to predict just how
good he'll eventually become.

154
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,497
He hasn't been defeated yet.

155
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:37,002
If Shusaku had
learned modern joseki,

156
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:38,739
I bet he'd play a lot like Sai.

157
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,977
-Do you know how hard it is
to combine those techniques?

158
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,948
-What an awesome summer break.

159
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:46,386
I wish we had this
much time off all year.

160
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,757
-Is Sai a god?

161
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,894
-Everyone knows about you
because of this computer,

162
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:53,131
but they have no idea
who you really are.

163
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:54,768
You're Fujiwara no Sai!

164
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,771
-Or is he a ghost?

165
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:57,773
-You're Honinbo Shusaku!

166
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:14,871
-If the spirit of Shusaku is
roaming around on the net,

167
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:17,710
then I want the chance
to play against him.

168
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:18,879
-What's going on here?

169
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:20,181
-Huh?

170
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:21,383
-You made it.

171
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,752
-I noticed all the
matches have stopped.

172
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,088
Is everything all right in here?

173
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,025
-This is none of your business.

174
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:27,828
-I know you.

175
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:29,030
-I'm curious.

176
00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:30,801
Have you ever played against
anyone on the internet?

177
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,539
-I had a game against
a pro from Kansai once.

178
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:34,707
Why do you want to know?

179
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:37,779
-It seems there's some
kind of go wizard online.

180
00:08:37,814 --> 00:08:39,883
We think he's an
amateur, but he managed

181
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:43,089
to defeat one of
Korea's top competitors.

182
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,692
-I think I've heard about him.

183
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:49,634
-What gives him the
right to barge in here

184
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:51,638
and interrupt our conversation?

185
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:52,474
-Calm down.

186
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:53,709
What's gotten into you today?

187
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:54,711
You're acting like a fool.

188
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:56,681
-Whatever.

189
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:59,553
-This mystery player
is called Sai.

190
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:01,656
-Really?

191
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,827
-Sensei, I know it
sounds ridiculous,

192
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:05,831
but I think that this
guy is actually a kid.

193
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:06,933
-He's a kid?

194
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:07,801
-There's no way.

195
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,471
-He's too strong.

196
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:10,740
-What makes you say that?

197
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:11,909
-Answer him.

198
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:14,814
-Sai's been online every
day since the end of July.

199
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,451
That's when summer
break started,

200
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:19,022
which would explain why
he's had so much free time.

201
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:21,058
He also sent me this
really immature message

202
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:22,662
that said "Strong, aren't I?"

203
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,565
Only a kid would write
something like that.

204
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:25,634
-He sent you a message?

205
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,938
Did he tell you any
details about himself?

206
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:29,675
-Where is he from?

207
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,947
-I can only answer one
question at a time!

208
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,216
-He's a kid.

209
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,620
-Hm.

210
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:37,104
-Hm.

211
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,999
-Do you have any
idea who it might be?

212
00:09:46,238 --> 00:09:48,075
-No, I do not.

213
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,951
But I know who
you're thinking of.

214
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:53,618
Hikaru Shindo.

215
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:02,000
-I used to think that you were
capable of the divine move.

216
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,604
I was wrong.

217
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:13,622
-Excuse me, this
laptop's internet ready.

218
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:16,928
-Come here, Toya.

219
00:10:25,777 --> 00:10:27,614
-Sai might be online.

220
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:29,050
I want you to see him play.

221
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,194
-That's him.

222
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:37,766
[crowd murmuring]

223
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,512
-Ha!

224
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:45,681
You won again!

225
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:46,883
He resigned.

226
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,554
Wow, who thought watching
you beat everyone

227
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:50,790
would be so much fun?

228
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,194
-It's unfortunate our last
opponent wasn't very good.

229
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,066
Sometimes there are strong
players inside of that box.

230
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:57,201
-Let's check and see.

231
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:01,543
Huh?

232
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:03,079
Akira's here?

233
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,817
Oh, man, we're being flooded
with all these game requests.

234
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:07,587
It's really starting to bug me.

235
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,060
I'll close this window and go
back to the previous screen.

236
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,763
Think it's him?

237
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,065
-Akira?

238
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:15,735
It's possible.

239
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:16,203
-No way.

240
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:17,171
It can't be him.

241
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:20,076
Oh, another challenger?

242
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,714
These people are drowning
me in game requests.

243
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,983
This guy's unbelievable.

244
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,956
I just refused to play him,
and now he's asking me again.

245
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:28,859
Why can't he get the message?

246
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:30,562
-I think that you
should take a break.

247
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:31,130
-Huh?

248
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:31,998
Hi.

249
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:33,200
What's this?

250
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:33,902
-It's on me.

251
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:34,836
-Thank you.

252
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,105
I could really use a cold soda.

253
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:39,745
-Huh.

254
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,215
The picture inside
that box has changed.

255
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:41,783
-Huh?

256
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,031
We should see if it's him.

257
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:53,304
-[gasp]

258
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,642
-It's Sai.

259
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:57,745
He's challenging me
to an online game.

260
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,997
-It looks like he
accepted our request.

261
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:11,169
I hope this turns
out to be Akira Toya.

262
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:12,205
Don't you?

263
00:12:12,238 --> 00:12:15,277
I know how badly he
wanted to play you.

264
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:17,949
He was so upset when I
resigned at the tournament.

265
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:19,218
I guess I would have been, too.

266
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:22,757
He must have trained for
that game for months.

267
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,028
-Hikaru, I have an idea.

268
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:26,197
-Huh?

269
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:28,835
-I know a way that will
reveal if it's him or not.

270
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:30,171
-Well, what is it?

271
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:32,809
-First we should choose black.

272
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:34,646
-No problem.

273
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,315
-Now let's begin.

274
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:38,620
Our first move is 17-4.

275
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,694
-17-4?

276
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,629
What's he up to?

277
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:50,375
-He just played the
upper left star point.

278
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:51,377
-Next move, 16-17.

279
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,964
-White played at 4-17.

280
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:06,037
-Our next move is 15-3.

281
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,527
-Oh.

282
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:14,652
-It's his turn to move, but
he's not doing anything.

283
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:15,754
What's he waiting for?

284
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,634
He approached in
the lower right.

285
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:23,970
Where should I move?

286
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,409
-So far, this game is exactly
the same as our previous match.

287
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:28,143
-Previous match?

288
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:32,685
It must be him!

289
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,088
-I agree.

290
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:36,392
He's mirrored his opening
moves from our second game.

291
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:37,427
Do you remember that day?

292
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:42,737
I struck him down
with a single move.

293
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:08,885
-All right.

294
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:10,955
Our next move,
15-16, the diagonal.

295
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,306
-Why doesn't he move?

296
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,142
-Perhaps we're not
the only ones who

297
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:25,014
have recognized our opponent.

298
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:26,317
He's recalling that game.

299
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:28,287
That's why he hasn't
placed his next stone.

300
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,756
He must be quite surprised.

301
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:34,732
-It can't be.

302
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:35,215
-Huh?

303
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:41,277
If he knows it's me, he's
gonna tell everybody who I am!

304
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:42,913
We messed up!

305
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:46,320
-It's not possible.

306
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,324
-Your opponent is
using an old strategy

307
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:49,493
called Shusaku's Diagonal.

308
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,873
-Are you OK?

309
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:58,442
-It can't be him.

310
00:14:58,475 --> 00:14:59,344
-It's your turn.

311
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:01,080
Why are you taking so long?

312
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:13,970
-Look, that's the same move
he made during our last game.

313
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:14,739
-I know.

314
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:16,008
This is bad.

315
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,810
Do you know what's going to
happen when people find out

316
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:19,079
it's me on this computer?

317
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:24,823
[screaming] I'm in
so much trouble!

318
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,159
-I was wondering
when you'd manage

319
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,829
to find a player
you couldn't beat.

320
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:29,032
-Excuse me, miss.

321
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:30,234
-Coming!

322
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:32,805
-Listen, Sai, you can't
keep playing the same moves.

323
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:35,143
Do some different ones.

324
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:36,979
-Let's try a two
point high approach.

325
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:38,415
4-14, please.

326
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:46,263
-Do you think we threw them off?

327
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:47,532
-Of course.

328
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:49,869
-You sure it's Akira?

329
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:50,838
Because I'm not.

330
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:07,936
-Check it out.

331
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:09,905
He sure is taking his time.

332
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,789
The game's over?

333
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,130
-You resigned?

334
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:24,365
-Why did you stop playing?

335
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:29,409
-If we keep going, this game
might disrupt the tournament.

336
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:31,846
I don't want to
distract the players.

337
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,549
I can always challenge
Sai to a rematch.

338
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,297
-What's Toya's problem?

339
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:44,269
-He wants to set up a
time for another game.

340
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:46,038
Huh?

341
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,042
I've got a question for you.

342
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:48,517
-Yeah?

343
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:50,113
Go ahead.

344
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:51,282
-Are you here tomorrow?

345
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:52,417
-It's my day off.

346
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:54,220
I'm going on a trip
with some friends.

347
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:57,026
I've got a shift on Sunday,
though, if you want to drop in.

348
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,161
-Perfect.

349
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:59,964
I need you to send this
guy a message for me.

350
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:02,268
I want it to say, this
Sunday at 10:00 AM.

351
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:03,237
-Come on.

352
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,306
You should have
learned this by now.

353
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:08,354
-Huh?

354
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:09,615
-Hm?

355
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:12,186
-I can't wait to see that game.

356
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:14,057
-The tournament will
be done by then.

357
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:15,459
We'll all have gone home.

358
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:20,902
-He agreed!

359
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,184
-Thank you for letting
me use the computer.

360
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:29,626
Good bye.

361
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:38,334
-Who was that boy, anyway?

362
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,004
-You don't know?

363
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:43,477
He's the son of Japan's
best player, Toya Meijin.

364
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,282
-There are plenty of
strong players online.

365
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,553
Why would Sai want a
rematch against him?

366
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:49,588
-That's a good question.

367
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:51,625
This is the first
time I've seen Sai

368
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,497
ask someone else for a game.

369
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,202
-Our test to turn
pro begins Sunday,

370
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:59,974
and Akira's going to have
to forfeit his first match.

371
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:03,046
He doesn't care about the exam.

372
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,549
It's the opportunity
of a lifetime,

373
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,354
and he blew it off
without a second thought.

374
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,425
He's throwing away his
chance to become a pro just

375
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,929
for a stupid game
on the internet!

376
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:13,165
Loser!

377
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:15,336
-I wish I could have
found out who Sai was.

378
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:18,508
There's a lot of questions
I want to ask him.

379
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:21,112
-If I find out anything,
I'll email you.

380
00:18:21,112 --> 00:18:22,248
-That'd be great.

381
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:55,576
-I heard that Toya Meijin's son
is taking the test this year.

382
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:57,646
-That's going to make
it really tough on us.

383
00:18:57,646 --> 00:18:59,917
-You've failed how
many times now?

384
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:00,685
-I've lost count.

385
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:02,956
But if I don't pass
this year, I'll

386
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:04,291
give up on trying
to become a pro.

387
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:31,642
-That kid's got a lot of nerve.

388
00:19:31,675 --> 00:19:34,948
He obviously doesn't care
if he loses his first match.

389
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:37,552
He's so full of himself!

390
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,688
-Where is Toya?

391
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:41,192
-He hasn't shown up yet?

392
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:42,695
-Everyone in this
room has been waiting

393
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:44,666
for this day for a whole year!

394
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:45,700
Everyone but him.

395
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,537
I've been studying
nonstop for months!

396
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,139
Toya!

397
00:19:51,177 --> 00:19:52,680
-You may now begin your games.

398
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:53,381
-Onegaishimasu.

399
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:19,529
-Hey, good morning, Hikaru.

400
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:21,332
It's sure raining hard.

401
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,334
-I can't talk right now!

402
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,737
I've got to get
online before 10:00!

403
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:25,139
Let's talk later!

404
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:42,070
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Sai, you ready?

405
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,074
[theme music]

406
00:22:22,587 --> 00:22:24,123
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Akira's totally

407
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:25,826
psyched to play
against you, Sai!

408
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:29,199
SAI (VOICEOVER): He has improved
since our previous games.

409
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:32,238
Now I'll have to
become stronger!

410
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:33,741
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
What are you saying?

411
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:36,312
Is Akira good
enough to beat you?

412
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:38,232
SAI (VOICEOVER): The
only way one of us

413
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:42,636
will win is by playing
a perfect game.

414
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:46,006
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Next
time, Akira vs. Sai!

415
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,844
This is gonna be great,
and I get to see it all!
