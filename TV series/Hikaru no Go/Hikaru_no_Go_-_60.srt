The memory of him on his death
bed is still very strong.

00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,077
-No, that's OK.

162
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,812
Just turn out the
light, would you?

163
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,017
-We should have enough
light if we play over here

164
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:32,920
by the window.

165
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:33,676
Sit down.

166
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,936
-You're still thirsty?

167
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,371
-It's been a long and I'm tired.

168
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:52,139
That'll be my handicap.

169
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:55,142
I doubt I'm going to put up
much of a fight in this game.

170
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:56,744
-Easier for me to win.

171
00:11:56,777 --> 00:12:00,314
Don't expect me to take
it easy on you, OK?

172
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:02,917
-Hey, hey, you can't
treat it like a real game

173
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,218
when I'm in this state.

174
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:06,954
Save your tough guy act
for an official match.

175
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:10,424
I already got an idea of
what your skill level is.

176
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,361
I was there watching when you
played your Shinshodan Series

177
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:14,395
game.

178
00:12:14,428 --> 00:12:15,997
Kuwabara-sensei and
I were taking bets

179
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,466
on who was going to win.

180
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:20,368
Kuwabara got in
first and bet on you,

181
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:22,937
which meant I was left with
no choice but to bet on Toya.

182
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:27,375
But if you want
to know the truth,

183
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:29,343
my money would have
been on you as well.

184
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:30,511
-Hmph, right.

185
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:32,480
You expect me to believe
you when you're like this?

186
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,782
-You really are a brat.

187
00:12:34,815 --> 00:12:38,152
Although I am a lot more
tired today than unusual.

188
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:40,821
Winning the Judan Series
title is a big deal.

189
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:44,825
So I think I deserve to go
out and celebrate a bit.

190
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:48,162
Toya-sensei's retirement was
turned everything upside down.

191
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:52,933
Even though I won
the Judan title,

192
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:55,302
people won't recognize
me as a champion

193
00:12:55,336 --> 00:13:00,074
unless I can successfully
defended it next year.

194
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:01,075
You'll see.

195
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:02,343
I'm going to be the
best in the world.

196
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:19,293
So, Shindo, like I said
before-- let me play Sai.

197
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:20,761
-Settle for playing me?

198
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,304
-Sure. Why not?

199
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,178
16.

200
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:39,313
You go first.

201
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:41,449
-Onegaishimasu.

202
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:42,049
-Yeah.

203
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:24,859
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Well,
it looks like I've won.

204
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:25,960
It's all over.

205
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:32,099
-Wait.

206
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:35,069
-You made a big mistake on
an easy life and death play.

207
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:39,073
You must be really
out of it to do that.

208
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:41,909
-My mistake hasn't got
anything to do with it.

209
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:44,044
Let's face it, you played well.

210
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,482
You went on the attack over
in the upper right corner.

211
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:54,088
My keystones were useless after
that, so what was the point?

212
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:56,157
After that, my
heart wasn't in it,

213
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,159
so I played some
pretty reckless moves.

214
00:14:58,192 --> 00:15:00,961
I'm surprised it took
you that long to beat me.

215
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:03,998
-Maybe if we'd played
earlier in the day.

216
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:05,332
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Was it really

217
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:08,836
worth letting him play Sai?

218
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:11,972
If he actually knew who
he'd been playing against,

219
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:14,074
I'd have been in big trouble.

220
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:16,010
But then again, he couldn't
have figured it out

221
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:17,478
while he's like this.

222
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:21,215
-Well, good night, Mr. Ogata.

223
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:29,190
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): It's kind
of sad, him losing this way.

224
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:30,824
-Some of those moves
were masterful.

225
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:33,093
There was no mistakes.

226
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:37,298
It was as if I was playing Sai.

227
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:41,135
[chuckling] But that's absurd.

228
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:43,504
I'm just imagining things.

229
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:45,272
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Hopefully that game's

230
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:48,242
got him off my back for a while.

231
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,377
I'll skip out of here
early tomorrow morning

232
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:52,813
so I don't bump into him again.

233
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:53,968
Sai?

234
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:11,205
-In the actual game, white
went after black's eye space

235
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,307
by playing here.

236
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:13,708
Now what would have
happened if white

237
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,777
had connected in
the center first?

238
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,346
White would wait for this move,
and then go on to play an--

239
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,716
-Ogata-sensei,
how are you today?

240
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:23,685
-Have you seen Shindo?

241
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:25,720
-He went back home
early this morning.

242
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,455
He'd finished all his
teaching sessions,

243
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:29,357
so I guess he didn't see
any point in staying.

244
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,583
[yawn]

245
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,285
HIKARU: I don't know
why I'm so tired.

246
00:16:57,318 --> 00:16:58,686
I had a chance to
sleep on the train.

247
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:03,091
I can barely stay awake.

248
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:08,696
-Hikaru, I would
like to play a game.

249
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,497
-Now?

250
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,431
I haven't got the energy.

251
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:13,401
I'm too tired.

252
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:16,371
I gotta get some sleep or else
I might get sick, you know.

253
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:18,473
But I guess a quick
game first will be OK.

254
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:29,617
Well, come on, sit down.

255
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:30,585
Here we go.

256
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:04,352
SAI (VOICEOVER): 140
years ago, Torajiro

257
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:08,089
allowed me to guide him.

258
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:13,428
If Torajiro existed
for my sake, then

259
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:15,596
I have existed
for Hikaru's sake.

260
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:24,172
And what's more, Hikaru will now
exist for someone else's sake.

261
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,178
Then that person will be
there for someone else.

262
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:38,286
And so it will continue,
year after year,

263
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,520
millennium after millennium.

264
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:05,747
The long path that leads us
all toward the Divine Move.

265
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:21,462
My part in the
journey is now over.

266
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,671
Hikaru, this is it.

267
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:33,341
Hikaru?

268
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:35,476
Hikaru?

269
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:40,715
Oh, can you hear me?

270
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:44,285
Hikaru, It was fun
being with you.

271
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:56,831
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
It's your turn.

272
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,834
What are you waiting for?

273
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,737
Hm?

274
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:04,238
I said it's your turn.

275
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:08,010
Sai?

276
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,661
Sai?

277
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,356
[ending theme]

278
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:24,312
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Sai, where are you?

279
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:26,747
He isn't at grandpa's
where I first saw him.

280
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:29,417
Where else could he have gone?

281
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,453
I'm gonna find him, no
matter what it takes,

282
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,588
or where I have to go.

283
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:38,459
But where do I start?

284
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,794
Torajiro's grave!

285
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:42,630
He could have gone
to see Torajiro.

286
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:46,534
Next time, Is Sai Really Gone?
