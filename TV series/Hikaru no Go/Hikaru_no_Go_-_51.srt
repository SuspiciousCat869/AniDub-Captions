[theme music]

2
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:11,415
-Look at this.

3
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:12,983
HIKARU: It isn't
just a tournament.

4
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:14,751
They've got everything
to do with Go here.

5
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:16,887
Teaching games, classes.

6
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,189
But you know, I
didn't think there'd

7
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,159
be this many people here.

8
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:22,726
-Hikaru.

9
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,727
Hikaru!

10
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,728
Over here!

11
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:29,833
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Looks like this

12
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:31,702
is helping to
cheer him up a bit.

13
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,236
I'm glad we decided
to come here.

14
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,241
-I wish we could've played
the game without a handicap.

15
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:48,685
Next time we play, let's
make it an even game.

16
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:49,353
SAI (VOICEOVER): Yes.

17
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:53,957
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): The match
didn't turn out so well for Sai

18
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,862
in the end, but it seemed
like a good idea at the time.

19
00:02:58,895 --> 00:02:59,963
-Hikaru.

20
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:01,331
Can we go and watch
one the games?

21
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:02,265
Hm?

22
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:03,233
-Sure!

23
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,801
And don't forget
that next week we've

24
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,837
gotta watch Ochi's
Shincho Dan match.

25
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,839
He was bugging me a
lot about my game,

26
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:11,174
so I want a chance
to get back at him.

27
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,376
I'll put him in his place.

28
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:20,016
SAI (VOICEOVER): He's trying
so hard to be nice to me.

29
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,284
He was right.

30
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:27,057
My selfishness ruined what
was an important game for him.

31
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,760
It was all my fault.

32
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:34,364
From now on, I won't ask
to play any more matches.

33
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:36,366
Well, not often, anyway.

34
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,972
MAN: That'll be 1,500 yen.

35
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,974
Thank you very much.

36
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,909
GOKISO: Instead of
selling those cheap fans,

37
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:49,713
you need to try and move some
of those expensive Go boards.

38
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:51,415
-Gokiso-sensei.

39
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:54,384
A top of the line board like
that is a bit of a hard sell,

40
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,820
but I managed to get rid
of three of the others.

41
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,721
-Oh, yeah?

42
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:58,855
Which ones?

43
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,390
MAN: These ones right
here, made of kaya wood.

44
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,759
On special at 200,000 yen.

45
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:04,094
-You call this kaya?

46
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:06,830
You might be able to fool most
of the amateurs in this place,

47
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,399
but I wouldn't pay more
than 80,000 for this.

48
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:13,103
-Uh, sensei, sh.

49
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,338
-You got a marker pen
lying around somewhere?

50
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:17,707
I think we can improve
on your special sign.

51
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:24,047
That should be more effective.

52
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,182
-Oh.

53
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,019
You're a much better
salesman than me, Sensei.

54
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,220
-Don't be stupid.

55
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,889
I'm a professional Go player.

56
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:35,158
Remember, I'm the one
who pulled the strings

57
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,761
to get a space selling
stuff at this event.

58
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:41,798
Now get more money
from those suckers.

59
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:42,766
-Oh, look!

60
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,234
That cluster's about
to be captured.

61
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:45,802
He's caught an atari.

62
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:46,970
-Hm.

63
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,872
HIKARU: I don't know
what he's going hm for.

64
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:50,073
The next move is obvious.

65
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:51,274
He's got to defend the cluster!

66
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,280
-How could he miss that?

67
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:59,182
HIKARU: He'll get captured
and that'll be it.

68
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,921
-Doesn't he realize he
could have won the game?

69
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:06,356
It's more stressful
watching this

70
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,860
than watching a
professional game.

71
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,228
GIRL: Aren't you
gonna play a game?

72
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,029
You can still sign up.

73
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,831
-Uh, no thanks.

74
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,833
I'm just watching.

75
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:21,271
-You might not wanna
play, but what about me?

76
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:23,740
I just promised I wouldn't
ask him to let me play again.

77
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:25,775
I can't help it!

78
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:26,443
MAN: A new Go board?

79
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:28,044
I've been thinking about that.

80
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,714
One day I'll get around
to splurging on one.

81
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:33,850
-Instead of one day, why
not make today the day?

82
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,786
They say studying on
a good quality board

83
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,955
will help you improve your game.

84
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:40,090
-Oh.

85
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,791
They're just selling Go
boards and other stuff.

86
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,693
-Were you expecting more?

87
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:47,898
-This one's a special offer
for today only at 250,000.

88
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,366
And this one's a
steal of a deal.

89
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,134
Only 200,000 for
a board made out

90
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,703
of top grade, domestic kaya.

91
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:54,337
-Kaya?

92
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:56,439
I don't think it is.

93
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,708
No, this is definitely not kaya.

94
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,710
It looks similar, but it's not.

95
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:02,779
-What is kaya, anyway?

96
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:04,848
-A special wood used
to make Go boards.

97
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:07,350
Your grandfather's
board is made from it.

98
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:09,686
Kaya is used for
all the best boards.

99
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:10,887
-What about mine?

100
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:12,222
-It's katsura.

101
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:13,356
-Oh.

102
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,393
You mean, this
isn't really kaya?

103
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:17,994
-Like you would
know the difference!

104
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,763
You're just a kid!

105
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,099
-What's going on over here?

106
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,735
Stop interfering with
this man's business.

107
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:27,270
-I'm not interfering!

108
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,705
SAI (VOICEOVER): Hikaru.

109
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:30,140
Place a stone on the board.

110
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:32,909
-Hmph.

111
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:34,144
-No!

112
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:35,378
What do you think you're doing?

113
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,350
-Thought so.

114
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,451
Sounds too dull for kaya.

115
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,152
So that means--

116
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:43,353
-Look at this.

117
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,956
You put your filthy fingers
all over my merchandise!

118
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,390
You pesky little brat!

119
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:49,759
MAN: Is everything all right?

120
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:51,928
Is there a problem
I can help with?

121
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:53,229
-Nothing I can't handle.

122
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,699
This kid decided to play a stone
on one of expensive Go boards,

123
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:56,766
that's all.

124
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,702
-The only reason I
did that was because--

125
00:06:58,702 --> 00:07:00,870
-If you make any more
false accusations,

126
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:03,073
we'll make you pay
for that Go board,

127
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:05,241
seeing as how you damaged it.

128
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:07,978
MAN: Um, I think I
should wait until I

129
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,247
get a bit better at playing Go
before I buy a brand new board.

130
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:12,015
Thanks, anyway.

131
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:12,682
-Wait!

132
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:13,383
Are you sure?

133
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:14,250
-Young man.

134
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,418
Go boards are made of soft wood.

135
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,287
They dent easily if
you're not careful.

136
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,689
Plus, they're very expensive.

137
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,660
Promise me you
won't do that again.

138
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,261
-I'm sorry.

139
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:26,229
Hmph.

140
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:27,831
-But we--

141
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,000
MAN: Honinbo Shusaku
used that board?

142
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,801
-Hm?

143
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,037
-Is this is for sale, too?

144
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,106
How much?

145
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,907
Six million?

146
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:38,408
Whoa.

147
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:39,876
-It just came in.

148
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:42,979
We acquired it from a very
well respected antiques dealer.

149
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,148
This is the very same
board that Shusaku-sensei

150
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:49,352
played on when he went to
Takamatsu to give lessons.

151
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,021
-Did you go to Takamatsu?

152
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,824
-I traveled all over with
Torajiro, so it's hard to say.

153
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:57,394
MAN: After the game, his
opponent asked Shusaku-sensei

154
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:59,229
if he would autograph
the board for him.

155
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,930
Which, of course, he did.

156
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:02,699
MAN: He signed it?

157
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,336
-It's signed by Inta--
I want to see this.

158
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:13,109
Hikaru, that signature isn't
Torajiro's handwriting.

159
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,110
-What?

160
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,811
You're kidding!

161
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:16,713
You mean it's fake?

162
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,380
-Huh?

163
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,882
What are you doing, you brat?

164
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,384
This signature is
absolutely genuine!

165
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:22,786
Now get lost!

166
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:23,820
-Hm.

167
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:26,656
-Sir, please don't go away!

168
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,259
-How dare he lie like that?

169
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,227
-That is not
Shusaku's handwriting.

170
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,197
-I have no doubts
that this is genuine.

171
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,932
-You see, even a pro says so.

172
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,834
You'd question a
the word of a pro?

173
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,904
-If he was a real pro,
he wouldn't be lying.

174
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,971
I get it.

175
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:44,941
He must be the one who
forged the signature.

176
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:46,042
-You!

177
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:48,111
Who do you think you are
talking to Mr. Gokiso?

178
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:49,179
Like that?

179
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,414
-What seems to be the
problem this time?

180
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,450
-How dare you dishonor
the name of Torajiro

181
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:54,918
with a forged signature?

182
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,320
-Yeah, how dare you?

183
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:58,021
What?

184
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,823
-Is there a problem?

185
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:00,385
-Well--

186
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,361
-Mr. Gokiso, maybe
you should head over

187
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,764
to your teaching session,
which starts shortly.

188
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,798
-Don't worry.

189
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:10,366
No one's going to
believe a teenager.

190
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:13,903
It's our word against his.

191
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:14,579
-So?

192
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,244
MAN: A forgery, huh?

193
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:22,746
Are you sure about that?

194
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,247
HIKARU: Yeah, those
two are big liars.

195
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,917
And those other boards aren't
real kaya wood, either.

196
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,119
-I knew it.

197
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,386
-What do you mean?

198
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,989
-I had a suspicion
about these boards.

199
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,658
They must be shin
kaya, not genuine kaya.

200
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:36,760
-Hm?

201
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,829
-Well, it's not like I'm
an expert or anything,

202
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:41,865
but the guy who was here
selling boards last year

203
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:43,399
was someone who
really knew his stuff.

204
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:46,002
He was nice enough to
teach me a few things.

205
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,438
Shin kaya looks a
lot like real kaya,

206
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,074
but actually it's made
from imported spruce.

207
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,275
It's not a bad wood.

208
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,410
I mean, it's got a lovely
grain and everything,

209
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:56,279
but it's way cheaper than kaya.

210
00:09:56,312 --> 00:09:57,981
And because of that,
there are a lot

211
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,016
of crooked dealers out
there who pass one off

212
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,718
as the other to
make a fast buck.

213
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,055
HIKARU: I see.

214
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:08,758
How come the guy from
last year isn't here?

215
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:13,229
-Mr. Gokiso, he insisted
we use this new dealer.

216
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:15,732
And of course, we
couldn't refuse.

217
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:17,033
-Why not?

218
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,769
-An event like this depends on
the good will of pros like him

219
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,671
if it's going to succeed.

220
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,208
I'll try and keep an eye on this
Go board dealer from now on.

221
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:28,344
Thanks for bringing
it to our attention.

222
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,445
-I don't know.

223
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,281
I thought coming here
would be a lot of fun,

224
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:34,350
but this has kind of ruined it.

225
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,387
Wanna watch another game?

226
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,256
Oh man, I don't think I've
ever seen you this angry.

227
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,091
-Sai?

228
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,128
Hikaru, over there.

229
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:48,064
That scoundrel is
playing a teaching game.

230
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:49,065
-Oh yeah!

231
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:50,400
And that guy he's
playing is the one

232
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,302
who they were trying
to sell a board to.

233
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:53,436
-Oh dear, oh dear.

234
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,005
You've gone and left
openings everywhere.

235
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:58,741
-And the upper
left corner's dead.

236
00:10:58,775 --> 00:10:59,943
-Let's face it.

237
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:01,811
You're never going to
improve your game until you

238
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:05,748
invest in a decent
quality Go board.

239
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:07,383
-He's being really mean.

240
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,718
-You're right.

241
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,920
He's not teaching him,
he's tormenting him.

242
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,121
Treating him like a fool.

243
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:15,124
This is no way to
play a teaching game.

244
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:17,727
-So you're saying
there's no hope?

245
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,394
-Don't give up yet.

246
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,430
There's still hope.

247
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,298
-You've still got a
chance to save the game.

248
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,300
Hang in there, mister,
and you can do it.

249
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:27,170
-How could he possibly
make a comeback from here?

250
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:31,007
But if you insist, let's
continue, shall we?

251
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,808
-It's OK.

252
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:33,810
I think I've had enough.

253
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,345
-But hey, the kid
behind you says

254
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:37,180
you can still win the game.

255
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:40,250
-Why don't you play in my place?

256
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,386
-They s actions speak
louder than words.

257
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,955
So here's your chance, kid.

258
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:47,924
-Hikaru, sit and play.

259
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,791
-Are you sure?

260
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:51,060
He is a pro, after all.

261
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:53,029
-I know I can win this game.

262
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:55,131
And if I do, he has
to promise to stop

263
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,400
selling the board with
the fake signature.

264
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:58,167
-OK.

265
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,737
Gotcha.

266
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,373
-Well, then, you're
actually gonna play.

267
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:04,741
-Here's the deal.

268
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,209
If I win, then you've gotta
stop selling the board

269
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:08,111
with the fake Shusaku signature.

270
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:08,878
-Hmph.

271
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:09,946
It's such a long shot.

272
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,048
Sure, why not?

273
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:13,316
HIKARU: Then it's a deal.

274
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:15,418
(VOICEOVER) Won't he suspect
something if I let you play,

275
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,353
Sai?

276
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,888
-This man has no respect.

277
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:21,190
He sees you only as a child.

278
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:24,060
If he loses to you, he'll be
too humiliated and embarrassed

279
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:25,995
to tell anyone about it.

280
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:30,366
-In that case--
he's all yours, Sai!

281
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,935
Here we go!

282
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,303
14, 4.

283
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,404
One point enclosure.

284
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:45,181
-So, do you guys have
anymore questions?

285
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:48,051
-Kurata-sensei, I'm
afraid we're out of time.

286
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:49,986
-Well, I think we've
covered everything.

287
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,388
It looks like we'll
have to stop there.

288
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:54,023
Thanks very much.

289
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:55,792
Thank you.

290
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:59,062
-Kurata-sensei, I'd love it
if I could get your autograph.

291
00:12:59,095 --> 00:12:59,762
-Oh, yes.

292
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:00,930
Yeah, of course!

293
00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:02,899
-I'll be rooting for you
to win the title this year.

294
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:04,734
-Oh, me, too!

295
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,936
Kurata Meijin's got a nice
ring to it, don't you think?

296
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,905
Maybe that's how I'll
sign my autograph.

297
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:10,907
Meijin to be.

298
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:12,241
There.

299
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:16,045
[laughter] Better not
show that to Toya Meijin.

300
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,448
-Sensei, sign
something for me, too?

301
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:19,248
-Sure.

302
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,317
How about the Kisei title?

303
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:25,188
Sentabi, Kisei Atsushi Kurata.

304
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,091
-Do one for me
with Honinbo on it.

305
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:29,425
-No problem.

306
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:32,895
Eventually the Honinbo,
Atsushi Kurata.

307
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:34,664
-Thanks. I love it.

308
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,366
Hope it won't be too long
before you get there.

309
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,968
-I'm one of the ones who booked
a teaching session with you,

310
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:40,670
Sensei, and I can't wait.

311
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,872
I'm going to learn so much.

312
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,140
-You betcha!

313
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:46,042
MAN: I wish I'd gone with you
instead of that other guy.

314
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:46,843
-Oh?

315
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:47,443
What do you mean?

316
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,978
Did something happen?

317
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,381
-Well, just a while ago
I had a teaching session

318
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,383
with Gokiso-sensei.

319
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,051
-And what's the
matter with that?

320
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,352
-It was horrible.

321
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:57,720
-Horrible?

322
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,055
-It felt like he
was setting me up

323
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,858
to fail so he could say
things to put me down.

324
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:02,725
MAN: That's awful.

325
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,027
There's gotta be an explanation.

326
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:06,162
There must be
something going on.

327
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:08,898
-It's just a rumor, but
I heard Mr. Gokiso's

328
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:12,969
been in financial trouble since
the stock market went down.

329
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,737
-I don't care
what's up with him.

330
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,274
There's no excuse to take
it out on us like that.

331
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:22,311
-In the end, I got so fed up
with him I just quit the game.

332
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:24,313
Even though there was this
kid behind me who said

333
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:27,717
I still had a chance of
winning if I stuck at it.

334
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,919
-Once you're that far
behind against a pro,

335
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,422
it's pretty much impossible
to make a comeback.

336
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,223
-That's what I thought, too.

337
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:35,391
-Let's face it.

338
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:37,360
The idea of a kid being
good enough to beat a pro

339
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,162
is just too
ridiculous for words.

340
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:40,763
MAN: Oh, there you are.

341
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:41,519
-Huh?

342
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:41,998
-Hm?

343
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,032
-Do you remember that boy?

344
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:45,935
The one who took over
your game for you?

345
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,770
He's giving Gokiso a good run.

346
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,702
-What?

347
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:54,410
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I
think we've done it.

348
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,412
It's down to the endgame.

349
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:59,015
Sai is so awesome.

350
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:02,185
He made moves I would
never have thought of.

351
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:03,352
-This can't be.

352
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:04,787
I don't believe it.

353
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,789
How could I have
underestimated him?

354
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,757
I can't figure it out.

355
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:08,324
MAN: Over here?

356
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:09,225
MAN: Let's have a look.

357
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:09,926
-Huh?

358
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,761
-Was this the game?

359
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:14,864
-What do you want, Kurata?

360
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,766
-Hey, don't clear those away.

361
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,000
I want to see!

362
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:19,702
-Well, maybe I don't
want you to see,

363
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,938
'cause I played such
an embarrassing game.

364
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,706
If you saw it,
you'd laugh at me.

365
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,174
And I'm not having that.

366
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:25,908
-What?

367
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:27,343
Was it that bad?

368
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,979
Shame I missed it.

369
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,414
-Excuse me.

370
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:32,181
-Wait.

371
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,216
His promise!

372
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:33,983
-Hey!

373
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,885
We had a deal, remember?

374
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:37,286
KURATA: You there.

375
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:40,389
So you won the game?

376
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:42,391
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): It
wasn't really me who won.

377
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,093
It was Sai.

378
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,728
-So what's the story?

379
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:48,898
You managed to come all the
way from behind to beat him?

380
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,399
Seriously, no way?

381
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:51,434
You're kidding?

382
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,903
I mean, this guy is a major pro.

383
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:56,439
If you managed to
beat him, then--

384
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:58,141
-Hey, wait.

385
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:01,177
I think I've seen
you somewhere before.

386
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,812
You're not a pro, are you?

387
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,447
-I only just started as a pro.

388
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:06,449
My name's Shindou.

389
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:07,721
-Ah-ha!

390
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:08,284
Now I've got it!

391
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:10,319
I read about you in Go Weekly!

392
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:11,654
Yeah, I remember.

393
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:13,890
You're one of the new
One-Dans, aren't you?

394
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:16,926
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
What's with this guy?

395
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,794
-Tell me something.

396
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:21,030
I heard you say you
had a deal with Gokiso.

397
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,998
What was it?

398
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:22,965
-The deal was--

399
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,103
-Boards for sale.

400
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,771
Oh, Sensei!

401
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:30,006
I'm sorry.

402
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,908
None of this merchandise is
anywhere near the quality

403
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:34,277
that a man of taste like
yourself would want to buy.

404
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,279
Don't even bother looking.

405
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:37,113
-Genuine kaya?

406
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:38,181
Yeah, right!

407
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,149
And you're charging 200,000?

408
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:41,784
-This is-- well, you see, it's--

409
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:42,952
-What?

410
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:44,120
-I can explain.

411
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:44,887
-Come on, then.

412
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,855
We're waiting.

413
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,957
Explain.

414
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,026
-I put the wrong price tag on.

415
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:50,760
See?

416
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:51,427
Here's the right one.

417
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:52,862
I'll change it right away.

418
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,897
It's a good thing you
brought it to my attention.

419
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,799
Thank you.

420
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:57,400
Sensei?

421
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,001
Is there anything else?

422
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:01,137
-Didn't you already sell
some of those boards today?

423
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,139
-Well, I'd need to check.

424
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:04,907
-I'd like you to bring
me all the receipts

425
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,276
from your transactions,
so I can check them.

426
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,878
Yes good idea.

427
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:09,779
-What?

428
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:11,747
You want to see the receipts?

429
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,715
-Right, then.

430
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:15,751
Now-- this is it?

431
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:18,187
I haven't got a clue what
Shusaku's handwriting's

432
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,422
supposed to look like.

433
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:20,990
So this is--

434
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:21,958
-It's a fake!

435
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:22,892
-A forgery!

436
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:23,793
-How do you know?

437
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:24,727
-I just do.

438
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,795
-No doubt!

439
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:26,662
-Yeah!

440
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:30,132
I'm telling you, it's a fake!

441
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,801
-I'm supposed to take
your word for it?

442
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,669
-Yes.

443
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,304
-Now, about this board--

444
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,973
-Mm-hm.

445
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:40,343
-You must remove the board with
the forged signature at once.

446
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:42,845
then come and see me
privately in my office.

447
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:48,050
-Be he won't be back next year.

448
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,151
Nope.

449
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:54,223
[laughter] Just for the
record, beating Mr. Gokiso

450
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,225
is no big deal.

451
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:57,893
Now, if you had
beaten me, that would

452
00:17:57,927 --> 00:17:59,962
be something to brag about.

453
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,163
Gokiso's over the hill.

454
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:03,165
He's past it.

455
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,166
-Who's he?

456
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,835
-Ask him, Hikaru.

457
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:07,103
HIKARU: Excuse me.

458
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:08,104
What's your name?

459
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:10,740
-Don't you know who I am?

460
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:12,908
Atsushi Kurata,
professional Go player.

461
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:14,076
Soon to be the Meijin.

462
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,112
Or the Honinbo.

463
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:17,913
-Are you that strong
a player, Mr. Kurata?

464
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:22,652
-You betcha.

465
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,387
It's not that hard to
beat the players that

466
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,923
are ranked above you.

467
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:30,293
The ones above me
are all desperate.

468
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:34,030
Even Toya Meijin has
reached his peak.

469
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:36,666
The old man Kuwabara
tries to make everyone

470
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,400
think he's invincible.

471
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,368
But he's desperate, too.

472
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:41,971
All that posturing
of his is a bluff.

473
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:44,807
He'll do anything to hang
on to his Honinbo title.

474
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,910
He'll be debated someday
soon, and if it's not by me,

475
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,881
that'll only be 'cause
Ogata beat me to it.

476
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:54,350
The ones to watch out for
the younger players still

477
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,053
coming up the ranks.

478
00:18:57,086 --> 00:19:00,890
That's why I'm more afraid of
Akira Toya than his father.

479
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,292
The games I play against
those ranked below me

480
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:07,196
will be life and death battles.

481
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,432
But that's still a ways off.

482
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,200
I gotta beat those
above me first.

483
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,969
Then deal with the others.

484
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:16,439
-He seems to be very
confident, doesn't he?

485
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,940
-Hey, what's your
name again, kid?

486
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:18,874
-It's Shindou.

487
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,443
Hikaru Shindou.

488
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:21,777
-Huh.

489
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:23,179
I'm kind of surprised
you never heard of me.

490
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:24,180
Oh, well.

491
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,782
Hey, give me one of those fans.

492
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:28,951
-Huh?

493
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:29,752
-Hm.

494
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:31,420
Take this, my compliments.

495
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,889
-Sorry tobother you, Sensei,
but those fans are for sale.

496
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,424
I'll need you to pay for it.

497
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,258
-Don't be shy.

498
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,760
You can keep the autograph.

499
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:41,163
-Uh-- I don't want
your autograph.

500
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:45,034
-You don't want-- but
everyone wants my autograph.

501
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:46,135
Why don't you?

502
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:47,069
-Give me that.

503
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,671
I'm a professional
too, you know?

504
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,873
I'm signing it.

505
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,068
-Hm?

506
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:55,811
What have you done?

507
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:57,179
You've ruined it, you fool!

508
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:59,448
You've gone and ruined my
precious, beautiful, priceless

509
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:01,283
autograph with your
ugly handwriting!

510
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:05,154
-Uh, your writing isn't exactly
a piece of art, Mr. Kurata.

511
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:06,889
-Oh how true.

512
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:10,092
Unlike Torajiro's.

513
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,762
-Well, if we doesn't want
it, you can have it back.

514
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,163
-Uh, thank you.

515
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:15,664
-You're weird, you know that?

516
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:16,732
Really weird.

517
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,434
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Look who's talking.

518
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:19,969
-Look what time it is!

519
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:22,905
I'm gonna be late for
my teaching games!

520
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:26,308
I gotta go, but I'm
gonna remember your name.

521
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,779
The kid who's an expert on
Honinbo Shusaku's handwriting.

522
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:30,913
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Who, me?

523
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:32,047
An expert.

524
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:33,783
-I still think you're
gonna regret not keeping

525
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:35,418
that fan with my
autograph on it!

526
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,892
HIKARU: Hey, Sai.

527
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:44,360
How you feeling now?

528
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:45,761
-Much better, thank you.

529
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:48,063
Much better.

530
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:50,199
-An expert on
Shusaku's handwriting?

531
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:52,768
He's a strange kid,
that's for sure.

532
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:55,671
[theme music]

533
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,724
SAI: So, Hikaru.

534
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,893
Who is your next
opponent going to be?

535
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,095
HIKARU: It's Toya!

536
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:27,162
-That's great!

537
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:29,064
This is the game you've
been waiting for.

538
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,733
HIKARU: I know
I've gotten better,

539
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,135
but I'm not sure if I've
reached his level yet.

540
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:34,870
SAI: You'll soon find out.

541
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:37,139
It looks like he's ready
to wage war against you.

542
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,280
HIKARU: Next time,
Hikaru Versus Akira.

543
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:45,848
SAI: There'll be
a surprise that's

544
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,250
going to shock the world of Go.
