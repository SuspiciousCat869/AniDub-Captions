-I've always known what
a strong player Ochi is,

00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:56,699

he could beat me.

ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
Thank you, Ochi.

You helped me
refocus on my game.

the very last day.

to call Toya Tudan.

Hold on.

Shindou's playing at right

Did you?

already had six losses.

got seven losses,

Oh, yeah that.

114
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,966
I'll be cheering for
you, but if you slack off

115
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:13,068
in the last few matches,
I'll never forgive you.

116

-When you two first
met, I was worried

119
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:24,546
that you were intimidated,
but now look at you.

AKIRA: I told you,
that move won't work!

You play a move as obvious as
that, and it'll all be over.

That extension combination
you played over here

127
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:41,897
has gone and left
you out of position.

128
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,565
What you should have
done was given him

129
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:46,001
some space, then waited out
to see where he attacked.

130
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:49,471
I told you about how to
play this three days ago.

You're not taking
this seriously!

-I am taking it seriously.

133
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:54,510
What I don't understand
is why you're

134
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:56,445
so obsessed with
me beating Shindou.

135

What's the big deal?

136
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,949
When you showed me that match
he played against the Korean

137
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,118
Insei, I had to admit,
I was pretty surprised.

138
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:04,920
But I've had my
moments of inspiration

139
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:06,989
and played matches like that.

140
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,056
-I seriously doubt it.

141
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,758
I know exactly what
your skill level is,

142
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,993
and you've never
played like that!

143
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:13,095
-I wanna know why you're so
preoccupied with Shindou!

144
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:30,112
-I'll show you a match played
two years ago with no handicap.

145
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:32,948
-The Shusaki diagonal?

146
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:34,783
AKIRA: I was white.

147
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:38,020
-And black?

148
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:39,421
Who was playing black?

149
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:52,134
Whoever it was, their moves
are pretty old fashioned,

150
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:55,537
but besides that, they
seem to be pretty good.

151
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,605
His moves are smart.

152
00:10:56,638 --> 00:10:59,575
They expose the weaknesses
in white's game.

153
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,077
He's a very strong player.

154
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,947
Who is black?

155
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,481
It couldn't be!

156
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,850
-Yes. It's him.

157
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:09,651
-This is Shindou?

158
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:17,926
But that's impossible.

159
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:18,961
I know Shindou!

160
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:20,462
I knew him when he
first became an Insei!

161
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:24,099
I played against him
before in study sessions.

162
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:27,703
-And right here is
where I resigned.

163
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:28,570
-You what?

164
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,905
I don't believe it!

165
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:31,707
This was two years ago?

166
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,642
-I was defeated.

167
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:34,977
-There's no way
Shindou could have

168
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,746
played this game two years ago.

169
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,081
-You're right.

170
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:41,783
That's why I've never shown this
match to anyone before today.

171
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,952
You're the first
person to have seen it.

172
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:45,520
-I don't believe it was him.

173
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:46,822
-I didn't think you would.

174
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:47,823
But I was there.

175
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:48,957
I was the one who
played this match.

176
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:49,925
I know it happened.

177
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,097
-This isn't the Sindou I know.

178
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,531
Who is he?

179
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:58,066
-That's what I want to find out.

180
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:01,536
All right.

181
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:02,404
Let's get back to the game.

182
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:19,336
-I resign.

183
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,103
-Yes!

184
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:21,571
A 3 and 1/2 point win.

185
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:26,343
-That was win number 19, Hikaru.

186
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,054
-Thank you very
much for the game.

187
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:30,407
Yeah

188
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,409
-Huh?

189
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:33,276
-Hm.

190
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,312
That was a very important move.

191
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:37,747
It means the power has now
shifted in black's favor.

192
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,318
-Huh?

193
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:00,670
-I resign.

194
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,111
HONDA: OK, great.

195
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:09,379
I've still only got four losses.

196
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:12,148
Hang in there, and I
might get into a playoff.

197
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:13,249
Five matches to go.

198
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:14,984
I've got a good chance
of making it through.

199
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:16,019
-A playoff?

200
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,120
What's that?

201
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:19,089
-If there's a tie for
third place in the exam,

202
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:21,458
they play another match
to see who goes through.

203
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:22,425
-Oh, I see.

204
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:25,933
-Huh?

205
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:36,506
(VOICEOVER) A playoff.

206
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:38,575
Since I have three
losses, chances

207
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,677
are I'm going to
be in the playoff.

208
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,545
-That move where Honda
played the wedge was

209
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,080
what decided the match.

210
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:46,282
-At first I thought
he'd invaded too deep,

211
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:50,587
but when you look back at
it, it was a great move.

212
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,622
-That one move cost
Isumi eight points.

213
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:54,124
They were already
in the endgame,

214
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:57,527
so there was nowhere else for
him to make up the lost ground.

215
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:58,094
-Hm?

216
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:02,665
-Guess that's it for Isumi now.

217
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:03,967
-That's not it for him!

218
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:04,567
Not yet!

219
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,035
-Oh, yeah?

220
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:07,604
And maybe if you lose one more,
you might be in a playoff.

221
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:10,573
-That's not gonna happen.

222
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:13,343
I'm gonna make it through.

223
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:15,345
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): And so am I.

224
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:16,579
-Five matches left.

225
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:18,648
So close to reaching my goal.

226
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:19,649
I'm almost there.

227
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:32,429
-Congratulations, Ochi.

228
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:34,097
-Well, thank you very much, sir.

229
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,099
-No matter what happens
in your last two matches,

230
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:38,601
this win means you're
guaranteed to pass the test.

231
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:39,969
-Yes.

232
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,704
-I bet you were quite
nervous in your game today.

233
00:15:41,738 --> 00:15:42,972
-No.

234
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:43,506
-No?

235
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,741
Very impressive.

236
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:46,342
I figured you'd
be tense since you

237
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:48,144
were on the verge of passing.

238
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:51,381
-Someone told me if I focus
on achieving a higher goal,

239
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:55,251
passing the pro exam would
just happen naturally.

240
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,220
I was just following
their advice.

241
00:15:57,253 --> 00:16:00,056
-A goal higher than
passing the exam?

242
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,258
What could be more
important than that?

243
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:04,194
-Beating Hikaru Shindou.

244
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:05,395
-Shindou?

245
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,130
But you've already played
him in the study sessions.

246
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:08,565
And you won, didn't you?

247
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:10,233
-Shindou's a
different player now.

248
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:12,368
It's not the same.

249
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:13,603
-I see.

250
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:15,972
Well, I know his progress
has been dramatic recently,

251
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:17,707
but I didn't think he
was that different.

252
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,610
Anyway, well done on
making it through.

253
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:22,212
-Thank you, sir.

254
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:26,082
-And best of luck on
your remaining matches.

255
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,050
-Hey, Ochi.

256
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,052
I hear congratulations
are in order.

257
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:30,220
-You're just saying that.

258
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:31,354
You don't really mean it.

259
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:32,589
-What is it with you?

260
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:35,191
You could have just acted
polite and said thank you.

261
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:36,726
-So, how did you
do in your game?

262
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,261
-Oh, I won.

263
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:39,496
So did the others.

264
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,264
Shindou's on a bit
of a winning streak,

265
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:42,765
holding firm at three losses.

266
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:44,501
Honda and Isumi also won.

267
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:46,369
The front runners
haven't changed.

268
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:49,105
You probably don't care anymore,
now that you're through.

269
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:52,108
-Waya, your next game's
against Shindou, isn't it?

270
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:52,709
-Yeah.

271
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:54,277
I've only got two losses.

272
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,546
If I manage to beat him,
then I'm through as well.

273
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,082
Then you and me can take it
easy and watch everyone else

274
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:00,650
fightin' it out
for the third spot.

275
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:03,119
-What makes you think I'm
going to take it easy?

276
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:05,588
I don't play Shindou
until my very last match.

277
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:06,556
-Huh?

278
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,191
-It's a really
important game for me.

279
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:10,260
In fact, as far
as I'm concerned,

280
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:13,329
it's probably the most important
game of the whole pro exam.

281
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:14,564
-Whoa.

282
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:16,533
I had no idea you considered
Shindou such a big rival.

283
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:17,967
You kept that quiet.

284
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,969
-I want to find out where
he gets his strength from.

285
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:22,105
That mysterious strength!

286
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,606
-Mysterious strength?

287
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,276
-I'm looking forward to
seeing how you do against him.

288
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:27,744
Good luck.

289
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:28,611
-Thanks.

290
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:30,113
See you later, Ochi.

291
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,988
-This is the
Shindou that I know.

292
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:44,527
OCHI (VOICEOVER): I won't know
for sure until I play him,

293
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:46,996
but I'm not gonna
lose Not to him.

294
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,764
Not to Shindou!

295
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,588
WAYA: Yes!

296
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:14,023
I win.

297
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,291
Maybe one more before bed.

298
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,131
Huh?

299
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:25,001
Ah!

300
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:26,035
Sai?

301
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:26,970
No way!

302
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,104
He's online now?

303
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:30,073
He hasn't been on here
since last summer!

304
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:40,583
Hm?

305
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:42,552
Huh?

306
00:18:42,585 --> 00:18:52,629
Ah-- Ah!

307
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:58,534
Ah-- Ah!

308
00:18:58,568 --> 00:18:59,135
Ah!

309
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:07,443
Grr!

310
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:08,277
What?

311
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:09,112
You're not Sai!

312
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:10,146
You can't play Go!

313
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,114
You're an impostor!

314
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:13,249
Sai was a legend online!

315
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:15,151
How dare you use his name?

316
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:22,659
I remember.

317
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:25,194
I once thought Shindou must
have been taking lessons

318
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:26,162
from Sai, or something.

319
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,500
-Zelda.

320
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:34,003
Of course you reply by
saying you're an Insei.

321
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:35,304
I can't believe you were Zelda!

322
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:42,612
-How do you know about
my chat with Sai?

323
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:45,081
It couldn't be.

324
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:49,652
Shindou-- could he be Sai?

325
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:50,486
No way.

326
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,589
Never in a million years.

327
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:56,025
He's got some
mysterious strength?

328
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,527
I don't think so.

329
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,529
I'm gonna beat him
and pass the exam.

330
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,376
-Two matches left.

331
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:14,677
-Yes.

332
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:17,313
-And next on the list is Waya.

333
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,982
I was just thinking,
remember all that stuff

334
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:21,751
he said to me after
I finally managed

335
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:23,753
to make it up into the A league?

336
00:20:23,986 --> 00:20:26,222
-Yes, of course I remember.

337
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:28,658
-You played a good
game, Shindou.

338
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:32,462
A lot of really great moves.

339
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:35,264
I think you're gonna
be a strong player.

340
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:36,733
Maybe even as strong as Sai.

341
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:46,109
-When Waya said that, he
inspired me to try even harder.

342
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:47,477
-That's probably true.

343
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,412
-I'm gonna win.

344
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:53,349
He'll find out just
how strong I am!

345
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:55,585

346
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:24,607
HIKARU: Two matches left,
and the one against Waya's

347
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,643
gonna be a big one for me!

348
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:31,247
SAI: He's well prepared
for this match.

349
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,617
HIKARU: We both need the win
if we're gonna make it through.

350
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,752
SAI: Just be careful not
to let the pressure affect

351
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,154
your game, Hikaru.

352
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:41,224
You know what you can be like.

353
00:22:41,257 --> 00:22:45,127
HIKARU: Next time,
Hikaru Versus Waya.

354
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:48,431
SAI: It will come down
to one decisive move.
