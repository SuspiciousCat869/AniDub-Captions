[theme music]

2
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,978
-Seems you're coding
isn't very precise.

3
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,847
Next time, try and end in a tie.

4
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:55,951
I want you to intentionally
end the game in a draw.

5
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:56,985
-Intentionally?

6
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:58,353
-What's this I hear
about you playing

7
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:00,422
four boards simultaneously
this morning?

8
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:01,056
-It was nothing.

9
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:01,690
-Nothing?

10
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:02,958
Yeah right!

11
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:03,992
-Uh.

12
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:05,694
-There's no reason
for you to be wasting

13
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:08,330
your talents in a
place like this!

14
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:10,465
Has something been
bothering you recently?

15
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,533
-No, not really.

16
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,734
I'm fine, thanks.

17
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:13,468
-Relax.

18
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,703
It's not a huge deal.

19
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:17,439
It's not like you've got someone
chasing after you, is it?

20
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,440
-Maybe.

21
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:20,709
Now he's passed the
pro exam prelims.

22
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,611
You're one point away
from a draw on my board.

23
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:24,980
-Just one point?

24
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,915
WOMAN: I know he only
missed out by one point,

25
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:29,851
but he did manage to draw
on the other three boards.

26
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:31,586
Isn't that good enough?

27
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,421
-Plenty good enough, I'd say.

28
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,090
In all my years
running this place,

29
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,758
I've never seen
anyone improve as much

30
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,569
as this kid has, and he's done
it right in front of our eyes.

31
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:52,941
-Whoa.

32
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,809
You tied all four?

33
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:55,677
-Hikaru.

34
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,978
That's not quite
true now, is it?

35
00:02:56,978 --> 00:02:59,447
-Well, actually there
were only three ties,

36
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:00,715
but the fourth was close.

37
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:01,483
-That's better.

38
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:02,450
Thank you.

39
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:03,651
-You guys should've
seen the game.

40
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,620
It was really awesome!

41
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,355
After I tied against
one, I took on two.

42
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,824
Then after that, I played three,
and it got harder and harder

43
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:10,592
each time!

44
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:11,059
-That's right!

45
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:11,760
That's right!

46
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:12,994
Then it was four!

47
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:13,828
Ooh.

48
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:15,096
I wish it could've been me.

49
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,399
If it had been me, I wouldn't
have stopped at four platers.

50
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:18,566
Oh no.

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,901
I'd have gone on to play
five or even 10 opponents!

52
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,403
In fact--

53
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:23,038
-Anyway, the point is, I've
been playing a lot of matches

54
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:25,907
during the summer break, so
my game's gotten stronger.

55
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,976
-Aren't we confident?

56
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,612
-Asumi, Are we gonna go
to another Go salon today?

57
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:34,049
-Mm-hm, I'd forgotten all
about it 'til yesterday,

58
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:37,752
but I think we should
check this place out.

59
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:39,087
-Hm?

60
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,890
I was given the map at
a Go salon a while back.

61
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:44,492
A recommendation from the
guy I was playing against.

62
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:46,694
-Oh yeah, I remember.

63
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:47,662
-Hey guys.

64
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,330
Maybe you should
try out this place.

65
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,900
You'll find stronger
opponents there.

66
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,535
-Think it'll be OK?

67
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,804
How do we know it's
not a complete dive?

68
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:58,706
-I know he looked scary, but
he seemed like a nice guy

69
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,574
underneath.

70
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:00,375
It's fine.

71
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,443
-Sounds good to me.

72
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:02,377
Let's go!

73
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,513
I wanna meet some
strong players.

74
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:09,451
-He's like a completely
different person.

75
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:12,020
-I wonder what kind of opponents
will be awaiting us today,

76
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,388
Hikaru.

77
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,556
-Yeah, I can't wait!

78
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:31,406
HIKARU: Look, uh, there it is.

79
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,574
-OK, let's go ahead.

80
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:33,975
-Hey, I want to grab a drink.

81
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:34,843
Will you wait for me?

82
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,415
-(VOICEOVER) That sign.

83
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,549
It's written in--

84
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:45,487
-Is that everything?

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,622
That comes to 147 yen.

86
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,495
Thanks.

87
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:54,329
Have a nice day.

88
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:04,200
-Hm?

89
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,375
Hey, see what you did?

90
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:08,510
Aren't you gonna pick it up?

91
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,080
Gotta do everything.

92
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,452
Hey, didn't you hear me?

93
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,653
-Huh?

94
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,088
-Don't you walk away from me.

95
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,422
I was talking to you!

96
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:32,000
Why you--

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,101
-Hikaru.

98
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,403
He must have his reasons
for not wanting to talk,

99
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,571
so let's leave him alone.

100
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:37,839
-But he shoved my arm!

101
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:39,807
WAYA: Hey, Shindou!

102
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,409
What's taking so long?

103
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,044
We've been waiting for you.

104
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,512
-Nothing.

105
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:46,714
-Then hurry up.

106
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,816
-I can't believe that guy.

107
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,519
WAYA: What were you doing
in here all that time?

108
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:53,521
-Hmph!

109
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:56,624
WAYA: I was only asking.

110
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:57,859
-What happened?

111
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:00,428
-Nothing, OK?

112
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:01,796
Let's see what
this place is like.

113
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,039
Hm.

114
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:11,639
Huh?

115
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:16,444
Uh, we, uh--

116
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:17,979
-What's the matter, Shindou?

117
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:18,580
-Hm?

118
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,137
-Oh?

119
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,091
-Isumi, is this the--

120
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:31,025
-Mm-hm.

121
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,860
But most of the
customers in here

122
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,495
don't look like
they're Japanese.

123
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,497
-(KOREAN ACCENT) Please,
don't just stand there.

124
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:37,932
Come on in.

125
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:38,800
-Uh, sure.

126
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,400
OK.

127
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:46,808
[speaking korean]

128
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:47,709
-You again!

129
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:51,980
[speaking korean]

130
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:58,686
-Do you know what
language they're speaking?

131
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,355
-I think it's Korean.

132
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:01,623
-Korean?

133
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:04,325
I guess that explains why no
one in here looks Japanese.

134
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,627
-Yeah.

135
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,462
And that's probably why the
old guy recommended this salon

136
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:08,796
in the first place.

137
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,098
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Now I get it.

138
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:11,799
He didn't answer me
because he didn't

139
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,836
understand what I was saying.

140
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,537
-Is there a problem here?

141
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:17,438
-Huh?

142
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,306
Oh, oh no.

143
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,707
Don't worry about it.

144
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:20,975
Sorry about earlier.

145
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,944
I shouldn't have shouted at
you in the store like that.

146
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:29,717
-Su-yeong, this boy is
offering you an apology.

147
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:33,021
You should say something to him.

148
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:36,758
-This is the first time I've
seen a boy inside a Japan Go salon.

149
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,892
I thought Go became
extinct here,

150
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:41,496
only played by old people.

151
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:42,563
-Now, don't be like that.

152
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:44,599
Why don't you give them a game?

153
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:47,468
Let me introduce you to him.

154
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,538
This is my 12-year-old
nephew Su-yeong Hong.

155
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,740
He's from Korea, but
he's visiting us here

156
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:55,076
in Japan for a while.

157
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,644
-Is he a Go player, sir?

158
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:57,745
-Yes.

159
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,014
Su-yeong has plans to
become a pro in Korea.

160
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:00,648
-Wow.

161
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:01,816
A pro, huh?

162
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,053
-So, he's an Insei from
the Koreon Go association.

163
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:07,355
-Hey, the three of
us are Insei as well.

164
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:08,022
-Really?

165
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:10,591
You must be good players then.

166
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,026
-They're Insei?

167
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,495
[speaking korean]

168
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:21,436
-Professionals?

169
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:23,738
-So, he wants to be a pro.

170
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:27,575
-He's following the same
path as you, Hikaru.

171
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,810
-Well, well.

172
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,845
Japanese Insei, you say?

173
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,580
Could be very interesting.

174
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,749
Why doesn't Su-yeong
have a game with them.

175
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:37,385
Hey Isumi, Is the
Korean Go association

176
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:38,619
like the one we have here?

177
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:40,421
-Yeah.

178
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:42,090
-I never knew Korea
had pro players.

179
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:43,391
Wow.

180
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:45,093
-Shindou!

181
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:48,796
-That's cool, but are the
players in Korea any good?

182
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,632
[angry stammering]

183
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:56,671
-He's got to be kidding.

184
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,806
He's never heard of Korean pros?

185
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,641
Just 'cause you're
a Japanese Insei,

186
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:03,444
I bet you think Japan's the
best in the world at Go.

187
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:05,313
You think Korean
players aren't good?

188
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:07,548
Well, I'm not gonna
stand for it anymore.

189
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:09,484
-Um, what's he talking about?

190
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:12,620
-He's probably angry because
of the dump things you said.

191
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,522
-Shindou, maybe you
should apologize.

192
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,657
-The days of Japan
leading the world of Go

193
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:18,426
ended a long time ago.

194
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,361
I thought everyone knew that!

195
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:22,563
-How would I know
other countries played.

196
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:24,732
I hardly know anything
about the game in Japan.

197
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:25,533
-OK, Shindou.

198
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,968
Enough!

199
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:30,571
-Korean players,
especially Korean Insei,

200
00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:33,541
aren't soft like
you Japanese Insei.

201
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,308
-What?

202
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,844
You think we're soft.

203
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:40,681
-Compared to Koreans, the level
of the Japanese Insei is--

204
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:41,449
-Is what?

205
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:48,356
Why don't you play me?

206
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:49,590
Then we'll see who's soft.

207
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,427
-Hmph.

208
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:52,960
-Shindou.

209
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:53,928
Calm down.

210
00:09:58,866 --> 00:09:59,467
-Su-yeong.

211
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,578
-Hm.

212
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,613
Three wins, two losses.

213
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:25,849
But one of those wins
was thanks to a bye.

214
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:27,985
Ogata Nine Dan
and and young Toya

215
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:30,187
seemed to take such
an interest in him.

216
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,189
But could he be the one?

217
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:33,757
-What are you talking about?

218
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,692
-Hm?

219
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:36,961
Oh, the prelims
for the pro exam.

220
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:38,829
-Checking up on the
progress of that kid.

221
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:39,830
-Hm.

222
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:40,965
Maybe he's just taking
his time getting

223
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:42,099
into the swing of things.

224
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:43,567
-Speaking of young players.

225
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,004
Have you seen how well the
Koreans have been doing lately?

226
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,539
You should take a look at this.

227
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:50,674
The Japan-Korea Shine.

228
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,842
-Yeah.

229
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:54,612
Things are starting to
look a bit bleak for Japan.

230
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:56,213
China's doing well though.

231
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,788
Says here we lost in
straight matches against them

232
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:00,356
in the Shine tournament.

233
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,091
-At least Toya-sensei
gave us something

234
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:04,227
to cheer about when he
won his game against China

235
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:05,728
in the Tengen tournament.

236
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:08,197
-We were so close to beating
Korea and in playoffs.

237
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:10,900
Just when it looked like
Kaja-sensei was about to win,

238
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:13,669
Korea came out of nowhere
and turned the tables.

239
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:15,872
-The Korean players have
become a major force

240
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:17,073
in recent tournaments.

241
00:11:17,073 --> 00:11:19,675
-Here's the photos
you wanted, Mr. Amano.

242
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:20,943
What's with the long faces?

243
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:23,079
You can't allow yourselves
to get all depressed just

244
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:24,881
'cause some of our
guys aren't playing up

245
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:26,182
to their usual standard.

246
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,784
You remember how Miss Kinochi
won the women's tournament

247
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:29,986
against China.

248
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:31,320
And don't tell me
you've forgotten

249
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:33,689
Kurata-sensei's
performance against Korea

250
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:35,291
in last year's tournament?

251
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:38,327
No, I haven't forgotten,
but that was last year.

252
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:42,298
This year, Japan seems to be
struggling to find its form.

253
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:46,135
-Well, yeah, I guess
that's true at the moment.

254
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:48,804
-We badly need to get some
new blood into the game.

255
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,740
Otherwise, the future
doesn't look to bright.

256
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:51,941
-Yeah, I agree.

257
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:55,244
We need a new
generation of players.

258
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,748
A new wave of talent to
follow Kurata Six Dan.

259
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,249
Hikaru Shindou.

260
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:04,387
Will he turn out to be the one?

261
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,225
A Go player as good as
Toya, respected by everyone?

262
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:10,726
-You wanna see who's soft?

263
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,031
You can play me and
find out who's soft.

264
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:17,300
I'd learn more from playing
customers in this Go salon

265
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,802
than from playing
a kid like you.

266
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:21,170
Hmph!

267
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:23,205
-So he says he'll learn
more from playing someone

268
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:25,174
like me than from
someone like you.

269
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:28,344
In that case, let me have a
seat and play against him.

270
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:29,245
-Hey, wait a minute.

271
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:30,746
How do you know how good I am?

272
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,949
You haven't even played me yet.

273
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:35,084
-Why are you always
shouting at me?

274
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:37,019
-You afraid you're gonna
lose if you play me?

275
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:39,789
Is that it?

276
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:40,690
-Listen, kid.

277
00:12:40,723 --> 00:12:42,425
You've gone too far.

278
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,093
Play him, Su-yeong.

279
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:48,364
show him what playing Go
in Korea is all about.

280
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:48,931
-Whatever.

281
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:57,406
OK.

282
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,042
The game is ready.

283
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:03,079
Sit down and I'll play a
teaching game with you.

284
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,013
-A teaching game?

285
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:12,888
-Su-yeong!

286
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:13,661
-Shindou, no!

287
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,134
-I'm not playing
any teaching game!

288
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,280
-What?

289
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,880
-Oh!

290
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,787
-Hikaru!

291
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,756
-Shindou.

292
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,757
-Pick a color!

293
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,762
-Way to go, guys.

294
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,030
-Waya!

295
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,231
-This is gonna be fun.

296
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:56,001
It's Korea versus Japan.

297
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,504
-Can you see what's
happening over there?

298
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,207
-Su-yeong's about to play an
even match with the new kid.

299
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,842
-Shindou's gonna
be playing white.

300
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,509
-Come on, Shindou.

301
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,244
You're playing for Japan now!

302
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,012
-You're no match for me.

303
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,815
I'm one of the top
Insei in all of Korea,

304
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,884
where the competition
is really tough.

305
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,023
-Who's that kid
Su-yeong's playing?

306
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,759
-He's an Insei from the
Japanese Go association.

307
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,161
-I know I'm a strong player.

308
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,265
There's no way I could lose
to an Insei from Japan.

309
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,001
He didn't know we
played Go in Korea?

310
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,837
Well, he's about to find out.

311
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,173
-It's the international
battle of the Insei.

312
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,841
-This could be interesting.

313
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,910
-Not something
you see every day.

314
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,111
-You can do it, Su-yeong.

315
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:42,848
Show the Japanese kid
how Go is really played!

316
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,150
-Everyone wants
to watch the game.

317
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,451
It's like we're surrounded.

318
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,920
-Yeha, like when you find
yourself cheering for the away

319
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,422
team in a stadium
full of home fans?

320
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,992
-Even though we're
the ones at home.

321
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,927
-I'll show you how strong i am.

322
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,096
You'd better prepare
yourself for a shock.

323
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,466
'Cause once I've
finished with you--

324
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,135
you're gonna hang
your head in shame!

325
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:08,407
[cheering]

326
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,009
-Come on, Su-yeong!

327
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:10,787
-Let's go.

328
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:33,949
-He is good.

329
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:35,650
Just what you'd expect
from a Korean Insei.

330
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,185
-Yeah, but look at Shindou.

331
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:39,788
He seems to be holding his own.

332
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:42,023
-Hm.

333
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:44,192
Excuse me.

334
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:46,328
You don't happen to know
what level Su-yeong plays

335
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,997
at as an Insei in Korea, do you?

336
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,833
-Back home, the Insei
classes go from 1 to 10.

337
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,069
10 students in each class.

338
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:55,937
Every month, the four
lowest ranked students

339
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:58,406
go down a level, and the four
highest ranked go up a level.

340
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:04,279
Su-yeong managed
to advance straight

341
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:06,715
up through all 10 levels.

342
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,650
Everyone who knows
him feels sure he

343
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,886
has what it takes to become
a professional player.

344
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:16,191
-(VOICEOVER) So he's
one of the best.

345
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:24,933
-Yes, but nobody is perfect.

346
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,550
-Hm?

347
00:16:35,514 --> 00:16:36,781
-Huh?

348
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:41,520
MAN: One day, for the first
time, he dropped down a class.

349
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:44,689
Unfortunately, he allowed this
setback to affect his game,

350
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:47,392
and the following month, he
dropped down another class.

351
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:56,434
The pro examination took
place earlier this month,

352
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:59,304
but, as you might have
guessed, he failed.

353
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:02,140
Su-yeong's father thought that
a break might be good for him,

354
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,543
so he decided to send him
to stay with me for a while.

355
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:10,148
How do your Insei classes work?

356
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:11,416
-We only have two levels.

357
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,184
We're at the top
of the A league.

358
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:14,152
-Ah, good.

359
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:16,187
-You can't compare the two.

360
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:18,123
In Korea, there's way
more kids training

361
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:19,991
to become pros than
there are in Japan.

362
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:23,295
Japan's Insei are nowhere near
as good as the Korean ones.

363
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:24,129
He's right.

364
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:25,130
-And take it from us.

365
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:27,098
Su-yeong's one of
the best there is.

366
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:29,668
-(VOICEOVER) I know that Korean
pros are supposed to be strong,

367
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:33,038
but I don't need to be
reminded of it all the time.

368
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:34,606
Come on, Shindou.

369
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:35,740
Show him what we're made of.

370
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:53,258
-(VOICEOVER) It's obvious
Su-yeong's no ordinary kid,

371
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:55,093
but given his current
state of mind,

372
00:17:55,126 --> 00:18:00,031
is he really up to
beating this other boy?

373
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:01,566
It's no longer a
matter of skill.

374
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:16,114
BOY: I heard Su-yeong
dropped down a class.

375
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:17,549
-First time ever, right?

376
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:20,318
-Maybe that's why he's been
in such a bad mood lately.

377
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,194
-Hey, Su-yeong.

378
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:30,462
You shouldn't give up so easily.

379
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:32,998
-This game is so pointless.

380
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:34,299
I don't feel like
playing anymore.

381
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:41,539
Why am I letting this get to me?

382
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:42,540
Whatever.

383
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:43,708
It doesn't matter anymore.

384
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:50,382
It seems like whenever
I feel this way, I lose.

385
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:51,416
Ugh!

386
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:54,386
This is no fun at all!

387
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,389
-Su-yeong dropped down
another class this month.

388
00:18:57,389 --> 00:18:59,591
-I wonder if he's gonna drop
right down to the bottom.

389
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:09,000
-You're starting to
make a mess of things.

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,201
-Shut up!

391
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:12,113
-Su-yeong!

392
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:20,430
SU-YEONG (VOICEOVER): I lose, I
go down a level, I lose again.

393
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:24,661
I don't care anymore.

394
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:25,628
I should quit.

395
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:30,033
This is annoying.

396
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:32,402
It's like I've
forgotten how to win.

397
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:38,875
Argh!

398
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:54,457
What am I doing?

399
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:00,759
Huh?

400
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,804
I can't let my guard
down for a single minute.

401
00:20:07,837 --> 00:20:10,507
This guy's stronger
than I thought.

402
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:16,980
If I lose, then that's it.

403
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:20,416
It's all over for me.

404
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,684
-Hey, you!

405
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:22,952
-Huh?

406
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:24,687
-You're gonna have
to tell me what

407
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:27,991
your name is if I
don't win this game.

408
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:28,591
-Huh?

409
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:32,265
-Oh yeah?

410
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,668
You're gonna remember
my name, all right.

411
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,569
-All right, Shindou.

412
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:37,504
-(VOICEOVER) Su-yeong.

413
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,512
SAI: At last, he's looking
forward to a real challenge.

414
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,781
Exactly what he needs.

415
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,917
Let's make him
remember your name.

416
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,919
The name of Hikaru Shindou.

417
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:55,855
[theme music]

418
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,252
SAI: Who would've thought
that a silly misunderstanding

419
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:27,754
in a store could have
ended up like this!

420
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:30,157
They've been playing
some amazing Go!

421
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:32,626
HIKARU: I know I
can beat this guy.

422
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:34,862
SAI: That move will
have everyone fooled.

423
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,096
HIKARU: That's what I'm hoping.

424
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:42,336
SAI: He doesn't look
to happy about it.

425
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:43,637
HIKARU: Next time.

426
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,772
My Name Is!

427
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:48,742
SAI: He'll never forget
your name, Hikaru.
