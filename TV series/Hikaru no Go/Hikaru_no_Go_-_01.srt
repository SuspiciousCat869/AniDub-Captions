1
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:12,145
-Who, who's there?

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,048
-That's, that isn't
the best move.

3
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,651
It's not even a good move.

4
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,586

[raindrops]

6
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,762
-Oh, Akari.

7
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,497
My grandpa's place
is just up ahead.

8
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,601
-Hikaru, I told you we should
have gone straight home.

9
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,505
-Grandpa, Grandpa,
we're coming in.

10
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:23,210
-Are you sure this is OK?

11
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,077
-Oh, yeah.

12
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,513
This place is just full of junk.

13
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,382
-Let's get out of here, Hikaru.

14
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,283
This place is creepy.

15
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,090
Should you be touching that?

16
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,159
-Well, my parents
cut off my allowance

17
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:43,397
after I got only eight points
on a social studies test.

18
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,066
Hey, maybe this is
worth something.

19
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,509
-Hey, check it out.

20
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,011
It's a five in a
row board, right?

21
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,514
-An old Go board.

22
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,582
I wonder if my grandpa
used to play on this?

23
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,352
Oh, I bet we could
get a lot for it.

24
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,220
-You sure this is OK?

25
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,422
-Don't worry.

26
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,091
I bet Grandpa's forgotten
all about this old board.

27
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,193
I'll just brush the dirt
off and shine it up a bit.

28
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,167
Good as new.

29
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,131
That's funny.

30
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,599
This stain here
isn't coming off.

31
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,035
-Uh, what are you talking about?

32
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,403
What stain?

33
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,672
-This one.

34
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,207
-Show me.

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,974
-Right here.

36
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,342
-Huh?

37
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,644
There's nothing there.

38
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,511
Look.

39
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,447
-It's right here.

40
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,015
-You can see it.

41
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,117
-That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

42
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,520
-You can hear me?

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,256
You can really hear
what I'm saying.

44
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,727
-I don't see a stain.

45
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,262
-Who, who's there?

46
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,263
-Stop it, Hikaru.

47
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,431
You're scaring me.

48
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,666
-At last.

49
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,735
I have found the one.

50
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,971
-Grandpa, is that you?

51
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,739
-I'm going home.

52
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:08,081
-To the gods I
offer my gratitude.

53
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:16,056
For once again, I can
finally, I can finally

54
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,657
return to this world.

55
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:31,972
[thud]

56
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,373
-Hikaru, what's wrong?

57
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,341
Hikaru?

58
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:38,245
Help, something's
wrong with Hikaru.

59
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,113
-Who are you?

60
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,283
-I am Fujiwara-no-Sai.

61
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,051
-Sai, what are you?

62
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:48,622
-During the Heian period, I held
a position as a Go instructor

63
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,257
to the emperor in the capital.

64
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,027
It was such a happy
time for me, to be

65
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,764
able to play Go every day.

66
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,333
One day, the other instructor
approached the emperor

67
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,968
with a suggestion.

68
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:07,374
He said, sir, I believe you only
have need for one instructor.

69
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,376
Please allow the two
of us to play a game

70
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,446
to decide who shall
keep their position.

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,981
-Oh, OK.

72
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,583
So you played a game, right?

73
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,184
Who won?

74
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,989
-The game was dead even.

75
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,193
Everyone's attention was
focused on the board.

76
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,596
It was only by mere
chance that I saw it.

77
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,532
There was a white
stone in his Go bowl.

78
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,634
He waited for an
opportune moment,

79
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,004
and then he slipped the
stone in with his prisoners.

80
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,273
-You mean he cheated?

81
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:45,979
-And then, just as I was
about to protest, was that?

82
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,214
-Scoundrel.

83
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,649
Just now, I saw you take a
black stone from your bowl

84
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,685
and place it among
your prisoners.

85
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,053
-What?

86
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,088
But I just saw you
do the same thing

87
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,057
with a white stone
from your bowl?

88
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,359
-What a pitiful
attempt at an excuse.

89
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,661
While all eyes were
fixed on the board,

90
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,397
you shamelessly took one
of my stones from your bowl

91
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,200
and placed it among
your prisoners.

92
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,568
-No, you are the
one who did that.

93
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:09,736
-Silence.

94
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,671
That's enough.

95
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,341
I refuse to believe that
two members of my court

96
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,044
would commit such a discourteous
offense within my presence.

97
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,346
Now, on with the game.

98
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:26,519
-Unable to calm myself with
this disturbing turn of events,

99
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,455
I lost the game.

100
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,660
I was banished from the capital.

101
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,665
My reputation tarnished by
the allegation of treachery.

102
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,469
I had no other skills,
no way to make a living.

103
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:55,282
Two days later, I cast
myself into the river.

104
00:06:55,315 --> 00:07:00,253
Unable to find peace, my soul
was trapped within a Go board.

105
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,026
It seemed like an
eternity, until one day

106
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,329
on the island of Enoshima
in the Setto Sea.

107
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,431
I heard a child's voice.

108
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,734
His name was Torajirou.

109
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,237
Sweet child, if
you are able to see

110
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,206
the stains of my wretched
tears, then perhaps you

111
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,009
have some small space
within your soul

112
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,246
in which to house my own.

113
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,348
Torajirou was an
aspiring Go player.

114
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,751
And by the age of 20, he
had surpassed his teacher.

115
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:36,189
He became known as
Honinbou Shusaku the 14th.

116
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,658
Honinbou Shusaku?

117
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,395
-But Torajirou fell
victim to an epidemic.

118
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:48,568
And one night in his
34th year, his time came.

119
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,138
-So those must've been his
blood stains on the Go board.

120
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,307
Does this mean you appeared
to me because you still

121
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,275
want to play Go?

122
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:05,618
-Yes, for I have yet to
play the Divine Move.

123
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,635
-Hey, Hikaru, I heard you rode
in an ambulance yesterday.

124
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,237
-Hmm?

125
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,205
Yeah.

126
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,206
-Uh, Hikaru?

127
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,479
-Hikaru, are you
feeling all right?

128
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,680
What happened to you yesterday?

129
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,583
-You know, I'm not really sure.

130
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,152
When I woke up, it
was already morning.

131
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,555
-Pass them to the
person behind you.

132
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,524
All right, then.

133
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,126
Begin.

134
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:46,568
-Uh.

135
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,432
-Ooh, a history test.

136
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,634
-You, again?

137
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,070
-Is everything all right?

138
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,974
-Uh, I, yeah, sorry.

139
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,410
-Then, please sit down and
continue with the test.

140
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,377
-Yes, ma'am.

141
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,113
So yesterday wasn't a dream.

142
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,581
-'Twas no dream.

143
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,116
-And what's your name, again?

144
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,618
-It's Sai.

145
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,119
-You really love Go, don't ya?

146
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,187
-Oh, yes.

147
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,556
-And you really want
to play Go, don't ya?

148
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,323
-Yes.

149
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,425
-Too bad.

150
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,427
I don't think I'm ever
going to play the game.

151
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,529
-Ahh.

152
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,129
-Ugh.

153
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,466
-What's wrong?

154
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,233
-Is he all right?

155
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,307
-What did you do to me?

156
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,108
-Nothing.

157
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,544
I, I didn't do anything.

158
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,746
-Hikaru, are you OK?

159
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,247
-I'm worried, Hikaru.

160
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,649
Do you want to see
the school nurse?

161
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,584
-I think I'm OK now.

162
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,253
-You must have felt
my intense sorrow

163
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:51,391
at the thought of not being
able to play Go again.

164
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,993
-Man, a thousand years
of disappointment

165
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:54,761
is hard on the stomach.

166
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:05,105
Couldn't you, ya know,
go bother someone else?

167
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,041
-Probably not.

168
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:10,116
-Uh.

169
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,348
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to play once in a while.

170
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,249
-Huh?

171
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,152
-But my head belongs to me.

172
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,555
And don't talk to me unless
I talk to you first, agreed?

173
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:23,156
-Agreed.

174
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:34,167
-Oh, what was his name, again?

175
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,668
-10 more minutes.

176
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,403
If you're finished,
you can go back

177
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,473
and double-check your work.

178
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,243
-Oh, I can't remember.

179
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,679
Hey, Sai, you know anything
about the Tempo reform?

180
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,215
-Tempo, the one started
by counselor Mizuno?

181
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,049
-Huh?

182
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,317
-Yeah, that's the guy.

183
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,385
-I remember him well.

184
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,387
We played a game of
Go at the castle once.

185
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,121
A fascinating--

186
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,289
-OK, that's enough.

187
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,991
You know anything about Perry?

188
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,125
-Perry?

189
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,461
-Perry, the guy with the
black ships and stuff.

190
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,730
-Ah, you mean, Commodore Perry.

191
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,597
-That's the one.

192
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,499
Which bay did Perry sail into?

193
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,600
-Uraga Bay.

194
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,170
He certainly caused
quite an uproar.

195
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:10,670
-Uraga.

196
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,138
Hey, Sai?

197
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,106
-Yes?

198
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,074
-You can pretty
useful sometimes.

199
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,544
-What are you mumbling
to yourself about?

200
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:18,978
Are you finished?

201
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,380
-Almost.

202
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,381
-Well, keep at it.

203
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,552
-How rude.

204
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,053
Your teacher walked
right through me

205
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,290
without even an excuse
me or I beg your pardon.

206
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,525
Hikaru, there seems to
be a lack of etiquette

207
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,993
in this modern world.

208
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,095
-Yeah, yeah, just stop making
such a racquet in my head.

209
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,997
Once we're done here,
I'll take you somewhere

210
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,265
where you can play Go, OK?

211
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,995
-Oh, there certainly
are a lot of people

212
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,296
in this city of yours.

213
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,133
-Yeah, Tokyo's a
pretty big place.

214
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,935
-So, tell me, where are
we going to be playing Go?

215
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:01,670
-At a Go salon.

216
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,538
-Really?

217
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:03,806
-My grandpa goes
there sometimes.

218
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,743
He says it's a place where
old guys who like Go hang out.

219
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:12,281
-So people still enjoy Go as
much as they did in my time.

220
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,249
-Hello, there.

221
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:14,750
Welcome.

222
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:15,766
-Hmm.

223
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,990
Gee, it's like a
nursing home in here.

224
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:23,526
-Is this your first time here?

225
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,629
-Yeah, everything in
this place is new to me.

226
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,830
Can anybody play?

227
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:28,864
-Certainly.

228
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:30,566
Just write your name
down here, please.

229
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,768
Uh, what's your skill level?

230
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:35,037
-Skill level?

231
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,939
I'm not too sure.

232
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,040
-Oh?

233
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:39,842
-See, I've never really
played anyone before.

234
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,177
But I think I'm pretty good.

235
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,045
Hey, there's a kid over there.

236
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:44,680
Can I play him?

237
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,950
-I know he's your age, but--

238
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,059
-Are you looking for
someone to play against?

239
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:57,726
-Yeah.

240
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,194
-Come on.

241
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,195
I'll play you.

242
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:01,697
-But this boy's never--

243
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,165
-Follow me.

244
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,066
-OK.

245
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:04,800
-Wait a minute.

246
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:05,801
There's an entrance fee.

247
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,069
-Huh?

248
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,604
A fee?

249
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:10,573
-Oh, this is his
first time here.

250
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,942
How about letting
him in for free?

251
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:14,810
-Well, sure Akira.

252
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,544
Whatever you say.

253
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,786
-By the way, I'm Akira Toya.

254
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:24,787
What's your name?

255
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:25,921
-Hikaru Shindo.

256
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:27,056
I'm in the sixth grade.

257
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,791
-I'm in the sixth grade, too.

258
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,259
-This is a lot
better than playing

259
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,194
against one of those old guys.

260
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:33,762
-What's your skill level?

261
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:34,563
-Don't know.

262
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:36,599
Don't have a single clue.

263
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:40,069
I think I'm going to be pretty
good at this game, though.

264
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,838
-You don't know, but you
think you're pretty good.

265
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:47,209
Well, why don't you put down
four or five stones for now.

266
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:48,711
-Put down stones.

267
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,578
A handicap?

268
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:50,980
Well, I don't need one.

269
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:53,215
You and I are
about the same age.

270
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,551
-No handicap against Akira Toya?

271
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,621
Who does that kid think he is?

272
00:13:58,654 --> 00:13:59,221
-All right, then.

273
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,923
You go first.

274
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,224
-I hope you don't mind.

275
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,626
I'm kind of a slow player.

276
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:19,742
[crying]

277
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,811
-Sai, are those tears of joy?

278
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:24,947
Oh, I guess I can't blame you.

279
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:30,052
Not being able to play the
game you love for 140 years.

280
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,854
-Very well, Hikaru.

281
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:33,289
Let us play.

282
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:34,690
-Yes.

283
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:35,991
-3, 4 in the upper right.

284
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,694
17 across and 4 down.

285
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:43,666
-17, 1, 2, 3, 4.

286
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:45,067
-Huh?

287
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,636
The way he holds his stones,
he must be a beginner.

288
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,109
-3, 4, in the lower right.

289
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,245
16, 17.

290
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:59,882
-16, 17, this must be it.

291
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:04,186
-3, 16.

292
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:05,521
-3, 16.

293
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,962
-16, 5.

294
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,198
-16, 5.

295
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:16,999
-A diagonal.

296
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:22,938
-14, 4.

297
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,173
-14, 4.

298
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,194
-He holds his stones
like a beginner.

299
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:48,897
But he's making
good solid moves.

300
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:50,632
He is pretty good.

301
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,633
-Well, what's the matter?

302
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,235
Isn't it your move?

303
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:53,936
-Oh, sorry.

304
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,282
-The shape of his
joseki appears outdated.

305
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:09,251
And why does his hand
keep stopping and starting

306
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:11,186
over the board?

307
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,590
-Um, 14, 11.

308
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,058
Ah, here it is.

309
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,876
-He's not intimidated
by my attacks at all.

310
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,678
In fact, he's
countering them easily.

311
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:16,185
-That white stone is yours.

312
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:17,953
Take it.

313
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,248
-Uh, this one?

314
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,103
-Yes.

315
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:29,198
-19, 15.

316
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,269
-He took it.

317
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,637
Is that OK?

318
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:36,605
-18, 14.

319
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,616
-I, I can take this one, right?

320
00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:43,051
-Yes.

321
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,217
-What just happened?

322
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,886
-Those nine white
stones just died.

323
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,056
Eventually, you will take
them as your prisoners.

324
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,090
-That many?

325
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:55,924
Wow.

326
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,660
This is going to be an easy win.

327
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:02,030
-No, this boy is not that weak.

328
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:09,104
We did not capture those stones.

329
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:11,073
He sacrificed them.

330
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:11,673
-Really?

331
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,811
Look closely.

332
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:20,048
-Oh.

333
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:21,717
-I still have a chance.

334
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,285
Losing those nine
stones in the upper left

335
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,789
hurt, but I still control
the center of the board.

336
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:30,125
-Are we going to win?

337
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:30,726
-Maybe.

338
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:31,593
4, 13.

339
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:39,201
Now, 8, 5.

340
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,803
-8, 5, where are you?

341
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:43,772
There it is.

342
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:45,807
-Huh?

343
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:49,144
That's, that isn't
the best move.

344
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:50,812
It's not even a good move.

345
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:53,715
He played it to see
how I'd respond.

346
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,818
It's like he's
testing my strength.

347
00:18:56,852 --> 00:19:00,956
He's measuring my skill
from a level far above mine.

348
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:09,164
-See ya later.

349
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:10,632
-Thank you.

350
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,634
Ah, game finished?

351
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:13,902
-Yep, all done.

352
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,572
I think it was a little too
soon for a match after all.

353
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:17,940
You know, I'm so slow.

354
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:20,275
It kind of tired me out.

355
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,276
-Oh, dear.

356
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,946
Oh, by the way,
there's a Go tournament

357
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:26,582
for children coming up soon.

358
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:27,849
Take a look.

359
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:28,584
-Oh?

360
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30,252
-Why not check it out?

361
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:31,853
-I'll think about it.

362
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:34,189
And thank you for letting
me play here today.

363
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:34,790
Bye.

364
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:35,757
-Come again.

365
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:41,964
He might even beat Akira
in another 50 years maybe.

366
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:42,931
-He lost?

367
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,299
That's ridiculous.

368
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,668
I mean, he's as good as a pro.

369
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,704
So he must have given
him a handicap, right?

370
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:49,805
How many stones?

371
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:52,007
-None, the boy played
black and went first.

372
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,242
-How much did he win by?

373
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,676
-Two points.

374
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,780
-So Akira actually won,
if you count the komi.

375
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,882
-It's not just the two points.

376
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,051
He was playing on a
higher level than I was.

377
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:05,053
-Wait a minute.

378
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:06,688
Is this true, Akira?

379
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:07,222
You lost?

380
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,195
That's impossible.

381
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:16,198
That boy said he'd never played
a game before in his life.

382
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:25,974
-Never played a game
before today ever?

383
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,577
Who, who is he?

384
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:33,706
-Huh, I'm not used to this.

385
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,675
I'm exhausted.

386
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:38,377
Did you have a good time
playing the game again?

387
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:39,612
-Oh, yes.

388
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:41,047
-Good.

389
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,415
Now, when we get home, we're
doing some social studies

390
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:43,249
homework.

391
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:44,117
-Anything you say.

392
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:44,550
-Great.

393
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:45,651
You wanna race?

394
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:47,053
-I would love to.

395
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:49,555
-1, 2, 3, go.

396
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,491
[theme music]

397
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,017
-This move, and this move, too.

398
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:28,654
It's as if he was
playing a teaching game.

399
00:22:28,688 --> 00:22:31,290
No, there's no way.

400
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:33,025
There's no way a kid
could be that good.

401
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,408
I finally found
you, Hikaru Shindo.
