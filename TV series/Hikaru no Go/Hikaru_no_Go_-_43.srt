2
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,545
-In the month between
the prelims and exam,

3
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,113
and all the way
through the finals,

4
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,748
your game's been
getting stronger,

5
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,583
but mine didn't improve one bit.

6
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,719
That's the difference
between you and me.

7
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,989
-Mr. Tsubaki, I can't
hear a word you're saying!

8
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:02,623
-Hey.

9
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,191
Your name's Shindou, right?

10
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,393
-What?

11
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,396
-I'm passing my dream
of being a pro onto you.

12
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,133
-Waya.

13
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,235
Your next game's against
Shindou, isn't it?

14
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,036
-Yeah.

15
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,337
I've only got two losses.

16
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,640
If I manage to beat him,
then I'm through as well.

17
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,376
Then you an me can take it
easy and watch everyone else

18
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,744
fighting it out
for the third spot.

19
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,013
-What makes you think
I'm gonna take it easy?

20
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,650
I don't play Shindou
until my very last match.

21
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,652
It's a really
important game for me.

22
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,420
In fact, as far
as I'm concerned,

23
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,323
it's probably the most important
game of the whole pro exam.

24
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,557
-Whoa.

25
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,726
I had no idea you considered
Shindou such a big rival.

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,128
You kept that quiet.

27
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,397
I wanna find out where he
gets his strength from.

28
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,564
That mysterious strength!

29
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,266
SAI (VOICEOVER): There's
no sign of the hesitation

30
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,401
or fear that he once showed.

31
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,304
His counting and end game
used to be his weak spot,

32
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,040
but now his game
is very precise.

33
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,510
Could the fact that his
game is now fully ed

34
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,112
have anything to do with me?

35
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:41,447
-What's the matter, Sai?

36
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:42,748
Your move here.

37
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:46,052
It looks like the kind
of move I would make.

38
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:49,555
-Really, you think so? I tried
to imagine where you'd play,

39
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:52,058
and that's what I came up with.

40
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:55,128
When I can't think of a move,
I put myself in your shoes.

41
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,762
Sometimes it works
out for the best.

42
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,134
-Put yourself in my shoes?

43
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,635
-Yep.

44
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:03,769
It isn't that hard, you know.

45
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:05,004
We're always playing together.

46
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,643
SAI (VOICEOVER):
Always together?

47
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:12,645
But for how long will that be?

48
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,637
I once thought I
would live forever,

49
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:16,008
and I would be with Hikaru
for the rest of his life.

50
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:19,512
And when his time
finally came to an end,

51
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:21,380
I would return to
the Go board until I

52
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,451
was released into
the world again.

53
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:29,021
But, now that I think about
it, how can I be sure?

54
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,057
Nothing is certain.

55
00:05:31,057 --> 00:05:32,658
Nothing.

56
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:36,963
-When I play Waya,
it's gonna be a tougher

57
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:38,831
match than the one against Ochi.

58
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:40,566
Ochi's already passed
the exam, so he

59
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,001
won't be as desperate
to win as Waya.

60
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,641
I've got one more loss than him,
so there's even more at stake

61
00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:50,743
here for me.

62
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:51,638
Darn it.

63
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:58,551
I'm starting to feel kind
of nervous about this game.

64
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:00,653
-If it's any
consolation, I'm sure

65
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:02,154
Waya's feeling exactly the same.

66
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,560
-Yeah, I know.

67
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:09,695
Just two matches left.

68
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,764
-That's right.

69
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:15,034
At the moment, my worries
really aren't that important.

70
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,764
-Morning.

71
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:45,898
-Good morning.

72
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:48,034
Waya's already gone
down to the match room.

73
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,436
-What's his problem?

74
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,872
He just wants to watch
our game so he can gloat.

75
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,811
He thinks he's better than us
because she's passed the exam.

76
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:00,579
-Excuse me, young man.

77
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:01,914
-Hm?

78
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:03,983
-You don't happen to know where
I can order my lunch, do you?

79
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:04,650
-Sure.

80
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,518
Over here.

81
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:12,525
Uh, here you go.

82
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:13,659
-Thanks a lot, son.

83
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:24,804
Oh, by the way, Shinoda-sensei,
the Insei instructor,

84
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:25,905
can't be here today.

85
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:29,642
He asked me to fill in
for him while he's gone.

86
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,143
And your name is?

87
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:31,911
-Shindou.

88
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,646
It's Hikaru Shindou.

89
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:36,649
-Well, Hikaru Shindou, how
have you been doing in the exam

90
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:37,650
so far?

91
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:39,652
-I've got three losses.

92
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:42,755
If I can win my last two
matches, then I'm through.

93
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:43,522
-Really?

94
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:44,924
Is that so?

95
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,659
In that case, good luck.

96
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,626
-Thank you.

97
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,627
I better get going.

98
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,668
-Hm.

99
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,404
Young man.

100
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,739
Your face seems familiar.

101
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:01,507
Have I met you somewhere before?

102
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,508
-What?

103
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:05,010
I don't know.

104
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:07,613
-Yes, we've definitely met
before, but for the life of me,

105
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:08,714
I can't place where.

106
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:10,783
Hm.

107
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:12,385
-Any ideas, Sai?

108
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:13,486
-None at all.

109
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,720
-Oh, well, never mind.

110
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:16,922
I'm sorry to have kept you.

111
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:17,523
Bye.

112
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,765
Hey!

113
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:26,966
I remember.

114
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,135
You're that kid from the
youth Go championships

115
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:33,906
who couldn't keep his mouth
shut and ruined the match!

116
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,775
-Now I recognize him!

117
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,910
He's the one who pulled
you into his office

118
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:39,512
and threw you out
of the tournament!

119
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:40,913
-What?

120
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:42,415
Oh, too bad.

121
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:43,883
Should've played it one higher.

122
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,654
-Unacceptable.

123
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,856
There's no excuse for a slip
of the tongue like that,

124
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,058
young man.

125
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:53,659
Oh no.

126
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:54,960
That's him?

127
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,596
I already apologized
for that, didn't I?

128
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,731
Besides, remember?

129
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:01,467
It was you who said what
the move should be, not me.

130
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,370
-Yes, but you're the one
who said it out loud.

131
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,640
-I remember thinking that you
had a special talent for Go.

132
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,142
You just said you were
close to passing the exam?

133
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:11,977
Well, now I can see you
were well on the way

134
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:15,648
to becoming a pro even then.

135
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,417
-It doesn't look like he's
gonna get mad at me, does it?

136
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,652
-Not really.

137
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,953
-Interesting.

138
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:23,656
This explains how you managed
to see that one, two move so

139
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,492
quickly.

140
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,593
-You didn't see that move!

141
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:28,627
I saw it.

142
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:30,463
I remember that match clearly.

143
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:32,031
You could never have seen it.

144
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:32,865
You didn't!

145
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:36,035
I-- Ugh.

146
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:38,070
All right, maybe now Hikaru.

147
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:39,638
-Maybe now what?

148
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:42,041
-Maybe now you'd see it.

149
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:43,375
-Yes!

150
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,044
I know I should have
kept quiet, but I just

151
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:46,679
couldn't help myself.

152
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,848
-I recall Mr. Ogata
and Toya-sensei

153
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,850
showing some interest in you.

154
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,052
I'm gonna have to tell
them that I bumped into.

155
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:56,522
-Oh, they already know I'm
here and I'm taking the exam.

156
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:57,389
-What?

157
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,924
They're following your progress?

158
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,060
I have to say I'm impressed.

159
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,429
Good luck in your
last two games.

160
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:04,763
I'm looking forward to them.

161
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:05,564
Bye.

162
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:06,800
-Thanks.

163
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:14,373
The way he just acted
right now reminds

164
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:18,711
me of that teacher from Kaio
after the match with Su-yeong.

165
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,713
-And now I'm
convinced, the person

166
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:23,482
who played that magical match,
and the person I see here,

167
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:24,783
are one in the same.

168
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:26,118
I won't forget your name.

169
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:29,522
It'll stay in my memory forever.

170
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:31,991
Hikaru Shindou.

171
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:34,360
-He saw how strong
a player I was.

172
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:35,761
And this guy?

173
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,764
I know he sees it, too.

174
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:43,035
SAI (VOICEOVER): Why does
this make me feel so uneasy?

175
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:45,971
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and
gentlemen, it's time to begin.

176
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:49,041
Would everyone please make
their way to the match room now?

177
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:12,565
-Hello there, Shindou.

178
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:13,799
You ready for the big game?

179
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:19,912
-Yeah!

180
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:29,515
SAI (VOICEOVER): I have to
put aside my own worries.

181
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:31,817
Right now it's more important
to watch over Hikaru.

182
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:43,562
-All right.

183
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:44,830
When you're ready, please begin.

184
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:58,231
-Onegai shimasu.

185
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,412
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Sensei.

186
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:52,018
-Waya, you've been studying
with me for five years now.

187
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:54,253
It's your fourth
time doing the test?

188
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:55,554
That's a lot.

189
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,123
If at first you don't succeed--

190
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,324
-Kazuo!

191
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:02,595
I don't want to hear you
talking like that to our guest.

192
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:04,030
Listen up, Waya!

193
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:05,998
You've been playing
very well this year,

194
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:09,201
but if you can't pass this time,
you're out of my study group!

195
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:10,303
Understand?

196
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,338
-Dad, you shouldn't talk
with your mouth full.

197
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:13,673
-Calm down, dear.

198
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:16,309
-He's got enough pressure as it
is without you threatening him.

199
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:24,483
-You've only lost
two games so far?

200
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:27,653
-Thanks very much for the meal.

201
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:31,457
-I think you're gonna
make it through.

202
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,293
-Shigeko, you're as
bad as your father.

203
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:37,730
Stop making him feel
so uncomfortable.

204
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:39,265
-Huh?

205
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:40,566
-I'll help.

206
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,167
-Great.

207
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,001
Thank you.

208
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:48,607
-You did tell your parents you
were eating here, didn't you?

209
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:49,275
-Yes, sir.

210
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:55,047
-Get a move on with
that washing up.

211
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:58,184
You and I have some
more studying to do.

212
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:00,519
-OK.

213
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,655
-Kazuo, you'll have
time to drive him home

214
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:04,123
once we're finished?

215
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:04,990
-Sure, Dad.

216
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:15,701
[giggling]

217
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:18,003
-Promise you'll buy
me a little something

218
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:19,271
when you become a pro?

219
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:21,574
-Shouldn't you be the one buying
him something if he passes?

220
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:24,577
-Sayaki bought me a present to
celebrate when he became a pro.

221
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,544
-All right, enough!

222
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:27,646
I want you two out of here.

223
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,682
You'd think they'd show
some interest in the game,

224
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:33,052
considering who their father is.

225
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:35,554
All that time I wasted
teaching you how to play.

226
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:37,356
-Maybe we weren't
meant to be good at it.

227
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,425
-Or maybe it's 'cause you
were a bad teacher, Dad.

228
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:08,387
-So, are you going
to pass this year,

229
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:10,222
or is this going to
be our last lesson?

230
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:10,897
-Huh?

231
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,400
(VOICEOVER) Sensei-- I--

232
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,547
SAI ( VOICEOVER): Waya's
white stones are in a secure

233
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:35,147
position.

234
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:49,261
WAYA (VOICEOVER): This is
going to decide the match.

235
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:51,764
If I can turn this
shape into my territory,

236
00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:53,032
he's going to lose for sure.

237
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:58,103
He'll have no choice
but to attack.

238
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:08,781
Your turn.

239
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:45,985
Huh?

240
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:06,338
He's made his move.

241
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:10,009
If his stone stays
there, he'll win.

242
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:12,545
But if I eliminate
it, then I win,

243
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:14,313
and I finally pass the pro exam.

244
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,540
Can I do it?

245
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:43,175
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Can I stay alive?

246
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:04,029
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Is
there any way black can

247
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:05,531
fight back from here?

248
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:06,732
Any way he can survive?

249
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:20,245
Sensei?

250
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,390
-Waya.

251
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,992
-Yes, sir?

252
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:35,694
-You've always been a
very nice young man,

253
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:38,130
ever obedient and
willing to learn.

254
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,265
Which is all very good.

255
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:42,101
But you can't stay
coddled forever!

256
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:43,369
Do you hear me?

257
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:56,649
WAYA (VOICEOVER): If black plays
there, then I'll extend here.

258
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:57,616
No, wait.

259
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,184
If I back down
without a fight, it

260
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,387
will only make things
harder later on.

261
00:19:01,387 --> 00:19:02,521
He won't go there, anyway.

262
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:09,361
-I've taught my fair
share of students.

263
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:11,597
Most of them could
never make it as a pro.

264
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,431
But you?

265
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:14,099
You're better than most.

266
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,268
I think you've
got what it takes.

267
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:18,537
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Even if
black attaches to my two point

268
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,341
extension, I can let it go.

269
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:26,345
Yeah, I can attack him
over there, instead.

270
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:27,546
-Listen to me.

271
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,648
You will pass.

272
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:32,618
Let me say it again.

273
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:34,386
You will pass.

274
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:43,295
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Yes.

275
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:45,531
-You gotta be confident, Waya.

276
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:48,367
If you do that, you'll
be joining the pros.

277
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:53,605
WAYA (VOICEOVER): There's
no way black can win.

278
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:54,540
I've done it!

279
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,478
SAI (VOICEOVER): Oh really?

280
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:10,389
There is one way
that black can win.

281
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:14,259
It's hard to see and difficult
to pull off, but it's there.

282
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:20,332
The question is,
will Hikaru find it?

283
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:26,538
-Hm.

284
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:27,639
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Come on.

285
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:32,745
Why can't I see it?

286
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:34,313
I know there's a
way for me to win.

287
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:41,386
WAYA: Sensei.

288
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:44,123
Finally, I've made it!

289
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:45,324
I'm gonna be a pro!

HIKARU: Ochi has been
teaming up with Akira?

292
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,260
SAI: Ochi now believes
he's strong enough

293
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:30,362
to defeat you in the last match.

HIKARU: First I gotta
finish my game against Waya.

00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:34,366
He thinks he's already won.

00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:36,068
SAI: The game is very
close because he's

00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:37,669
playing the best he can.

is everyone else.

he wants to pass the exam.
