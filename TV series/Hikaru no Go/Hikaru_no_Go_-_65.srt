1
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,540
[theme song]

2
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,610
-It's so depressing.

3
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,378
I've gotta go through
all the qualifying rounds

4
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,479
for the pro exam.

5
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:56,049
Ryo's given up being an
insei, so I'm on my own.

6
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,219
I'm beginning to wonder if
I should just call it quits.

7
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,055
Oh, by the way, do
you know what I heard?

8
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,291
A bunch of players from the
Kyusekai went on this trip

9
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,492
to China.

10
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,160
They were like goodwill
ambassadors for the Japanese Go

11
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,095
Association.

12
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:08,830
-Oh yeah?

13
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,030
Good for them.

14
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,665
-The interesting thing is that
one of the players on the trip

15
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,299
was Isumi.

16
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,533
-Isumi?

17
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,101
No way!

18
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,144
-So the flight from Tokyo
to Beijing is four hours.

19
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,214
And now are we going
to be getting a taxi?

20
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,416
How long do you think it'll
take to get to the China Go

21
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,317
Institute?

22
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,585
-It's only about 30 minutes.

23
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,054
I can't believe you guys have
never been to China before.

24
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,692
Hey, Isumi.

25
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,360
When you left the Nine
Stars Club last year,

26
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,495
I thought you would
give up the idea

27
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,330
of becoming a
professional go player.

28
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:46,266
-There's no reason why Isumi
can't take the pro exam again.

29
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,136
He's more than a match for most
of the pros I've come across.

30
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,137
-Easy.

31
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,338
I wasn't saying he's
not strong enough.

32
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,639
I just thought he
got discouraged

33
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,343
and didn't want it
enough, that's all.

34
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,745
-I took some time so I could
figure out what I wanted to do,

35
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,480
that's all.

36
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,549
Sorry to make you
worry about me.

37
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,152
-Anyway, the fact that
Narusawa-sensei invited you

38
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,087
on this trip to play
these goodwill matches

39
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,556
shows he thinks you've got what
it takes to make it as a pro.

40
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,691
-Yeah, I hope so.

41
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,426
And I intend to pass
the exam this year

42
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,128
to repay his confidence in me.

43
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,229
-You'd better.

44
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,165
You're 19 already, and
time's ticking away.

45
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,299
-What are you talking about?

46
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,434
He's got plenty of time.

47
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,536
I didn't pass until
I was in my 20s.

48
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,171
-Sakurano, that was you.

49
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,273
But Isumi is Isumi.

50
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,541
-Hey, what does that mean?

51
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,044
How many games do
you think we're

52
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,679
going to have to play
over the three days?

53
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,014
ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
I've done as much

54
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,716
as I can to prepare for
the qualifying rounds

55
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,286
of the pro exam which
begin in two months time.

56
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,521
I'm going to treat these
goodwill matches here in China

57
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,290
as if they were the
pro exams themselves.

58
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,434
-I resign.

59
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,402
-You see this move?

60
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,003
Why did you go there?

61
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:01,174
Every move you made from that
point on cost you stones.

62
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,342
Hm?

63
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,557
-Hm.

64
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,485
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): I
wasn't able to recover.

65
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,986
He was too strong for me.

66
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,290
-You didn't play that bad.

67
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,526
Come on, cheer up.

68
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,761
-Let's grab some lunch.

69
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,696
Take your mind off it.

70
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,264
-I didn't play that bad?

71
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,532
-Hm?

72
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,434
-The point is I didn't
play that good, either,

73
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,402
and I should have been better.

74
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,604
I haven't lost my confidence.

75
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,273
I'm just mad at myself.

76
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,142
I didn't want to lose,
so I allowed myself

77
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,612
to get all tense, and then I
couldn't play my best game.

78
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,483
-You sure you would have won
if you'd played your best?

79
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,751
-Hm.

80
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,387
-Well, you've got another chance
to try again this afternoon.

81
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,256
SAKURANO: Come on, Isumi.

82
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,157
Let's go eat.

83
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,564
-I remember coming
here with Sai.

84
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:01,001
I practiced playing go
using a pebble in the dirt.

85
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,640
It all started when he found
one that looked like a go stone.

86
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,678
Kind of like this one here!

87
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,547
He told me to play
the stone as if I

88
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,183
was putting it on a go board.

89
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,684
I tried to look cool
and snap it down,

90
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,186
but it flew right
out of my hand.

91
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,125
Sai.

92
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:27,561
-Hey, Shindo!

93
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,362
-Huh?

94
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,730
Oh, hi, Waya.

95
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:31,598
-What are you doing?

96
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,067
You find something in the dirt?

97
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,669
-No, not really.

98
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,137
Anyway, what are you doing?

99
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,738
I've never seen you
around here before.

100
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,141
-I was on my way over to
your house to find you.

101
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,376
Morishita-sensei is
furious with you.

102
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,412
Why haven't you been coming
to the study sessions?

103
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,180
You've been skipping
matches, too!

104
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:50,350
You didn't even call the Go
Association to let them know.

105
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,318
What's the matter?

106
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,286
Can't take the pressure
of being a pro?

107
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,657
Say something!

108
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,728
I'm trying to help you out here,
but if you won't talk to me--

109
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,363
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
How can I tell him

110
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,265
I couldn't care less
about go anymore?

111
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,407
And I can't tell him
anything about Sai.

112
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,408
-Hey.

113
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,543
-Huh?

114
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,144
-Did you hear I've moved
into my own place now?

115
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,247
The insei guys are coming over.

116
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,181
You want to join us?

117
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,983
It'd be great just to hang out.

118
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,017
-Nah.

119
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,719
-Shindo, you're the
only one from our group

120
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,287
who is not playing right now.

121
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,322
I've won two out of
three games so far

122
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,358
in the Dan Promotion
League, which is OK.

123
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,425
But you should see Ochi.

124
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,128
He's played four games,
and hasn't lost yet.

125
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,998
Honda, Komiya, the rest
are all studying hard

126
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,301
for this year's pro exam.

127
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,736
And did you hear about Isumi?

128
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:47,140
He got invited to go on
a trip to play in China.

129
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,242
-Isumi's gone to play in China?

130
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,011
-Yeah.

131
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,247
Listen, Shindo, last year
we had to really battle

132
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,683
to pass the pro exam, because
we were up against Isumi.

133
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,053
Without us around this time,
he's going to pass for sure.

134
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,621
He's going to be so
mad if he finds out

135
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,189
you bailed so soon
when it could've

136
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,557
been him in your shoes.

137
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,526
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

138
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,327
-Hm.

139
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,695
-You want to play go.

140
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,562
I know it.

141
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,097
Let's play a game right now!

142
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:11,698
I'll go first.

143
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,733
16-4, the star point!

144
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,307
I bet you thought of what
move you're going to make.

145
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,511
So come on, tell me what your
next move is going to be!

146
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,415
-[screaming]

147
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,750
-Shindo, come back here!

148
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,519
[growl] Stupid idiot!

149
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,432
-I can't believe our
three days are up already.

150
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,701
Once we've said our good byes
to Mr. Liu and the others,

151
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,070
it'll be time for
us all to head home.

152
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,271
-We've got an hour or so we.

153
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,539
Should go to Tienanmen Square.

154
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,741
-I wouldn't mind going shopping.

155
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,575
-You're kidding me.

156
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,576
We're in Beijing.

157
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,144
You can go shopping anywhere.

158
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:58,745
Right, Isumi?

159
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,510
Huh?

160
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,087
-What's the matter?

161
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,155
-I know I should've
told you this earlier,

162
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,024
but I think I'm going
to stay an extra day.

163
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,493
I want another game
against that young kid.

164
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,995
-Isumi.

165
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,331
-Come on, just what do you
expect us to do while you play?

166
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,368
-Uh, well, I meant I
would stay here by myself.

167
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,335
-Oh.

168
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,105
So this young kid--
is that Zou-si?

169
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,073
-I remember him.

170
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,175
I managed to win, but
it wasn't an easy game.

171
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,411
He was a tough opponent.

172
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,646
If the kids play that
well, then the standards

173
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,416
of the China Go Institute
must be very high.

174
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,118
-Why are you so surprised?

175
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,286
This go institute
is pretty amazing.

176
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,022
The pro players here
have been selected

177
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,257
from all across the country.

178
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,159
China is made up of
different provinces,

179
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,395
like the prefecture
districts we have in Japan.

180
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,729
The best players
from each province

181
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,232
are invited to come and
study here in Beijing.

182
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,235
They train every day, and all
their expenses are covered.

183
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,338
The Institute even provides
their accommodation.

184
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,205
SAKURANO: What?

185
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,508
They actually live here as well?

186
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,675
-Yep.

187
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,444
Once they start making a
lot of money or get married,

188
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,980
then they usually move out
and rent a place of their own.

189
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,349
So the players living
here at the Institute

190
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:14,120
tend to be teenagers, or
the ones in their early 20s.

191
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,155
-Wow.

192
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,689
-So this kid you've
been talking about

193
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,358
is one of China's top players.

194
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,161
Even though he's so young, he
lives here with the other boys

195
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,562
away from his parents.

196
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,664
He has incredible talent.

197
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,299
SAKURANO: What does
he do for school?

198
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,734
-This is his school.

199
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,437
-I guess they'd have to provide
some sort of education program

200
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,538
for the kids.

201
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,606
Still, they're all
pros, aren't they?

202
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,141
-Can I help you?

203
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,009
-Huh?

204
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,645
-Oh, hello, Mr. Li.

205
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,679
-Hi.

206
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,114
One of our group was
just saying how much

207
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,550
he'd like to play Zou-si
again before he goes home.

208
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,018
-Oh really?

209
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,388
-He really doesn't feel like
he played his best yesterday.

210
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,622
-I'd be very grateful.

211
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,724
-I happened to see
that game yesterday.

212
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,593
He played quite well,
but Zou deflected

213
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,295
every one of his attacks.

214
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:59,165
I can understand why he'd
want to have another chance.

215
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,301
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): It doesn't
matter how good Zou is.

216
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,670
I didn't play my best, and I
don't want to go back to Japan

217
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,138
with that hanging over me.

218
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,407
I need to go into this year's
pro exam with the confidence

219
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:11,144
that I'm playing at
the top of my game.

220
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,645
-Sorry to disappoint
you, but it's not

221
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,647
going to be possible
for you to play Zou

222
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,149
because he's leaving town today.

223
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,217
-Oh.

224
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,685
-He has games scheduled
out in the provinces.

225
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,221
In fact, he's
probably already left.

226
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,223
-He won't be back
for a few days.

227
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,991
But hey, I've got an idea.

228
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,759
Why don't you stick
around Beijing for a while

229
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,295
and study with us until
he gets back into town?

230
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,396
-Mr. Liu!

231
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,232
-Stay here?

232
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:35,668
-Our practice rooms are like
a training ground for pros.

233
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,238
You'll see them in
there every day.

234
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,306
You'd be welcome to join them.

235
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,543
I understand your frustration
at losing your game to Zou,

236
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,146
so if you can, stay
for a few days.

237
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,147
What do you think?

238
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,414
Is that OK?

239
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,618
--[laughing] Anyone willing
to work hard is welcome here.

240
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,220
All you need to do is find
yourself a hotel nearby,

241
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,422
and you're all set.

242
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,057
-Well, Isumi?

243
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,159
-It's your decision.

244
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,261
What are you going to do?

245
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,763
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): I hadn't been
expecting something like this,

246
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,433
but it might be a great
opportunity for me.

247
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,501
-OK.

248
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,403
I'll stay a few more days.

249
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,204
-Oh.

250
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:11,799
-Huh?

251
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:21,895
-I don't know how much you've
heard about this place.

252
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:24,231
It's where all of the
elite players get together.

253
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:25,398
It can be demanding.

254
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:28,001
If their game records fall
below a certain level,

255
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,336
we send them home.

256
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:31,771
They all come here with great
potential, but not all of them

257
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:33,707
manage to fulfill it.

258
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,842
-Mr. Li is one of
the go instructors,

259
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:39,913
but he also teaches the
kids about life skills.

260
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:41,815
-This is the main practice room.

261
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:44,117
It's where they study new
moves, past game records,

262
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,019
and where they have
practice games.

263
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:48,889
It's a very fertile training
ground for the pros.

264
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:54,761
ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
They're all so young.

265
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:57,163
And all of them are pros?

266
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,698
I shouldn't let
that intimidate me.

267
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:00,267
I study with pros back in Japan.

268
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:01,768
Why should this
be any different?

269
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:04,771
-They begin their studies
at 8:15 sharp every morning,

270
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,374
and the session goes-- huh?

271
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:08,241
-Huh?

272
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:09,943
-Sneaking out of class again?

273
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:12,245
Don't think you can get away
with it when I'm not around.

274
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,313
-I wasn't skipping class!

275
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:14,881
I was in the bathroom!

276
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:15,749
-Don't lie to me.

277
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:17,050
-Huh? Waya?

278
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,121
[murmuring]

279
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:22,822
-Uh, I'm sorry.

280
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:23,924
-Waya?

281
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:25,725
-It's the name of one
of my friends in Japan.

282
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,427
They look so alike,
I thought it was him.

283
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:29,095
-Mr. Li, what's a Waya?

284
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:30,997
Was he talking about me?

285
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:32,732
[laughter]

286
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:34,267
-Your attention,
please, everyone!

287
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,268
-Huh?

288
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:36,970
-This is Isumi,
visiting from Japan.

289
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,972
He'll be studying with
us for the next few days.

290
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:39,767
-Isumi?

291
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:41,041
-Is he a pro?

292
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:43,877
-No, but I expect he will
be by the end of the year.

293
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,879
-Yes, I'm taking the pro exam.

294
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,180
Pleased to meet you.

295
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:49,049
-Hey Isumi, Isumi!

296
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:49,649
-Huh?

297
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:55,355
-Does your friend Waya have
an outie as good as this one?

298
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:56,990
-Lur Ping!

299
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:58,425
-Oh, what do you know?

300
00:12:58,658 --> 00:12:59,859
It's lunchtime.

301
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:01,194
-Not so fast, Lur Ping!

302
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:05,332
That child is trouble.

303
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:06,933
-As you might have
guessed, Lur Ping

304
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:10,670
isn't great at focusing his
attention on his go studies.

305
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:13,406
And he knows exactly how
to get under Mr. Li's skin.

306
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,408
He's always getting
himself into trouble.

307
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:17,777
-Some kids are always
going to be a handful.

308
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:19,679
Are you sure he's old
enough to be a pro?

309
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:20,981
-Absolutely.

310
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:23,917
-He was invited to come here
last year when he was only 11.

311
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,752
-I think it's about
time for lunch.

312
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:27,420
Hope you're feeling hungry.

313
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:28,435
-Yeah.

314
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:35,395
-Everyone has their meals
here on the first floor.

315
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:39,099
While you're here, you're
welcome to join us.

316
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,067
Once you're done
eating, I suggest

317
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:43,003
you look for a hotel to stay at.

318
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:44,270
You should have plenty of time.

319
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,773
The lunch break
is two hours long.

320
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:47,374
-Thanks.

321
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:48,842
-Study hard now.

322
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,211
If you make the most of your
next few days here with us,

323
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:55,281
you should be a better
player by the time you leave.

324
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,383
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): I'll try.

325
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:02,856
Huh.

326
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:04,891
Lur Ping.

327
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:05,959
Careful!

328
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:06,960
I can't let my guard
down just because I

329
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,228
met someone who looks like Waya.

330
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,368
-The afternoons are
dedicated to playing games

331
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:17,070
with a 90 minute
limit per player.

332
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,872
We play in a league format.

333
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:21,274
It helps raise the
stakes for everyone.

334
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:24,844
I'll add your name to the list.

335
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:27,280
This group is made up of
the lower ranking players--

336
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:28,448
1 through 3-Dan.

337
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:30,950
All you need to do is find
someone who's available

338
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:31,985
and start playing.

339
00:14:31,985 --> 00:14:32,886
-Mr. Li!

340
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,653
-Hm?

341
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,121
-Can I play Isumi first?

342
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:36,823
-If you really want to.

343
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:38,758
Is that OK with you, Isumi?

344
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:39,726
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Me?

345
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,895
Play him?

346
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:43,229
Should be an easy game.

347
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:44,264
He's just a kid.

348
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:45,432
-Huh?

349
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:46,399
-All right.

350
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:47,734
I'll play against you.

351
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:05,900
-Hm.

352
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:17,363
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Hm.

353
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:18,765
I underestimated him.

354
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:21,901
I figured he was a kid, so
he couldn't be that strong.

355
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,275
But he is a pro, and
he's studying here,

356
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:30,877
so he's one of the elite.

357
00:15:34,714 --> 00:15:35,281
-Isumi.

358
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:36,416
You were too aggressive.

359
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:38,852
This move here was a mistake.

360
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:40,820
You were quite successful
in defending yourself

361
00:15:40,854 --> 00:15:43,857
from black's overall
attack, but not

362
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:45,992
quite strong enough when
you were in close quarters.

363
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:47,994
-You thought you could
defend yourself with that?

364
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:50,897
What do you take me for, a fool?

365
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,699
You could never beat me.

366
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:57,370
Not when you play
like that. [laughing]

367
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:58,238
Hang in there.

368
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,305
Keep studying hard.

369
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,874
-Now, Lur Ping.

370
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:02,142
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): He mocked me!

371
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:06,946
-So, how was he?

372
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,714
-Nothing special.

373
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:08,681
-You beat him, then.

374
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,059
-In this situation,
instead of advancing

375
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:23,096
to the top of the board, try
moving towards the bottom.

376
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:25,431
-Makes a lot of sense, seeing
as black's waiting at the top

377
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:27,100
and down the right hand side.

378
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,401
ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
These guys are

379
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,203
looking at the board
in a whole new way.

380
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,341
I could never join
in their discussion.

381
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,444
They've been studying here
for months, sometimes years.

382
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:40,046
Surrounded by other
elite pros, they

383
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,383
get to play from
morning to night.

384
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:45,919
I thought that if I stayed
here, I would learn a lot,

385
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:47,987
but if all that
happens is I lose

386
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:50,723
my confidence, then
what's the point?

387
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:55,862
No.

388
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:56,896
I'll be fine.

389
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,665
I'm just angry with myself.

390
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:02,869
That's OK, as long as I don't
let it turn into self-pity.

391
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,138
These guys are only in
their teens and early 20s,

392
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:07,907
but they're among the
best in the country--

393
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,109
stronger than a lot of
older, higher ranked players.

394
00:17:13,213 --> 00:17:15,848
What am I doing here?

395
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:16,683
-Isumi.

396
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:18,084
-Uh, yes?

397
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:19,719
-Want to play a game
of lightning go?

398
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:20,787
10 seconds per move?

399
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,388
-Uh, OK.

400
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,862
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): I played
a lot of 10 second go

401
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:31,397
during my spare time
when I was an insei.

402
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:33,233
This kind of game
depends on intuition

403
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:34,801
instead of reading the board.

404
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:35,301
-Onegaishimasu.

405
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,917
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): He's
about the same age as me,

406
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,152
but he's way stronger than me.

407
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:57,824
He's like the equivalent
of Japanese 9-Dan.

408
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:08,334
-I resign.

409
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:09,102
-What?

410
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:10,303
Giving up already?

411
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:11,871
It's too soon for that.

412
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:12,839
-Huh?

413
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,240
-If black plays
hane here, white has

414
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:16,142
to back off or
fight to the death.

415
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:20,013
-So white has no option but to
cut first and then exchange.

416
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,248
Black would lose the initiative,
but none of his stones

417
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:24,083
would be in danger, and
he'd be in the lead.

418
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:25,652
-I thought if I
sacrifice my stone,

419
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:26,819
I'd get nothing in return.

420
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:30,290
But if he exchanged--
why did I resign so soon?

421
00:18:30,323 --> 00:18:32,358
-Thanks, guys.

422
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:33,960
We should clear the board.

423
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:34,661
-It's OK.

424
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:36,029
I'll do it.

425
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:36,663
-Fair enough.

426
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:48,241
-Uh.

427
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:51,277
-What's this I hear about
you being from Japan?

428
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:53,146
I've been hanging out
in my room all day,

429
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:55,181
so I guess I missed the
formal introduction.

430
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:56,215
My name's Yanghai.

431
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:57,116
Pleased to meet you.

432
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,717
-Thanks.

433
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,718
I'm Isumi.

434
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:01,254
-So what's up?

435
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:02,388
You're looking pretty tired.

436
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:04,424
Where are you staying
while you're here?

437
00:19:04,657 --> 00:19:05,992
You got a hotel or something?

438
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:07,160
-Yeah.

439
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:08,394
-You want to save some money?

440
00:19:08,428 --> 00:19:10,963
I've got a spare bed in my
room you're welcome to use.

441
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:11,731
Interested?

442
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:13,366
I'm in room 303.

443
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:15,868
-I didn't think it was allowed
to stay overnight here,

444
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,136
especially not foreigners.

445
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,938
-Come on, who's going to know?

446
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:20,139
I don't care.

447
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:22,742
Mr. Li goes home at 5:00,
so he'll never find out.

448
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:24,744
Beats an expensive hotel.

449
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:27,387
-That's nice of
you, but no thanks.

450
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:27,927
-Oh.

451
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:28,681
And why not?

452
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:31,217
-I kind of wanted
some time on my own.

453
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,419
And it'll only be
for a couple of days.

454
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:36,089
-Well, the offer's still there.

455
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:37,690
I was hoping you'd
be able to tell me

456
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:40,093
something about the hot new
bands coming out of Japan right

457
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:41,361
now.

458
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:43,062
But I guess if you take go
seriously enough to come study

459
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:44,897
in China, you probably
don't have much time

460
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:46,666
to keep up with the music scene.

461
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:48,267
You interested in a game?

462
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:51,404
-Nah, I'm done for today.

463
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:52,004
-Oh.

464
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,041
Too bad.

465
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:57,217
You must be really tired.

466
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:06,359
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): During
last year's pro exam,

467
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:09,896
after I lost three games in a
row to Shindo, Waya, and Fuku,

468
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:12,632
all it took was one win against
Ochi to regain my confidence.

469
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:18,905
It was my game
that kept me going.

470
00:20:18,938 --> 00:20:21,307
Back then I believed in myself.

471
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:22,709
I trusted in my own strength.

472
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:28,882
But now, here at the
China Go Institute,

473
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:30,817
I'm not really sure
what my strength is.

474
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:35,688
Will my game keep
me going this time?

475
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,027
[theme song]

476
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:21,728
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Next time, we're

477
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:24,664
going back to when
I first met Akira.

478
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:26,833
No one our age can come
close to defeating him.

479
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:33,573
But the kid who holds the
Children's Meijin title

480
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:37,944
shows up and is
