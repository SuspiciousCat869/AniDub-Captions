NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:11,659
a spirit from the past known as
Fujiwara-no-Sai has returned,

3
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:15,267
visible only to Hikaru
Shindo, a master of Go,

4
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:18,007
Sai seeks to play
the divine move.

00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,011
[theme music]

6
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,477
-I want to enter the
Young Lions tournament.

7
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,414
I mean, I have to.

8
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:54,118
Otherwise, no one
will believe me

9
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:57,425
when I tell them I'm going
to defeat Akira Toya.

10
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:59,830
I have to enter that tournament
if it's the last thing I do.

11
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,467
I want to make sure
he knows I'm going

12
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,837
to catch up to him one day.

13
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:29,462
Loya!

14
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:30,164
-Oh.

15
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:30,732
Hey there, Shindo.

16
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:31,901
So what's up?

17
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,405
[chuckling]

18
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:34,340
-Hah.

19
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,677
I finally made it.

20
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,645
Look.

21
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,850
Starting today, I'm
in the A-league.

22
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:40,220
-Hm.

23
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:40,955
Big deal.

24
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:43,260
You're in last place.

25
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:44,295
-Come on.

26
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,564
Aren't you going to
congratulate him?

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,801
-Not until he passes me.

28
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,705
-Stop being so mean, Waya.

29
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:49,774
-You don't get it.

30
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:51,344
Now that I'm in
the A-league, I can

31
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:53,482
go for the Young
Lions tournament.

32
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:56,221
-So you can go after
Toya, you mean.

33
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:58,426
Have you forgotten that to
get into the tournament--

34
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,629
-I've got to be in the top 16.

35
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:00,230
Yeah.

36
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:00,965
I know that.

37
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,636
It's one step at a time.

38
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:04,239
First was to get
into the A-league.

39
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:06,378
Next, I've got to
climb a few places.

40
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:08,917
-I know you're excited
about this Shindo,

41
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:10,720
but there's one thing
you need to remember.

42
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:12,925
-What's that?

43
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,595
-Don't think it'll
be an easy ride,

44
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:18,304
because we're your
opponents now.

45
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:19,840
-You managed to make
it here much faster

46
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:21,311
than we thought you would.

47
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:22,646
-Give him a break, you guys.

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,983
Stop hassling him.

49
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:25,653
-We're not hassling him.

50
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:28,693
We're giving him spirit.

51
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:29,662
-Huh?

52
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:30,831
-Well, good luck, Shindo.

53
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:31,433
-Hey.

54
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,303
Thanks.

55
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:34,505
-Good luck.

56
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:35,408
-Yeah, good luck.

57
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:36,978
-The same from me.

58
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:38,247
-And me too!

59
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:39,584
-We're all glad you
made it to the A-league.

60
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:46,299
-Hikaru!

61
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:47,634
They're expecting
you to respond.

62
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:50,375
-Uh-- ah, thanks.

63
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:54,249
I'll look forward
to playing you.

64
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:56,321
-If you're already, it's time.

65
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:56,821
Let's begin.

66
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:58,325
-Onegaishimasu.

67
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,828
-Onegaishimasu.

68
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:00,463
-Hm.

69
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,349
-Huh?

70
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,685
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I didn't realize

71
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,461
they gave you more time
to play in the A-league.

72
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,665
I can't let myself be
intimidated by the fact

73
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:18,603
that these are all
A-league players.

74
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:22,044
After all, I'm one of them now.

75
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,048
SAI (VOICEOVER): Hikaru
has taken his first step

76
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:24,783
toward his goal.

77
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:42,422
-Hm.

78
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:46,932
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): This guy
sure takes a long time to play.

79
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:47,533
-Hm.

80
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:56,686
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): No
wonder he's in the A-league.

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,525
He thought a lot
about that move.

82
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:03,067
I mean, it's a
strong move, but--

83
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:04,538
-Huh?

84
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,441
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): There's
no point getting worried.

85
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:09,782
I have to come back at him
with an even stronger move.

86
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:11,085
I know I can do it.

87
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:15,728
SAI (VOICEOVER):
You've taken your play

88
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,533
to whole new level, Hikaru.

89
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:22,678
Huh?

90
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:25,417
But there's still a lot
of room for improvement.

91
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:31,530
-Hm.

92
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:32,700
I resign.

93
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,136
[sigh]

94
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,372
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I won.

95
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,829
This is the first time
I've ever played Fuku.

96
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:50,940
He doesn't really
plan his moves at all.

97
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:52,443
Not like that guy
this morning who

98
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,116
took forever to make a move.

99
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:56,418
Fuku's different.

100
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:57,120
All instinct.

101
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:03,467
This is much easier.

102
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,004
I remember sensei
being impressed

103
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:07,042
with how I'd played
three games at once.

104
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,645
Maybe I play better this fast.

105
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:12,721
Whoa.

106
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,191
I won by half a point.

107
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:15,761
That's two wins in a row now.

108
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:16,997
-No need to rub it in.

109
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:17,865
-Oh.

110
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:18,767
Sorry.

111
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:19,502
-That's OK.

112
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:20,471
Forget it.

113
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:22,008
-I thought I had
you cornered here,

114
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,815
but then you went and
made a great comeback.

115
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,485
-But you were in
control after that.

116
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,954
It got way too complicated.

117
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,458
I lost track.

118
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:31,763
-I couldn't believe how
fast you played your stones.

119
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:32,498
-Yeah.

120
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:33,868
Everyone says that.

121
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:36,039
Hey. want to play another game?

122
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:36,640
-Sure.

123
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,074
Why not?

124
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:39,681
We've got time.

125
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:40,816
Go's really awesome.

126
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,885
Don't you think so?

127
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:45,092
-You know, that's what
Waya always says too.

128
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,763
-What's he like as a player?

129
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:47,898
-He's pretty good.

130
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:50,972
But I still manage to beat
him every time we play.

131
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:52,475
-Wha?

132
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,546
Well, if you can beat him
and I can beat you, then

133
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,751
maybe I'm a better
than I thought was.

134
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,722
-Hikaru, it's your turn to move.

135
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:00,727
-I know that.

136
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,796
Whoa.

137
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:03,867
You've really spread
yourself out over here.

138
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,771
-That's because I'm
building up my territory.

139
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:07,175
It's going to be my turf.

140
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,243
-Oh really?

141
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:10,114
In that case, I'm going
to land on your turf

142
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:11,918
and build a fortress
of black stones.

143
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:12,921
-Oh, no!

144
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:14,658
He landed right in the middle!

145
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:16,195
-Will you two keep
the noise down?

146
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:18,632
There are still people
playing in here?

147
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:19,669
-OK.

148
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,876
-Sorry about that.

149
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:23,811
-Hey, guys.

150
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:25,615
So who won the game?

151
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:26,717
-Hm.

152
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,586
-You're kidding me.

153
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:29,223
That means you won two games.

154
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,194
-I hear that you
can't beat Fuku.

155
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:32,096
[clears throat]

156
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:33,532
-You should keep
your mouth shut.

157
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,270
-I was only telling the truth.

158
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:37,541
-Before you start
acting invincible,

159
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:39,679
remember that I'm going
to be your next opponent.

160
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:41,116
You won't win three in a row.

161
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:42,085
-We'll see.

162
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:46,327
-Just you wait.

163
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:47,764
[chuckling]

164
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:53,083
-Hahah.

165
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,620
Two wins.

166
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,855
I'm on a roll.

167
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,196
-I know it feels good to put
together consecutive wins,

168
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,299
but don't forget.

169
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:01,970
Your first opponent
next week will be Waya,

170
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:05,310
and he seems determined that
he's going to win that game.

171
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:07,849
-We'll see how good he
is, once we start playing.

172
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:08,618
-Yes.

173
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:09,987
I suppose you're right.

174
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,094
I don't think we've ever watched
one of his games, have we?

175
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,364
-No.

176
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:17,336
But it'll be fun to find out
what kind of a player he is.

177
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:18,071
Come on.

178
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:19,040
It's your turn to play.

179
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:20,276
Go.

180
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,877
-Yes.

181
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:28,928
[grunting]

182
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:37,815
-Huh?

183
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,961
[shout]

184
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:45,365
[laughter]

185
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:48,706
-I think this is
going to be fun.

186
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:49,147
-You bet.

187
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:54,852
-Good morning.

188
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:55,328
-Oh.

189
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:56,130
Hey, guys.

190
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,265
Have you seen Waya?

191
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,134
-Yeah.

192
00:08:58,134 --> 00:08:59,136
Over there.

193
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,241
Waya: Internet Go
is a piece of cake.

194
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,113
-Easy for you say, but I don't
know anything about computers.

195
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:05,851
Since my cousin's
giving me his old one,

196
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:07,154
I guess I should learn.

197
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:08,156
-What kind?

198
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:09,759
-You know, I got no idea.

199
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:12,098
But once my cousin's got
it all set up for me,

200
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:14,035
maybe you could show me
how to play Go on it.

201
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:14,518
-Yeah.

202
00:09:14,518 --> 00:09:15,087
Sure.

203
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,189
Whenever.

204
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,093
-They're talking about
playing on the internet.

205
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:20,365
-That's where you play
against complete strangers

206
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:22,135
in a little box, isn't it?

207
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:22,611
-Huh?

208
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:23,579
Shindo?

209
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,650
You mean you've
actually played online?

210
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:26,419
Oh.

211
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:27,989
You can use a computer?

212
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:29,024
Way to go.

213
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:31,029
-Uh-- well not a lot.

214
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:33,535
Just a few times in
an internet cafe.

215
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:34,537
-I'm the one who played.

216
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,472
Not you.

217
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:37,242
-I don't have a
computer at home.

218
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,479
-Aw, too bad.

219
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,918
You get to meet any
good players online?

220
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:42,053
-Actually, quite a few.

221
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,924
It's a good way to
practice your game.

222
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:45,962
Sometimes even the
pros are on there.

223
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:47,231
-They play amateurs?

224
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:48,200
-Not all the time.

225
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,436
And it's just for fun.

226
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,574
Nobody uses their real
name, so sometimes it's

227
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:53,044
hard to tell for sure.

228
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:54,247
-Cool.

229
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,485
-There was one time where
a pro used his real name.

230
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:58,990
I remember being
surprised that he did it.

231
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,027
-Did you play him?

232
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,295
-Yeah.

233
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:02,932
At first I thought it was
just an amateur using his name

234
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:05,038
as a joke, until he thrashed me.

235
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,373
[laughter]

236
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:07,042
-Who was it?

237
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:08,044
-Ichiryu-sensei.

238
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:09,547
I did a bit of
checking up afterwards,

239
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,351
and it was definitely him.

240
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:13,689
-A real pro, huh?

241
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:15,493
-There's lots of them online.

242
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:18,167
There was one guy who seemed
to be as strong as the pros,

243
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,302
if not stronger.

244
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,206
He was online for
about two months

245
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,611
and then he just disappeared
and never came back.

246
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:25,248
-Stronger than the pros?

247
00:10:25,282 --> 00:10:27,487
-Online for about two months?

248
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,257
-Well, sounds like a lot of fun.

249
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,429
Once I figure out the
computer, let's play.

250
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:32,998
-Sure.

251
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:35,337
-Waya, do you remember the
name of that guy you thought

252
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,974
was stronger than the pros?

253
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:37,409
-Yeah.

254
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,279
It was Sai.

255
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:40,248
-Oh my.

256
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:42,119
-That's what I was afraid of.

257
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:44,457
-It was during the
summer break last year.

258
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:47,130
I only played him
once, but I logged on

259
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,538
to watch a lot of his other
games with other players.

260
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:53,077
-So I have played
Waya after all.

261
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,751
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): You
played hundreds of people.

262
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:58,522
-He was an amazing player.

263
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:01,261
As far as I know, he never lost.

264
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,566
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I've never
known him to lose either.

265
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,170
-And not just amateurs.

266
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:08,043
He managed to beat one of
the top pros from Korea.

267
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:08,778
-Oh?

268
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:11,384
They have pros over in Korea?

269
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,256
WAYA: Even Toya skipped an exam,
so he could play against Sai.

270
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,292
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Yeah.

271
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,495
I remember that.

272
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:19,769
-Anyway, he was a really
awesome guy to watch online.

273
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:22,174
Once summer break was
over, I kept logging on

274
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:26,550
to see if he was there,
but he never returned.

275
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:29,256
I'd like to play
him again some day.

276
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,561
Every time I log
on to play Go, he's

277
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:33,465
the first person I look for.

278
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:40,815
Although he played against
lots of different people,

279
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:44,022
he never chatted with
anyone, so his true identity

280
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:46,059
was like this big mystery.

281
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:47,463
No one knew who he was.

282
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:50,102
And then one day,
for some reason,

283
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:52,474
Sai sent me a message
after our game.

284
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:53,409
-What?

285
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:54,579
-Of course he beat
me, but then he

286
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:57,084
sent me a message
saying, strong, aren't I?

287
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:00,224
Don't you think that's
kind of childish?

288
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:00,748
-Huh.

289
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:05,736
Zelda.

290
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,277
Of course, you replied by
saying you were an insei.

291
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,149
I can't believe you were Zelda.

292
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:11,716
-Hikaru!

293
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:12,318
-Huh?

294
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,582
-Hm.

295
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:31,193
-How do you know about
my chat with Sai?

296
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:33,698
-If you're all ready,
it's time to begin.

297
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:35,302
-Onegaishimasu.

298
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:35,769
-Onegaishimasu.

299
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:44,187
WAYA (VOICEOVER):
It couldn't be.

300
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:48,831
Shindo-- could he be Sai?

301
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:49,600
No way.

302
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:50,502
Never in a million years.

303
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:02,711
-Huh.

304
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,540
[sigh]

305
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:09,477
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
We and my big mouth.

306
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,245
-Hikaru.

307
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:10,847
Worry about it later.

308
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:18,730
Hikaru.

309
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,534
Right now you have to focus your
attention on the game at hand.

310
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:21,470
Hikaru!

311
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:22,606
Did you hear what I just said?

312
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,577
Are you paying any
attention to me whatsoever?

313
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,282
You're going to lose
if you listen to me.

314
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:30,490
I mean, you'll lose if
you don't listen to me.

315
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,232
WAYA (VOICEOVER): I saw
lots of Sai's games online.

316
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:37,372
There's no way they
can be the same person.

317
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:41,681
Sai's a much stronger
player than this.

318
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:45,389
Still, it's kind of
weird, but there's

319
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,196
something about the way he
plays that reminds me of Sai.

320
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,709
Ah!

321
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:56,380
I can't let myself
get distracted.

322
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:06,703
But if he's not Sai, how
did he know about the game?

323
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:16,257
Could it be him after all?

324
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:16,740
No.

325
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,575
It can't be!

326
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:18,043
It can't be!

327
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:19,046
It can't be!

328
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:37,453
[panting]

329
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:44,936
I resign.

330
00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:46,473
-Huh?

331
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:48,410
-You did it, Hikaru.

332
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:50,548
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): That's
three straight wins.

333
00:14:50,548 --> 00:14:52,084
[laughter]

334
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,554
-That's it.

335
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:55,425
Now I get it.

336
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:55,993
Shindo!

337
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:56,962
-Huh?

338
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:59,000
-You're Sai's
student, aren't you?

339
00:14:59,033 --> 00:14:59,969
-What?

340
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:01,506
-You were sitting
right behind him

341
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:02,976
when he was playing me online.

342
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:03,610
Come on.

343
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:04,545
Admit it!

344
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:05,548
-Nearly right.

345
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:07,819
He wasn't behind
me. he was in front.

346
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:10,124
-So if you're learning
Go from this Sai,

347
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,663
then it would make
sense why Toya's

348
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:14,768
so dead set on playing you.

349
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:17,674
It's got to be because he
recognizes something of Sai

350
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:18,844
in the way you play your game.

351
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:20,748
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He's
sort of got it right

352
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:22,385
and he's sort of got it wrong.

353
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:24,455
SAI (VOICEOVER): Waya is
an intelligent young man.

354
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:25,992
-Answer me, Shindo!

355
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:29,033
How do you know about
my online game with Sai?

356
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,973
-Hm.

357
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,877
[whimper]

358
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:35,179
[clears throat]

359
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:38,520
-Waya, it was a total
accident that I happened

360
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:40,558
to see that game
between Zelda and Sai.

361
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:42,095
-Huh?

362
00:15:42,128 --> 00:15:44,868
-Remember I told you I went
into this internet cafe?

363
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:47,841
Well, I was waiting
for a computer

364
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,582
when I saw someone
playing go online.

365
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,821
I tried to look over his
shoulder at the game,

366
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:56,895
but it was already over.

367
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:58,565
Then the chat caught my eye.

368
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,502
I guess that's why
I remembered it.

369
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:04,778
-What did he look like?

370
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:05,847
-I don't know.

371
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,052
He left before I got
a chance to see him.

372
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,123
[sigh]

373
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:13,030
-Hikaru, you've become
quite accomplished liar.

374
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,769
-No thanks to you.

375
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,172
-So you don't know him.

376
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:23,720
You played a good game, Shindo.

377
00:16:23,753 --> 00:16:27,595
A lot of really great moves.

378
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:30,168
I think you're going
to be a strong player.

379
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:31,771
Maybe even as strong as Sai.

380
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:39,922
-Three straight wins.

381
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:42,260
And one of them against Waya.

382
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:44,766
[whimper]

383
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,069
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
The next guy I

384
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:48,173
played seemed intimidated by me.

385
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,047
I guess I must have
been playing well.

386
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,216
-I resign.

387
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:54,554
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): My
fourth win in a row.

388
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:55,791
It was great.

389
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:58,530
I thought I was on my way.

390
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,902
But then, I lost
game after game,

391
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:03,708
and started to wonder if I
was getting worse, not better.

392
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,810
It was pretty depressing.

393
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:13,095
-It was a real long
shot, but you did it.

394
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:14,765
I never thought you'd
actually make it

395
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,872
into the ranks of
the top 16 so fast.

396
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:20,278
-Now you're qualified for
the Young Lions tournament.

397
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:21,046
Way to go!

398
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,850
-Congratulations.

399
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:24,287
-Aw, thanks, guys.

400
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,124
-It wasn't that long
ago you were hanging

401
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:27,994
around the bottom
of the B-League.

402
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:29,031
-That.

403
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:31,168
Doesn't mean he's
any better than us.

404
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:34,275
-He set himself a difficult goal
and he managed to achieve it.

405
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:36,012
Why can't you be happy for him?

406
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:37,883
-I don't do that sort of thing.

407
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:40,021
-So when does the Young
Lions tournament take place?

408
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:41,124
Do you think Toya--

409
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:43,662
-Do you ever think about
anything else but Toya?

410
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,032
It's starting to get annoying.

411
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,603
-The tournament
starts next month.

412
00:17:46,636 --> 00:17:49,242
It takes place on Saturdays when
there aren't any insei classes.

413
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,012
-It doesn't just
happen on one day.

414
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:52,883
Because there's 16
pros and 16 insei,

415
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:54,854
that's a lot of matches
that have to be played.

416
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:56,691
About three Saturdays total.

417
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,295
-All the first round
matches are the insei

418
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:02,036
versus the pros-- without
a handicap, of course.

419
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:03,573
-What was it like last year?

420
00:18:03,606 --> 00:18:06,312
-The insei that won their
first matches were--

421
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:07,749
-Just five of us.

422
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,921
Isumi and I went on to win
our second round match,

423
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:11,791
although that's
as far as we got.

424
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,896
-It's awesome you got
that far against the pros.

425
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,898
-No, it's not.

426
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:16,000
-Huh?

427
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:17,804
-You've got to be able
to beat some of them,

428
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:19,742
if you want to
pass the pro exam.

429
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:22,215
The Young Lions is a good
way to see if you're ready.

430
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,052
-Will Kurata 5th Dan be playing?

431
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:25,187
-Nah, I doubt it.

432
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:27,125
I think he's over the age limit.

433
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,196
-Aw, hope I don't
have to play Sayaki.

434
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:30,131
-Why?

435
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:31,200
He's in your study
session, right?

436
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,938
-The most important
thing is that we all

437
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:34,709
make it through the first round.

438
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:35,844
-Hey.

439
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:39,218
Did you hear that Nakayama's
going to be there?

440
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,888
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Toya, last time

441
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:42,826
we met I couldn't
give you an answer.

442
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,401
-Why wait?

443
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:48,840
Why don't we play
a game right now?

444
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,044
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Now I'm ready.

445
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:52,114
Let's play.

446
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:04,073
ANNOUNCER: Mitsuru Mashiba,
age 17 from the Chiba region.

447
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:06,712
Studying under Hiroshi
Mizoguchi, 9th Dan.

448
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,017
[applause]

449
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:12,124
Akira Toya, age 13 from Tokyo.

450
00:19:12,158 --> 00:19:14,329
Studying under Koyo Toya Meijin.

00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,133
[applause]

00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:21,311
[laughter]

453
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,313
TOYA: Mr. Ogata.

454
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:24,017
Mr. Ogata!

455
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,291
Mr.-- uh.

456
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,295
-Hello, Toya.

457
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:32,703
Welcome to the pros.

458
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:35,007
-Uh.

459
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,010
Thank you, sir.

460
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:37,681
I'm looking forward to it.

461
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:41,923
[chatting]

462
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:54,071
-Kimihiro, I just wanted to
say thanks for everything.

463
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,787
-Don't be silly.

464
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,192
I'm the one who should
be thanking you.

465
00:19:58,225 --> 00:20:02,836
The only reason our Go club can
keep going is because of you.

466
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:03,938
Thank you.

467
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:05,976
We've had a lot of fun.

468
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,751
-Kimihiro, take care.

469
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:11,254
-You too.

470
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:12,791
-Thanks.

471
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:14,093
[laughter]

472
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:15,430
-Tetsuo.

473
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,367
Tetsuo.

474
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:18,504
-If it isn't Shindo.

475
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:22,078
-Before you go, you know
when I played that game

476
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:23,315
against the three of you?

477
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,854
Well, I just wanted to say--

478
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:26,922
-Ah forget it.

479
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:27,924
Doesn't matter.

480
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,528
You just take care of yourself.

481
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,998
-Hm.

482
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:33,403
I'm going to be the
best Go player ever.

483
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:34,806
-Hey, Shindo.

484
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,409
I'll look forward to seeing
your name in the papers

485
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:37,412
once you become a pro.

486
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,048
[shouts of goodbye]

487
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:39,750
-Just you wait!

488
00:20:39,783 --> 00:20:40,318
It won't be long.

489
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:48,168
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
The best player ever.

00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:57,155
[theme music]

492
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:26,148
changed since graduation.

493
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:27,783
SAI (VOICEOVER): They'll
need another player

494
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:29,652
if they're going to
enter tournaments.

495
00:22:32,388 --> 00:22:34,490
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Something
else must be going on.

496
00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:36,158
Akari and Yuki are ignoring me.

497
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:37,526
SAI (VOICEOVER):
There's certainly

498
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,429
are lot of tension in the air.

499
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:42,498
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Next
time-- a place to return.

500
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:46,635
What?

501
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,470
They don't want me to come
to the Go club anymore?

502
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:49,562
SAI (VOICEOVER): I told
you things were tense.
