00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:07,524
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a go board,

2
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:11,366
a spirit from the past known as
Fujiwara no Sai has returned.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,875
Visible only to Hikaru
Shindo, a master of go,

4
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:17,480
Sai seeks to play
the divine move.

5
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:19,451
[theme song]

6
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:48,383
-Can't see him.

7
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,421
I wonder where he could be.

8
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:51,022
Huh?

9
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:16,446
-Hikaru!

10
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:18,183
That was a terrible move!

11
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:27,586
What?

12
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:37,526
Although he made a mistake,
he didn't let it throw him.

13
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,765
He drew his opponent
in and managed

14
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:41,569
to turn a bad move around.

15
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:42,170
Hikaru.

16
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:22,259
-I wonder how Shindo's
been doing in his match.

17
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,590
-Toya is there.

18
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:36,892
And why is
Ogata-sensei watching?

19
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,189
-6 and 1/2 points.

20
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,226
-6 and 1/2 points?

21
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,298
That's a big gap.

22
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:56,435
-These pros are
way better than us.

23
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,574
-Hey, it turned out to
be a really good game.

24
00:03:58,607 --> 00:03:59,175
Thanks.

25
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:10,868
-Shindo.

26
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,204
-Huh?

27
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,576
What's up, Waya?

28
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,748
-Too bad you lost the game.

29
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,319
-That's OK.

30
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:20,389
At least I played well.

31
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:22,260
-So I see.

32
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:23,229
-Hm.

33
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,231
Huh?

34
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,467
How did Toya do?

35
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,637
-He won, of course.

36
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,174
Finished ages ago.

37
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:30,813
-Oh, never mind.

38
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,416
I wanted to play him.

39
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,488
Missed my chance.

40
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:35,824
-He was watching you.

41
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:36,859
-Huh?

42
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:39,198
-I saw him looking
over your shoulder.

43
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:41,570
He was watching you like a hawk.

44
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:42,740
It was really intense.

45
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,944
-How did you know
where to find me?

46
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:02,450
-I've seen you in
here before, so I

47
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:03,586
figured it was worth a try.

48
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:09,599
-You seem to be making good
progress in the Young Lions,

49
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,706
but I get the impression you're
not happy about something.

50
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,577
-Uh--

51
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,615
-I can tell your
heart isn't in it.

52
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,956
It's obvious there's
something bothering you.

53
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:22,361
It's Shindo, isn't it?

54
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:24,432
-You left the
tournament before I

55
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,504
had a chance to talk
to you yesterday.

56
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:28,909
There was something
I wanted to ask you.

57
00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:30,613
-I guessed as much.

58
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:32,918
I'm surprised you didn't
come and find me sooner.

59
00:05:35,657 --> 00:05:38,330
The same fish food, please,
but a little more this time.

60
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:39,566
-Ogata-sensei.

61
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:43,375
-You do know I'm playing
Kuwabara-sensei for his title.

62
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:46,582
That means I'm going to
be away for quite a while.

63
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:49,021
I need to focus on
winning the title match.

64
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:51,025
Of course, I need
to watch my step,

65
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:52,896
or else a young player
named Akira Toya

66
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,734
might take the title before me.

67
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:00,313
I'll give you a ride home.

68
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:03,954
Want to stop for some
sushi along the way?

69
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:05,090
-Ogata-sensei!

70
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,629
I need to know about
Shindo's match yesterday.

71
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,998
Something happened, didn't it?

72
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:11,738
Something important.

73
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:12,740
-Important?

74
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:13,809
Like what?

75
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:15,747
-By the time I got
there, Murakami 2-dan

76
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:18,386
was easily overpowering
Shindo in the end game.

77
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,690
But that's all I saw.

78
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:20,892
-So Shindo lost.

79
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:23,064
Isn't that enough for you?

80
00:06:23,097 --> 00:06:25,703
And it was by 6 and 1/2 points.

81
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:28,543
-From what I saw, he should
have lost by way more than 6

82
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:29,878
and 1/2 points.

83
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:32,885
Which means he must have put up
a pretty strong fight earlier

84
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,021
in the game.

85
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:36,059
Has Shindo really
improved so much

86
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,030
that he can hold his
own with the pros?

87
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,803
-You saw the board for yourself.

88
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:43,843
-Yeah, I know, but that's
not the whole story!

89
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:46,048
I can't work out how
they got to that point.

90
00:06:46,048 --> 00:06:48,453
It doesn't make any sense to me!

91
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:49,957
Something unusual happened.

92
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,496
You have to tell me what
was that Shindo did!

93
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:56,104
-Hop in the car.

94
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:57,407
I'll take you home.

95
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,104
-If you've got
questions about Shindo,

96
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:12,441
why don't you ask Murakami?

97
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:14,979
He is the one who played him.

98
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:17,385
-I tried to, but--

99
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:19,089
-You want to know
what Shindo did?

100
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,826
Why are you so
interested in that guy?

101
00:07:20,826 --> 00:07:21,794
He lost!

102
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:22,964
I won!

103
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:24,835
An insei ranked 16th?

104
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:26,505
He was easy.

105
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,577
And I'm the one you'll
be playing next,

106
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,619
so I suggest you start
worrying about me.

107
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,721
-I see.

108
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:35,592
You didn't like his
know it all attitude,

109
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,864
so you got your own
back by humiliating him

110
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:39,467
in front of everyone.

111
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,069
That'll teach him.

112
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:40,971
Poor guy.

113
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:41,939
-Forget about him!

114
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:43,744
What did Shindo do?

115
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:46,717
-I thought you said you didn't
care about Shindo anymore.

116
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,200
-Huh?

117
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,940
-There were times when he
was playing very skillfully.

118
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:57,542
-Huh?

119
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:03,755
-After making a
careless mistake,

120
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:06,093
he used the move
to his advantage.

121
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:07,931
It was a smart choice.

122
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:09,674
He didn't let the
fact that he made

123
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,979
a mistake affect the
rest of his game.

124
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:14,017
He drew his opponent
in and managed

125
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:17,291
to turn the game in his favor
with that one innovative move.

126
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:25,743
There's no rush.

127
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:26,713
-Hm?

128
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:29,017
-You'll get all the
answers you need

129
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:31,657
in just a couple
of months' time.

130
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,892
-The pro exam?

131
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,029
-That's right.

132
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:37,370
He's following the same
path you've been taking,

133
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:40,142
only he's doing it a year later.

134
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,189
--[sigh] This time yesterday,
we were all taking part

135
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:48,060
in the Young Lions Tournament.

136
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,265
I can't believe
it's over already.

137
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:54,207
It's boring having to
go back to normal again.

138
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,047
-Not many of us made it through
the first round this year.

139
00:08:57,047 --> 00:09:01,022
There was Asumi, Ochi, and
Adachi, and that was it.

140
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:03,327
-Ochi won the second
round match two.

141
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,331
-Yeah, but I don't think
he stands much chance

142
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:07,336
of getting through
the third round.

143
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:09,207
It's so depressing.

144
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,777
-You did really well, Waya.

145
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,181
Your game was so close.

146
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:13,718
Could have gone either way.

147
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:15,187
You were playing as
good as the pros.

148
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,223
-Yeah.

149
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,960
Sensei made a point
of telling you that.

150
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:20,265
-You've got to give
credit where credit's due.

151
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,902
Ochi's been awesome recently.

152
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,940
I haven't been able
to beat him for ages.

153
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:25,310
What about you, Isumi?

154
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:27,013
-We're about even, I think.

155
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:28,684
-Yeah, it's the same here.

156
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:30,789
Me and him are a
pretty good matchup.

157
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,659
-Hey, have you
guys ever noticed?

158
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:35,332
When Ochi loses, he goes and
locks himself in the bathroom.

159
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:37,237
-In the bathroom?

160
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,040
-I just noticed him
doing it recently.

161
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:41,312
After he loses, he
goes into the bathroom

162
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,316
and won't come out
for the longest time.

163
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,987
-You're kidding, right?

164
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:47,058
-If you listen carefully,
you can hear a tap,

165
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:51,201
tap, tap and strange mumbling
noises coming from inside.

166
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:53,306
If he loses his next
game in the Young Lions,

167
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,408
he'll do it for sure.

168
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:57,214
You'll hear him go tap,
tap, tap, like that.

169
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,985
-What do you think
he's doing in there?

170
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,288
-That is so weird.

171
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:01,991
-Even if his opponents
a really good pro,

172
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:04,932
and he's expecting to lose,
he'll still go in there

173
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:06,268
and then tap, tap, tap.

174
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:08,005
-Ew, creepy.

175
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:11,213
-Um, I'm playing
Ochi this afternoon.

176
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:13,317
-Well.

177
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,054
We want to see him
hide in the bathroom,

178
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:16,825
so you'd better
beat him, Shindo.

179
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:18,796
-He's not good
enough to beat Ochi.

180
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:21,836
He just lost by 6 and 1/2
points in his Young Lions game.

181
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,442
-It's too bad you didn't get
the chance to play against Toya.

182
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,279
-It's all right.

183
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:28,317
Yesterday I could feel
my game getting stronger.

184
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:36,435
The only way I'm going to
improve is if I keep playing.

185
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,308
I need more games like
the one yesterday.

186
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:41,246
More and more and more.

187
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:45,222
-Whoa.

188
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:47,894
-I know I can become stronger.

189
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:48,829
I know it!

190
00:10:48,863 --> 00:10:50,133
Whoa!

191
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,068
Sorry!

192
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:51,903
Here!

193
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:52,379
Sorry!

194
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:53,514
You OK?

195
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:56,989
-Were Ogata 9-dan and Akira
Toya watching that game

196
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,427
because they were
interested in Shindo?

197
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:00,096
-Thanks.

198
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,534
Have a nice day.

199
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:04,071
-The way you've
been talking, I'm

200
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:06,978
thinking we need to watch
out for you this summer.

201
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:07,445
-Why?

202
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,280
What's happening?

203
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:10,051
-The pro exam, of course.

204
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:12,123
-Oh, right.

205
00:11:12,123 --> 00:11:13,258
-What's wrong with you?

206
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:14,862
How could you forget about that?

207
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:19,039
That's the only reason
we're here as insei.

208
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:21,043
Once exam time
comes around, you'll

209
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:24,383
get to play all the games
you could ever want.

210
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,352
Dozens of games.

211
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,989
Day after day after day.

212
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:28,159
Hello!

213
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:32,134
We'll be fighting each
other not to get eliminated.

214
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:36,043
There'll be no
more Mr. Nice Guy.

215
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:39,551
Anyway, hope you beat
Ochi this afternoon.

216
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:40,519
-Thanks.

217
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,123
-Hey Waya, guess
who you're playing!

218
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:43,893
-Oh, not you again.

219
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:44,628
Give me a break.

220
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:46,332
-Not looking forward to it?

221
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:47,402
-Shut your pie hole!

222
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,106
-You're still having
trouble beating Fuku

223
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:50,943
after all this time?

224
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,081
-Just a run of bad
luck, that's all.

225
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:56,322
-Komiya has the same
problem with Fuku.

226
00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:58,526
-That's weird, because
I can beat him OK.

227
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,096
-Yeah, well, that's you, Isumi.

228
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,955
-Come on, Shindo, let's go.

229
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:41,489
-What?

230
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:42,425
Oh, right.

231
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,025
Sorry.

232
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:56,155
-What happened?

233
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,193
You looked like you were on
another planet or something.

234
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:00,565
-Got anything to do
with Kuwabara-sensei?

235
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:02,369
-Who's Kuwabara-sensei?

236
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,572
-You mean you don't know?

237
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:05,442
-He doesn't know anything.

238
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:06,746
That guy's famous.

239
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:09,051
He holds the Honinbo title.

240
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,320
-Honinbo?

241
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:11,389
That's pretty big.

242
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:18,038
-Is everything all
right, Kuwabara-sensei?

243
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:19,273
-I'm not sure.

244
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:22,347
You know, I sensed a rather
unusual presence just now.

245
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,215
-Oh, my.

246
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,686
You didn't see a ghost, did you?

247
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:25,721
-No, no ghost.

248
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,726
Something about that boy.

249
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,062
He's an insei.

250
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:33,104
I suppose I'll have
to keep it on him.

251
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:35,309
-Honinbo's one of the
major titles that's

252
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:38,650
been passed down for
generations and generations.

253
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,655
-It started in the
early Showa period.

254
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,359
After the first
tournament, the winner

255
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:44,764
started to give himself
the name Honinbo,

256
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:47,803
and then the tradition sort
of carried on from there.

257
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:49,107
-Huh.

258
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,445
-You've heard of some of
the other titles, right?

259
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,447
Like Meijin and Oza?

260
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,087
Well, the Honinbo
is like that, only

261
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,423
it's older than
the rest of them.

262
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:59,196
-So that old guy
calls himself Honinbo?

263
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,501
-I'm not sure I like that.

264
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:05,209
-Ogata-sensei is challenging
Kuwabara for the Honinbo title

265
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:06,044
right now.

266
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,515
-Ogata-sensei is that good?

267
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:09,252
-They play the best of seven.

268
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:12,159
The series of matches are
spread out over a few weeks.

269
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:14,396
Ogata-sensei won the
first game the other day,

270
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,403
and round two is going to
be happening this week.

271
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:19,174
-Anyone who wants
to try and challenge

272
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:21,479
the Honinbo for
the title has to go

273
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:23,316
through two years of
preliminary matches

274
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,154
before they get a
chance at the big one.

275
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:25,688
-No way!

276
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:26,691
It takes two years?

277
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:28,295
-You really don't
have a clue, do you?

278
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:30,466
Ever thought about
doing a bit of research

279
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:31,802
into the world of go?

280
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:34,441
-I can do all that
once I've turned pro.

281
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:36,780
-With that attitude,
he might just make it.

282
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:51,646
-I need to keep playing.

283
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,718
I know I can become stronger.

284
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:55,321
I know it.

285
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:58,127
I have to.

286
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,832
-Hm.

287
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,604
Hikaru, you should have played
a large knight's move there, not

288
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:04,208
a small one.

289
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,645
-A large knight's move?

290
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:07,615
But you've been telling
me that I should always

291
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,885
use a small one.

292
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,324
-They're both very similar,
but the large knight's move

293
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:13,763
involves a slightly
more advanced technique.

294
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:17,270
So up to now, I've encouraged
you to use the small knight's

295
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:20,411
move because it makes it easier
to predict what will happen

296
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:23,284
in the game and reduces
the opportunity for error.

297
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:25,455
Now, if you use the
large knight's move,

298
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:26,892
it makes things
more complicated,

299
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,531
and you have to plan
your game accordingly.

300
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:31,369
-OK.

301
00:15:31,402 --> 00:15:34,843
-Hikaru, I think you're ready to
take on that sort of challenge

302
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,213
now.

303
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:36,655
-Right.

304
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:40,823
Hm.

305
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,362
-Why the hesitation?

306
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:45,767
-I am getting
stronger, aren't I?

307
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,404
-Yes, you are.

308
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:50,645
Since the Young Lions, you've
been playing at a higher level.

309
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:52,348
Why do you ask?

310
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:54,553
-I was thinking about Akira.

311
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,859
It's kind of weird,
knowing that we're

312
00:15:56,892 --> 00:16:00,701
both playing in the
same room as each other.

313
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:03,841
I'm in there playing on Sundays
and every other Saturday,

314
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:09,319
but as a pro, he's in there
on Wednesdays or Thursdays.

315
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:12,527
Even though we never
actually see each other,

316
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,400
I can feel his presence
there in the room with me.

317
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,543
It's like a fire burning
inside pushing me on.

318
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:22,283
I've gotta work
really hard on my game

319
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,620
so I can pass the pro exam!

320
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:27,427
-Yes, summer will be
here before we know it.

321
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:28,463
-You bet.

322
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:29,833
And then I'll get my
chance to play Toya.

323
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:54,755
-Hokkaido, here I come.

324
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:10,690
-Good evening, Ogata.

325
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:12,562
-Have you just arrived?

326
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:13,664
-Yes, that's right.

327
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:17,004
It's so easy to travel
to Hokkaido nowadays.

328
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:18,374
Here's an idea.

329
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:20,378
Why don't we skip
the prematch ceremony

330
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:23,385
and go for a night on the
town, just the two of us?

331
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:24,387
-No thanks.

332
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:26,326
I'm afraid I'm not
really interested.

333
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,499
-You're no fun at all.

334
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:33,575
-Oh, look, honey, that's
Kuwabara, the championship

335
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:34,577
go player.

336
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:35,613
-That's nice.

337
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:38,519
I've never heard of him.

338
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,788
-Excuse me!

339
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:41,994
I don't suppose you've got a
pen and paper you could borrow,

340
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:42,996
do you?

341
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,901
-Come on, dear,
don't be so childish.

342
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:46,671
-How can you think
of going out when

343
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:49,543
we got two days of
matches ahead of us?

344
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:50,914
-You need to lighten up.

345
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:53,787
Stop taking things so seriously.

346
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:56,961
-Sorry to interrupt, but
aren't you Kuwabara Honinbo?

347
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:57,930
-Yes, that's me.

348
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,400
What can I do for you?

349
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,070
-I was wondering if
you'd be willing to let

350
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,072
me have your autograph.

351
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:03,676
I'm such a big fan.

352
00:18:03,676 --> 00:18:08,353
It would mean so much to me
if you would do me the honor.

353
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:10,892
-If an old guy like me is
getting all this attention,

354
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:13,966
it doesn't say much for the
future of go, does it, now?

355
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:16,003
Wouldn't you agree, Ogata?

356
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:17,573
-Ogata?

357
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:18,408
-How's this?

358
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:20,680
I hope it's all right.

359
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:21,482
-Thank you.

360
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:24,021
Thank you!

361
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:26,059
Thank you!

362
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:28,965
-Now, Ogata, you may have
beaten me in the first match,

363
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:31,371
but I won't allow
it to happen again.

364
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,043
Anyone who tries to take the
title of Honinbo away from me

365
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:37,985
will find this old man won't
give up without a fight.

366
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:41,059
-Kuwabara-sensei,
there is a new wave

367
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:43,464
about to sweep the world of go.

368
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:45,803
-What do you mean?

369
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:48,475
-I can feel it coming.

370
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:51,014
The next generation is
coming up through the ranks.

371
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:53,420
A wave of new young pros.

372
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:54,423
-Huh?

373
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,160
Is that so?

374
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,032
-I want to be there when
this wave crashes on shore.

375
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:03,509
I want to be there to take them
on as the holder of the Honinbo

376
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:03,984
title.

377
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,159
-Excuse me, gentlemen.

378
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,100
All the preparations for the
ceremony are now complete.

379
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,472
If you would please follow me?

380
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:17,842
-All this talk of
waves means I've

381
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,846
lost my chance to sneak
out and enjoy myself.

382
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:40,057
-Hey, everyone.

383
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:40,926
-Hi.

384
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,663
Did you hear the
latest news yet?

385
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:45,235
Akira Toya has
moved up to 2-dan.

386
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:45,837
-What?

387
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:47,107
Already?

388
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,109
Oh, wow.

389
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:56,728
It won't be too long.

390
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,134
I'm gonna catch up
to you, Akira Toya.

391
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:00,203
Just you wait.

392
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:06,082
-Yes!

393
00:20:06,115 --> 00:20:07,619
And he resigns!

394
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:08,889
One more win for Waya.

395
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,768
Shindo's game has improved
a lot since the Young Lions

396
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:16,004
Tournament.

397
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:17,775
I'm gonna have to make sure
I don't let my guard down.

398
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,629
Kadowaki?

399
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:29,301
Kadowaki?

400
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:30,971
-You sure about that?

401
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,708
The same guy who held
the Student Meijin

402
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:35,014
title, the Student Honinbo
title, and the Student Joketsu

403
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:36,250
title at the same time?

404
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:37,887
That Kadowaki?

405
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:38,756
-You've got it.

406
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:40,626
He's the same guy, all right.

407
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,965
Everyone was talking
about him back then.

408
00:20:42,998 --> 00:20:45,804
What's he up to now?

409
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:47,642
-According to the
rumors on the internet,

410
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:49,780
he's going to take the pro exam.

411
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,785
[theme song]

412
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:22,954
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
This Kadowaki guy

413
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:24,859
sounds like someone we
need to watch out for.

414
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:26,228
SAI (VOICEOVER):
Well, he certainly

415
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,900
has an impressive reputation.

416
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,870
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Just
like Kuwabara Honinbo,

417
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:32,109
out to defend his title.

418
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,913
SAI (VOICEOVER):
Ogata-sensei has made it

419
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:35,972
through to the seventh and
final game of the series.

420
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:37,492
The decider!

421
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:43,946
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Next
time, Ogata vs. the Honinbo!

422
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,614
SAI (VOICEOVER): It
looks like you've

423
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,751
got a fight on your
hands in the pro exam.
