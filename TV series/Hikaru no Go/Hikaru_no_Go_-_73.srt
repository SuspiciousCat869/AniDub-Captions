[theme music]

2
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,411
-Isumi's definitely gonna
be one of the front runners.

3
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,646
He looks very confident.

4
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,147
Not at all like last year.

5
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:02,022
-First you beat Murakami,
and now Tsujioka.

6
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:06,126
-We're not going to let these
greenhorns take over just yet.

7
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,395
-With all due respect,
Kuwabara-sensei, Ogata

8
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,097
here isn't exactly a greenhorn.

9
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,398
He has won two titles.

10
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,700
-Hm.

11
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,601
WOMAN: It's amazing.

12
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,703
Back then Toya was
just a One-Dan,

13
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,272
and he's made it to
the Honinbo league.

14
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,611
-Miyake called to say that
Koyo Toya signed a contract

15
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,147
to play for Beijing in China.

16
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,283
-I get a sense that there's a
momentous change on the way,

17
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,219
don't you?

18
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,122
Something's about to
happen in the world og Go.

19
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:42,529
The new wave is
coming, and Akira Toya

20
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,564
is definitely leading the way.

21
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,448
-If it isn't Shindou!

22
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,582
What are you doing here?

23
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,284
Are you scheduled
to play a game?

24
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,452
-Hi, Mr. Kurata.

25
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,687
No, no game today.

26
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:10,157
I'm here for my study session
with Morashita-sensei.

27
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:13,660
-I just saw the pairings for the
Meijin tournament qualifiers.

28
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,530
Your first match is
against Akira Toya!

29
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,230
-Yeah.

30
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:17,998
And you know what?

31
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,166
It's all thanks to you.

32
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,300
-Thanks to me?

33
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,535
How?

34
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,470
-The only reason he has to play
in all the qualifying rounds

35
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:27,674
this year is because you
managed to beat him last year.

36
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,010
He's made it to the finals
in every other tournament,

37
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,078
but not the Meijin.

38
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,546
It seems like he doesn't
want to come down

39
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,749
to my level or something.

40
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,284
-Well, what do you expect?

41
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,352
He is Akira Toya, after all.

42
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,722
-I know, but he's so busy
playing in other tournaments,

43
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:45,258
our game hasn't even
been scheduled yet.

44
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,027
I should get going.

45
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,494
-Hey!

46
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,562
Shindou!

47
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,563
Tell you what.

48
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,131
If you beat Toya,
make sure to bring

49
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,133
that half signed autograph.

50
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,267
-What?

51
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,402
Autograph?

52
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,537
-Remember, when I
gave you my autograph,

53
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,172
I only signed half of it.

54
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:03,677
If you bear Toya, I'll sign
the other half for you.

55
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,545
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Oh no!

56
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,381
What did I do with it?

57
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,150
-Think of it as
a special reward.

58
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,685
How about that for motivation?

59
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:16,456
-Well, thanks but I don't
really need extra motivation.

60
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,457
-What?

61
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,126
You don't need any
extra motivation?

62
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:22,262
You sure it's wise to be
that confident against Toya?

63
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,664
-Well, no, I wouldn't
say that exactly.

64
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,032
-Well, OK then.

65
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,401
I hope your game gets
scheduled really soon.

66
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,303
I'm gonna look forward
to seeing the results.

67
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,305
See you!

68
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,306
-Uh, bye.

69
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,679
Hope your game gets
scheduled really soon.

70
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,149
-Yeah, I wonder when
I am going to play.

71
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,216
-Oh no!

72
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,351
I'm gonna be late for
the study session.

73
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,166
-Ever since he
started playing again,

74
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,333
Shindou's improved immensely.

75
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,007
I've got no idea what happened
to him while he was out

76
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,710
of action, but
whatever it was, he

77
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,679
seems to have put it
all behind him now.

78
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:35,969
-I resign.

79
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,541
-No doubt about it,
Shindou's turned

80
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,677
into a very strong player.

81
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,278
One of the best.

82
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,581
-This block you played here
was what really did me in.

83
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,716
It was like you planned
it from the start.

84
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,285
You managed to break through
every single one of my groups,

85
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,288
so in the end, there
was nothing I could do.

86
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,023
-Shindou, if you keep
playing like that,

87
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,091
you're gonna do just fine.

88
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,092
HIKARU: Yes sir!

89
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,694
-And Saeki, you gotta
do better if you

90
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,196
want to beat Koyo Toya's
protege, Ashiwara!

91
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,264
SAEKI: Yes, sir.

92
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,599
-And as for you, Waya.

93
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,534
-I don't know if
I wanna hear this.

94
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,635
-What are you talking about?

95
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,569
Of course you do.

96
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,037
Don't slack off,
or Shindou's gonna

97
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,572
pass you in no time at all.

98
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,208
-Yeah, I kind of
already know that.

99
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,741
-Play me next.

100
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:18,443
Are you up for it, Shindou?

101
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:19,477
-OK.

102
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,011
Onegai shimasu.

103
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,711
Toya.

104
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:31,689
I'll play against
you anytime you want.

105
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:38,704
I'm home!

106
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,767
Some mail came for you today.

107
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,837
The Go Association sent you
this notice of your next game.

108
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,638
-My next game?

109
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:49,440
No way!

110
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:51,609
They finally scheduled it.

111
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:53,678
Two weeks from today.

112
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:54,509
Toya.

113
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:06,557
Let's see.

114
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,626
This is Toya's game record
from the Honinbo championship.

115
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,745
From now on, our
game has started.

116
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:34,752
Toya, you and I have
to play each other.

117
00:07:39,757 --> 00:07:42,093
I know that you've always
wanted to play against Sai,

118
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:43,494
but he isn't here anymore.

119
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:49,934
Except he is in my game.

120
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,203
He's in every one of my moves.

121
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,605
But I can't expect you
to understand that.

122
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:02,146
I'll make myself strong
enough to beat you!

123
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,515
I'm gonna play at
your level now.

124
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:10,988
You ready?

125
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:29,607
AKARI: Aw, I've gone
way down in the class

126
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,075
ranking since the midterms.

127
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:32,810
GIRL: You've got your
rankings already?

128
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,212
We didn't get ours yet.

129
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:36,714
I bet our teacher
just forgot about it.

130
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:38,616
-See you later, Akari!

131
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:39,984
-Goodbye!

132
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:40,585
Huh?

133
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:06,711
Hikaru?

134
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:07,745
-Hm?

135
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:10,081
Oh, uh, hey Akari.

136
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,917
-I just wanted to wish you
luck for your game against Toya

137
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,018
tomorrow.

138
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:15,653
-How'd you know
when I was playing?

139
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:17,121
-I saw it listed in "Go Weekly."

140
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:19,023
You know, the column
where they tell

141
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:21,859
you the schedule of all the
upcoming tournament matches?

142
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:29,967
You must get really nervous
the day before a big game.

143
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,069
-What do you mean?

144
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,471
-I don't know.

145
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:35,873
You've just got this
serious look on your face.

146
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:36,474
-Hm.

147
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:41,579
This match against
Toya is a big one,

148
00:09:41,612 --> 00:09:43,080
so maybe I'm a
little bit nervous.

149
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,105
Hm.

150
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:55,793
Akari.

151
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:57,528
What are you up to right now?

152
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:58,496
-What?

153
00:09:58,496 --> 00:09:59,964
Nothing, really.

154
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:02,099
Interested in playing some Go?

155
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,201
It might help me take my
mind of tomorrow's match

156
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:05,703
if I play a game with you.

157
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:12,577
-I'd love to have a game
with you, but I don't think--

158
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,811
I'm not sure--

159
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:14,679
-All right, come on.

160
00:10:14,712 --> 00:10:15,746
Let's go to my place.

161
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:21,452
Hm?

162
00:10:21,485 --> 00:10:22,086
What's the matter?

163
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,694
-Hikaru.

164
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:32,930
You've changed.

165
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:34,732
-You think so?

166
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:35,666
-Yes.

167
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,168
For sure.

168
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,804
Maybe it's just 'cause
you're a pro now,

169
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:43,040
but you seem much more mature.

170
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,476
-I've noticed a
change in you too.

171
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:46,294
-Really?

172
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:47,413
You mean it?

173
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:50,681
So, tell me.

174
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:52,617
How do you think I've changed?

175
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,651
-Hm.

176
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:56,621
You've gotten shorter.

177
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:57,955
-I haven't gotten shorter!

178
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:59,490
You're taller!

179
00:10:59,523 --> 00:11:02,193
[laughing]

180
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:04,895
-Hey, don't laugh at me.

181
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:07,765
You can be such a jerk
sometimes, you know that?

182
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:26,751
MITSUKO: Are you leaving, dear?

183
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:27,485
-Yes.

184
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:28,853
I'm going now.

185
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,035
-I'm leaving now.

186
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:07,658
-You've got a big
game today, Saeki.

187
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:08,793
-That's right.

188
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:12,063
Against Koyo Toya's
protege, Ashiwara.

189
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:13,964
-Can you imagine what
Morashita-sensei's

190
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:15,433
gonna say if you lose this one?

191
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:16,634
He'll blow his top.

192
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:17,501
-Thanks a lot.

193
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,070
Like I need any more pressure.

194
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:20,137
-Good morning, Saeki.

195
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,038
How are you?

196
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:23,174
-Uh, Mr. Ashiwara--

197
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:26,177
-Good morning to you too, Waya.

198
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,511
-Oh, hey there.

199
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:28,512
Good morning.

200
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:30,881
-Well, I guess I
should wish you luck.

201
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:34,618
Here's to a good game.

202
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:36,620
-You know, I've started
to realize something.

203
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:38,089
-Yeah, what?

204
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:40,758
-This rivalry with
Toya-sensei's students,

205
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,159
I think we feel it
just because we're

206
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:44,462
in Morashita's study class.

207
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:46,097
I mean, doesn't
it seem like we're

208
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,100
the only ones getting worked
up before our matches?

209
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:51,769
-I don't even want to
think about it right now.

210
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:57,641
-Hey.

211
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:58,576
Waya.

212
00:12:58,609 --> 00:12:59,777
Mr. Saeki.

213
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,845
-Hi, Shindou.

214
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:01,545
-Oh, hello.

215
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:02,913
-Good to see you.

216
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:04,081
-Guess what?

217
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:06,517
Isumi gave me a call last night.

218
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:09,653
He told me he just
passed the pro exam.

219
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:10,121
-Really?

220
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:11,522
That's great!

221
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:14,125
But isn't there still a few
more games left to play?

222
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:15,926
-Well, yeah, but
he's undefeated,

223
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,928
so his win yesterday
means he's through.

224
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,230
-That's awesome!

225
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:20,931
-And he wants me
to look after him

226
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:23,033
and give him a few tips
now that he's a pro.

227
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:25,436
I better work hard if I'm
gonna stay ahead of him.

228
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,204
-So, Isumi passed the exam, huh?

229
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:29,073
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Uh, hey, Mashiba.

230
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,474
-Well, it's about time.

231
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:31,909
He sure took long enough.

232
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,911
-Mashiba!

233
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:35,913
-Now he's a pro, he'll
probably move up the ranks

234
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:37,014
pretty quickly.

235
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:38,015
He's a strong player.

236
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:43,854
Every year, another bunch of
guys come on to the scene.

237
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:46,123
Doesn't make it easy
for the rest of us.

238
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:48,025
I'm not gonna lose today, Waya!

239
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:52,763
-What was that all about?

240
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,198
Is he your opponent?

241
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:57,034
-You got it.

242
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:58,869
And you're gonna be
playing Toya, right?

243
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:07,077
[ding]

244
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,446
-I won't know until I play him.

245
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:15,786
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Toya.

246
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,001
-Ochi.

247
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:06,937
What were you and Toya talking
about just before you came out

248
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:08,172
of the elevator?

249
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:10,007
-Well, he started
the conversation

250
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,010
by offering me congratulations
on my winning streak.

251
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,945
-Yeah, and then what?

252
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:17,214
-I told him my winning streak
was nothing compared to him

253
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:18,849
making it all the way
to the Honinbo league

254
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:20,084
and playing for the title.

255
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:31,061
Then I asked him
about today's game.

256
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:32,930
I said something about
how it's probably

257
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:35,799
going to be an easy
win against Shindou.

258
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,502
-Then I bet he said, yeah,
of course it'll be easy.

259
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:40,604
He thinks he's such
a big shot, and only

260
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:42,206
has to face the top
ranked players now.

261
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,844
Come on, Ochi, tell me.

262
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:47,578
What did he said?

263
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:53,216
-He said, I won't
know until I play him.

264
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:54,016
-Huh?

265
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:58,856
-Don't you remember back
when Shindou was an Insei?

266
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,025
There was a rumor
around that Toya

267
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:02,860
considered him to be a rival.

268
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:03,794
-Well, yeah.

269
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:05,195
But none of us
took it seriously.

270
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:07,197
We all thought it was a joke.

271
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:10,634
Maybe it was true, after all.

272
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:13,671
-We can't just sit back and
let these two take over.

273
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:14,672
-You're right.

274
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:17,942
They haven't seen what I can do.

275
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:18,609
-Waya?

276
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:19,643
-Huh?

277
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:21,779
-You're my opponent
next week, right?

278
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,948
My winning streak
will keep on going.

279
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:24,915
-You little nerd!

280
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:27,918
I'm gonna crush you!

281
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:30,087
-I'd better take some of
that fighting spirit of yours

282
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,821
with me.

283
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:31,689
-Yeah!

284
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:33,057
Let's give it all we got, Saeki!

285
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:48,733
-Uh, hey, Toya.

286
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:52,737
We finally get to
play each other again.

287
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,739
-The last time the
two of us played

288
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:56,474
was in the school
Go club tournament.

289
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:06,851
Two years and four months ago.

290
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:09,620
-It's been a long
time since then.

291
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,522
-I know.

292
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:12,657
It's been too long.

293
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,112
-I happened to see your
game against Zama-sensei

294
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:36,247
in Go Weekly.

295
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,783
It was really close.

296
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,551
I mean, you played
great, but the lead

297
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:43,754
he built up early in the game
was impossible to overcome.

298
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:45,489
-He's the former Oza.

299
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:47,391
I wasn't expecting to
beat someone like him

300
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,527
on my first attempt.

301
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,264
However, the next time we
meet, things will be different.

302
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:57,401
I won't be the same
player then that I am now.

303
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:59,103
-I've had a chance
to see how strong you

304
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:00,738
are by looking at the game
records of your matches

305
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:02,573
against Zama-sensei
and Hagiwara Nine-Dan.

306
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,612
Now it's your chance to
see how strong I've become.

307
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:11,115
It may be two years and four
months since we last played,

308
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:12,783
but I haven't been
wasting my time.

309
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,489
[buzzer]

310
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,512
-Onegai shimasu.

311
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:15,246
-Onegai shimasu.

312
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:33,731
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): OK, Toya.

313
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:34,431
Let's begin.

314
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:52,483
3, 4 point in the
upper right corner.

315
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,852
Hm?

316
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:56,220
That was fast.

317
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:10,367
He's not playing like he's
got five hours on the clock.

318
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:12,837
He's playing speed Go.

319
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,372
It's like he's been
waiting for this game.

320
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,722
He didn't respond
to my approach.

321
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:36,327
Instead, he decided to
make an attack of his own.

322
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:38,329
If he wants to go
straight on the offensive,

323
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,496
that's fine with me.

324
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:46,403
He's not the only one.

325
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,405
I've been waiting
for this game too.

326
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:56,747

327
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:22,800
HIKARU: Toya's putting
a lot of pressure

328
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,336
on me by playing so
quickly, but I'll

329
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:28,405
play my strongest game ever.

330
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:30,107
I'll play just like Sai.

331
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,509
And that's when
Toya will realize.

332
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:33,310
-It's you.

333
00:22:33,344 --> 00:22:34,511
-He thinks I'm Sai!

334
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:47,558
Next time, The Power Within!
