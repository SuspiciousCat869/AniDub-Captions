00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:07,480
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:10,419
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:13,191
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:17,599
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

5
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:21,172
[theme music]

6
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,772
-We're at one win and one loss.

7
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:53,341
It's all up to Kimihiro now.

8
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,241
PRINCIPAL: There's a Go
tournament taking place

9
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:12,310
here today.

10
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:14,514
Several middle
schools are competing.

11
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:16,150
Feel free to drop
in and have a look

12
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:17,285
around once we're finished.

13
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,454
-Uh, OK.

14
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:20,425
-Now, it's come to my
attention that you've just

15
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,529
applied to our school.

16
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:25,200
There's something
I want to ask you.

17
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:26,269
-Yes sir?

18
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:28,105
-I want you to consider
joining our Go club.

19
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:30,109
You'd be a fantastic
addition to our team.

20
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:30,811
What do you say?

21
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:32,714
-But sir, I don't think--

22
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:35,385
-Please, just hear
me out for a second.

23
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:37,556
I know your goal is to
play Go professionally.

24
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:40,328
I bet you're thinking our club
won't be challenging enough.

25
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:41,798
If we had someone
with your skill,

26
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,400
it would inspire
the other players.

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,771
They would try harder, because
the bar would be set higher.

28
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:48,577
You'd be a hero to them.

29
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,547
-I'm sorry, sir.

30
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,782
But I can't.

31
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:53,419
It's nice of you to
say those things,

32
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:54,621
but I'm just not that good.

33
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,831
MAN: There's no shame in being
talented, and you, young man,

34
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:01,200
are bursting with talent.

35
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:02,368
Besides.

36
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:05,308
You'll never turn pro with
that attitude, will you?

37
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:06,409
-I-- I guess you're right.

38
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:37,700
-Your friend has won.

39
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:38,702
-You sure?

40
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:46,349
BOY: White's score, counting
the Komi, 60 and 1/2 points.

41
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:54,698
-Black's score is
only 61 points.

42
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,436
-You stayed ahead of
him the first half.

43
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:00,509
-He made up a 20 point
deficit in the end game?

44
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:02,513
-Your first moves are
pathetic, but at least you

45
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:04,850
know how to finish a game.

46
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:06,720
-I can sure count up territory.

47
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:08,222
-Too bad your opening stinks.

48
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:10,193
At least you're not
totally clueless.

49
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:11,462
-Hey, Captain.

50
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:14,401
Make yourself useful and report
on the results, all right?

51
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:17,606
-Haze Middle is the winner
with two wins and one loss.

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,646
MAN: Haze Middle School
advances to the second round.

53
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,717
MAN: Haze made it
through the first round?

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,755
BOY: That's impressive for
such an inexperienced team.

55
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:27,659
-Both of you played
awesome games.

56
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:29,562
Those were two huge wins.

57
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:30,931
-And one huge loss.

58
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:32,668
Way to go, rookie.

59
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:34,905
-Players, the second
round will now begin.

60
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:35,874
Please take your seats.

61
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,287
-I resign.

62
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,556
MAN: Ikashita!

63
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:06,329
You didn't even try to enter
the upper right hand corner.

64
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:07,899
If you had played the
three, three point,

65
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,602
you could have hung on.

66
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:10,805
-Wouldn't have helped.

67
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:13,643
If he had invaded, I'd
have killed his stones.

68
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:17,316
And even if I didn't,
he was still gonna lose.

69
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:18,351
Listen.

70
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,622
Count up his
territory, professor.

71
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:22,793
Resigning was the only
thing he could've done!

72
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:28,671
-Kaio Middle School is the
winner, three to nothing.

73
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,507
-Whoa, that didn't
take long, did it?

74
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,944
Kaio's in top form.

75
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:33,713
-They always make the finals.

76
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:34,849
Reminds me of last year.

77
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,722
TETSUO (VOICEOVER):
This guy is stronger

78
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,826
than the guy who
was playing before.

79
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,600
He's going to lose by
at least five points.

80
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:46,804
BOY: I can't believe
I got so stressed out.

81
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,373
What was I worried for?

82
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:50,043
He isn't that good, after all.

83
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:54,017
BOY: Hey.

84
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,621
Check out the kid
that I'm up against.

85
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:58,325
He's the one that cleared our
board and replayed our game.

86
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,294
-That's him all right.

87
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:00,429
His whole team is weak.

88
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:02,967
Their captain's the only
decent player they've got.

89
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,570
-We can crush these two.

90
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,876
This round's gonna be a breeze.

91
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,412
-Let's see what we got here.

92
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,354
Hm.

93
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:16,292
Your playing style is
kind of interesting,

94
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:18,362
but it's too crude for my taste.

95
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:20,432
Needs work, if you ask me.

96
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,703
-That's exactly what I said.

97
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:25,642
Sometimes, Hikaru has
an amazing instinct

98
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,478
which guides his potential.

99
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,783
But just as often,
his immaturity

100
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:34,892
causes him to play impulsive,
disappointing moves.

101
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:37,464
-Hm?

102
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,000
Come back!

103
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,703
-Now it's one win
and one loss apiece.

104
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:45,311
TETSUO: If we don't
win this tournament,

105
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:48,317
there's not gonna be a
Go club at Hazo Middle.

106
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:49,953
It's all up to you now, kid.

107
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:51,322
-Huh?

108
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:53,493
-The only reason Kimihiro
kept his mouth shut

109
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:55,964
is because he thought you'd
buckle under the pressure!

110
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,066
-Really?

111
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,870
You guys should've told
me this stuff before!

112
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:00,339
-You wanna know everything?

113
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,742
A bunch of guys
from the Shogi Club

114
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:03,378
got together and
threatened Kimihiro.

115
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:06,017
You'd better stop messing around
and start winning some games

116
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:08,086
or he's gonna have
a tough time showing

117
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,457
his face in school next week.

118
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:11,426
-What?

119
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:12,528
Those bullies can't
push him around!

120
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:14,031
We gotta do something.

121
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:16,468
-Then pull it together and
try winning for a change!

122
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,673
I can't believe you're the
same kid who almost beat me

123
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:19,775
the other day.

124
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:21,077
-I'd appreciate it if
you guys could be quiet.

125
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,387
-You're about to run
out of time, Hikaru.

126
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:27,890
Better make a move,
or you'll forfeit.

127
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,381
-Sai.

128
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:01,518
Help.

129
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:03,088
There's too much
on the line now.

130
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:05,526
I need you give me a hand.

131
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,529
I don't know what to do.

132
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:10,167
If I lose, so does Kimihiro.

133
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:12,471
Please.

134
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:15,077
-But you requested that
I not play at all today.

135
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,147
[sobbing]

136
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,982
-Wait, stop!

137
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,418
Don't cry!

138
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:20,520
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:21,622
I'm so sorry.

140
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:26,564
The limitations
of your abilities

141
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:28,401
are causing you such anguish.

142
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:29,570
I'm here now.

143
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:30,806
I'm here to help.

144
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,010
Together, we will join forces.

145
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:35,948
We will summon our
collective will and win!

146
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:40,056
Wipe the tears from your
eyes and focus your mind.

147
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,559
Now pick up a stone.

148
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,527
Attach at eight, three.

149
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,662
-Huh.

150
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:04,000
They sure got fancy
restrooms here.

151
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,035
-The kid.

152
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:06,771
He just one.

153
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:07,840
-Seriously?

154
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,876
Are you sure?

155
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:10,845
That means we can
still win this thing.

156
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,549
-My guy was right about him.

157
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:15,087
He can play a mean game.

158
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,124
I'm looking forward
to the final showdown.

159
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,595
It'll be really something if
we brought the championship

160
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:21,665
home to Haze.

161
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:22,902
-Incredible.

162
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:24,871
I can't believe we've
actually gotten this far.

163
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:25,740
-Listen.

164
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,744
Throw out that book, will you?

165
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:29,113
You're hudding a go manual!

166
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:30,916
You gotta stop this.

167
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:33,453
Why don't you grow up already?

168
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:35,124
One down, one to go.

169
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,593
The rookie's got me worried.

170
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,062
His first game was a joke.

171
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:40,500
But he really came back
in the second match.

172
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:43,172
Hope he holds it together.

173
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:45,108
MAN: The championship
round is about to begin.

174
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:48,048
Will the teams from Kaio
Middle and Haze Middle please

175
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:48,815
take their seats?

176
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:55,094
TETSUO: Kimihiro!

177
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:55,695
Let's go!

178
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:29,056
-Begin your matches now.

179
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:29,824
-Onegai shimasu.

180
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:42,882
-I'm glad we finally had a
chance to sit down and chat.

181
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:43,749
-Me, too.

182
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:45,153
My father asked me to say hello.

183
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,655
He always talks
about your school.

184
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:51,230
-When your dad was
a student here,

185
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:52,666
I was his homeroom teacher.

186
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,269
Did you know that?

187
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:57,108
Our facilities weren't always
as modern as they are now.

188
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:59,813
You know where your father
and I used to have to play Go?

189
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:01,282
In the night watchman's office.

190
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:02,851
Several students
and teachers swore

191
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:04,555
that the room was
haunted, but it never

192
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:05,657
seemed to bother your dad.

193
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,859
[laughter]

194
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:07,961
-Are you serious?

195
00:11:07,994 --> 00:11:10,599
My father played a game
against Hikaru Shindo?

196
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:11,668
-Yeah.

197
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:13,304
I can't imagine why
he didn't tell you.

198
00:11:13,537 --> 00:11:15,541
I ran into him on the
street and invited him in.

199
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,044
He didn't stay long.

200
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:17,812
-He won the game?

201
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:19,048
Please, I have to know!

202
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:20,217
-Nobody.

203
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,686
He made a few moves, then
panicked and ran off.

204
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,122
I wish he had stayed longer.

205
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:24,792
-I'll be back in a bit.

206
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:25,694
-Thanks very much.

207
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,996
Have a great day.

208
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,068
-If he had, then Toya Meijin
could have judged his ability.

209
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:31,872
That boy's still a mystery.

210
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,875
Who knows how good
he actually is?

211
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:35,043
Hmph.

212
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:37,849
But if you're intimidated,
maybe I should be, too.

213
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:39,987
[laughter]

214
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,854
MAN: Akira?

215
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:42,992
Are you feeling all right?

216
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:44,862
-I'm fine.

217
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,598
-I think you might
enjoy seeing this.

218
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,849
-The championship
round's already underway.

219
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:03,730
That man over there,
he's Mr. Yuen.

220
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,266
He's the coach of our Go club.

221
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:11,110
AKIRA: Hikaru?

222
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:12,112
I can't believe it.

223
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:13,248
What's he doing here?

224
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:26,137
SAI: A quick turn at 5, 10.

225
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:40,832
Side extension at 9, 3.

226
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:51,752
Bottom right at 17, 14.

227
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:03,005
Attach at 17, 4.

228
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:09,217
Hikaru, I had a thought.

229
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,154
Do not merely place
stones on the board.

230
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:12,958
Instead, feel the
flow of the stones.

231
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:15,094
Channel yourself into each move.

232
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,330
-The flow of the stones?

233
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:25,213
SAI: Play the hane at 18, 5.

234
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:27,016
Allow me to show you this idea.

235
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:30,122
Study the position of
the stones carefully.

236
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:32,927
Feel them as they flow onto
the board as they work together

237
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,866
and affect each other.

238
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,070
You can sense their
energy, can't you?

239
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,942
Open your mind and
become one with the game.

240
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:41,418
17, 3.

241
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:49,866
Let's proceed.

242
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:50,308
Atari.

243
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,237
Hikaru.

244
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:01,505
You have awakened.

245
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:25,850
-I resign.

246
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,451
-Thank you.

247
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,121
That was a very good game.

248
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:31,160
-(VOICEOVER) I guess those
rumors about Kaio are true.

249
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:32,863
Look at these guys.

250
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:34,399
They're a bunch of
Akira Toya wannabes.

251
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,609
Kimihiro doesn't stand a chance.

252
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:43,382
What's that guy lookin' at?

253
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,122
Akira!

254
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:49,260
You guys still hanging in there?

255
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:49,860
Hm?

256
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:56,340
-(VOICEOVER) It's pointless.

257
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,877
At least I managed
to play this long.

258
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:01,449
But maybe it's time to give up.

259
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,018
Huh?

260
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:03,494
Oh.

261
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,512
Hm!

262
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:17,961
-(VOICEOVER) How did he manage
to cut me off like that?

263
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:20,232
I should have never
filled that liberty.

264
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:22,101
I opened the door for him.

265
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:34,257
-(VOICEOVER) I can win!

266
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,294
I can by eight points.

267
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,465
He won't get past
me in the endgame.

268
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,369
Let's see him try
and turn this around.

269
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:49,987
-I'm resigning.

270
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:55,663
-You two won't believe this!

271
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:13,529
I just-- guys?

272
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:15,433
-Hikaru, it's over.

273
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:16,101
Good work.

274
00:17:21,678 --> 00:17:22,646
-He did it.

275
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,593
SAI: Your opponent
was quite talented.

276
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:33,700
It was your resolve
and strength that

277
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,303
brought this game
to its conclusion.

278
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:38,175
You should be very
proud of yourself.

279
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:41,448
And so should he.

280
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:43,418
-Huh?

281
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:45,121
-You played extremely well.

282
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:48,394
-Yes, Sensei.

283
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,651
-Hello.

284
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:21,488
-That was such a beautiful game.

285
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:29,469
The truth is, I
envy your opponent.

286
00:18:29,469 --> 00:18:31,239
I wish I had been him.

287
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,615
There's more.

288
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,322
I finally know that if I hope
to achieve the Divine Move,

289
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:43,261
I must surpass you.

290
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:45,632
I won't try to
avoid you anymore.

291
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,426
-So Haze Middle School
has won 2-1 over Kaio.

292
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:02,296
It's been a surprising
tournament this year.

293
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,434
Haze has made quite
a memorable debut.

294
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:06,237
-I don't think anyone
could have predicted

295
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,539
that Kaio would lose the game.

296
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:09,843
-Hey, would you mind
passing me that marker?

297
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:11,881
-Sure.

298
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:13,183
-I think I know that guy.

299
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:14,185
His last name's Shindo.

300
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:14,786
-Huh?

301
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:15,654
-I do know him.

302
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,489
It's Hikaru.

303
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,591
You're in the sixth grade.

304
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,797
You're not a student at Haze.

305
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:22,500
-We've been busted.

306
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,537
-Time to come clean, boys.

307
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:27,643
Now tell me, is this young
man a student at Haze Middle?

308
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:28,645
-I'm, uh--

309
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:30,114
-This is all my fault.

310
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:30,649
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:32,118
I forced him to come.

312
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:41,802
-I now present Kaio Middle
School with this certificate

313
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:42,904
for winning the third--

314
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:44,674
HIKARU: So what's gonna
happen to the Go club?

315
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:46,678
TSUTSUI: We'll try
again next year.

316
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:48,180
HIKARU: But I thought--

317
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:51,153
TETSUO: I'm itching to get
back to the Shogi club.

318
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:53,156
Oh, what I told you
earlier about Kimihiro

319
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:55,695
getting beaten up
if we didn't today?

320
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,696
I kind of made that up.

321
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,297
Ha ha.

322
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:58,433
HIKARU: Huh?

323
00:19:58,433 --> 00:19:59,702
MAN: I hope to see you
all back here next year.

324
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:01,471
BOY: Thank you very much.

325
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:02,473
-Hikaru.

326
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:03,642
-Hm?

327
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:06,815
-During that last game, did
anything unusual happen?

328
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,406
-Hm.

329
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:23,746
Yeah.

330
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:25,282
Yes, something did happen.

331
00:20:25,315 --> 00:20:27,486
Akira was staring right
at you, wasn't he?

332
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,721
Did he sense you were there?

333
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:30,325
You know, he's a tough player.

334
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:32,596
He's going to come after you
with everything he's got.

335
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:33,865
And he may even beat you.

336
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,668
I saw that look in his eye.

337
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,305
It was so intense.

338
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:40,543
As for me, well, I'm still
far behind both of you.

339
00:20:40,576 --> 00:20:42,614
But I'm off to a
good start, aren't I?

340
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,551
Well, I guess we're
going to find out.

341
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:47,423
Anyway, I'm just glad I've
got you in my corner, Sai.

342
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,604

343
00:22:22,397 --> 00:22:23,933
HIKARU: I don't believe this!

344
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,404
I've got enough
problems with Akira,

345
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:29,410
and now no one's joining
my school's Go club.

346
00:22:29,444 --> 00:22:31,715
It's just me and Kimihiro.

347
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:33,384
SAI: Don't forget Akari.

348
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:35,822
You can have many
practice games with her.

349
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:36,943
HIKARU: Yeah.

350
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:38,512
But I want our club to
enter tournaments and win

351
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:39,379
lots of trophies.

352
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:45,785
Next time, I'm Not
Gonna Play You.

353
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:46,820
Wait.

354
00:22:46,853 --> 00:22:49,356
Is Akira going to
join the Kaio Go club?
