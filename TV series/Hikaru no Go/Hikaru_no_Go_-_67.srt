2
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,179
-You thought you could
defend yourself with that?

3
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,147
What do you take me for, a fool?

4
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,682
You could never beat me.

5
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,718
Not when you play like that.

00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,653
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): After
last year's pro exam,

7
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:03,156
after I lost three games in a
row to Shindou, Waya, and Fuku,

8
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,562
all it took was one win against
Ochi to regain my confidence.

9
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,398
It was my game
that kept me going.

10
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,634
Back then, I believed in myself.

11
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,135
I trusted in my own strength.

12
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,341
But now, here at the
China Go Institute,

13
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,076
I'm not really sure
what my strength is.

14
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,215
Will my game keep
me going this time?

15
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,490
OK.

16
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,758
I can't lose my nerve here.

17
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,360
If I go back to Japan
without enough confidence,

18
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:43,330
I don't stand a chance
of passing the pro exam.

19
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:46,099
Waya, Shindou, Ochi.

20
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:50,237
I'll never be able to
face any of them again.

21
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,271
BOY: Hey, Isumi.

22
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,406
-Huh?

23
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,674
Yeah?

24
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,008
-Phone call.

25
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,009
-What?

26
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,612
A phone call for me?

27
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,313
Thank you.

28
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,381
Hello?

29
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:02,649
MAN (OVER PHONE):
Shinichiro, is that you?

30
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,017
-Oh, hey dad.

31
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,285
MAN (OVER PHONE): So I
hear you're still in China.

32
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,420
-Mm-hm.

33
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,355
MAN (OVER PHONE): Why
didn't you let us know?

34
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,158
If Ms. Sakurano hadn't
called, well, we

35
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,193
would've been worried about you.

36
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,428
-Sorry, dad.

37
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,729
There's been a
lot going on here.

38
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,664
MAN (OVER PHONE): Anyway,
if staying in China

39
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,300
is what you want to do,
then it's fine with us.

40
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,004
Just as long as we know how
long you're going to be there.

41
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,439
Ms. Sakurano said
you told her you

42
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:29,476
might be staying
a few extra days.

43
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,211
Uh, Shinichiro?

44
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,548
-I've decided to stay
until the pro exam starts.

45
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,749
So, two months.

46
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,286
MAN (OVER PHONE): Two months?

47
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,022
-Hopefully by staying here,
I can build up my confidence

48
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,690
without any distractions.

49
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,693
That way, I'll be at my best
when I take on the pro exam,

50
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,061
and the world of the pros.

51
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,476
[knocking]

52
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,714
-Yang Hai. You there?

53
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,549
It's me.

54
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,283
-Hi.

55
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,586
Change your mind?

56
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,087
-If you're sure
it's OK, I'd like

57
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,189
to take you up on your offer.

58
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,558
-You can take that
bed over there.

59
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,527
-This is really nice of you.

60
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,161
-Thanks you.

61
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,097
I appreciate it.

62
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,566
-You even have
your own Go board.

63
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,534
-Yeah.

64
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,002
-I tell you.

65
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,005
This sure beats having to say
in a hotel room on my own.

66
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:36,209
With a board in your room, I can
study in the evenings as well.

67
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,544
-Listen to you.

68
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,279
You're getting
serious, aren't you?

69
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,081
I'll leave the board
out for you so you

70
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,018
can use it to replay your game
records, or whatever you want.

71
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,186
-That'd be great.

72
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,389
-I spend most of my time
doing stuff on the computer.

73
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,624
You play Go on the computer?

74
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,326
-Nah, I haven't yet.

75
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,663
-So, how long you
planning on staying here?

76
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,532
-About two months.

77
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,100
-Oh.

78
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,103
You get a chance to
play anyone today?

79
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:03,670
-Yeah.

80
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,539
A kid called Le Ping.

81
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,274
But he beat me.

82
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,275
-Le Ping?

83
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,277
You lost to Le Ping?

84
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:13,680
-It was one of the league games
with 90 minutes per player.

85
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,348
When we finished the
game, he actually

86
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,451
sat there laughing at me.

87
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,653
-Le Ping isn't that good.

88
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,054
You should've crushed him!

89
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,155
Still.

90
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,356
It was pretty mean of
him to laugh at you.

91
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,292
That little brat.

92
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,360
Isumi, come over
here and sit down.

93
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,162
You and me are
gonna play a game.

94
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,230
-What?

95
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,165
I wanna see how strong you are.

96
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,367
I'm sorry, but if you
can't even beat Le Ping,

97
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,069
there's no way I can
let you stay here.

98
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,604
You'll have to leave.

99
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,674
-But-- are you actually serious?

100
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,142
Listen, Yang Hai--

101
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:42,676
-Come on.

102
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,977
Sit down and play.

103
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,558
-I can't believe
it's 7:30 already.

104
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:11,559
BOY: Feel free to use anything
you can find in there.

105
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,340
-Thanks.

106
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,834
-I'm gonna sleep a bit longer.

107
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:20,969
You can go on without me.

108
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:21,569
-OK.

109
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:30,979
-He's just as strong
a player as Le Ping,

110
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,747
and he's got a good
feel for the game.

111
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,990
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Well, in the
end he didn't ask me to leave.

112
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:43,558
I guess I must've
passed the test.

113
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:48,863
But playing Yang Hai
with a two stone handicap

114
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:50,432
wasn't about winning or losing.

115
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,934
It was more like a teaching
game with a top pro.

116
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:10,685
-I heard you played
Wan Sing today.

117
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:11,753
-Yeah.

118
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:13,421
And then when we were
reviewing the match,

119
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:15,790
Wasong Li came
over and joined us.

120
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:17,659
It's weird meeting
these Chinese pros

121
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:20,028
that I've only ever read
about in the newspaper.

122
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:21,663
-They both just got
back from playing

123
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:24,399
in some tough
tournament matches.

124
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:25,700
-You know what I've noticed?

125
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,036
Most of your top pro players
are a lot younger than the ones

126
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,838
we have in Japan.

127
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:30,805
-Yeah.

128
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,040
Once they get past
30, there's always

129
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:34,642
a new batch of younger players
ready to bring them down.

130
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:36,845
That's why it's so important
that kids don't slack off

131
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:38,880
in their teens.

132
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:41,449
That Le Ping needs to
watch it, or he's out.

133
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:42,450
-Le Ping?

134
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:45,153
-Don't suppose
you're up for a game?

135
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:48,123
-Yeah, that would be great.

136
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:50,492
-We've got the day off
tomorrow, so we can stay up late

137
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:52,026
and have as many
games as we want.

138
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:04,506
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Mr. Lee won't
be here because it's a day off.

139
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,808
In fact, there's
hardly anybody around.

140
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:07,976
Hm?

141
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:09,911
Oh.

142
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:10,912
-You're still here?

143
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:11,913
-Zou Si.

144
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:13,848
I didn't know you
were back already.

145
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:15,150
-Uh, yeah?

146
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:15,950
-Guess what.

147
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:17,585
I decided to stay longer.

148
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:18,853
One of the reasons
was so I could

149
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:21,055
have a rematch against you.

150
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:22,724
I'm going to be
here for a while.

151
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:23,558
-Zou Si!

152
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,960
You're back, you're back!

153
00:08:25,994 --> 00:08:26,961
-Yeah, I'm back.

154
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:27,896
-So, how'd it go?

155
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:29,130
Did you win?

156
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:30,064
-What do you think?

157
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,065
-Wanna go out?

158
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:31,966
Let's do something.

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,834
What about bowling?

160
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:33,468
Yeah, bowling!

161
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:34,102
Come on!

162
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:37,038
-But what about--

163
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,907
-Forget about him.

164
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,476
He says he needs to stay here
for a while so he can study,

165
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:42,844
because he sucks.

166
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:44,112
-Why do you say that?

167
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:45,947
-I played him yesterday.

168
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,081
It was an easy win.

169
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:48,416
He's useless.

170
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,518
He can study here all he
wants, but he is never

171
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:52,821
going to win against me.

172
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,389
YANG HAI: You sure about that?

173
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:55,723
-Huh?

174
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:56,724
-Yang Hai.

175
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:57,992
-You know what?

176
00:08:58,026 --> 00:09:00,061
I think you should give
Isumi another game.

177
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:02,397
I have a strong feeling
he might beat you.

178
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,565
-No way.

179
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:06,067
Today my day off, so I'm
gonna hang out with Zou.

180
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,770
-You spend more time hanging
out than you do in class.

181
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:09,838
-What about you?

182
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,706
You're always stuck in
front of your computer!

183
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:13,741
-That's got nothing
to do with this!

184
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:15,043
-Argh.

185
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:18,079
OK, if I let him play me again,
and if I win, which I will,

186
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:19,447
you stop bugging me.

187
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:22,884
-And if you lose, you have
to promise to work harder.

188
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:26,421
-Let's get out of here.

189
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:27,989
-Le Ping!

190
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:30,492
We'll make the game
one week from today.

191
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:32,093
And don't forget.

192
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:32,694
-Whatever.

193
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:51,105
-Sai.

194
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:57,452
ASUMI: Shindou?

195
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:05,693
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Not now, Asumi.

196
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:08,696
-I heard you haven't been
going to any classes or games.

197
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,165
Waya's really worried about you.

198
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,133
Hey, wait.

199
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:12,734
Shindou!

200
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,871
What's wrong with him?

201
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,308
-Le Ping and I both come
from the province of Yunnan.

202
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:31,043
I was back there
recently for a game,

203
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:33,145
and guess who I bumped into?

204
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:34,413
Le Ping's mom and dad.

205
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:36,148
They talked to me
after the game.

206
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:37,883
They started asking
a bunch of questions

207
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:39,852
about how Le Ping was doing.

208
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:43,055
They wanted to know everything
about their precious only son.

209
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:45,290
They were worried.

210
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:46,358
And they should be.

211
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:48,026
With his record,
there's a good chance

212
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,895
he's gonna get sent
home next year.

213
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:50,762
-Ah.

214
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:52,030
-Isumi.

215
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:53,332
I need you to
teach him a lesson.

216
00:10:53,365 --> 00:10:56,335
Shock him into taking his
studies more seriously.

217
00:10:56,368 --> 00:10:59,438
I hope you don't mind
me using you like this.

218
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:00,873
-It's OK.

219
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:03,842
Actually, I should be
thanking Le Ping for this.

220
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:06,044
If you were so concerned
about his progress,

221
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,014
you wouldn't have given me
all this extra study time.

222
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,249
It's been great.

223
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:11,884
I guess the best
way I can repay you

224
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:16,054
is by making sure I win
against Le Ping, right?

225
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:17,389
-Right.

226
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:20,025
I wouldn't have insisted on him
playing a rematch if I wasn't

227
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,294
entirely confident
you could beat him.

228
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:24,730
By the way, what
exactly do you think

229
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:27,032
happened to make you lose the
first time you guys played?

230
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:32,437
-I had lost to Zou.

231
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:35,807
I was determined not to
be beaten by another kid.

232
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:38,176
I let that throw me off, and
I didn't play my normal game.

233
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:44,283
I wanted to treat it
like it was my pro exam.

234
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:47,019
But instead of helping me to
focus, it made me all tense

235
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,453
and I couldn't
concentrate properly.

236
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,026
-How did you do in the
pro exam last year?

237
00:11:56,895 --> 00:11:58,163
-Things were really
getting to me.

238
00:11:58,163 --> 00:12:00,299
What people said,
what people did.

239
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:03,368
Then there was this one match
where I made a huge mistake.

240
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:06,705
It took me a long time
to recover from that.

241
00:12:06,738 --> 00:12:08,040
I had three straight
losses, and I

242
00:12:08,073 --> 00:12:09,741
wasn't able to put
them behind me.

243
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:13,912
-Hm.

244
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,480
You know what your problem is?

245
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:16,949
Your emotions.

246
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:19,751
Forget about what anyone
else says or does.

247
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:24,156
Irritation, impatience, anxiety,
eagerness, tension, pressure.

248
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:26,291
You let any of these
emotions control you,

249
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:28,327
you're never gonna
play your best.

250
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,796
That's what you need to work on.

251
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,764
Focus on the stones!

252
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:35,867
If you are aware of the
problem, you can fix it!

253
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,437
It's got nothing to do
with your personality.

254
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:41,406
This is a skill you can learn.

255
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,009
ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
A skill I can learn?

256
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:46,311
I never thought of
it like that before.

257
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:47,079
He's right.

258
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:54,052
I need to learn to
control my emotions.

259
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:57,289
-If you can do that, it's gonna
bring a new level to your game.

260
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:03,762
-Did I hear right?

261
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:05,297
There's gonna be a rematch
between Isumi and Le Ping

262
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:06,898
What's that all about?

263
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:09,468
-I heard that Yang Hai's giving
Isumi some extra training.

264
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,169
But why?

265
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:13,205
BOY: Isumi doesn't need
any extra training.

266
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:15,040
I played him too,
and in my opinion,

267
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,241
he's better than Le Ping.

268
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:18,710
More consistent, anyway.

269
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:21,847
MAN: He's more relaxed now
than when he first got here.

270
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,381
MAN: Yeah.

271
00:13:22,414 --> 00:13:24,449
He looked so scared.

272
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:27,152
MAN: Even Chen Yi lost to Isumi
in one of the league games.

273
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,994
BOY: Where's Isumi?

274
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,396
He should be here by now.

275
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:37,963
BOY: I know!

276
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:38,463
I know!

277
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:39,765
Look at the time.

278
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,333
If it wasn't for
this game, I could

279
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:43,902
be down at the
arcade or something.

280
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:44,903
He's late.

281
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:46,938
Just what does he
think he's doing?

282
00:13:46,972 --> 00:13:49,074
Yang Hai's the one who
wanted to start at 1:30.

283
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:58,283
-How are we doing for time?

284
00:13:58,283 --> 00:13:59,017
-Don't panic.

285
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:00,185
We're gonna be fine.

286
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:02,254
The game doesn't
start until 1:40,

287
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:04,756
and you do not want to arrive
until the very last minute.

288
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,924
There's no reason to worry.

289
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:07,926
It's not like there's much
at stake in this game.

290
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,428
You should relax a bit.

291
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,696
-But if I lose, I
don't think I'll

292
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,266
be able to look you
in the eye ever again.

293
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:17,936
And if that happens, I couldn't
keep staying here in this room.

294
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,906
In fact, I'd probably have to
quit studying at the China Go

295
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,708
Institute, head back
to Japan, maybe even

296
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:25,210
give up playing for a while.

297
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:25,777
-Whoa.

298
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:27,045
Hold on!

299
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,880
You're putting yourself under
too much pressure, Isumi.

300
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,284
You're still acting the
same way you did before.

301
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:33,952
-No, I've changed.

302
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:36,354
I still feel the pressure,
but thanks to you,

303
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:39,458
I can look at it from the
outside, see it for what it is.

304
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:42,060
Looking at it with an objective
eye helps me deal with it

305
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,128
and calms me down.

306
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,467
-In that case, I think it's
time for us to get going.

307
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,434
-You're late!

308
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:51,103
Look at the time.

309
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:53,205
It's 1:40 already!

310
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:54,906
-We didn't set an exact time.

311
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,043
I said around half past 1:00.

312
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:00,745
Isumi, let me fill you
in on a little secret.

313
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,013
-What?

314
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:04,049
-I know if I talk quietly enough
so that Le Ping can't hear,

315
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:05,984
he's gonna think I'm
giving you some coaching

316
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,953
advice on strategies
for the game.

317
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:09,020
-Why would you do that?

318
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,022
-And I did tell him
we'd start at 1:30,

319
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:12,424
because I know how
irritated he gets

320
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:14,092
when things don't go as planned.

321
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:15,794
I mean, look at him now.

322
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,996
I'm sure you know how these
little distractions away

323
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:21,800
from the board can
affect a person's game.

324
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:26,371
-Yang Hai, I don't want you
doing anything like that again.

325
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:29,040
-I'm sorry.

326
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:30,342
Oh, no!

327
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:34,179
If I thought he'd react like
that, I'd never have done it.

328
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:35,413
-It was all my mistake.

329
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:36,448
I'm sorry.

330
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:39,017
I'm 10 minutes late,
so how about I take 20

331
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:40,085
off my time on the clock?

332
00:15:40,118 --> 00:15:42,354
Sound fair to you?

333
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:45,423
[groan]

334
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:47,025
-I was trying to help.

335
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:50,028
I didn't mean to upset him.

336
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:51,897
-Hey, have you guys started yet?

337
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:53,765
What the--

338
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:54,466
[groan]

339
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:57,969
-I'm such an idiot.

340
00:15:58,003 --> 00:15:59,037
-What's going on, Yang Hai?

341
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:00,172
Are you OK?

342
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:16,454
-Gee!

343
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:18,290
He comes in late, then
takes forever to move.

344
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:28,333
-Why's Isumi taking so long?

345
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:29,434
It's only his first move.

346
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:32,037
He doesn't have time for this.

347
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:43,148
Come o If Isumi
ends up losing, I'm

348
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:44,983
going to have to
apologize for interfering.

349
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:53,291
It's not that I didn't believe
Isumi could win the game.

350
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,926
I just wanted to
make sure he would.

351
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:29,828
I can see some weaknesses in
white's position in the lower

352
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:31,029
right corner.

353
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:33,064
Looks like Isumi's planning
a direct jump cut attack.

354
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:40,438
Le Ping's natural response
would be to block it.

355
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:43,341
But that inside hane Isumi
played was a strong move.

356
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,148
Although, I expected
him to use a wedge.

357
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:04,029
He's staying calm.

358
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:06,064
Now that I think
about it, I remember

359
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:08,900
him being pretty calm
when he played me, too.

360
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,802
No matter what the
book looks like,

361
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:13,038
if he can always
keep his cool, he's

362
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,774
going to be able to play at
this level of Go any time.

363
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:26,418
There's a move I didn't expect.

364
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:27,919
A good endgame
play from Le Ping.

365
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:36,027
But not enough to win.

366
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:41,933
Controlling his emotions
may be a skill he can learn,

367
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,735
but he still has
a long way to go

368
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:46,037
before he's going to
make it on its own.

369
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,406
But let's deal with
one obstacle at a time.

370
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,085
Game over.

371
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,920
Isumi wins by 2 and 1/2 points.

372
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:06,063
ISUMI: Yang Hai, why'd you
have to interfere like that?

373
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,931
It completely threw me off.

374
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:09,800
-You managed to keep
your cool, though.

375
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,935
-Yeah, but just barely.

376
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:13,403
-Isumi!

377
00:19:13,437 --> 00:19:14,304
-Le Ping?

378
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:15,672
-I want to play another game.

379
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:16,907
-What?

380
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,509
I just played I don't know
how many games of 10 second

381
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:20,677
Go with you.

382
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:23,547
-Well, obviously it's
still not enough for him.

383
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:26,917
He wants to keep playing
until he can win every time.

384
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,918
-Hold it!

385
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:28,952
-Look at him now.

386
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:30,687
I'm not going to have
to keep bugging him

387
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:33,323
about studying harder now
that you've beaten him.

388
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:34,725
-Come on, hurry up!

389
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,794
-Stop pulling on my
arm, maybe I well.

390
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:39,062
-I can't believe it.

391
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,698
Le Ping's actually dragging
someone into the practice room.

392
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:44,067
-Looks like I'm gonna
be gone for a while.

393
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:46,770
-Don't forget, you're
playing Zou next.

394
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:47,904
-Zou Si?

395
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,340
-He and I have got a
little wager riding on it.

396
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:53,010
If you win, I get
his cell phone charm.

397
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:55,979
If he wins, I have to
give him my MP3 player.

398
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,615
So don't lose.

399
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:01,051
-Yang Hai!

400
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:03,954
MAN: Have you noticed how Le
Ping's sort of attached himself

401
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:05,389
to Isumi recently?

402
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:06,790
He's much more focused now.

403
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:08,692
MAN: Isumi spends a
lot of time studying.

404
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:11,561
It seems to be rubbing
off on Le Ping.

405
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:14,297
-We should thank him for
being such a good influence.

406
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:16,333
I'm glad he decided
to stay here with us

407
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:17,601
for more than a few days.

408
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:22,005
ISUMI: Hello?

409
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,741
Hi dad, its me.

410
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:27,911
Can you do me a favor and send
in my pro exam application?

411
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:28,879
Yeah.

412
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,347
I'll be coming back
to Japan a week

413
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,382
before the qualifiers start.

414
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,351
That's right.

415
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:35,419
Yeah.

416
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:36,620
Being out here has
given me the confidence

417
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,422
to win and become a pro.

418
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:47,531
Even though everyone else has
a year's head start on me,

419
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:49,633
I'm still gonna make it
into the world of the pros.

420
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:57,674
[theme music]

421
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:24,427
HIKARU: Everyone finds out
that I lost a game by default

422
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:27,330
because I didn't show up.

423
00:22:27,364 --> 00:22:29,065
And even when I tell
them that I want to quit,

424
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:32,335
they don't believe me.

425
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:34,938
There's so many people that want
me to get into the game again,

426
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,975
and there's one place
I could do that.

427
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,677
But how could I
play without Sai?

428
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:47,817
Next time, Losing by Default!
