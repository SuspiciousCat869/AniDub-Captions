00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,547
ASUMI: Shindou?

3
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,989
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Not now, Asumi.

4
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,225
-I heard you haven't been
going to any classes or games.

5
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,995
Waya's really worried about you.

6
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:08,695
Hey, wait, Shindou!

7
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,567
What's wrong with him?

8
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,119
MAN: He's quit being a pro?

9
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,353
-Yes.

10
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,656
-You're sure it's Hikaru
we're talking about?

11
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,324
-Yes.

12
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,259
-I can't believe
he'd stop playing.

13
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,328
It just doesn't seem possible.

14
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,763
He put an incredible
amount of effort

15
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,498
into passing the
pro exam last year.

16
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,299
He was so committed.

17
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,569
At least that's what I was
told by his previous teacher.

18
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,571
-Mm-hm.

19
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,741
-Did Hikaru actually tell
you he was going to quit?

20
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,044
-Oh, no, no.

21
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,479
But he's been
skipping his matches.

22
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,549
He hasn't been playing at all.

23
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,685
-Not been playing?

24
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,153
-No.

25
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,689
There were a couple of games
back in April that he went.

26
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:11,091
Now they keep sending
him reminders,

27
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,060
but he doesn't
even look at them.

28
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,295
He hasn't been to a
single game since then.

29
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,301
-I remember that he took
some time off and went out

30
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,403
of town right
around Golden Week.

31
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,539
When he later told me that
he'd gone to Hiroshima,

32
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,275
I thought it was
something Go related.

33
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,977
But he didn't play
any matches there?

34
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,312
-That's right.

35
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,681
-I had no idea he
was skipping games.

36
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,150
His attendance record at
school has been excellent,

37
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,453
so I just assumed
everything was OK with him.

38
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,324
Look, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,593
I don't really follow Go.

40
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,128
Otherwise I would have realized.

41
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,596
When you're a teacher
and your student

42
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,631
comes to school in
his work, you don't

43
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:55,135
tend to worry
about his progress.

44
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,238
Well, has he said
anything to you about it?

45
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,339
-Not a thing.

46
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,042
I've tried asking him
about it, but he just

47
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,677
won't tell me what's going on.

48
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,078
But he's changed.

49
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,447
He used to be full of energy.

50
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,317
Sometimes he was so cheerful,
it was almost annoying!

51
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,185
I'm sure that he has
a lot on his mind

52
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,321
now that he's become
a professional,

53
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,423
and that's why my
husband and I decided

54
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,025
we shouldn't interfere too much.

55
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,062
We'd leave him alone
and see how things went.

56
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,764
But it's been going
on for so long,

57
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,732
we just don't know what to do.

58
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,501
-Don't worry about it.

59
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,736
I'll look into it and
see what I can find out.

60
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,207
AKARI: Hikaru!

61
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,480
-What's going on, Akari?

62
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,414
-Hikaru.

63
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,216
I think you owe
me an explanation.

64
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,017
-Hm?

65
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,385
"Go Weekly?"

66
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,154
Since when have you
been reading that?

67
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,089
-Since Koike gave it to me.

68
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,690
There's something here
I don't understand.

69
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,726
You know they do a
list of all the results

70
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,427
of the professional Go games?

71
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,165
By your name it says
lost by default.

72
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:01,067
-I told you I wasn't
playing anymore, didn't I?

73
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,169
-What?

74
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,470
You were talking about
playing me, weren't you?

75
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,006
You thought I wasn't good
enough for you now you're a pro!

76
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,413
You're serious about
this, aren't you?

77
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,748
Are you gonna quit being a pro?

78
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,755
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): If
Sai never comes back.

79
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,123
It's possible.

80
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,059
I'm thinking about it.

81
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,594
-You selfish jerk.

82
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,495
AKARI: Oh no.

83
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,996
Mitani.

84
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,631
-I don't know what the heck
is going on with you, Shindou,

85
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,402
but you left the Go club
so you could become a pro.

86
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:40,006
-You're not gonna be a
pro, what are you gonna do?

87
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,474
-Entrance exams
are coming up soon

88
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,476
and I need to study for them.

89
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,279
Akari, what are you
doing after school today?

90
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,447
You want to study with me?

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,549
-She doesn't have the
time to study with you.

92
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,051
We got practice
for a tournament!

93
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,157
-Another tournament.

94
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,092
-Oh, it's just another
tournament, huh?

95
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,126
Who do you think you are?

96
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,561
Have you forgotten
how much you wanted

97
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,663
to beat Kaio when you
were part of the Go club?

98
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,534
Back then, it was more than
just another tournament!

99
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,102
-Mitani--

100
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,538
-I'm gonna play in
this next tournament.

101
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,040
Natsume, Koike and me
are gonna challenge Kaio,

102
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,342
and we're going to crush them!

103
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,343
-What?

104
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,044
You never told us
you wanted to play.

105
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,980
Are you sure, Mitani?

106
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:20,714
-Jealous, Shindou?

107
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,182
As long as I'm in
the club, you're

108
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,450
never gonna play with us again.

109
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,751
We don't need someone like you!

110
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,019
Come on, Akari.

111
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,153
Forget about this loser.

112
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,121
Let's get out of here.

113
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,576
-But Mitani--

114
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,664
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): The school
tournament is coming up again.

115
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,034
I promised Kimihiro I'd help
get his go club started,

116
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,202
so that's what I'm gonna do!

117
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,273
Check it out!

118
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,041
I managed to track down Yuuki!

119
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,279
Listen, Yuuki.

120
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,080
There's this Go tournament
that's coming up pretty soon.

121
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,050
A bunch of middle schools
will be competing.

122
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:58,405
-What's your point?

123
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,542
-Well, we wanna play this year.

124
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:03,711
Our goal was to defeat Kaio.

125
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:08,048
I had to find out.

126
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:09,016
Sorry, Sai.

127
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:10,651
I know Akira's more
skilled than me,

128
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:14,388
but I'll never know how big that
gap is until I play him myself.

129
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:18,459
Go was the only thing
that mattered to me.

130
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:20,761
Maybe the next guy you
inhabit will let you play.

131
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:44,585
-That kid!

132
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:45,686
He makes me so mad.

133
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:46,887
What does he think he's doing?

134
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,823
Giving up?

135
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:50,991
-Calm down.

136
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:53,394
You got like that last
time you read "Go weekly."

137
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:56,630
-Were you rooting for
someone and they lost?

138
00:07:56,663 --> 00:08:00,000
-Another game lost by default.

139
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:03,837
How long is he gonna
keep doing that?

140
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:07,074
-Hey, Tsubaki, you
finished your lunch yet?

141
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:11,145
The boss wants to play
a game of Go with you.

142
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:13,480
-There goes my break.

143
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:14,882
-Gotta keep the boss happy.

144
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:17,851
Earn a few brownie points.

145
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:19,920
-He's such a lousy
player, but if I

146
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:24,658
don't let him win-- I hate it.

147
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:25,726
-What's going on?

148
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,562
Is Tsubaki good at
playing Go, or something?

149
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:29,830
-He must be pretty good.

150
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,965
He took the pro exam last year.

151
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:34,635
-No way, him?

152
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:37,104
-I had no idea someone
like that worked here.

153
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:40,107
Maybe it's time for me to
start taking up that game.

154
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:41,842
-Look, he made a mess of this.

155
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,849
-How come that copy of "Go
Weekly's" scrunched up?

156
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:50,751
-If you want an
answer, ask Mr. Kawai.

157
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:51,985
-Hmph.

158
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,053
-Don't you hmph me!

159
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:55,088
That paper is here
for everyone to read.

160
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:58,659
Shindou forfeiting his game
is no excuse to crumple it up.

161
00:08:58,692 --> 00:08:59,560
-Ugh.

162
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:00,828
-What do you thinks
up with Shindou?

163
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:05,466
That's a lot of games
he's lost by default now.

164
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:07,434
-What's the point in
us cheering for him

165
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:09,102
if he doesn't even play?

166
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:11,672
-I'm sure he's got a very
good reason for not playing.

167
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:13,006
Give the boy a chance.

168
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,609
You just need to be a
little more patient.

169
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:16,477
Really.

170
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,179
You guys give me
such a headache.

171
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:21,582
-It's all very well
telling us to be patient,

172
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,183
but can't they kick
him out of the pros

173
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:25,419
is he misses too many games?

174
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:26,587
-Do you think that's true?

175
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:28,622
-How am I supposed to know?

176
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:29,923
-Fukawa, what do you think?

177
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:33,494
-I guess they could, but
I don't know for sure.

178
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:34,461
-Kick him out?

179
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:35,629
Don't say that!

180
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,965
Not after I went all the
way to Hiroshima with him

181
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:40,901
and paid for his hotel.

182
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,036
That brat!

183
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,404
-Mr. Kawai, please!

184
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:12,466
-I only just scraped
through that game.

185
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:13,066
Ochi.

186
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,101
-Hm?

187
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:16,136
-You finish your game too?

188
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,905
Considering you were
just in the bathroom,

189
00:10:17,938 --> 00:10:20,040
I'm guessing you probably lost.

190
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:22,709
I mean, we all know how you lock
yourself in one of the stalls

191
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:23,710
when you lose.

192
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:25,879
-Actually, this
time I had to go.

193
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:28,148
In fact, my winning
streak is still intact.

194
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:30,784
Unlike yours, Waya..

195
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:32,753
-You're such a nerd.

196
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:34,054
-Did you hear about Shindou?

197
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:37,424
The chairman of the Player's
Association, Murota Nine-Dan,

198
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:39,092
gave him a call.

199
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:40,494
-Yeah, and?

200
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:42,496
-He asked Shindou if he was
missing games because he

201
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,965
was sick and offered the chance
to take a leave of absence,

202
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,601
but he didn't even
bother to reply.

203
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:50,437
-What an idiot.

204
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:52,906
-Think he'll quit being a pro?

205
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,841
-I don't know.

206
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:59,446
-Looking at him now, it's hard
to believe he was Toya's rival.

207
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:00,881
-Having talent is
a waste of time

208
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:02,449
if you don't put
it into practice.

209
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,633
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I remember
the school tournament.

210
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,834
That was a lot of fun.

211
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:24,438
Mitani was our captain,
Kimihiro was our second,

212
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:26,573
and I was there as number three.

213
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:29,409
Of course, I was the
worst player on the team.

214
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:32,679
It was exciting when we beat
Iwata 3-0 in the first round.

215
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:40,454
I can still remember the
faces of the guys we played.

216
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:06,913
Sai.

217
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:07,514
Sai!

218
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:36,824
GIRL: Hey, Shindou!

219
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:37,825
You heading home?

220
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:41,896
-What do you want?

221
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:43,965
-Well, since you've got
nothing better to do,

222
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,501
you can do a favor for me.

223
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:48,403
-What do you mean I got
nothing better to do?

224
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:49,904
-I could be wrong,
but someone who's

225
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:52,674
been skipping all his games
must have some free time.

226
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,509
-Hmph.

227
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:57,412
-Come to the Go club
and play Mitani.

228
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,547
-Hm?

229
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:00,748
Mitani?

230
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:02,483
-He wants to play in
a tournament so bad,

231
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:04,352
but he doesn't have
anyone to practice with,

232
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:05,787
so I thought maybe
you could help.

233
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,624
I'd play him, but
I'm not good enough.

234
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:10,858
-Sorry, but no.

235
00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:11,755
-No? Why not?

236
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:12,794
-Kanako.

237
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:13,895
-Hm?

238
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:16,331
-I don't want you asking
stupid favors for me.

239
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:19,033
He's the last person I
want to practice with.

240
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:22,070
-Yeah, well maybe I wasn't
just asking him for you, OK?

241
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,805
If Shindou plays
against you, that

242
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:28,610
means I get to play
against Natsume and Koike.

243
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:30,445
-What's going on?

244
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:31,012
Kanako?

245
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,413
Mitani?

246
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:33,088
Hikaru?

247
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:46,294
-I was just trying to help.

248
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,729
We're all trying to
do our best here.

249
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:49,430
Otherwise, I
wouldn't have asked.

250
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:53,468
But if that's how Mitani feels
about it, then nevermind.

251
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:56,738
I guess it's better for the Go
club to practice without you.

252
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:58,706
Sorry to bother you.

253
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,475
-Uh, Hikaru.

254
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:01,576
Listen.

255
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,444
We're playing in the
tournament next Sunday.

256
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:05,346
At least come and cheer us on!

257
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,414
-We don't need him.

258
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,612
-Hikaru.

259
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:37,011
-This tournament is what
we've all been dreaming of.

260
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:39,647
-I don't wanna let anyone down .

261
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:44,018
-Ugh!

262
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:45,386
What a terrible game.

263
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,388
I played so bad.

264
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:49,524
Akari, give me
another chance, OK?

265
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,492
-Sure.

266
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,394
The atmosphere's
so intense in here.

267
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:56,731
-The boys take it too seriously.

268
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:58,766
AKARI (VOICEOVER): When
Hikaru was in the Go club,

269
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,902
he used to be like that.

270
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:04,672
I wonder what happened.

271
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:07,008
Go was so important to him.

272
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:11,379
He couldn't have
forgotten how that felt.

273
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,747
-Now that we're
in our third year,

274
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:15,049
this is the last chance for
us to play in a tournament.

275
00:15:15,283 --> 00:15:16,651
Let's give it all we've got.

276
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:20,988
-Mm-hm.

277
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:21,856
All right.

278
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,591
Ready for another game?

279
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:24,325
-Of course I am.

280
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:27,028
Mind if I play first?

281
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:27,628
-OK.

282
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:18,813
-They've probably
started playing already.

283
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,567
It's OK, Sai.

284
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,968
I won't be playing.

285
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:41,669
You understand?

286
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,744
I'm just gonna watch.

288

Huh?

There's Akari.

00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:54,775
She's sitting in the middle.

292
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,579
That must mean she's
playing in the number two.

293
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:00,448
Why's she taking
so long to move?

294
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:13,027
It's a simple life
and death problem.

295
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:14,762
Don't rush it.

296
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:16,631
Take your time to
think it through.

297
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:22,311
Yes!

298
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:28,876
And there's Mitani.

299
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,521
Huh?

300
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:34,275
I can't.

I just can't allow
myself to play.

Is that Shindou?

304

HIKARU (VOICEOVER): If I
start having the urge to play,

305
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:34,969
and if I start playing
Go again, then Sai

306
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,404
will never come back to me.

307
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:40,007
That's how I feel.

00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:43,944
I can't help it.

[theme music]

HIKARU: Isumi's
come back and he's

311
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:26,413
determined to meet up with me.

312
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:27,715
All sorts of people
are wondering

313
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:30,451
If I'll play again,
because if I don't, Toya'll

314
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:35,055
get so far ahead of me
I'll never catch up to him.

lots of games in China,

to play, and it's against me.
