00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:07,316
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,457
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,297
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,540
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

5
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:20,547
[theme music]

6
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:49,180
-Huh?

7
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:51,384
Doesn't that guy play for Kaio?

8
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:51,827
-Huh?

9
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:56,864
Do you have some
free time right now?

10
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:57,465
-Uh.

11
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:11,731
-Hello.

12
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,368
How are you doing, Kishimoto?

13
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,771
-Fine, thanks.

14
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:16,408
Grab a seat, and
I'll be right there.

15
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,170
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I
wonder what's going on?

16
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:30,941
He said he wanted to
find out some stuff.

17
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:34,281
Maybe this is about those couple
of games I had with Akira.

18
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:36,587
I still don't get why he
brought me to a Go salon.

19
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:38,625
He could've talked to
me in the bookstore.

20
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,827
Oh no!

21
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:41,732
I totally forgot to get
that textbook for my class!

22
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:54,761
So, are you going to
tell me why I'm here?

23
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:57,601
-I want to see how
strong you really are.

24
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,203
-Huh?

25
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,947
-Let's get started.

26
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,711
-Those two kids really know
how to play a game of Go.

27
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:32,381
You, uh, know either of them?

28
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:34,320
-See that taller boy over there?

29
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,689
That's Kishimoto.

30
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:38,329
He's an amazing player.

31
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:42,671
You should try and see if
he'll play you a game later.

32
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:45,745
-Yeah, that kid's pretty good,
but what about the shorter boy?

33
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,917
He might actually be
the stronger of the two.

34
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:55,601
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): You
want to see how good I am?

35
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:56,370
Fine.

36
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,605
I don't need Sai.

37
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,777
I've practiced long enough
to show you a thing or two.

38
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:10,835
I'm way better than I was
at the last tournament.

39
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,056
-I'd say you're about as
strong as our co-captain.

40
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:27,940
This exchange was
a really good play.

41
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,143
Those weren't impulsive moves.

42
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:32,784
You have the patience
not to rush the game.

43
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:34,889
-(VOICEOVER) Kaio's first
just gave me a compliment?

44
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:37,796
-I still don't understand why
Toya considered you his rival.

45
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,070
You're not even
close to his level.

46
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:43,074
I wonder if there's
something else about you

47
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:44,678
that I haven't noticed.

48
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,914
-I don't know.

49
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:48,086
I think Akira just
overestimated how good I

50
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,558
was at the tournament last year.

51
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:52,997
I guess that's why he
got so disappointed when

52
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:56,505
he saw my true ability.

53
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:58,543
-Oh really?

54
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:01,182
There's got to be more
to the story than that.

55
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:05,959
There must be something
about you that intrigues him.

56
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:08,165
Let me give you a
piece of advice.

57
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:09,868
You should go after Toya.

58
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:10,870
-Huh?

59
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,675
Uh.

60
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:13,777
Oh yeah.

61
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:15,749
I-- I'm going to play
him again eventually.

62
00:06:15,782 --> 00:06:17,586
I'll catch up to him one day.

63
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,101
-There is a big gap
between you and him.

64
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,537
-Wha--

65
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:28,243
-And I'm not talking about
your differences in strength.

66
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,152
I'm talking about how passionate
you are in pursuing your goals.

67
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:33,957
Toya is more determined
than you are.

68
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,796
You didn't see what he was
like in the Kaio Go club.

69
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,636
He went after you with every
ounce of energy he had.

70
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:42,008
He wasn't gonna
let you get away.

71
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,945
You're running out of time.

72
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,786
If you wait too long, you'll
never catch up to him.

73
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:51,630
One more thing.

74
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,502
Toya's already
passed the pro exam.

75
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:56,507
-Is that really true, Kishimoto?

76
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:57,543
-Let me get this straight.

77
00:06:57,576 --> 00:06:59,648
You're talking about
Akira Toya, right?

78
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:00,951
-Yes.

79
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:03,122
-I thought the pro exam took
almost two months to complete.

80
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:05,127
He won't be finished until
the end of the month.

81
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,131
-I'm just repeating
what my sensei told me.

82
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:11,541
Toya's pro career
begins next April.

83
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,743
I wonder how he'll do.

84
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,782
Maybe he'll get
lucky win a title.

85
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,652
-A pro?

86
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:18,156
Nah, he's way too young.

87
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,063
An eighth grader
can't become a pro.

88
00:07:21,063 --> 00:07:24,537
-A lot of top players were only
teenagers when they turned pro.

89
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,542
Many of them passed the
exam while they're still

90
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:27,744
in junior high.

91
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:30,016
You seem surprised.

92
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,890
-Of course, most people don't
really know much about that.

93
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:35,863
-The world of Go is full
of unusual surprises.

94
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:36,965
-What about school?

95
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,869
-Pros don't go if
there's a game scheduled.

96
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:40,774
-No way, they skip classes.

97
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:43,848
Don't their teachers care?

98
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:45,150
-Good one, kid.

99
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:46,988
-A pro?

100
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,827
He sure doesn't waste any time.

101
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:50,663
I can't believe it.

102
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:51,966
He's still a kid.

103
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:55,240
I mean, I figured he would get
through the pro exam some time,

104
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:57,210
but I didn't think it
would be this soon.

105
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,984
I always thought you had to be
a lot older to become a pro.

106
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,590
-A lot older?

107
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,126
You better start
chasing after him.

108
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:07,000
Toya's getting farther
and farther away from you.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,272
He officially becomes
a pro next spring,

110
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:11,944
and he's sure to advance
faster than anyone else.

111
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:14,149
If you wait until then,
it'll be too late.

112
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:16,153
If you don't put your
all into it right now,

113
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:19,895
you'll never catch up to him.

114
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:21,065
-Right.

115
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:23,971
I wish I could've found out
about this stuff sooner.

116
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:26,945
I just thought that, as long
as I kept on playing Go,

117
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:31,355
I would eventually
catch up to Akira.

118
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:34,294
-You're not taking this thing
seriously, you know that?

119
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:38,137
I'm actually more disappointed
than I am surprised.

120
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,310
Before the tournament, Toya
was going all out after you.

121
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:42,379
What were you doing?

122
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:48,293
Well, it doesn't
matter to me that much.

123
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,663
You mind if we end this game?

124
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,703
Sorry to take up so
much of your time.

125
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:53,939
-Hate to interrupt your game.

126
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:55,776
Can I get you another
cup of coffee?

127
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:56,311
-No thanks.

128
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:57,715
I should get going.

129
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:02,826
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Everybody thinks

130
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:06,401
that Akira was chasing me,
but he was really after Sai.

131
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,305
I'm playing with
everything I got,

132
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:12,147
and it's the best
I can do right now.

133
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,051
MAN: If Toya's already
passed, does that

134
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,956
mean he won all his matches?

135
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,826
MAN: He had one
loss, but that was

136
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:19,430
because he didn't
show up for a game.

137
00:09:19,463 --> 00:09:21,067
MAN: He forfeited?

138
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,935
-Yeah.

139
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:23,372
He skipped the first day.

140
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,444
It was the last Sunday
in August, I think.

141
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:28,450
He must have had something
pretty important to do.

142
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,088
MAN: He missed the first exam?

143
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:30,822
No way.

144
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:32,960
You gotta be kidding.

145
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:34,999
-The last Sunday in August?

146
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:38,874
That's the day we played online.

147
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,785
KISHIMOTO (VOICEOVER): I'm not
talking about your differences

148
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:45,087
in strength.

149
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:49,264
I'm talking about how passionate
you are in pursuing your goals.

150
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,803
-Wait a sec!

151
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:55,946
What do I have to do
to take the pro exam?

152
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:56,429
-Huh?

153
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:03,095
-The exam only takes
place once a year.

154
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:06,002
You'll have to wait until next
summer if you want to take it.

155
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:07,137
-Listen.

156
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,009
I don't think you're
strong enough to pass it.

157
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,746
-Maybe you should
become an Insei first.

158
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:11,848
Do you know them?

159
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:14,387
They're at the Japan
Go Association.

160
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,490
-Yeah.

161
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:17,160
You should study with
other strong players,

162
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:18,931
and then take the exam.

163
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:26,482
-Let me just say this.

164
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:29,121
You're still not good
enough to become an Insei.

165
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:30,056
You need to train more.

166
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:33,237
SAI: Hikaru.

167
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,411
MAN (VOICEOVER): You have
to pass a special test

168
00:10:39,444 --> 00:10:41,916
before you can become an Insei.

169
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,388
The test happens
four times a year.

170
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:46,860
The next one's in December.

171
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:47,930
How does it work, again?

172
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,867
I think you play a
game against a pro,

173
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,404
when he judges your ability.

174
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:52,540
Hm.

175
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:54,244
And, of course, you
don't pass if you're just

176
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,382
an average player.

177
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:57,852
BOY (VOICEOVER) Hikaru.

178
00:10:57,885 --> 00:11:00,224
KISHIMOTO (VOICEOVER): Toya
is getting farther and farther

179
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:01,259
away from you.

180
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,131
He officially becomes
a pro next spring,

181
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,269
and he's sure to advance
faster than anyone else.

182
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:11,216
-What's the matter?

183
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:12,218
-Nothing.

184
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:13,988
-Your friend made it
seem like becoming

185
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:15,492
an Insei was impossible.

186
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:17,029
-Who cares if it's impossible?

187
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:19,100
I am not giving up.

188
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,236
-What was that?

189
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:22,174
-There's a huge gap
between me and Akira.

190
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:25,481
I finally see that now.

191
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:27,285
If I really do want
to catch up to him,

192
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:29,257
I'll have to ace
that Insei test.

193
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,166
And then I'll have to
beat all the Insei.

194
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:34,435
I'm going to be a pro.

195
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:37,008
I'm going to pass the exam
without losing a single match.

196
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:41,250
I've made up my mind.

197
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,419
I'm not giving up.

198
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,992
I don't care what
Kishimoto says.

199
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:47,598
Akira didn't stop chasing
you, and I'll never

200
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:49,001
stop chasing him.

201
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,879
Akira was shaking
at the tournament

202
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,483
because he was
intimidated by you.

203
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:58,890
But he refused to back down.

204
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,425
-You're right.

205
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:02,264
It's not impossible.

206
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:04,669
It's not impossible.

207
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:06,173
Not at all.

208
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:10,048
If you pursue Akira with every
ounce of strength you have,

209
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:11,017
you'll catch him.

210
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:19,570
Hikaru, we've been here
before, haven't we?

211
00:12:19,603 --> 00:12:21,909
HIKARU: We came here to
watch that kid's tournament,

212
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:22,392
remember?

213
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:32,265
-What an impressive school.

214
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,604
This must be the place
where the Insei study Go.

215
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:38,446
-Do you think it would be
fun to take classes here?

216
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,983
-There's probably
a bunch of mean

217
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:42,957
looking guys like Kishimoto.

218
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:44,025
-Don't get down.

219
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:45,662
You'll make plenty of
friends and rivals.

220
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,499
And they'll both
help you improve.

221
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,338
-I've got find out
how to take that test.

222
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:51,542
I'll worry about all
that other stuff later.

223
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:54,616
-These are the steps must
take to get closer to Akira.

224
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:55,952
Now, let's get started.

225
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:56,954
-All right!

226
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:57,957
Follow me, Sai!

227
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,335
-Hikaru!

228
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:04,639
Look at these artificial fish!

229
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,376
They're just like the
ones we saw before.

230
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:08,381
They're so realistic,
aren't they?

231
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:09,616
I wonder how they were made.

232
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,320
I'll never get tired
of watching them.

233
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:14,260
-You're driving me nuts!

234
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,465
-So you want to take
the December Insei test?

235
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:19,506
You don't mean the examine we're
having this Sunday, do you?

236
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,476
We're no longer
accepting applications.

237
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,245
Sorry.

238
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:23,348
-But you gotta be joking.

239
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:25,352
I want to take that test
as soon as possible.

240
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:27,056
-I'm afraid I can't help you.

241
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:29,161
Don't worry, there'll be
another test next March.

242
00:13:29,194 --> 00:13:32,033
-I came all the way here
because I wanted to be an Insei.

243
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:32,735
Come on.

244
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,740
-My hands are tied.

245
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,245
HIKARU: Akira's getting further
and further away from me!

246
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,749
-There's no need to get upset.

247
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,720
I'm just trying to do my job.

248
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,491
HIKARU: Please, can't
you do this for me?

249
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:44,195
I won't tell anyone.

250
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:45,464
-I know that boy.

251
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:47,202
-I can't break the rules.

252
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,739
I'm sure you can
understand that.

253
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:51,311
-What's the problem?

254
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:53,348
-Ogata-sensei.

255
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:55,520
-Who's he?

256
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:57,023
Do I know this guy?

257
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:59,028
I think I've seen him before.

258
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:01,366
-The boy insists on
taking the Insei test

259
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:03,371
so he can enroll in January.

260
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:04,473
-Is that so?

261
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:05,543
Hm.

262
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,647
-He just showed up
here a few minutes ago.

263
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,619
I already told him the
application deadline

264
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:10,721
has passed.

265
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:12,692
The boy didn't bring any
game records with him,

266
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,596
and he doesn't have
a sponsor, either.

267
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:18,739
-I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we've got to get going.

268
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:21,077
-I've met this boy before.

269
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,748
I will sponsor him.

270
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:26,557
Please allow him
to take the test.

271
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,095
-I'll give him the forms.

272
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:29,579
-Thank you.

273
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:37,548
-What's that kid's
story, Ogata-sensei?

274
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:40,254
-I've been asking
myself the same thing.

275
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:41,591
-Huh?

276
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:46,368
-(VOICEOVER) I'm finally going
to learn the truth about him.

277
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,640
HIKARU: Now I
remember who he is!

278
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,242
-Huh?

279
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:50,310
-It's him.

280
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:52,516
He was the same guy I
saw with Akira Toya.

281
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:54,186
-Please, keep it down.

282
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:56,391
We don't want to disturb
the other people.

283
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:58,663
-Aw, sorry.

284
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:01,135
-(VOICEOVER) This
boy is unbelievable.

285
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:04,109
Why did Ogata-sensei
insist on sponsoring him?

286
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:05,746
All right.

287
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,285
This is your Insei
application form.

288
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:09,453
Please fill it out carefully.

289
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:10,857
On the day of your
exam, you'll need

290
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,496
to bring it back, along with a
resume and three of your game

291
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:14,666
records.

292
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,438
There's also an application
fee and a game fee.

293
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:19,443
You'll have to pay both
before taking the test.

294
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:20,545
One more thing.

295
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,149
You have to bring
a parent with you.

296
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:23,352
-Ah!

297
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:25,289
I gotta pay a bunch of fees,
and bring my mom or dad?

298
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:26,593
-That's right.

299
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,695
-Got that?

300
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,165
-Let's see.

301
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,844
An application, a resume,
and three game records?

302
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:36,214
What's a game record?

303
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:38,286
-You mean you don't know?

304
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:39,755
-What's wrong?

305
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:41,359
-This boy wants to
become an Insei,

306
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:43,664
and he doesn't know
what a game record is.

307
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:45,469
-Is this some kind of joke?

308
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:47,573
Why don't you just
tell him to go home?

309
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,709
-I can't.

310
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:51,315
I told Ogata-sensei
I'd help him.

311
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:52,952
He's sponsoring the boy.

312
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:53,787
-Huh?

313
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,859
Ogata-sensei's his sponsor?

314
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:57,863
-What is a game record?

315
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,977
Boring.

316
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,814
I've gotta use these
forms to record my games.

317
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:08,521
How am I supposed
to fill these out?

318
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:10,625
Man.

319
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:12,329
It's just like doing homework.

320
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,237
Hm.

321
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,717
Yuuki and Kimihiro know
how to do all this.

322
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,421
I'm sure they can help me out.

323
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:25,425
-You can finally
see the road ahead.

324
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,530
I'm proud of you.

325
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:29,601
-You're absolutely right.

326
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:30,904
Hm.

327
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:32,842
I've started getting
closer to Akira.

328
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:41,628
-Good news.

329
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:43,767
I found a new member
for our Go club.

330
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,905
-That's awesome, Yuuki.

331
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:46,640
-Thanks, man.

332
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,842
Do you want to meet him?

333
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:49,781
-How's it going, everyone?

334
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:51,651
YUUKI: Natsume and I
are in the same class.

335
00:16:51,684 --> 00:16:53,021
He says he knows how to play.

336
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:55,360
-I had my first game
of Go this summer.

337
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:56,797
I guess that makes me a rookie.

338
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,302
-Now Haze Middle will be able
to play in the tournament

339
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:01,273
even if Kimihiro is too busy.

340
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:02,342
-Yep.

341
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:03,878
We've got our team.

342
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:04,915
-What's up, guys?

343
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:06,418
-Who's that?

344
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:08,757
AKARI: Is he really
gonna join our club?

345
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,029
You'll have enough players
for the tournament!

346
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:13,701
-And we're not just gonna
enter the tournaments.

347
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,906
Hikaru is 10 times better
than he used to be.

348
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,712
And with him and me,
we're going to win.

349
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,282
We can throw the top game.

350
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:21,686
We'll still pick
up two wins if we

351
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,858
play in the number two and
number three positions.

352
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,695
-Kaio won't know what hit 'em.

353
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:26,563
I hope.

354
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:30,505
-What's so funny.

355
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:32,409
Are you guys telling
jokes, or something?

356
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:33,713
-Guess again.

357
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:34,448
-Hold on.

358
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:35,416
I don't know this guy.

359
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,519
Is he a new member?

360
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:37,855
-That's right.

361
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,060
Haze Middle School is gonna have
a boy's team and a girl's team

362
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:41,062
competing this year.

363
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,499
Isn't that amazing?

364
00:17:42,532 --> 00:17:43,602
-I didn't know about this.

365
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:45,105
-You have a third player?

366
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:45,840
-Yeah.

367
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:47,343
You already met her.

368
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:48,713
Hikaru brought her in.

369
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,484
She said she would
play for us if she

370
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:52,989
got to compete in
the tournaments.

371
00:17:53,023 --> 00:17:55,328
-I totally forgot about her.

372
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,066
At least now there'll
be an experienced player

373
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,435
on the girl's team.

374
00:17:58,468 --> 00:17:59,404
-See, th three.

375
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:00,640
I told you so.

376
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:03,046
-Akari, am I gonna have to
play in the tournament, too?

377
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,549
-That's the plan.

378
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:06,788
-Wait a minute!

379
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,858
-I've got something that
you'll want to read.

380
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:10,763
-Hm?

381
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:12,434
-Take a look at this.

382
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,939
There's an article in here
that I could hardly believe.

383
00:18:14,973 --> 00:18:17,913
It said that Akira Toya
just passed pro exam.

384
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,082
-Huh.

385
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:20,920
Oh, yeah?

386
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:21,888
-What's with you?

387
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:23,559
I thought you'd be surprised.

388
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:24,996
-Is that your news?

389
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:27,066
Kaio's captain already
told me all about it.

390
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,971
-You were talking
with Kishimoto?

391
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:30,775
Where did you see that creep?

392
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:31,844
-The mall.

393
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,682
We ran into each other
in the bookstore.

394
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,486
I guess it was
about a month ago.

395
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,091
He said Akira was going to
start his pro career sometime

396
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,695
next April.

397
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:40,731
[sigh]

398
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:41,933
-Know what else?

399
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,837
I've decided that I don't
want to lose to that guy.

400
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,143
That's the reason I've
been studying Go every day.

401
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:47,813
-I get it now.

402
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:49,083
You've been pushing yourself.

403
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,953
That explains why
you've improved.

404
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:51,688
-Thanks.

405
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:52,758
I guess you're right.

406
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:53,860
I've grown a lot.

407
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:57,134
I bet I'm good enough
to take that Insei test.

408
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:57,936
-Insei?

409
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,008
-You're kidding, right?

410
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,048
-Pretty cool, huh?

411
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,952
Don't look so shocked.

412
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:06,556
I've got to do this.

413
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:07,959
Kishimoto said I
need to get serious,

414
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,198
or I'll never catch up to Akira.

415
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:12,470
Anyway, they asked me to
bring three game records

416
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:13,638
on the day of my test.

417
00:19:13,672 --> 00:19:17,146
Do you guys know how to
fill in one of these forms?

418
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,616
Kimihiro, you'll help me, right?

419
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,930
Uh, what's wrong with you guys?

420
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,935
-Have you thought this through?

421
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:28,706
-Hm?

422
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:30,978
-You wanna be an
Insei, that's fine,

423
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:34,452
but you won't be allowed to
compete in amateur tournaments.

424
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:34,935
-What?

425
00:19:57,838 --> 00:19:58,295
-Hikaru?

426
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:09,932
-Hm.

427
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:11,101
Now you know.

428
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,643
At least you didn't waste
your time on that test.

429
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,650
Now, let's forget about all
this Insei stuff, shall we?

430
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,184
Come on.

431
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,254
Well play a game.

432
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:19,855
-Uh.

433
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,870
-What's going on?

434
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:27,354
Hikaru?

435
00:20:35,323 --> 00:20:36,826
-You need to choose.

436
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,200
It's us or them.

437
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:41,671
You'd have to quite the Go club.

438
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:43,007
Are you prepared to do that?

439
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:56,971
[theme music]

440
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,670
SAI: Are you going to
stay in the Go club?

441
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:26,440
HIKARU: It's a tough
decision, but I

442
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:28,779
know I gotta give Kimihiro
and Yuuki an answer.

443
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:31,579
SAI: Kaga has his own opinions
on what you should do.

444
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:33,948
HIKARU: I don't even know if
I'm good enough to an Insei yet.

445
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:35,650
SAI: They can help you find out.

446
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:36,317
HIKARU: Really?

447
00:22:40,488 --> 00:22:44,592
Next time, the Haze
Middle School Go club.

448
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,027
SAI: They'll challenge
you to a game

449
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,363
unlike any you've had before.
