3
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:21,626
That move I just
played, it was exactly

4
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:24,162
the same move he'd have played.

5
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:30,869
He was here.

6
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:32,504
I've been looking
for him everywhere.

7
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:41,713
And he was here all the time.

8
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:49,187
The only way for
me to see him again

9
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,156
was by actually having a game.

10
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:59,464
I promise from now on, I'm
going to play all the time--

11
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:02,700
dozens, hundreds, even
thousands of games against you,

12
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:05,136
Isumi, and Waya and
Ochi and everyone.

13
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,848
I'm leaving now.

-Yeah.

16
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:25,123
-Is it just the one game today?

17
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:26,457
-No, I told you yesterday.

18
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:27,759
I'm going to play every day.

19
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,028
Can you let to school know I'm
not going to be there today?

-Whoa.

24
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:49,681
You'll be promoted to
3-dan if you win today?

00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:50,353
-Yeah.

26

-Aren't you supposed to
be playing that kid who's

27
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,622
been skipping his
games for months now?

28
00:03:57,622 --> 00:03:59,057
-Yeah, that's right.

29
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,060
I win by default, and then
they can move up the rankings.

30
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,229
-Well, jeez, lucky for you.

31
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:09,801
-To be honest, I would
have rather earned

32
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,770
the promotion by actually
winning the game. [chuckles]

-Huh?

37
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:28,019
-So, Shindo, you made it.

38
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,025
Great!

39
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,993
He just had to pick
today to be the one

40
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:10,728
day that he's going to show up.

00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:11,763
-What's up?

42
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:13,031
Did Shindo actually
make an appearance?

43
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:13,665
-Yeah.

44
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:14,966
Hey, Tsujioka.

45
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,135
-He's going to be my opponent
in the next game I've

46
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:18,169
got scheduled.

47
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:19,537
I'm glad he's back.

48
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,205
I've been wanting to play
him for a long time now.

49
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,940
-You want to play against him?

50
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:23,775
-Hmm.

51
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:24,909
-Yeah.

52
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,678
Ever since I heard this
rumor that Toya considers

53
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:28,546
him to be his rival,
I've wanted to see

54
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,847
what all the fuss was about.

55
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:31,916
-Toya and Shindo are rivals?

56
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:34,252
-I never heard that before!

57
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:35,086
Huh?

58
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,621
Are you really sure about that?

59
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:41,125
I mean, Toya's already made it
through to the Honinbo League.

60
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,527
-Good morning, excuse me.

71
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:33,204
MAN (VOICEOVER): I faced him
before in the Young Lions

72
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,806
Tournament last year.

73
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,177
He played a good game, even
gave me a bit of a scare.

74
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,012
But his end game
wasn't strong enough,

75
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,780
and I beat him by
6 and 1/2 points.

76
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,020
Afterwards, Toya kept
asking me about Shindo,

77
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,755
wanting to know
how he had played.

78
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:56,494
At that time, it
really ticked me off

79
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:59,130
that he didn't want to
know about me and my game.

80
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:01,532
But if Shindo really
was his rival,

81
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,100
that would explain
why was so interested.

82
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:08,172
I need to play a
solid game here,

83
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:09,507
keep control of my territory.

84
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:16,781
All I need to do is hold
steady until the end game,

85
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:18,516
and I'm going to win for sure.

86
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:21,486
He's going to find out just
how weak his end game is.

Are you sure, Kaneko?

95
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:54,685
Hikaru's not coming
to school today

96
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,521
because he's got
a match to play?

97
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:57,488
-Yep.

98
00:08:57,488 --> 00:08:58,689
In the next two or
three days, he's

99
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:00,725
off to do some sort of study
session thing for the Go

100
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:02,026
Association.

101
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:04,028
I don't think he's going to be
spending much time in school

102
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:05,630
if he's got all this Go to play.

103
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:06,497
-Good!

104
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:07,798
Hikaru's finally cheered up!

105
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:09,133
-That's great!

106
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,168
-I can't wait to see
how he's going to do.

107
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:12,503
This is awesome news.

108
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:13,638
-Good for him.

109
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,540
-Mr. Suzuki said he wasn't
worried about Shindo

110
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:17,642
missing a bit of school to
play Go since we've only

111
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,777
got a few classes left
before the summer break.

112
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:22,179
This way, he gets to be
happy and do what he wants.

113
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:24,916
-Hah, first he says he's
going to quit being a pro.

114
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:26,817
Next thing you know,
he's skipping classes

115
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,919
so he can play.

116
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,020

of the pot calling

-What's that?

121
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,028
-You only show up for practice
whenever you feel like it.

122
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:39,163
And then you tell us you
want to enter the tournament

123
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:41,933
and expect us to
put you on the team?

124
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:44,035
-Hah, I bet the
only reason Shindo

125
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,203
went back to being a pro
was because he's too lazy

126
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:48,873
and got bored studying
for his entrance exams.

127
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:51,642
-Oh, and I guess you study
in the library all the time,

128
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:52,810
and you're in the honor roll.

129
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:53,744
Is that it?

130
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:54,712
-Shut it!

131

-[laughs]

132
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:57,782
-You know, if it
wasn't for Mitani,

133
00:09:57,815 --> 00:09:59,183
we wouldn't have
been able to enter

134
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,818
a boys' team in the tournament.

135
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,119
-And you guys did so well!

136
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:03,621
You made it to the final!

137
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:06,123
I know Kaio ended up beating
you three to nothing, but still!

138
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:08,526
-And you girls really
had a great first round,

139
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,760
winning three in a row.

140
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:11,062
-Yup, I know!

141
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:11,996
I couldn't believe it.

142
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,798
It was so exciting!

143
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,166
[girls giggle]

144
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,567
-It's not fair.

145
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:18,235
You guys are all
in the third year,

146
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:21,072
so you're going to be
leaving the Go Club soon.

147
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:23,040
[groans]

148
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,775
What am I going to do?

149
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:26,243
I can't play on my own.

150
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:29,780
-But, Koike, when this Go
Club was first started up

151
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:32,883
by Tsutsui, there was just
one person who belonged to it.

152
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,552
-He was the only one?

153
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:35,620
AKARI (VOICEOVER): Yeah.

154
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,822
Tsutsui started the
club all by himself.

155
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:40,992
Then Hikaru joined, and
I tagged along with him.

156
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,861
After that, Hikaru managed
to drag Mitani into it.

157
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,198
So it didn't take long for
the club to get bigger.

158
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:50,167
Later on, we invited Kaneko
to join as a temporary member.

159
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:55,606
And then Natsume and
Kumiko came, too!

160
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,576
Anyway, that's how we all got
together at the Haze Go Club.

161
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:00,077
-Wow.

162
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:02,480
-Sure, it's fun to have a
lot of people in the club,

163
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:03,781
but you've got to
start somewhere.

164
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:05,049
So why not start with you?

165
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:06,784
-From now on, this
Go Club is going

166
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,252
to have to be run by you, Koike.

167
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:09,820
-You mean, it's my club?

168
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:10,755
-You bet it is.

169
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:11,589
All yours.

00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:13,457
-[laughs]

171
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:15,559
-Go Club is mine now.

172
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:17,595
-Maybe you'll even
beat Kaio one day.

173
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:18,596
-That's impossible.

AKARI (VOICEOVER): The
Haze Go Club is changing,

176
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:30,541
and so are we.

177
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:33,511
Even Hikaru, who decided
to quit playing as a pro,

178
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:35,046
has started up again.

179
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,114
Right now, I bet he's
sitting at a Go board

180
00:11:37,148 --> 00:11:38,616
with one of those
intense looks he

181
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,151
gets when he's in
the middle of a game.

182
00:11:59,091 --> 00:12:01,494
-Oh, not again.

183
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:03,929
Why am I such a terrible player?

184
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:04,864
-No, you're not.

185
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:06,832
I just had a few lucky moves.

186
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:11,003
-No, let's face
it, I'm the worst.

187
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:13,105
WAYA: I thought it
was a good game.

188
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,007
-Oh, thank you.

189
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,976
That game was closer
than you think.

190
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:19,178
You focused on your
strengths, and you almost

191
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:20,079
pulled off a win.

192
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:21,881
You played a strong game.

193
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:23,249
-You think so?

194
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,527
-Aah.

195
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:37,029
Oh, by the way, Isumi?

196
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:38,130
-Hm?

197
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:40,199
You went over to Shindo's
place, didn't you?

198
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:41,534
-Uh-huh.

199
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:43,269
-Oh, you never told us.

200
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,236
So how's he doing?

201
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,571
Is he all right?

202
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,339
-Yeah.

203
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:50,042
Well, I don't know
what happened.

204
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:54,914
But whatever it was
he was going through,

205
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:57,249
he seems to have
gotten over it now.

206
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:00,186
We even played Go.

207
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:02,254
-That's good.

208
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:03,222
What a jerk!

about him like that.

Is something wrong?

Ah, Mr. Amano.

And I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

237
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:13,485
Well, I've got some news
about Hikaru Shindo.

238
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,321
You seem to take an
interest in him before,

239
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:16,789
so I wanted to let you know.

00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:19,391
Yes.

Oh.

243
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,997
You mean he started
playing again?

244
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:26,265
I see.

245
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:28,200
Well, I appreciate you taking
the time to give me a call.

246
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:28,801
Bye.

247
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,273
Hm, Shindo's back in the game.

00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:40,512
Really?

00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:42,248
I-- I'll get right on it.

251
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:48,387
-Hm.

252
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,122
-I was looking for
the editor-in-chief,

253
00:15:50,122 --> 00:15:51,257
is he not here?

254
00:15:51,257 --> 00:15:53,192
-Ah, Kuwabara Sensei!

255
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:55,027
-Maybe you could
give him this for me?

256
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,062
It's the manuscript
he's been waiting for.

257

-Thank you for bringing
it all this way.

00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:00,866
-I was in the area on
some other business.

259
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,168
So it wasn't any
trouble to drop it off.

-That's very nice of you.

Hm.

-Hm, something on
your mind, Mr. Amano?

263

-Well, I was just
thinking about something

264
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:18,851
you mentioned to
me the other day.

265
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:21,220
Do you remember we had a
conversation about Hikaru

266
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:24,523
Shindo, the new 1-dan player
who had been missing his games?

267
00:16:24,556 --> 00:16:27,860
You said you were sure he'd
come back to play again, right?

268
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:29,028
-That's right.

269
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:31,830
I gather you were about
to tell me I was correct.

270
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:32,931
-You were.

271
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:35,267
But what I can't figure
out is why you're also

272
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:37,269
concerned about this
one particular boy.

273
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:39,872
Because it's not
only you, there's

Ogata Sensei, Kurata Sensei,
and even Toya Sensei.

What makes him so special?

I believe that's something we've
all been trying to find out,

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,185
no?

00:16:53,218 --> 00:16:54,053

-There's no hurry, Mr. Amano.

281
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,122
We'll learn more soon enough.

282

Mark my words.

283
00:16:58,557 --> 00:17:02,227

about these sort of things.

Shindo's comeback game?

If he considered
Shindo to be his rival,

he would have wanted to
check out how he's playing.

Maybe he thinks

312
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:58,570
a game against such a low-ranked

The only way I

can measure Shindo's

something different about him.

HIKARU (VOICEOVER): The
pro exam is starting,

327
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:23,800
and everyone is focused
on making it through.

328
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,036
And I better focus on getting
some wins, too, or else,

329
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:27,470
I won't be going
up in the rankings

330
00:22:27,704 --> 00:22:30,907
like Toya has been doing.

331
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:32,976
Some of the older players
are having a tough time

332
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:34,077
hanging on to their titles.

333
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:41,318
But the big question
is, what's going

334
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,254
to happen when I finally
get to play Toya?

335
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:46,648
Next time, "The Race Is On"!
