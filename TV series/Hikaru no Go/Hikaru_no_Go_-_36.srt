[theme music]

2
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,346
-Sit down and I'll play
a teaching game with you.

3
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,016
-I'm not playing
any teaching game.

4
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:56,810
-Huh?

5
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,156
I can't let my guard
down for a single minute.

6
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,125
This guy's stronger
than I thought.

7
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,431
If I lose, then that's it.

8
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,968
It's all over for me.

9
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,270
Hey, you!

10
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,705
You're going to
have to tell me what

11
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,376
your name is, if I
don't win this game.

12
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,443
-Oh yeah?

13
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,112
You're going to remember
my name all right.

14
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,104
-Hm.

15
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,142
What's happening here?

16
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,977
Is there something
special going on today?

17
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:57,444
Oh.

18
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,645
Hello, Mr. Yun.

19
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,248
We've got a match in progress
between a Japanese insei

20
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,216
and a Korean insei.

21
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,486
-An international showdown, huh?

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,722
Huh?

23
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,558
That's the boy from
Haze middle school.

24
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,626
-You mean you know him?

25
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,260
-Yeah.

26
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,261
I recognize him.

27
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,595
He's an insei?

28
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,264
Are you guys sure about that?

29
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,533
-That's what the kid
said when they got here.

30
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,702
He's playing Mr.
Ryu's nephew who

31
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,237
happens to be
visiting from Korea.

32
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,139
-He's an insei ready?

33
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,407
It can't be.

34
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,208
That's impossible.

35
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,318
Now what was his name?

36
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,120
I think it was Shindo.

37
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,055
I remember the first
time I saw him play.

38
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,457
I was very impressed by him.

39
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,031
-Huh?

40
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,233
-You played extremely well.

41
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:59,339
[sobbing] But the
next time I saw him,

42
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,642
his performance
was disappointing.

43
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:06,747
And I wasn't the only
one was disappointed.

44
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,150
His opponent, Akira Toya,
obviously felt the same way,

45
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,985
judging by his
reaction to the game.

46
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,994
-Thank you very
much for the game.

47
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,395
-Same to you, It
was a good match.

48
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,104
-I know a whole year
has passed since then.

49
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,240
But could he really
ahve improved so much

50
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,307
that he's now an insei?

51
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,117
-Come on.

52
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,156
I can't lose to him.

53
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,101
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Oh man.

54
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:07,974
There's no way--
no way I'm going

55
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,242
to lose to a guy like him.

56
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,449
SAI (VOICEOVER):
Even though this all

57
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,485
started with an
argument, the end result

58
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,121
is an absolutely
wonderful game of Go!

59
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,264
Both of them are playing
such inspired moves.

60
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,565
And they're
responding with moves

61
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,634
that are equally inspired.

62
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,970
They're both desperate
to win the match.

63
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,972
They're throwing
caution to the wind.

64
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,207
Yes.

65
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,178
It is as though their hands
are moving of their own accord,

66
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,282
forging a new path
with each stone.

67
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:26,386
How radiant they are
as their game improves.

68
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,588
But there can only
be one winner.

69
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,291
Which one of them will follow
the path that leads to victory?

70
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,601
YUN (VOICEOVER):
This is remarkable.

71
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,737
Even though the Korean
boy has the advantage,

72
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,538
Shindo's holding his own.

73
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,674
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): They're
both playing a risky game

74
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:52,279
with some tough moves, but
Shindo's still slightly behind.

75
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,313
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Shindo!

76
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,266
YUN (VOICEOVER):
What's he intending

77
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,102
to do with that last move?

78
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,038
-Hm.

79
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,542
He just made a big mistake.

80
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,717
WAYA (VOICEOVER): What do you
think you're doing, Shindo?

81
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,285
What kind of move was that?

82
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,429
YUN (VOICEOVER):
What's happening?

83
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,699
Was that a careless mistake or
was a part of a bigger plan?

84
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,739
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Shindo.

85
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,997
SU-YEONG (VOICEOVER): Did
you make a wrong move?

86
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,664
Oh well.

87
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,299
That's too bad.

88
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,067
I guess it was the
best you could do.

89
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:45,258
SAI (VOICEOVER): No one realizes
what Hikaru's strategy is.

90
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,661
He's playing at a level far
above anyone in this room.

91
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,995
[gasp]

92
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,531
SU-YEONG (VOICEOVER): I thought
that move of his was a mistake,

93
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,266
but now it's put him
in a great position.

94
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:44,017
[groan]

95
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,385
ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
That move Shindo

96
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,720
made earlier wasn't
a mistake at all.

97
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,191
He was anticipating a battle
for the upper left corner.

98
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,576
-Hm?

99
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:39,933
YUN (VOICEOVER): He
was fully aware he

100
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:43,203
was going to lose ground
in the middle of the board.

101
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:46,072
But now all of a sudden change,
Shindo has the advantage.

102
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:50,977
-You think we made
that move, he could

103
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,479
have been thinking
this far ahead?

104
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,514
Did he plan the whole thing?

105
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:55,115
-Huh?

106
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:01,354
SU-YEONG (VOICEOVER): The
game could go either way,

107
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:03,990
but I can still win
by-- by moving here.

108
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:13,666
He was going after that stone?

109
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,068
I should have seen it coming.

110
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:39,092
I can't let it bother me.

111
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,318
ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
Su-Yeong's managing

112
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,319
to catch up with Shindo.

113
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:18,031
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Uh-oh.

114
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:19,399
Shindo's lost territory.

115
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:53,960
-Hm.

116
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:30,496
-I don't believe it.

117
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,066
Shindo wins by one
and a half points.

118
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:46,679
-What an amazing match.

119
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,081
Really intense.

120
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:49,182
-You're telling me.

121
00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:51,084
It had me guessing right
up to the very end.

122
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:52,218
-Kudos to both players.

123
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:55,088
They should be proud of
that game, win or lose.

124
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:56,422
-What an attack by white.

125
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:59,192
What a game.

126
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:00,626
-Su-Yeong, you OK?

127
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:02,595
[sobbing]

128
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,321
SU-YEONG (VOICEOVER):
I-- I lost?

129
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:31,724
I haven't been beaten like
that in a long, long time.

130
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:38,431
I played one bad game,
and then paid for it

131
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:41,934
by dropping down a class for
the first time in my life.

132
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:45,338
My game's been
messed up ever since.

133
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:48,007
Then this guy appears
and challenges me.

134
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,475
So I take him on.

135
00:15:49,475 --> 00:15:52,378
I played a tough game, but
he stayed right with me.

136
00:15:57,617 --> 00:16:00,219
I'm just as good as he is.

137
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:03,089
Even though he won,
I won't be defeated.

138
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:06,192
I'll come back to an
Japan and play you again.

139
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:09,695
But next time as a pro.

140
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,397
-I want to know your name!

141
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:12,231
-Huh?

142
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:14,200
-Tell me what's your name.

143
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,135
I need to know
what your name is.

144
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:21,207
-My name's Hikaru Shindo.

145
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:22,608
Hope you'll remember it.

146
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:23,376
Hikaru Shindo.

147
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:29,982
-Hikaru Shindo.

148
00:16:30,016 --> 00:16:30,950
I got it.

149
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,929
-Su-Yeong.

150
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:46,165
He's so disappointed in himself,
he can't hold back his tears.

151
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,934
That's the way it should be.

152
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:49,068
-Huh?

153
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:51,704
-He was advancing so
smoothly up the ranks

154
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:55,341
that dropping down a class
came as quite a shock.

155
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:57,944
He felt ashamed and he
didn't want to admit it.

156
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,946
He tried avoiding
all the frustration

157
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:01,314
that was building inside him.

158
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:03,082
-I think this is yours Su-Yeong.

159
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:05,051
[cheering]

160
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:10,356
-He's going to be OK.

161
00:17:10,356 --> 00:17:12,458
Su-Yeong goes back
to Korea tomorrow,

162
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:14,093
and I have no doubt
his game is going

163
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:16,062
to improve because of
what happened here today.

164
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:19,532
-Shindo.

165
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:20,132
-Huh?

166
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:29,308
-Who's that?

167
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:31,410
-Um-- he's a-- I--

168
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:34,213
-Hikaru, don't
you recognize him?

169
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:36,115
It's the man from the Go club.

170
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:39,285
-I'm Mr. Yun, advisor to
the Kaio School Go club.

171
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:41,621
You probably don't remember me.

172
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,523
-You're from Kaio Middle School?

173
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:45,458
-If my memory serves
me right, this

174
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:47,226
is the third time we've met.

175
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:49,195
The first time I saw
you, I was astonished

176
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:50,429
by how well you played.

177
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:52,598
And to think you were
only in grade school.

178
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:55,468
-Actually, I think that
was one of my games.

179
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:56,569
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): -Right.

180
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:59,005
-The second time was
last year's tournament.

181
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,375
I had high expectations of you,
but you didn't live up to them.

182
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:03,676
SAI (VOICEOVER):
But after seeing

183
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:07,480
him play today, your opinion
of him has changed, hasn't it?

184
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,482
-Now I've seen you
play a third time.

185
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:11,384
I have to say I'm amazed.

186
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:12,251
-I knew it!

187
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:13,352
I knew it!

188
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:15,288
-As I was standing there
watching the two of you

189
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:18,691
fight it out, I saw
strong aspiring pros.

190
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:22,995
You handled a difficult position
with great skill and maturity.

191
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,563
-Wow!

192
00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:24,363
Did you hear that?

193
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:25,197
Hikaru?

194
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:26,198
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Yeah.

195
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:27,233
What a great compliment.

196
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:31,470
And it's for me!

197
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:33,205
Not Sai!

198
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:35,942
-When I think back to
when I first saw you,

199
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:39,078
that wonderful game of Go you
played that helped Haze win

200
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:40,446
the school tournament--

201
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,547
SAI (VOICEOVER): Thank you.

202
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:43,516
That was all my doing.

203
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:45,718
-I didn't believe a
student in sixth grade

204
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:48,087
could be capable of such
a high level of play.

205
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,189
SAI (VOICEOVER): Of course not.

206
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:54,293
-But today's match was every
bit as impressive as that one.

207
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:55,161
SAI (VOICEOVER): No.

208
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:56,562
You've got it all mixed up.

209
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:57,964
That was me.

210
00:18:57,997 --> 00:18:59,365
-And now I'm convinced.

211
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:02,101
The person who played that
magical match and the person I

212
00:19:02,134 --> 00:19:03,336
see here are one and the same.

213
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:11,177
I won't forget your name.

214
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,213
It'll stay in my memory forever.

215
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:15,147
Hikaru Shindo.

216
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:33,933
-Well should we go home?

217
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,234
Great game today.

218
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:36,602
You did really good.

219
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:39,338
-I can't believe the pro
exams start next week already.

220
00:19:39,372 --> 00:19:41,607
Next time we see each other,
we'll be in the exam room.

221
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:46,345
-Remember.

222
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:48,147
The exam isn't at
the Go Association.

223
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,182
The matches all take
place at the study center.

224
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:51,183
-Got it.

225
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:52,084
-See you later.

226
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:53,099
-See you.

227
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:57,623
Sai, what do you say
we head home too?

228
00:19:57,623 --> 00:19:58,224
OK?

229
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:04,363
Ahh.

230
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:05,064
You know what?

231
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:06,932
I'm kind of good.

232
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:08,567
Isn't it awesome?

233
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:11,137
The teacher from Kaio
thinks my game is so strong

234
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,673
that he believes it was me
who was playing in the school

235
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:15,274
tournament!

236
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:18,310
He actually believes he was
watching me and not you.

237
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:21,347
In his eyes, you never
even existed, Sai.

238
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:22,348
[gasp]

239
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:24,116
SAI (VOICEOVER): I
don't don't exist?

240
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,388
-Once day, I'm going to erase
Sai from Akira's memory too!

241
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:31,257
SAI (VOICEOVER): Erase me?

242
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,325
-Remember the name--
Hikaru Shindo.

243
00:20:35,928 --> 00:20:37,530
SAI (VOICEOVER): Why
am I suddenly feeling

244
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:39,298
so apprehensive?

245
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,267
What does this mean?

246
00:20:53,612 --> 00:21:03,622
[theme music]

247
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:23,609
[theme music]

248
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:43,596
[theme music]

249
00:21:43,596 --> 00:22:03,616
[theme music]

250
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:21,167
[theme music]

251
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,335
SAI (VOICEOVER): The big
day has come, Hikaru.

252
00:22:23,335 --> 00:22:25,171
Time for you to
take the pro exam.

253
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:26,472
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I have to pass

254
00:22:26,505 --> 00:22:28,574
if I want to catch
up with Akira.

255
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:30,309
SAI (VOICEOVER):
Gorilla man's back.

256
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:32,611
This time, don't let
him intimidate you.

257
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:35,481
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I
think I can handle him now.

258
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:38,617
SAI (VOICEOVER): That's
the spirit, Hikaru.

259
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:42,054
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Next
time-- the pro exam begins!

260
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:43,989
SAI (VOICEOVER): Remember,
only the top three

261
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:45,491
can go to become pros.

262
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:48,427
There is a long struggle ahead.
