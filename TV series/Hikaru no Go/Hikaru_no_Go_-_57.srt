1
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:06,546
[theme song]

2
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,475
TOYA (VOICEOVER): I can feel
an unusual air surrounding

3
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:53,410
this game.

4
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:56,482
With every move,
every stone-- hmm.

5
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:58,453
I'm sure I've felt
this way before.

6
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,855
Yes.

7
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,559
This intensity.

8
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:04,497
This pressure seems familiar.

9
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,833
What?

10
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:07,803
AKIRA (VOICEOVER):
It's the old Shindo.

11
00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:09,674
I can see him in Sai.

12
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,185
SAI (VOICEOVER):
Now I understand.

13
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:21,162
The reason my spirit has
endured for a millennium

14
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:25,169
is so I could show
Hikaru this one game

15
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:27,406
and guide him toward
the divine move.

16
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:40,564
-[laughs]

17
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:41,566
SAI (VOICEOVER): Hikaru.

18
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,145
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Father.

19
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:55,458
-Sai.

20
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:56,561
Who are you?

21
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:08,549
-That's nice.

22
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,454
Hm?

23
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,692
I've been thinking, Sai.

24
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:16,464
Remember how you once told me
that sometimes only the person

25
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:19,871
who's playing can see all
the possibilities in a game?

26
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:23,344
It's weird, but
being there with you,

27
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:26,182
I could almost see your thoughts
as you were thinking them.

28
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:29,188
I felt like I knew what
Toya Meijin was thinking to.

29
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:30,724
Even though I wasn't
actually playing,

30
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:33,195
it seemed like I was in
the middle of it all.

31
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,404
Imagine how disappointed
Toya-sensei is going to be.

32
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:40,408
You beat him, Sai!

33
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:41,710
[gasp]

34
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:44,616
-If I lose to your
friend, then I'll retire.

35
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,720
I won't play again.

36
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:49,592
--[whimper] Do you really
think he's gonna retire?

37
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,363
Whoa!

38
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:53,599
Remind me not to do that again.

39
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:15,573
-Here we are.

40
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:17,811
I got here as quickly
as I could to see him.

41
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:25,592
Retire?

42
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,297
He can't give it all up
because he lost one game.

43
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,768
I mean, he's one of the
best players in the world.

44
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:34,475
He can't just disappear off
the scene like that, can he?

45
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,479
-Huh?

46
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:38,850
Uh, no.

47
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:40,452
-What's the matter with you?

48
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:42,390
You're not even
paying attention.

49
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,658
I mean, come on.

50
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:46,531
I'm always the one who has to
do the worrying around here.

51
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:49,836
All right, let's go, Sai.

52
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:50,438
-Hm.

53
00:04:57,351 --> 00:05:00,690
-[sigh]

54
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,393
-[knocking]

55
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,564
-Hm?

56
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:06,568
Is that you, Akira?

57
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:07,570
-Uh, hi.

58
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:09,273
Good morning.

59
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:10,608
-Please come in.

60
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:11,410
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,248
What's your name again?

62
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:14,983
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Oh.

63
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,653
That must be Akira's mom.

64
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,623
-Uh, my name's Hikaru.

65
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:21,796
-This is Hikaru Shindo, one
of the new batch of pros.

66
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,265
I played him once, remember?

67
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,901
And he came to visit last week.

68
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:26,271
-Oh, that's right.

69
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,576
I saw his name mentioned
in Go Weekly once before.

70
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:29,845
Let me see.

71
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:32,916
You're about the same age
as Akira, isn't that right?

72
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,820
-[laughs]

73
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,558
-Akiko, dear, I'd like to
have a few words in private

74
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:37,993
with the boy.

75
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:39,996
Would you mind?

76
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,265
-I'll wait outside.

77
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:57,796
-Look, uh, I know you resigned
in your game against Sai

78
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,735
yesterday, but you're not
really going to retire.

79
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,436
Are you?

80
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,681
I mean, that was
just something you

81
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:09,718
said in the heat of
the moment, right?

82
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:13,659
You wouldn't actually give it
all up because you lost a game.

83
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:15,596
You were joking, weren't you?

84
00:06:15,596 --> 00:06:17,800
I had to come and make sure.

85
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:21,507
-Are you Sai?

86
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,512
Tell me the truth.

87
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:24,980
-No!

88
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,382
No, I'm not!

89
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,718
Why would you say that?

90
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:31,358
-There was something about the
game that reminded me of you.

91
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,894
It made me think of
the time we played

92
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:34,097
each other in the [inaudible].

93
00:06:57,707 --> 00:07:01,614
-I suppose I shouldn't pry.

94
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:04,920
Sai's identity
doesn't matter to me.

95
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:11,667
But Shindo, I want another game.

96
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,907
Let me play one more
time against Sai.

97
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,113
It can be over the internet
if that's what he wants.

98
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:21,384
And if he agrees,
I promise I won't

99
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:22,787
ask him to reveal his name.

100
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,035
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Another game?

101
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,471
I don't know.

102
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:35,143
I guess if he's willing to
play online, it could work.

103
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:39,417
Yeah.

104
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,821
Why not?

105
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:43,492
As long as I can trust him to
keep the fact that I'm involved

106
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:47,466
in this secret, I don't see why
he shouldn't have the chance

107
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:48,901
to play Sai once in awhile.

108
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:53,477
And I bet Sai would love having
such an awesome opponent.

109
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,645
SAI (VOICEOVER): No.

110
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:57,083
It's too late.

111
00:07:57,117 --> 00:08:01,926
I feel I don't have
much time left.

112
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:09,607
It's slipping away
relentlessly, without mercy.

113
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,613
The sands of time had
been frozen for me,

114
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:14,984
but they've begun
to flow once again.

115
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:23,833
-Sensei.

116
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:24,835
-Hm?

117
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:26,070
-OK.

118
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,442
If I was able to arrange
another game for you with Sai,

119
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,848
promise me you'd forget
about retirement.

120
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,854
-I'm a man of my word,
and I've made my decision.

121
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:37,692
It is my intention to
retire from professional go

122
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,863
after the final game
of the Judan Series.

123
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:40,665
-But why?

124
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:42,000
That's ridiculous!

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,970
You can't be serious!

126
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,907
-I've been thinking
about it for some time,

127
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:49,447
and retirement is
inevitable for me.

128
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:51,918
There are a lot of
benefits, you know.

129
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:54,523
It would mean an end to the
constraints and obligations

130
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:57,696
that come with being
a professional player.

131
00:08:57,729 --> 00:09:00,735
No more tedious interviews
with the press, for instance.

132
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,640
It's not like I won't be
playing go ever again.

133
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,755
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): That's
the one thing Sai can't do.

134
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:21,541
-The games I play don't have
to be important title matches.

135
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:24,712
I can play a serious
game of go anytime.

136
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:27,485
Yesterday's match against
Sai was proof of that.

137
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:31,892
That was a game at the
very highest level.

138
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:34,030
Let me play him
once more, Shindo.

139
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:54,000
OGATA (VOICEOVER): Sai's true
identity remains a mystery.

140
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,570
But there has to
be someone who has

141
00:09:55,604 --> 00:10:00,813
a connection with him--
someone close to us.

142
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,182
Is it Shindo?

143
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:04,553
Or did someone else come
to visit the hospital?

144
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:17,644
Either way, someone
knew that Toya-sensei

145
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:20,683
had started playing go
online and acted as a go

146
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,219
between for the
game against Sai.

147
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:25,558
Who could it be?

148
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,863
There's only one
way to find out.

149
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:35,276
HIKARU: But it doesn't make
any sense for you to retire.

150
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,982
OGATA (VOICEOVER): I
recognize that voice.

151
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:38,582
Shindo.

152
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,093
I have to hear what he's saying.

153
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,772
HIKARU: I know you might be
fine with it, but what about me?

154
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:51,841
I can't let you do if.

155
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:52,775
It's all my fault!

156
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:53,977
Try and understand.

157
00:10:53,977 --> 00:10:58,219
You do want to play against
Sai again, don't you?

158
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:00,156
I know Sai wouldn't want
you to retire either,

159
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,792
so why not just forget about?

160
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:04,798
Pretend you never
even mentioned it.

161
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,281
-Hikaru!

162
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,581
-Ogata?

163
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:15,218
-Did I hear you say Sai?

164
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:22,264
So there is a connection
between you and Sai after all!

165
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:22,931
-No no no!

166
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:23,800
I don't know him!

167
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,902
I don't know anything about him!

168
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:25,603
-Ogata.

169
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:26,138
-Don't lie to me.

170
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:28,809
I heard every word!

171
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:30,746
-See you!

172
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,651
-Come back!

173
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:34,134
Shindo!

174
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:39,162
Did you set it up?

175
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:41,800
The game between
Sai and the Meijin?

176
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:46,141
-I told you, I don't know him!

177
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:47,143
-Don't lie to me!

178
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:50,148
I know you know Sai!

179
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:51,885
Let me play him!

180
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:02,238
-Ogata-sensei.

181
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:19,277
Ogata-sensei.

182
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,880
-You knew about Sai all along!

183
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:25,681
You know him.

184
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:28,253
Let me play him!

185
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:29,188
-How can I?

186
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:30,090
I don't know him!

187
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,957
I don't know Sai.

188
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,694
So stop bugging me, OK?

189
00:12:32,728 --> 00:12:34,965
I happened to see him play
a game against Toya-sensei,

190
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,801
and that was only
on the internet.

191
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:41,151
Huh?

192
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,923
-What are you doing here?

193
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:48,405
-T-Toya!

194
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:54,902
-Shindo!

195
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,215
-Mr. Ogata!

196
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,051
What's going on?

197
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,922
What was he doing here?

198
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:08,895
-Shindo was visiting
your father in his room.

199
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:11,132
But as soon as I
arrived, he ran away.

200
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:16,875
Upon arrival, I
overheard a small part

201
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,412
of their conversation.

202
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:23,956
I'm almost positive that
Shindo knows who Sai really is.

203
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,126
He denied everything when
I asked him about it.

204
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:31,136
But we can get to the truth
if we ask your father.

205
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:33,106
AKIRA (VOICEOVER):
They know each other?

206
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,709
No.

207
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:35,443
Shindo and Sai?

208
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:39,284
Is it possible?

209
00:13:44,794 --> 00:13:46,030
-Hm?

210
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,265
-Sensei.

211
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:48,434
-Yes, Ogata?

212
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,440
Akira.

213
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,145
-Your game against Sai was
arranged by Shindo, wasn't it?

214
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,124
-No, it wasn't.

215
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:03,429
-But sensei!

216
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:06,968
-He had nothing to do with it.

217
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:09,073
I was on the internet
yesterday morning,

218
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:12,145
and Sai requested
a game with me.

219
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:14,215
That's all it was.

220
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:16,252
By your interest,
I'm assuming both

221
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:18,723
of you watched the game online.

222
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,330
It was a game Koyo Toya could
be proud of, don't you think?

223
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:31,915
Despite the fact that in the
end, Sai managed to beat me.

224
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:35,822
--[growls] Akira, why
don't you try asking him?

225
00:14:35,856 --> 00:14:38,727
You want to find out Sai's
true identity, don't you?

226
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:45,206
-If my father says he has
nothing to do with it,

227
00:14:45,206 --> 00:14:47,878
then there's no point in
me asking him about it.

228
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:53,788
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Mr.
Ogata seems to be convinced

229
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:57,963
that Sai and Shindo are
two different people.

230
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,270
I'm not so sure about that.

231
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:04,208
But one thing's certain.

232
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,812
Shindo holds the key to
finding out the truth.

233
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:14,961
--[sigh] I guess I'm wasting my
time if both Shindo and sensei

234
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:15,930
pretend they don't know.

235
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,407
[sigh] I'm getting nowhere.

236
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:25,982
-Goodness.

237
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:26,984
Hello, Akira.

238
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:27,952
-Huh?

239
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:30,122
-And Mr. Ogata,
you're here as well.

240
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:31,391
-Hello.

241
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:33,964
-Did your friend
Shindo leave already?

242
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:35,399
He was here visiting earlier.

243
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:42,078
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Oh, that was close.

244
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:43,982
-[panting]

245
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:45,919
[coins clanking]

246
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:52,464
-Ogata must've overheard
me talking about you, Sai.

247
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:54,801
Why else would he run
after me like that?

248
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:56,238
And then Toya had to show up.

249
00:16:01,014 --> 00:16:03,418
He doesn't still think that
you and me are the same person,

250
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:05,555
does he?

251
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,225
Just have to keep
my fingers crossed

252
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,894
that Toya-sensei
won't say anything.

253
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:16,442
Anyway, I still think
it'd be OK to let

254
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,078
you play another
game with him, Sai.

255
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:24,590
Sai?

256
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:27,028
What's with the long face?

257
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,833
I just said I was going to let
you play him again, didn't I?

258
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:35,210
Huh?

259
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:37,247
Look, there's nothing
to worry about.

260
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:39,952
I think we can still
trust Toya-sensei to keep

261
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:41,321
my part in all this a secret.

262
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:45,095
So playing him someday soon
shouldn't be a problem.

263
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:48,267
-Will I have the
chance to play someday?

264
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:51,039
That day already seems
so distant to me.

265
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:52,909
So far away.

266
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:54,612
-What do you mean by that?

267
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,983
In case you forgot, you
just played yesterday!

268
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:01,358
Hmph!

269
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:03,963
You can never be
satisfied, can you?

270
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:05,065
Well, I'm going home!

271
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,177
Huh?

272
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:18,190
Man, you're unbelievable.

273
00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:19,359
OK, then.

274
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:21,328
If he carries through with
his promise to retire,

275
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:23,132
you might have to wait
for the controversy

276
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,237
to die down before
you can play him.

277
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,721
-Hm.

278
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:34,219
--[laughing] You're just
going to have to be patient.

279
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,354
You've got loads of time.

280
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:43,069
SAI (VOICEOVER): Time is
the one thing I do not have.

281
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,951
Hikaru is the one who has
the future ahead of him.

282
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:52,653
My time is running out.

283
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:07,013
-So, Waya.

284
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:08,148
This is it?

285
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:10,152
This is the game Toya
Meijin played yesterday

286
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:11,188
on the internet?

287
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,357
-Yep.

288
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,427
I watched the whole thing
from start to finish.

289
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,130
It was totally awesome.

290
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:17,432
You'll see.

291
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:21,172
-And Toya-sensei
was playing black?

292
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:23,410
-Yeah.

293
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:25,014
-It's hard to believe.

294
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:27,285
He was actually
using a computer?

295
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:29,588
I thought he was like
me and not interested

296
00:18:29,622 --> 00:18:31,292
in this new technology.

297
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,529
-Hey, everybody.

298
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:35,967
-Hello, Shindo.

299
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,434
-Hey.

300
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:37,436
How's it going?

301
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:38,438
Sai's back.

302
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:39,707
-Huh?

303
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:44,282
-Sai was online again yesterday,
and he was playing Toya Meijin.

304
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:45,585
We're replaying the game now.

305
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:48,390
-Really?

306
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:52,698
So, you got to see
all of it, Waya?

307
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,201
Yeah, me too.

308
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,002
-What?

309
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:56,572
Why didn't you say so?

310
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:58,308
-Who is this Sai, anyway?

311
00:18:58,342 --> 00:18:59,711
Was he the one playing white?

312
00:18:59,944 --> 00:19:01,180
-Yeah.

313
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:03,184
Do you remember me telling
you about this amazing player

314
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,288
we saw on the internet
a couple of years ago?

315
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:07,726
Well, this is the same guy.

316
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,030
OK, are you ready for this?

317
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:12,368
Then Sai-- I mean
white-- moved here.

318
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,370
-Whoa.

319
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,476
-That's a pretty bold move.

320
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:18,746
-Then after that,
look what happened.

321
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,287
And that's when black resigned.

322
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:24,758
Game over.

323
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:26,594
-Toya-sensei resigned here?

324
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:29,232
-There's only half
a point in it.

325
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:31,469
-White was in the lead,
but couldn't black

326
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,106
have regained some ground?

327
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,076
What if he'd let
this go over here?

328
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:37,147
-Would have been sentei.

329
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,753
At that point, he couldn't
afford any more losses.

330
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:42,323
-Hm.

331
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:44,427
This is starting to
give me a headache.

332
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,499
-[laughing]

333
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:48,468
-Ahem.

334
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:51,173
Here's a question for you.

335
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:52,208
-What is it?

336
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,179
-What if he played
in the corner first

337
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:57,317
before he made his
defensive move?

338
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,054
-Interesting.

339
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:00,090
Oh, yeah.

340
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:02,694
-You know what?

341
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:04,498
I think he's right.

342
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:06,334
-Oh!

343
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:08,271
-You see, if black
had done that, he'd

344
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:09,474
have a slight advantage.

345
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:11,478
-White would have been
forced into playing there

346
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,412
in the end game.

347
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,714
-You wouldn't want
to go back there

348
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:15,284
at that stage of the game.

349
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:17,622
-You never see stuff like
this normally, Shindo!

350
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:18,524
What happened?

351
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:20,260
-Waya, no need for that.

352
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,498
That move would have turned
the game around completely.

353
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:24,401
-Did you really calculate
it all by yourself?

354
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:25,804
-Well, that's what I'm saying.

355
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:27,473
He doesn't usually
bother with working

356
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:28,542
things out ahead of time.

357
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:31,481
-What's that supposed to mean?

358
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:33,117
SAI (VOICEOVER):
I'm not the only one

359
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,555
who is aware of
Hikaru's strength.

360
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:39,630
Even those around him
have started to take note.

361
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:45,707
It's clearly visible, shining
ahead of him-- the future

362
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:48,679
that he and I no longer share.

363
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:50,683
[theme song]

364
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,885
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
There's Kurata again!

365
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:24,857
I'm gonna challenge
him to a game.

366
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,228
SAI (VOICEOVER): He's
an expert, Hikaru.

367
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:28,665
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
He's so arrogant!

368
00:22:28,698 --> 00:22:29,867
I sure would like to beat him.

369
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,503
SAI (VOICEOVER):
That won't be easy.

370
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:32,638
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Hold on.

371
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:34,241
Both sets of stones are white?

372
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:35,811
SAI (VOICEOVER): It's
called one color go.

373
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:37,514
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): But I've
never had that kind of game

374
00:22:37,547 --> 00:22:38,483
before!

375
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:39,618
SAI (VOICEOVER):
It will be a test

376
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:41,837
to see what level
your game is at.

377
00:22:41,837 --> 00:22:44,272
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "One Color Go!"

378
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:47,409
SAI (VOICEOVER): Do you
still think you can beat him?
