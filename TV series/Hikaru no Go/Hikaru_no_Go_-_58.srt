[theme music]

2
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:50,381
-Are you Sai?

3
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:51,551
Tell me the truth.

4
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:52,152
-No.

5
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,555
No I'm not.

6
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:54,892
Why would you say that?

7
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:59,168
There was something about the
game that reminded me of you.

8
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:00,838
-What if he played
in the corner first,

9
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:03,144
before he made his
defensive move?

10
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:06,584
You see, if black had done that,
he'd have a slight advantage.

11
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:07,554
-I think he's right.

12
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:11,930
WAYA (VOICEOVER):
I'm not the only one

13
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:14,369
who is aware of
Hikaru's strength.

14
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:18,344
Even those around him
have started to take note.

15
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:23,690
It's clearly visible shining
ahead of him, the future

16
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,694
that he and I no longer share.

17
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:01,475
-Hm.

18
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:05,899
-Huh?

19
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,861
It's no good.

20
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:41,398
I resign.

21
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,768
-Thank you very
much for the game.

22
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,588
[chuckling]

23
00:03:51,588 --> 00:03:52,590
-Huh?

24
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,460
Kurata?

25
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:55,797
You finished already?

26
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,269
By the smile on your
face, I'd say you won.

27
00:03:58,302 --> 00:03:59,338
-You bet I did.

28
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:00,741
This year I'm giving
it all I've got

29
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,746
to win myself a championship.

30
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,383
-You've been playing well.

31
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:07,624
Even 9-dan players like Kamaishi
are apparently no match for you

32
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:08,826
now, huh?

33
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:09,996
-Nope.

34
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:12,435
Say, how are things going
over there in Nagano?

35
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:13,503
-Ah.

36
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:14,840
You mean the final game
of the Judan series.

37
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:16,677
So that's why you're here.

38
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,512
You want to know?

39
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:17,988
-Yeah.

40
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:19,692
Of course.

41
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:20,994
-Well, let me see.

42
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,498
There was a fax here somewhere.

43
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:23,014
Ah.

44
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:24,469
Here we are.

45
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:26,373
This is the latest
info we've got.

46
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:29,380
From about 30 minutes ago.

47
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,884
Looks like it's a
pretty close match.

48
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,422
Of course, Toya-sensei
has years of experience

49
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:36,463
on his side, which means
he's more likely to win.

50
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:38,100
[gong]

51
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,512
Ogata-sensei isn't
nearly as strong as him

52
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:44,581
in finishing off opponents.

53
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,960
He wasn't able to pull it off
in the final game of the Honinbo

54
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,462
series.

55
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:53,768
And my I guess is the same thing
will happen in the Judan series

56
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:54,971
today.

57
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,143
-That'll be less of a
problem the more championship

58
00:04:57,176 --> 00:04:58,545
experience he gets.

59
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,684
I've noticed his
game's been far more

60
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,688
aggressive in the
last little while.

61
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:03,624
-Yes.

62
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:05,895
So you could be
right about that.

63
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:07,566
-Did you take a look at these?

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,905
What's going on with Koyo Toya?

65
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:10,505
-What?

66
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:18,590
-This move here doesn't
make much sense to me.

67
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,595
Ogata seems to be
keeping his cool though.

68
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:24,704
Huh?

69
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:27,076
What's the Meijin doing
playing a move like that?

70
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,480
That's not like him at all.

71
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:29,950
-What do you mean
that's not like him?

72
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:46,970
-What?

73
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,237
Toya-sensei?

74
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,810
He lost?

75
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:57,293
-How?

76
00:06:06,164 --> 00:06:08,937
-In this equation, we use X
to solve Y. Now pay attention,

77
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,209
because this is guaranteed
to be on your exam.

78
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:13,814
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): How
could Toya-sensei lose?

79
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:15,652
I wonder if his internet
game against Sai

80
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:16,888
had anything to do with it.

81
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:22,134
Maybe he tired himself
out by playing too much.

82
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,238
Or just lost his focus.

83
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:25,674
I hope that it's not our fault.

84
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:30,853
-What do you think, Sai?

85
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:32,991
-I doubt we had
an adverse effect,

86
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:35,864
but we can't know for sure
until we see the game record.

87
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:37,201
-The game record?

88
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:38,938
-Yes.

89
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:42,814
Once we see it, we can get a
feel for his emotional journey

90
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,751
through the game.

91
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,288
-You can tell that
from the game record?

92
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,225
-Yes.

93
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:49,963
-You know what, Sai?

94
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:51,967
It's really good to see
that you're finally back

95
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,103
to normal again.

96
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:53,905
-Huh?

97
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:54,974
-Because you got to admit.

98
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:56,711
You have been acting
strange lately.

99
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:57,981
Like you're on another planet.

100
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:00,587
Always acting so some
serious about everything.

101
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,557
Well, you haven't been
as serious as Akira is,

102
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,094
but you've been
kind of restless.

103
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,132
I've been getting pretty
worried about you.

104
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:09,941
-Hm.

105
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:11,010
-Hey.

106
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,580
I didn't offend you
or anything, did I?

107
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:13,096
-No.

108
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:13,884
Not at all.

109
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:16,121
How could you have offended me?

110
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:18,293
Far from it.

111
00:07:18,326 --> 00:07:19,696
[sigh]

112
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,639
-Do you think Toya-sensei's
really going to retire?

113
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:25,643
-I don't know.

114
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:28,816
But he's not the sort of
man to go back on his word.

115
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,353
Not him.

116
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:32,358
-I guess you're right.

117
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:33,260
This stinks.

118
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:38,940
I want to check out
the game record,

119
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:41,378
but it won't be in Go
Weekly until next issue.

120
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:42,748
Hey.

121
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:46,189
Maybe we could see it now
at the Go Association.

122
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,363
[stomach rumbling]

123
00:07:49,597 --> 00:07:52,303
-But let's grab a
bite to eat first.

124
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:53,372
-Come on in.

125
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,140
Have a seat.

126
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:00,788
-Mr. Kurata.

127
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:01,790
-Who's that?

128
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,994
Shindo?

129
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:03,895
-What a surprise.

130
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,065
So what are you doing here?

131
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:05,834
-Duh.

132
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:07,804
What does it look like?

133
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:10,176
I'm chowing down on
some ramen, aren't I?

134
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,947
-Hm.

135
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:12,982
I'm not that stupid.

136
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:14,654
What I meant was what
are you doing here

137
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:15,822
in this neighborhood?

138
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:18,094
-I'm not paying for you
just because you sat down.

139
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:18,896
-I can buy my own.

140
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:20,400
Thanks.

141
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,268
-What can I get you?

142
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:21,903
-A ramen.

143
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,272
-And one for me.

144
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:24,842
-You're having another?

145
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:25,326
-Two ramen!

146
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:36,168
-So what have you
been doing out here?

147
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:37,906
Having teaching games?

148
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:40,411
Uh-- or is it something else?

149
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:41,981
-Yeah.

150
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:43,317
I'm on my way home.

151
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,919
-Oh.

152
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:46,024
I see.

153
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:47,894
by the way, Mr.
Kurata, do you think

154
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,999
the Go Association would
let me see the game

155
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,438
record of yesterday's
Judan series match?

156
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:53,207
-Why not?

157
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,808
I did.

158
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:54,977
-You did?

159
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,748
-I happened to be
by there yesterday,

160
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:59,386
so I stopped by the
publishing department.

161
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:01,425
They get updates on
the games sent by fax.

162
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,164
-There you go guys.

163
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:06,336
-I read about in the paper.

164
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:09,944
They said Toya-sensei had lost,
but didn't give any details.

165
00:09:09,978 --> 00:09:11,147
So tell me.

166
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:12,784
How did he play?

167
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:15,289
-Hm.

168
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,494
He sure wasn't playing
like he usually does.

169
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:18,898
[gasp]

170
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:21,003
-What do you mean?

171
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:24,410
-You know how his game
is normally so balanced?

172
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:26,047
Aggressive when
he needs to attack

173
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,851
and restrained at
all the right times.

174
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:29,087
Not this time.

175
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:31,426
It was like he decided to play
the game with a completely

176
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:32,195
different tactic.

177
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:43,386
-Are you saying he
didn't play well?

178
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,157
-Are you kidding?

179
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,431
It was fantastic Go.

180
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:50,435
Even though it was the
final game of the series,

181
00:09:50,468 --> 00:09:52,940
he played one interesting
move after another,

182
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,510
with the passion of youth.

183
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,482
I know he lost in the
end, but I was impressed.

184
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,794
He was able to change
his game, and didn't

185
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:04,400
let his experience
get in the way.

186
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,504
Koyo Toya is awesome.

187
00:10:06,537 --> 00:10:08,342
He's still got what it takes.

188
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:10,848
At least I think so.

189
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:13,353
Hey, aren't you
going to eat that?

190
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:14,088
-Yeah.

191
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,160
Keep your hands off.

192
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,097
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): So
he's still playing well.

193
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:19,266
That's a relief.

194
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,004
Maybe he won't retire after all.

195
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,376
-It'll be even more of a
challenge to beat him Now

196
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,578
I can't wait.

197
00:10:24,812 --> 00:10:27,351
I got such a thrill
when I defeated his son.

198
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:28,387
-Wait a minute.

199
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:30,425
You're telling me you've
played Akira Toya?

200
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,962
-Sure.

201
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:34,267
Just last month in the second
round of the Meijin qualifiers.

202
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,503
But look at him now.

203
00:10:35,503 --> 00:10:38,543
Through to the third round
of the Honinbo series.

204
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:40,514
A 2-dan through the third round?

205
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,318
It's unheard of.

206
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:45,592
He's way ahead of anyone
else at his level.

207
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:47,564
Seeing him this
summer, I got a feeling

208
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:51,238
he's going to make a much bigger
impact than I first thought.

209
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,608
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Toya.

210
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:54,546
You've already made that far?

211
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:57,085
It's going to be hard for
me to catch up to you now.

212
00:10:57,119 --> 00:11:00,159
Or even surpass you.

213
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,397
Hm.

214
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,370
-Thank you.

215
00:11:05,404 --> 00:11:06,372
Ah.

216
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:08,878
I really needed that.

217
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:09,513
Well see you later.

218
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:10,281
-Oh.

219
00:11:10,314 --> 00:11:10,883
By then.

220
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:17,030
Hm.

221
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,433
Uh-- Mr. Kurata?

222
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,371
-Hm?

223
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:22,543
-I was wondering what
you're doing right now.

224
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:24,246
You got some free time?

225
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,449
-Why do you want to know?

226
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,921
-I thought maybe you and
me could play a game.

227
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,357
-Don't want to.

228
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:30,359
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Huh?

229
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:34,670
What do I do now?

230
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,907
I bet he's still mad at
me because of the time

231
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:39,313
I told him I didn't
want his autograph.

232
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:41,118
Hm.

233
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:43,055
I know.

234
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:44,558
-Hey, Mr. Kurata, wait up.

235
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:47,332
I want to get your autograph.

236
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,369
The deal is I have to
play you and win first.

237
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:50,404
It'll be like a prize.

238
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,352
I know the chances of me
beating you are pretty slim.

239
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,156
But I'm such a fan of yours.

240
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:00,127
I can't just ask you
for an autograph.

241
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:01,563
It's worth much more
to me than that.

242
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,133
I've got to earn it.

243
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:11,218
-Hm.

244
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:13,356
Well, well.

245
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,662
You want it that bad, huh?

246
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:18,635
Uh-- I'd hate to deprive you.

247
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:21,641
Let's go find ourselves
a Go salon right now.

248
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,678
-That was easy.

249
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:24,548
I can't believe he
actually fell for it.

250
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:25,952
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): All right.

251
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:27,287
Let's see how well I can do.

252
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:29,159
It's going to be a real
test of my strength.

253
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:37,477
-OK, kiddo.

254
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,716
You pay the table
fee for both of us.

255
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:40,317
-What?

256
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:41,086
Oh.

257
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:41,586
OK.

258
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,123
-Good afternoon.

259
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:46,197
[gasp] It's the pro, Kurata.

260
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:47,032
-Kurata?

261
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:48,202
Is it really him?

262
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,337
-Kurata 6-dan?

263
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:50,339
-For sure.

264
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:52,444
I'd recognize him anywhere.

265
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:53,546
-Got a table?

266
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,248
-Of course.

267
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:55,285
Yes.

268
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:58,457
Right this way.

269
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:00,095
-Mr. Kurata, I just
wanted to wish you

270
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,598
all the best for
the Honinbo series.

271
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:03,101
I'll be rooting for you.

272
00:13:03,135 --> 00:13:04,538
-We were just talking
earlier saying

273
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:06,475
how you stand a good
shot of becoming Honinbo,

274
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:09,015
now that Ogata has won
the Judan championship.

275
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,351
-That's very kind of you.

276
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:13,124
-Mr. Kurata, aren't you
going to introduce us?

277
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:14,093
-Who The kid?

278
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,228
His name's Shindo.

279
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,732
He just turned pro recently.

280
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,035
KURATA: We've got a deal.

281
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:20,107
If he beats me he gets
to have my autograph.

282
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,176
MAN: Aw, he's a fan.

283
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,080
How sweet.

284
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,385
-I'd be honored to
have an autograph too.

285
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,290
Let me see if I
can find some cars.

286
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:29,327
-An even match wouldn't
be fair for you,

287
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:31,466
so you play first
with no komi, Shindo.

288
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:32,501
-All right.

289
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,105
-I know how bad you
want my autograph,

290
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:36,477
but that doesn't mean I'm
going to go easy on you.

291
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,713
-That's OK.

292
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:39,784
What a jerk.

293
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:42,491
-You ready?

294
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:43,225
Huh?

295
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:44,728
-They're both white.

296
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:45,563
-Oh.

297
00:13:45,597 --> 00:13:47,200
Here are some black stones.

298
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:48,437
-That's OK.

299
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,472
We can use these.

300
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:51,109
-Hm?

301
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:52,646
-We're playing one color Go.

302
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,250
-I've never heard of it.

303
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:55,820
-Just like a normal
game, except you

304
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:58,426
only play with one
color-- white or black.

305
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,764
You play with what would
be the black stones.

306
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,301
Onegaishimasu.

307
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,404
-Whoa. wait a minute.

308
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:05,175
These white stones are black?

309
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,179
-Are you going to say
onegaishimasu or not?

310
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:08,415
-But I-- onegaishimasu.

311
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:12,424
This is weird.

312
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,696
White is black?

313
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:18,304
-He's obviously never heard
of one color Go before.

314
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,108
Oh well.

315
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:22,413
This is where it starts
to get interesting.

316
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:23,316
Heh.

317
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,721
-Only using white stones.

318
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:27,291
-I don't get it.

319
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,431
-Imagine if all the stones on
our board were the same color.

320
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:33,404
-It'd be a nightmare.

321
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:34,273
-I couldn't do it.

322
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,276
Could you?

323
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,178
-Uh-uh.

324
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:36,712
Not me.

325
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:44,878
-Oh.

326
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,160
-I'm amazed they're
even trying to play

327
00:14:58,193 --> 00:14:59,530
with stones of the same color.

328
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,867
-What color was the kid again?

329
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,936
White or black?

330
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:03,406
-He was black.

331
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:05,844
Now will you guys be quiet or
I'm going to lose track here.

332
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,698
KURATA (VOICEOVER): He's
better than I thought.

333
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,493
-I think I'm
following the game OK.

334
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,863
-Yeah. me too.

335
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,467
-Hm.

336
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,270
-It's not tough to
see what's going on.

337
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:37,448
Imagine the shape of
the game in your mind,

338
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:38,818
then the shape of the stones.

339
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:39,820
-That's how you do it?

340
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,805
KURATA (VOICEOVER):
Now I remember.

341
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:50,545
When I first met this kid at
the amateur Go tournament,

342
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:52,749
he outplayed the pro Gokiso.

343
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:54,821
-Don't know about you,
but I can't see any shapes

344
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,525
when they're all the same color.

345
00:15:56,558 --> 00:15:57,226
-Yeah.

346
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,398
I can't follow it.

347
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:02,237
I was doing until you
managed to distract me.

348
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:02,713
-Yeah.

349
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:03,582
Me too.

350
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:05,052
Now I'm totally confused.

351
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:05,754
-Really?

352
00:16:05,754 --> 00:16:06,889
Already?

353
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:09,261
We've still got a
long way to go yet.

354
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:12,368
Right, Shindo?

355
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:13,470
KURATA (VOICEOVER): Hm.

356
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:16,009
I can see why Gokiso was
no match for this kid.

357
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,785
-You still managing to follow
the game there, Mr. Muranishi?

358
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:20,720
Good for you.

359
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:21,622
I'm completely lost.

360
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:22,390
-Oh no.

361
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:23,560
I haven't got a clue.

362
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:25,597
I'm just trying real hard.

363
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:27,469
I don't know how they do it.

364
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:29,808
-Anyone still
following the board?

365
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:33,917
Well, if you are, it's
time to put a stop to that.

366
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:34,518
There.

367
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:40,665
-Oh.

368
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:41,901
Wow.

369
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,805
There's a pretty fierce
battle going on in the corner.

370
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,375
At least I think it is.

371
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,478
-Yeah.

372
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:48,884
Who knows when you can't
tell white from black.

373
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,389
OLD MAN: It's impossible
to figure this out.

374
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:55,398
Everything looks the same to me.

375
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:56,935
-We've still got a ways to go.

376
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,657
-So, who do you think's winning?

377
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,628
-Don't ask me.

378
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,566
KURATA (VOICEOVER):
Who is ahead right now?

379
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:11,000
Darn.

380
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:11,568
It's Shindo.

381
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:17,447
-Ah-- excuse me, Kurata-sensei.

382
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:19,819
How are things
going in the game?

383
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,660
-The kid's starting to put
up a pretty tough fight.

384
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:24,697
He must want my
autograph real bad.

385
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,036
[laughter]

386
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,773
KURATA (VOICEOVER):
He's doing more than

387
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:30,076
putting up a good fight.

388
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:32,381
He's not showing any
sign of weakness at all.

389
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,529
[gasp] Yes.

390
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:41,869
[gasp] Oh.

391
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:43,138
How could I have misread that?

392
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:48,050
KURATA (VOICEOVER):
Thank goodness.

393
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:50,456
That was a huge
mistake you just made.

394
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,502
What am I saying.

395
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,741
I shouldn't be so surprised
you made a mistake.

396
00:17:58,774 --> 00:18:01,814
It's not like I'm playing Koyo
Toya or Kuwabara or anyone

397
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:02,916
like that.

398
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,821
This is a kid who
only just turned pro.

399
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:12,538
[gasp] Then again, this
is is the first time

400
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,476
Shindo's ever
played one color Go.

401
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:20,723
I can see that Akira Toya
isn't the only one coming up

402
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:25,802
from the lower tanks that
I need to watch out for.

403
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:27,171
There's someone else now.

404
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,960
[gasp] Oh no.

405
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:40,936
I've gone and lost
track of the stones.

406
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:51,593
Around there-- that area--
[groaning] If I attack here,

407
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:53,631
will that be the end of black?

408
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:54,098
Ohhh.

409
00:18:57,974 --> 00:18:58,475
There.

410
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:14,745
-I resign.

411
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,221
Gah.

412
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,058
So stupid.

413
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:19,863
Misreading that move was
what cost me the game.

414
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,702
Things had been going
so well up till then.

415
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:23,739
I thought I had a real chance.

416
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:26,879
Playing a ko here
was a big mistake.

417
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:28,783
And I should have taken
more time over here.

418
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:30,755
It would've been better to
respond on the right-hand side

419
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:31,590
wouldn't it?

420
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:34,196
Right, Mr. Kurata?

421
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:37,303
KURATA (VOICEOVER): This
kid's got what it takes.

422
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:39,275
SAI (VOICEOVER): Someone
else has noticed it.

423
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:43,817
The hidden strength that
Hikaru possesses deep within.

424
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,956
-The autograph cards,
did you find them?

425
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:46,724
-Oh yes.

426
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,261
I've got them right here.

427
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:48,863
-Hm.

428
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,207
For you.

429
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,246
-I thought you were
only going to give him

430
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,718
an autograph if he
managed to beat you.

431
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:00,121
-Just what I've always wanted.

432
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,125
Hold on a minute.

433
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,698
You've only written Kura.

434
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:06,903
-The day you beat
me in a formal game,

435
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:09,008
I'll finish signing it for you.

436
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,710
-Hm.

437
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,192
Sure.

438
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:11,347
OK.

439
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,719
-Kurata-sensei, can you also
sign an autograph for me?

440
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,152
-Me too.

441
00:20:14,186 --> 00:20:15,322
Sign a card for.

442
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:15,956
-All right.

443
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,992
No problem.

444
00:20:16,992 --> 00:20:20,133
Form an orderly line now.

445
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:23,273
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Mr.
Kurata wants to play me again.

446
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,779
-Oh no!

447
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:26,279
-What is it?

448
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,416
What happened?

449
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,420
-It's something on the news.

450
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:31,725
-Turn it up, so we can all hear.

451
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,242
-Sure.

452
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:33,162
Hold on.

453
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:35,234
-At a press conference
earlier today,

454
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,405
Koyo Toya, one of the
world's top Go players

455
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:39,376
and holder of four
championship titles,

456
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,815
announced his retirement.

457
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:44,020
-No way!

458
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:45,757
-He did it.

459
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:46,859
He kept his word.

460
00:20:54,009 --> 00:21:04,065
[theme music]

461
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:23,009
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
It's our fault, Sai.

462
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,381
Toya-sensei retired
because he lost to you.

463
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:27,552
SAI (VOICEOVER): It was a
decision he made on his own.

464
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:29,256
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): What do you
think's going to happen now?

465
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:30,893
He had all those
championship titles.

466
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:32,196
SAI (VOICEOVER):
I'm sure there'll

467
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,900
be plenty of
competition to see who

468
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,281
will become the
next great player.

469
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:37,183
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): The
field's wide open now.

470
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:39,819
And I got my next game
as a pro coming up.

471
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:45,992
Next time-- Koyo Toya retires.

472
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:49,162
SAI (VOICEOVER): You'll need
a win to keep pace with Akira.
