NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:10,455
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:13,294
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:18,170
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

5
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:21,176
[theme music]

6
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:50,292
-Is it it true?

7
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:53,466
I can really play as
much Go as I want?

8
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:54,166
-Yeah!

9
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,137
Let's get started.

10
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,648
S-A-I. Sai!

11
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,431
OK, let's do it!

12
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:26,366
[beep]

13
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:26,848
-Huh?

14
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,311
-Is everything OK?

15
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:33,548
-Uh, someone sent me a message.

16
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:35,518
Can you tell me what
they're trying to say?

17
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:38,256
-Uh, let me have a look.

18
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,428
He's saying that you're
too good a player.

19
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,599
He wants to know
if you're a pro.

20
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:43,935
He seems impressed.

21
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,173
HIKARU: That's because
he's not very good.

22
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:48,344
-Don't you wanna answer him?

23
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,646
HIKARU: Ugh, no way.

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,152
-Then you have to bring
the cursor over to this box

25
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:53,154
and click here.

26
00:02:53,154 --> 00:02:54,256
Why are you looking at me?

27
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:56,260
Watch the screen.

28
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,563
-OK.

29
00:02:57,597 --> 00:03:00,736
-If you don't want to answer,
just close the dialog window.

30
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:01,638
-Thanks for the help.

31
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:03,508
-Not a problem.

32
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:07,516
Let me know if you
get stuck again.

33
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,687
-I think I need some
computer lessons.

34
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:10,790
-I am astounded.

35
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,295
Can you tell me, how
does this-- this box let

36
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:15,734
us play against so many
different opponents?

37
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:17,604
-How should I know?

38
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:18,606
-Oh.

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,775
Hey.

40
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:22,246
Do you think people are inside?

41
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:23,850
-Right.

42
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,220
Time for a new game.

43
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,561
We'll find someone
who's Japanese.

44
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:32,969
Sai, would you quite doing that?

45
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:33,737
Let's see.

46
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:38,580
-The way he responded
seems a bit immature.

47
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:39,716
I bet this person is a kid.

48
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,326
-Look, it's zelda.

49
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,830
I hope you're ready
for another game, Sai.

50
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:47,799
-Oh!

51
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:50,604
This is the happiest
day of my life!

52
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:51,908
I get to play more Go games.

53
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,811
-I don't think I've ever
seen you this happy.

54
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:54,746
-I get to play more Go games.

55
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,216
I get to play more Go games.

56
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,485
-This is just the
beginning, Sai.

57
00:03:57,485 --> 00:03:58,888
We've got the whole summer!

58
00:03:58,922 --> 00:03:59,757
-Wait a minute.

59
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:01,326
This guy's Japanese.

60
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,364
And I think he
might even be a kid.

61
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:05,769
-Is he skilled?

62
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,473
-I don't know.

63
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,775
-Please be cautious.

64
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:11,614
Last time you clicked on the
wrong spot and ended our game.

65
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,284
-I already told you,
I'm still trying

66
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:14,787
to figure out how to
use this computer.

67
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:29,251
BOY: This is weird.

68
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:33,826
Who's this Sai?

69
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:34,661
He's good.

70
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:40,540
HIKARU: Well, what do you think?

71
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,945
Is this guy any good?

72
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,448
-He's strong.

73
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:47,455
Strong as any I've faced.

74
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,959
1, 10.

75
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:52,731
-If you're impressed,
then he must be amazing.

76
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:55,537
[beep]

77
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:56,439
-What?

78
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,777
He just resigned from the game.

79
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,316
-A player with his skill
is able to quickly judge

80
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:02,819
the positions on the board.

81
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:05,424
He must've realize how
strong I was and decided

82
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:08,431
that continuing the
game would be futile.

83
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:10,435
The weaker the player,
the more likely

84
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,443
they'll continue the match even
if their defeat is unavoidable.

85
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:16,313
Remember when you used
to make that mistake?

86
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:18,818
-Aw, be quiet!

87
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,054
Hey, h--- how's it going?

88
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,390
-Pretty good, thanks.

89
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:22,459
Need any help?

90
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:23,829
-Could you send
this guy a message

91
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:24,998
that says, strong, aren't I?

92
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:26,467
-All right, but pay attention.

93
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:29,474
You gotta learn how to type
these messages on your own,

94
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:30,409
you know.

95
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:31,343
There you are.

96
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:32,413
-Thanks a lot.

97
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:32,880
-Have fun.

98
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:39,995
-This whole internet thing
is actually pretty awesome.

99
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,531
You're an excellent player.

100
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:43,535
Who are you, anyway?

101
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:44,437
I'm an Insei.

102
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:50,617
An Insei?

103
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,487
-Hey, Hikaru?

104
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:54,425
Could you finish up
when you get a chance?

105
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,495
My shift's gonna be over soon.

106
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:57,731
-I was just about done, anyway.

107
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:04,879
Looks like this zelda
is trying to turn pro.

108
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:06,883
He must practice all the time.

109
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:21,680
-Please stop your games.

110
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:22,548
It's time for lunch.

111
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,817
We'll meet back here in an hour.

112
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,811
BOY: Something
bugging you, Waya?

113
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,080
-Eh?

114
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:40,151
-You're acting kind
of strange today.

115
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:43,925
Did you make a mistake in
the first half of the match?

116
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:44,860
-You're crazy.

117
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:45,762
I never mess up.

118
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:46,531
Leave me alone.

119
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,511
How come this had to
happen to be right

120
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,048
when I'm taking my pro test?

121
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,499
Look at that guy.

122
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:05,937
He's totally freaking out.

123
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,972
-That's and awful move.

124
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:08,910
WAYA: Everybody's waited
all year for this.

125
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:17,695
And so have I. I've
got to pass this exam.

126
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:23,440
Why does that kid
look so relaxed?

127
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,878
Huh?

128
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,013
You're Akira Toya!

129
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:27,915
-Hm?

130
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,517
Hello.

131
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:33,460
-Isn't he famous?

132
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,832
-Toya Meijin is his dad?

133
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,969
-I can't believe he
has to take the test.

134
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:39,973
-Are you sure it's really him?

135
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:41,577
I thought he'd be taller.

136
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,079
-I hope I don't
have to play him.

137
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:45,150
-You honestly didn't
know he was here?

138
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,019
-Yeah.

139
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,489
-I knew he was taking the test.

140
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:48,858
I found out this morning.

141
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,128
-Seriously?

142
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:52,666
-Yeah, because I'm playing
against him in today's match.

143
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,734
I have no chance.

144
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:54,803
He's already got me beat.

145
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:56,842
-When was the last time
you heard a pro whining

146
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,478
about the strength
of their opponent.

147
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,583
You're never gonna beat
him with that attitude.

148
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:03,087
-You try and win against him.

149
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,761
-Sorry to interrupt,
but are you both Insei?

150
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:07,195
-Yep.

151
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,499
My name's Fuku.

152
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:10,101
This is my first time
taking the pro test.

153
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,907
My buddy Waya has already
failed the exam twice.

154
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,742
Right?

155
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:15,145
-Why'd you tell him that?

156
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:16,181
-What luck!

157
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:18,151
I finally try and
become a pro player

158
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:20,022
and there's no way I
can win my first match.

159
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:21,592
-You're just giving up?

160
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,496
You haven't even
finished the game yet.

161
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:27,270
Pull yourself together and
show Toya's who's boss!

162
00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:30,544
-Is there a reason why
you're acting so crazy today?

163
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,180
Did something happen to you?

164
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:41,934
-I was playing this guy
on the internet yesterday.

165
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:44,305
He was way better than I
was and beat me easily.

166
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,910
With that kind of skill,
he'd have to be a pro, right?

167
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,146
You know what this guy does?

168
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:50,216
He sends an online
message taunting me.

169
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:52,922
It said, strong, aren't I.

170
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:54,259
-That doesn't sound
like something

171
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:56,597
that a real professional
player would right.

172
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,601
-I don't remember
asking for your opinion.

173
00:08:58,634 --> 00:08:59,736
-You're being loud.

174
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:00,538
Everyone's staring.

175
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,800
-(VOICEOVER) I need
to forget about Sai.

176
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:18,708
I'm gonna get my three wins and
get through the preliminaries.

177
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:20,278
But why can't I get
him out of my head?

178
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:24,687
-Hm.

179
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:27,226
So this is Sai.

180
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,163
You were last year's
US Representative.

181
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,967
I'd like to know what
you think of him.

182
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,102
-He's great.

183
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:34,240
I'd love to have the
chance to play him online.

184
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,977
-Now that the word's
out, he's constantly

185
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,247
receiving game requests.

186
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:39,251
You'll have to wait in
line if you want a match.

187
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:40,653
-That's too bad.

188
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:42,257
I suppose I have to
just sit back and watch

189
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,125
like everyone else.

190
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:54,014
-More and more people are
logging on just too watch Sai.

191
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:56,686
His popularity seems to
be growing by the day.

192
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,855
-Teacher.

193
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,292
Do you think this mystery
player could be a pro?

194
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:01,096
-I'm guessing that he isn't.

195
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:03,100
I've never heard of
a professional who

196
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,671
played against
amateurs this often.

197
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:07,743
-How did he get so good?

198
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,878
-Where'd this guy come from?

199
00:10:08,878 --> 00:10:11,617
He never loses.

200
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,757
-He's better than
anyone I've ever faced.

201
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,827
-(VOICEOVER) I've only
had one match against Sai,

202
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:20,235
and he wouldn't chat with me,
regardless of how many messages

203
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:21,337
I sent him.

204
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,808
After asking around, I
discovered that he never

205
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:26,313
chats with anybody
Why does Sai insist

206
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:29,086
on keeping his identity secret?

207
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,958
-I'm leaving for the World
Amateur Championship this week.

208
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:33,427
Once I get to Japan--

209
00:10:33,662 --> 00:10:35,265
-I'm going to track Sai down.

210
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,870
-He's not going to be able to
be able to hide in the shadows

211
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:38,353
forever.

212
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:48,292
[wind chime]

213
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:56,742
-(VOICEOVER) So, what
exactly do I know about Sai?

214
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:58,913
He started playing
in July, and he only

215
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:02,688
goes online in the
middle of the day.

216
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:04,892
He must have a lot
of time on his hands.

217
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,696
I wonder if he's even got a job?

218
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,040
-Because it's
getting warm outside.

219
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,190
-July and August.

220
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:21,827
Summer break.

221
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,133
There isn't any school.

222
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,772
It can't be!

223
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:28,874
He's a kid.

224
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,425
ANNOUNCER: Over the
past decade, I've

225
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,997
had the fortune of watching
our competitors steadily

226
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:58,903
improve as they begin to play
Go at a much higher level.

227
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:01,775
I have never seen such
dedication for this game.

228
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:03,512
It's my pleasure
to welcome players

229
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:06,017
from more than 50 countries
to this year's tournament.

230
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,489
Your participation is
proof of Go's popularity

231
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:09,925
throughout the world.

232
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,795
There will be a total
of eight matches.

233
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:15,036
Two games will take place every
day for the next four days.

234
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,407
Remember to focus,
to try your hardest,

235
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,746
and most importantly,
to have fun.

236
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:22,117
If any of our participants
haven't been assigned a game

237
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,221
yet, please visit our
registration booth

238
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:26,225
in the main lobby as soon
as you get the chance.

239
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:29,031
Good luck to all of you,
and have a great tournament!

240
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:31,035
-(VOICEOVER) Sai's
an amazing player.

241
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:34,208
I've known that since the
first time I saw him online.

242
00:12:34,242 --> 00:12:37,048
I've watched tons of his
matches over the past month,

243
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,452
trying to find any
weakness I've noticed

244
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:41,156
he's been acting differently.

245
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:42,425
Something about him has changed.

246
00:12:56,787 --> 00:12:59,126
Is he trying out
some new strategies?

247
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,930
Can a player like
him get any stronger?

248
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:16,995
-Have a safe trip, Seinsei.

249
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:19,100
I hope you can find
out who Sai really is.

250
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,236
-He's unbelievable.

251
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,206
That guy's beaten every
opponent he's ever faced.

252
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,951
-(VOICEOVER) I'm itching
to find out more about Sai,

253
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:29,020
but that'll have to wait.

254
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:30,422
I'll have plenty
of time to search

255
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:32,427
for him after the competition.

256
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,834
Right now I've got
to stay focused.

257
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:38,506
-(VOICEOVER) I have to bring
the championship back to China.

258
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:40,977
I can't let anything
distract me.

259
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:45,187
The only thing I should be
worrying about is winning.

260
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,124
I'll look for Sai once
the tournament is over.

261
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:49,428
-Will the contestants
please choose for color?

262
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,912
You may now begin your games.

263
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,876
-Morishita-sensei,
I'd like to thank you

264
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,283
for agreeing to serve as
our head judge this year.

265
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:18,888
-Organizing this tournament
must be exhausting.

266
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:21,026
-Once the competition
starts, most of my work

267
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,329
has already been done.

268
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,900
The toughest part of my job is
getting all these participants

269
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,170
into Japan.

270
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:28,642
Arranging visas for this many
players can be quite tricky.

271
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:31,314
Each country has its own
set of rules and regulations

272
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:32,884
for traveling here.

273
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:35,422
We do whatever we can to help,
and usually all our efforts

274
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:36,625
are rewarded.

275
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,663
Go is truly an
international game.

276
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,616
MORISHITA: Waya.

277
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:51,088
-Sensei?

278
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:52,925
-So, is this a student of yours?

279
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:53,592
-Waya?

280
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,528
He sure is.

281
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,631
I asked him to
help us out today.

282
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,006
Hm.

283
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,208
What's with that
look on your face?

284
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:02,311
You OK?

285
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:04,081
A few of these
international competitors

286
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,918
might have some spare
time between matches.

287
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:07,922
I want you to play a
couple of games with them,

288
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:09,325
just to see how
good you really are.

289
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,396
I'm not expecting you
to beat a top amateur,

290
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:13,968
but you should be evenly matched
against some of the lesser

291
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:15,270
players.

292
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:17,108
I know that you
won't let me down.

293
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:19,112
An inexperienced competitor
could learn a lot

294
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:20,381
from my best student.

295
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:21,617
Right?

296
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,959
[laughter] Waya managed to
make it through the pro test

297
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,631
preliminaries with a record
of three wins and one loss.

298
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:30,635
I bet it would have been
four wins if he haven't

299
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:34,109
had to face Toya-sensei's son.

300
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:35,612
-Do you mean Akira Toya?

301
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:38,484
I heard he was taking
the test this year.

302
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:42,225
MORISHITA: You'd better
pass the main exam.

303
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:43,429
-Sensei?

304
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:44,029
-Hm?

305
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:48,104
-Listen.

306
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:56,121
There's this really strong
player you should know about.

307
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:56,603
-Hm?

308
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:01,498
Are you talking about Toya?

309
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:03,670
I know he's good.

310
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,005
-Forget about Toya!

311
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,676
I'm talking about this
new guy I saw on the net.

312
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,546
-Someone on the internet?

313
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:10,283
Did you check to
see if he was a pro?

314
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:13,389
-He's always online, even
on scheduled game days.

315
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:15,126
-Sounds like he's an amateur.

316
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,729
A few of them are
incredibly strong.

317
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:19,401
Japan's top amateur,
Shimano, is playing today.

318
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,239
He can give a pro a
run for his money.

319
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,709
-He's much better than him.

320
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,044
-Huh?

321
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:25,013
Are you serious?

322
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:27,385
How good is he?

323
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:30,090
-(VOICEOVER) You wouldn't have
a chance against him, Sensei.

324
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,529
But I can't tell you that.

325
00:16:32,562 --> 00:16:33,797
How good?

326
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:34,533
Uh--

327
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:36,670
-It's not important.

328
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:40,111
These so-called amateurs are
getting better every day.

329
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:41,079
-Give me five minutes.

330
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:43,083
He's probably online right now.

331
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,620
-We can talk about this later.

332
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,023
Don't you have some work to do?

333
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:52,336
[knocking]

334
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:53,705
WAYA: Is anyone here?

335
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:56,110
-Who are you?

336
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:56,644
-Hello.

337
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:58,381
I'm Waya, an Insei.

338
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:00,719
I've been looking for a
computer with internet access.

339
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,590
Would it be all right
if I used one of yours?

340
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:03,191
-Sure.

341
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:04,060
Go ahead.

342
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,333
That laptop is already online.

343
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:08,168
-Thanks a lot.

344
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:09,070
I won't take long.

345
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,348
-He's not logged in.

346
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:31,832
Argh.

347
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:35,658
I'm all finished.

348
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:36,660
Should I turn it off?

349
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:37,395
-No.

350
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:38,196
Don't worry about it.

351
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,165
I'll do it later.

352
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:39,640
-OK.

353
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,418
-Hm.

354
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,257
I'm resigning.

355
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,294
-Thank you for the
challenging game.

356
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:41,867
-Sai.

357
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:54,786
All right.

358
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,191
I know he's from Japan.

359
00:18:57,224 --> 00:19:00,163
Is Sai a world amateur
representative?

360
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:03,169
I doubt it.

361
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:05,208
This guy isn't half
the player he is.

362
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,888
I bet I'm not the only person
here who's battled Sai online.

363
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:20,471
I wonder if any of
these competitors

364
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:21,975
traveled all the
way to Japan just

365
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,879
to get a glimpse of
the mystery player?

366
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:33,632
How am I gonna find him?

367
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,602
He could be standing
right beside me,

368
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:37,506
and I wouldn't even know it.

369
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:37,956
-Sai.

370
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:48,663
(VOICEOVER) Wh-what?

371
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:51,235
Did he just say what
I thought he said?

372
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:52,437
-Just where have you been?

373
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,441
-Huh?

374
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:56,846
-Now you come with me.

375
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,747
-Uh, sure.

376
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:04,495
-This young man is an
aspiring professional.

377
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:05,898
-Ooh!

378
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:08,679
-I'm really sorry, but I don't
have time for this right now.

379
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:10,114
-What are you talking about?

380
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:11,982
Let him have six stones.

381
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:13,584
WAYA: You've gotta
be kidding me!

382
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:31,068
-(VOICEOVER) He's good,
but not good enough.

383
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:34,104
It's not him.

384
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:34,872
-(VOICEOVER) Sai.

385
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:38,142
-(VOICEOVER) Sai.

386
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:41,845
-(VOICEOVER) I don't get it.

387
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:45,682
Where are you, Sai?

388
00:20:45,716 --> 00:20:49,086
[theme music]

389
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,681
HIKARU: It looks
like Akira's gonna

390
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:27,084
start playing online, too.

391
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:28,986
SAI: He wants to
know my identity.

392
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:31,688
HIKARU: Everybody's trying to
figure out who you are, Sai.

393
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:32,522
Come on.

394
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:34,558
Let's challenge Akira to a game.

395
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:37,894
SAI: By playing him, we
risk revealing ourselves.

396
00:22:37,928 --> 00:22:40,964
HIKARU: Don't tell me
you're gonna avoid him?

397
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:46,637
SAI: I'll play him and
use a new strategy.

398
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,739
HIKARU: Next time, Deja Vu!
