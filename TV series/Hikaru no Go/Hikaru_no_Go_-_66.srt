00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:07,608
[theme music]

2
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,416
-Ahem.

3
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,518
Uh, hello everyone.

4
00:01:58,552 --> 00:01:59,620
Good to see you again.

5
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,422
Just in case you hadn't
against, it's me, Sai.

6
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,459
I have another special bonus
episode of "Hikaru No Go,"

7
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,630
and it's going to be starting
Akira Toya and Hikaru.

8
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,332
This will be a story
about when they first met.

9
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,234
We're going back through
the years to the time

10
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,371
when the two of them we're
still in the sixth grade.

11
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:17,971
Hm.

12
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,076
That's right!

13
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,379
I remember it
well, it was a time

14
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,280
when I could only
watch what Akira

15
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,116
was doing from a distance.

16
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,552
Those memories will be
recreated just for you.

17
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,321
What?

18
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,723
I'm not in it?

19
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:37,324
Oh.

20
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,564
So, now I'll appear
in it, right?

21
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,133
Left out once again.

22
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,668
How could this happen to me?

23
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,412
I should've known.

24
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,021
-Whose bag is this?

25
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,223
Is it Akira's?

26
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:10,991
-Oh!

27
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:11,625
Did I leave that there?

28
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,094
I'll put it away right now.

29
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,663
-I wonder how he managed to
keep it in such good condition.

30
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,032
My grandson's in the
same grade as him,

31
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,268
but his bag's already
falling apart.

32
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,737
-Well, that's Akira for you.

33
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,439
He never spends any
time after school

34
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,974
playing outside like
other kids his age.

35
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:28,575
-I see.

36
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,544
He's always busy with Go.

37
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,479
-That's for sure.

38
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,481
-So, where is he, anyway?

39
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,120
-Shouldn't you have played
a checking extension

40
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,521
to my knight's move there?

41
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,056
Not necessarily.

42
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,991
If my move leads to
a diagonal, black'll

43
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,426
be stronger in the center.

44
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,195
-But if you played
on the edge instead,

45
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,363
then you'd have made these
white stones in the corner

46
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,565
more vulnerable.

47
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,366
-Hm.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,634
You sure about that?

49
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,137
I think a one point jump
towards the center of the board

50
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,473
would have been just
as strong a move.

51
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,240
-You two thirsty?

52
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,243
I brought you some tea.

53
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,580
-Ashiwara-sensei, Are you
available for a teaching game?

54
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,515
-Sure, as soon as
we finish up here.

55
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,519
-So, Akira.

56
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,554
I've heard you'll be in
middle school next year.

57
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,990
Will that mean you'll finally
try to turn professional?

58
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:17,624
-Uh.

59
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,159
-What?

60
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,627
Don't tell me you're thinking
of skipping the pro exam again

61
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,394
this year?

62
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,096
That'd be such a waste.

63
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,433
You're more than
good enough to pass.

64
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,402
Maybe you can convince
him, Ashiwara?

65
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:33,406
I mean, if you can become a pro,
then anyone can do it, right?

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,009
-I suppose you think that's
funny, Miss Ichikawa.

67
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,211
-I don't understand why you
didn't try for it this year.

68
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,679
What are you waiting for?

69
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,415
Most people would jump at
the chance, if they could.

70
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,017
-I don't really know.

71
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,387
I guess I just want to be a bit
better before I take the exam.

72
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,589
-Are you bored with Go?

73
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,257
-No!

74
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,351
I'm not bored!

75
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:51,811
Not at all!

76
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:53,026
-Really?

77
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,261
Are you sure about that?

78
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,428
-What do you mean?

79
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,563
Why would he be bored?

80
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,232
-A player needs someone
to rival their skill

81
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,469
to keep things interesting, and
there isn't anyone Akira's age

82
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,070
that's strong enough.

83
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,440
So, it's gotta be
boring for him.

84
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,543
I have lots of friends
around my age to play with,

85
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,710
so it's still fun for me.

86
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,579
-No one's saying it
isn't difficult for him.

87
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,649
It must be tough knwoing there
aren't any kids who are as good

88
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,150
as he is.

89
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,418
-I don't care about a rival.

90
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,420
As long as I can play.

91
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,089
Anyway, when I get older, people
like Mr. Ogata and my father

92
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,758
are gonna be my rivals.

93
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,627
-What about me, Akira?

94
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,663
-You're not quite good
enough to be my rival.

95
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,497
-Why you!

96
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,404
-Now I get it.

97
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,672
That's why Akira--

98
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,374
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): I don't
know why, but for some reason,

99
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:45,278
I don't really enjoy
playing right now.

100
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,048
Turning pro isn't
going to change that.

101
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,183
Maybe Mr. Ashiwara's right.

102
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,219
I need to have a
rival challenging me.

103
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,129
-Hm.

104
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,346
I'm going to have
to call it a day.

105
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,748
I have to say, I'm quite
impressed, young man-- I mean,

106
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,049
Sensei.

107
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,385
Four stone handicap and
I still can't beat you.

108
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,255
-It was all over when you
played the diagonal here.

109
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,024
What you should have done
was reinforce in the middle.

110
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,293
If you'd done that,
you might have been OK.

111
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,160
-Yes.

112
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,295
I see what you mean.

113
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,130
When you cut me off,
everything fell apart

114
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,999
and I couldn't regain control.

115
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,735
-Some refreshments for you, sir?

116
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,170
-Is that orange juice
you brought for me?

117
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,007
I told you, I don't
drink orange juice.

118
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,707
-Oh.

119
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,743
-Sensei prefers banana juice.

120
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,411
Banana juice.

121
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,178
-Yes, of course.

122
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,013
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,014
I'll bring it right away.

124
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,282
I'll be right back.

125
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,517
-Hmph.

126
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,185
-I'm sorry about that.

127
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,122
My usual assistant
has the day off today.

128
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,024
After only playing a
few games with you,

129
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:07,260
I can see why you won the
children's Meijin tournament.

130
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,229
An impressive achievement.

131
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,430
-Not really.

132
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,431
It doesn't mean a thing.

133
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,532
-Huh?

134
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,000
Of course it means something.

135
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,036
How can you say it doesn't?

136
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,405
Over 2,000 children
entered that tournament.

137
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,540
You're the number one child
in the country right now.

138
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,076
That's got to mean something.

139
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,745
-After the awards ceremony,
I heard this rumor

140
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,347
that's been going around.

141
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,416
-What rumor?

142
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,285
-That one about Akira Toya.

143
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,555
-He's the strongest player
in the school, isn't he?

144
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,390
-If you're talking
about Akira, yeah.

145
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,659
His dad is Toya
Meijin, and he never

146
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,494
enters any amateur competitions.

147
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,496
BOY: I heard he was an
Insei, and was trying out

148
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,297
for the pro exam.

149
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,565
BOY: An Insei? Pfft.

150
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,167
Nah, not him.

151
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,102
BOY: Then how come
he doesn't compete?

152
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,670
BOY: He thinks everyone
else would give up

153
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,340
if he enters because he's
so much better than them.

154
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,007
BOY: What?

155
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,541
Are you serious?

156
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,682
-He's such an annoying creep.

157
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,252
Always bragging about how
strong he is, but never playing.

158
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:10,190
I wonder if he's as
good as he thinks he is.

159
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,593
-You said that this boy's
father is Toya Meijin.

160
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,296
If I remember correctly,
that little Go salon

161
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,365
down by the station
is run by Toya Meijin.

162
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,766
-I never knew that.

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,236
-If it's owned by his father,
it wouldn't surprise me

164
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,438
if Akira hangs out
there from time to time.

165
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,973
-Here you are.

166
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:27,674
-Thank you very much.

167
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,375
That's great.

168
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,447
-Where is it?

169
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:30,176
-Hm?

170
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,978
-The Go salon.

171
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,046
Where is the Go salon?

172
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,687
-Sir.

173
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,490
Who exactly is that boy?

174
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,393
-His father happens to be one of
our most important and valuable

175
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,560
clients.

176
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,430
He knows how much I like
Go, so he sends his son over

177
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,565
to play a game with
me once a week.

178
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,101
It's a way for them to show
off how bright their son is.

179
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,680
[phone ringing]

180
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,987
-Hello?

181
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,122
Oh, hi mom.

182
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,223
Yeah, I know.

183
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,025
Cram school, right?

184
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,396
Hey, don't forget to remind
dad I need my allowance.

185
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,330
Hm.

186
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,167
Yeah, I just
finished playing him.

187
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,425
OK.

188
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,019
-Hi, can I help you?

189
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,359
Uh, you need to sign in.

190
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,640
-Who's that over there?

191
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,408
-What?

192
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,375
The boy sitting down?

193
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,343
That's Akira.

194
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,579
-You mean Akira toya?

195
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,179
-Mm-hm.

196
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,434
Yes.

197
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:14,994
Do you know him?

198
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,055
-So that's him.

199
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,357
How much does it
cost to play here?

200
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,327
-Children are 500 yen.

201
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,961
-Here.

202
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,042
-Ah.

203
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,041
Thank you very much.

204
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,032
You can go right in.

205
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,035
-I've heard Akira Toya's
quite a strong player.

206
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,203
Is that true?

207
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,104
-Hm?

208
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,106
Of course it's true.

209
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,009
Is that really so
hard to believe?

210
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,645
-I guess not.

211
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,247
-Maybe you should
play him, find out

212
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,549
how strong he is for yourself.

213
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,152
-You bet, 'cause that's
what I came here for.

214
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:11,498
-Akira.

215
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:18,972
-A new customer?

216
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:20,240
-Yes.

217
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:21,675
And he says he wants
to give you a game.

218
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,277
Is that OK?

219
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,011
-Sure it's OK.

220
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:25,879
How strong a player are you?

221
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:28,615
-I just won the children's
Meijin tournament.

222
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:29,983
-No way, really?

223
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:30,951
That's awesome!

224
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:32,586
-It's not awesome at all.

225
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:33,620
You didn't enter.

226
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:41,829
I came here because
I wanted to beat you.

227
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,836
Being children's
Meijin champion is OK,

228
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:52,306
but if people are gonna
really recognize my strength,

229
00:11:52,306 --> 00:11:53,440
I have to beat you too.

230
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:55,409
ICHIKAWA (VOICEOVER):
Like that's gonna happen.

231
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:56,977
Poor kid doesn't know
what he's in for.

232
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,013
This is one of the reasons Akira
should hurry up and turn pro!

233
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:01,548
I'll go and get
you both some tea.

234
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:11,325
HIDEKI (VOICEOVER): Look at him.

235
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:13,327
Sitting there all smug.

236
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,963
I'll show him.

237
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:18,565
My name's Hideki Isobe.

238
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:23,570
When I win, I want to hear you
tell everyone you lost to me.

239
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:27,307
I want them to remember my name.

240
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:27,908
-OK.

241
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:29,710
I'd be happy to tell them.

242
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,912
Hideki Isobe, right?

243
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:33,247
Let's get started!

244
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,650
Do you mind if I
choose for color?

245
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:37,451
-Huh?

246
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,318
What's with this guy?

247
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:44,958
This should be an easy win.

248
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:47,427
-You get the first move.

249
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:49,663
-Uh, OK.

250
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:50,864
-Ongegai shimasu.

251
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:51,598
-Onegai shimasu.

252
00:13:02,743 --> 00:13:07,548
There's no way I can
lose to a dork like him.

253
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:08,849
Here we go!

254
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:15,322
Hm?

255
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,601
That look in his eye.

256
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:28,969
Where did that come from?

257
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:10,877
-Ah, there's a better place
you could have played,

258
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:12,012
instead of the knight's move.

259
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:14,314
Let me show you.

260
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:15,582
Make an attachment here.

261
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:16,516
Perfect.

262
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,451
-I see, I see.

263
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:18,819
That's much better.

264
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:23,357
I'm usually too scared to make
contact, so I never do it.

265
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,258
-Huh?

266
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,961
Akira's found a kid to
play against for a change.

267
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:28,895
-Listen to you.

268
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:30,831
You're not even
20 yet, Ashiwara.

269
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:33,834
To someone as old as me,
you're still a kid, too.

270
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:34,434
-What?

271
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,944
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): He's the
children's Meijin champion,

272
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:52,312
but he's not very good.

273
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:09,296
-I can't win.

274
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:10,597
I resign.

275
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,300
-Your game seems to be focused
too much on gaining territory.

276
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,336
Those sort of tactics aren't
going to work against Akira.

277
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:17,571
-Mr. Ashiwara!

278
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:18,905
ASHIWARA: Your
best strategy would

279
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:20,941
have been to play deep
into white's territory,

280
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:23,477
and then hang on for dear life.

281
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,878
But when all's said
and done, you're

282
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:27,547
obviously a strong player.

283
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:29,850
You just weren't strong
enough to beat Akira.

284
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:30,517
-Whever.

285
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,419
I'm going home.

286
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:33,587
-You don't have to go!

287
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:38,391
-Thank you very
much for the game.

288
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:39,960
-Thank you very
much for the game.

289
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:07,020
-That kid-- what was his name?

290
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:08,622
-Huh?

291
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:11,691
Uh, it was-- what was it, now?

292
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:13,860
He did tell me, but I forgot.

293
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,861
-Oh, well.

294
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:17,597
It's OK.

295
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:19,800
You really should think about
turning pro soon, Akira.

296
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:26,373
-Yeah.

297
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:27,007
Maybe you're right.

298
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:36,716
TOYA MEIJIN: Not too long ago
you, would have been careless

299
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,753
and not protected
against the cut here.

300
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:41,588
But this tiger's
mouth you played

301
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:42,889
was an interesting choice.

302
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:46,927
It definitely marked the
turning point of the game.

303
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,297
I have to say, the shape
of those black stones

304
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:52,999
became a lot stronger as
a result of that move.

305
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,668
It was a fine game.

306
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:58,505
It's been a long time since
you've played as well as that.

307
00:17:58,538 --> 00:17:59,100
-Huh?

308
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:04,878
TOYA MEIJIN: It
wouldn't surprise me

309
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,647
if your handicap goes down
from three stones to two

310
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:08,415
before long.

311
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:20,360
Akira, for such a young man,
you show a great deal of promise

312
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:21,494
as a Go player.

313
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:33,940
-Father-- He thinks
I can make it!

314
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:39,980
-Oh, hi there.

315
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,448
Good to see you, Akira.

316
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:44,451
-Well, hello, Miss Ichikawa.

317
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:46,720
Could you look
after this for me?

318
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,687
-Sure.

319
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:48,722
What's up?

320
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:49,990
-Huh?

321
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,591
-That big smile on your face.

322
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:52,959
What happened?

323
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:56,229
-I was playing my father, and
he said some really nice things

324
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:57,430
about my game.

325
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,431
-That's great.

326
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,966
But doesn't he do
that all the time?

327
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,600
-No.

328
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:01,434
Not at all.

329
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:02,535
Hardly ever.

330
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:04,671
-You should hear the
way he talks to us.

331
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:07,741
He's always going on about
how good you are, Akira.

332
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,276
-Are you serious?

333
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:10,644
-Absolutely.

334
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:12,312
He's very proud
of you, you know?

335
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:14,247
So make sure you try your best.

336
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:14,923
-Hm.

337
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:29,296
(VOICEOVER) So my father
thinks I can make it.

338
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:31,598
And Mr. Ashiwara's always
bugging me to go for it

339
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:32,999
and become a pro.

340
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:36,870
I suppose I should have more
confidence in my own strength.

341
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,306
I don't wanna sound
stuck up, but I

342
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:42,909
wanna make it all the way to
the top, just like my father.

343
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:46,246
Anyone who wants to can
join me for the ride!

344
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,614
And I'll get rid
of all my doubts

345
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:49,349
and keep going straight
toward the goal.

346
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:10,236
Straight toward the goal.

347
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,671
On the path of the pros.

348
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:17,277
HIKARU: Hey.

349
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,478
There's a kid over there.

350
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:21,414
-Hm?

351
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:23,416
-Do you think he'll
let me play him?

352
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,285
-I don't know.

353
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:27,287
I know he's your age, but--

354
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:37,664
-Are you looking for
someone to play against?

355
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:38,665
Follow me.

356
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:40,333
By the way, I'm Akira Toya.

357
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,468
What's your name?

358
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:42,469
HIKARU: Hikaru Shindou.

359
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:43,636
I'm in the sixth grade.

360
00:20:54,014 --> 00:20:56,950
[theme music]

361
00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:23,470
HIKARU: Isumi's decided
to stay for more than just

362
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,537
a few days in China.

363
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:25,939
He moves out of his
hotel and starts

364
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:27,440
sharing a room with Yunghai.

365
00:22:27,474 --> 00:22:29,342
But it comes to a challenge.

366
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,711
Isumi has to defeat Lur Ping
or else he has to leave.

367
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:37,016
Back in Tokyo,
everyone's bugging

368
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,284
me to start playing again.

369
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:39,486
I just want to be left alone.

370
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:48,495
Next time, Isumi's Test!
