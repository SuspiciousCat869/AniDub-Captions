NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

3
00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:11,525
a spirit from the past, known as
Fujiwara-no-Sai, has returned.

00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:15,099
Visible only to Hikaru
Shindou, a master of Go,

00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:17,470
Sai seeks to play
the Divine Move.

-I don't know.

8
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,743
What if he cheats
during a tournament?

9
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:56,413
-Huh.

10
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:59,787
-If he can do this kind of stuff
to adults in some Go salon,

11
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,659
what's going to stop him from
doing it to kids his own age?

12
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:05,132
He'd have no trouble
getting away with it.

13
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:07,904
I doubt anyone would even
notice, but I'd know and so

14
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:09,273
would you.

15
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:10,810
Do you think he could
play on a team like that?

16
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:12,413
I don't think I could cheat.

17
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:13,549
It's just not right.

18
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:18,359
-I hope that you've
got some kind of plan.

19
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:19,529
How are we going to stop him?

20
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:21,800
-I'm not quite sure.

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,205
We'll have to figure
that out as it goes.

22
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:26,276
I just hope that we
can get there on time.

-Nope, I'm just going to watch.

door and pull up a seat.

that racket going on outside.

what's wrong with kids today.

Do an old man a favor, will you?

Tell your friend here
that he's supposed

00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:41,568
to show a bit more
respect for his elders.

DAKE: Your buddy isn't
pulling any punches.

He's a real aggressive player.

-I'd like to know what you
think you're doing here.

-I'm just a big Go fan, I guess.

HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Sai, look at the board.

47
00:03:57,969 --> 00:03:59,773
Yuki's winning, isn't he?

48
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,447
Maybe he won't have
to cheat after all.

49
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:05,519
-I know your reason
for coming here,

50
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:07,256
but you're wasting your time.

51
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,525
-You've got it all wrong.

52
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:11,331
--[laugh] What are you
two talking about?

53
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:17,879
-How'd Yuki cheat anyhow?

54
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:19,548
Hikaru mentioned
that it had something

55
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,553
to do with how he
counted up his territory.

56
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:22,822
-I'll show you.

57
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:25,394
At the end of the game, the
player with the most territory

58
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:25,928
wins.

59
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:26,530
-Hm.

60
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:27,031
-OK.

61
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:27,766
Here's an example.

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,537
See this black shape?

63
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,674
Count up the intersections
inside it, OK.

64
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:32,843
-No problem.

65
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:37,954
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

66
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,925
10, 11, 12.

67
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,564
KIMIHIRO: This territory
contains 12 intersections.

68
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:44,301
So it's worth 12 points.

69
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:47,073
At the end of the game, most of
the shapes look like this one.

70
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:49,946
Players rearrange their
stones into neater formations,

71
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,749
so they'll be easier to count.

72
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:53,553
As long as you only
move the stones which

73
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:56,727
are inside your own shapes,
the size of your territory

74
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:59,065
won't increase or decrease.

75
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,970
Then you can multiply
the width by the height

76
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:02,305
and figure out your score.

77
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,307
See?

78
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:05,513
Three times four
equals 12 points.

79
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:06,815
AKARI: Hey.

80
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,318
I think I get it now.

81
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:10,689
So he cheats by increasing
his own territory,

82
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:12,728
while decreasing his
opponents, right?

83
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,665
-That's absolutely right.

84
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:15,667
-Is it really that easy?

85
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,337
Won't someone notice?

86
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:18,473
-Huh.

87
00:05:18,473 --> 00:05:20,343
I know that it's
hard to believe,

88
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:22,715
but it really is that simple.

89
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:26,790
Even with my slow clumsy hands
I doubt anyone would notice.

90
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:28,494
At the end of the
game, both players

91
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,832
are paying so much attention
to rearranging their stones

92
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:34,072
that they hardly ever notice
what their opponent's doing.

93
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:36,110
Players automatically
assume that no one

94
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:37,513
will do anything dishonest.

95
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:42,056
Go is about trust.

96
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:43,926
Cheating on a count
is the worst thing.

97
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,597
It goes against
everything a player is

98
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,069
supposed to stand for.

99
00:05:48,102 --> 00:05:50,608
It's unforgivable.

100
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,910
Cheaters ruin the whole game.

101
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:59,460
-Oh.

102
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,566
Why would Hikaru want someone
like that to join the team?

103
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:10,583
MITANI (VOICEOVER): Why did
this guy want to bet 10,000 yen?

104
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:11,819
He's terrible.

105
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,857
He was probably
just showing off.

106
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,600
Well, his pride is going to wind
up costing him a lot of money.

107
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:23,143
-Young man, you think you've
already won, don't you?

108
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,180
Well, have ever heard
of an old saying that

109
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:28,054
goes, "it ain't
over til it's over"?

110
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,623
How about don't
count your chickens

111
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,693
before they've hatched?

112
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:32,128
You know that one, right?

113
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:34,500
-Yeah.

114
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:35,169
-Ha.

115
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:36,705
Think that's funny.

116
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:40,847
[laughing] You really shouldn't
laugh until after you've won,

117
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,486
and this game is far from over.

118
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,557
-Huh.

119
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,525
-Thanks for the advice.

120
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:50,735
-I know.

121
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:52,003
You're a pretty good listener.

122
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,142
You've got a bright
future ahead of you.

123
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:57,148
It's nice to meet such
a smart young player.

124
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:59,052
Excuse me, son.

125
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,124
Do you see that
ashtray over there.

126
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:01,858
Grab it.

127
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,935
Thanks a lot.

128
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,552
-Are you left-handed?

129
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:15,042
-Huh.

130
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,869
-You're pretty
sharp, you know that?

131
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,706
I'm very impressed.

132
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,009
-What's going on here?

133
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,018
-I suppose that the
fun and games are over.

134
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:33,024
You're about to learn
how grownups play Go.

135
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:37,066
Luckily for you, your tuition is
only going to cost 10,000 yen.

136
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:38,903
Why so quiet, hot shot?

137
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:41,776
You probably think some
clumsy old man can't catch up

138
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:42,911
this late in the game.

139
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:43,813
Well, you're wrong.

140
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:48,891
Play time's officially over.

141
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:51,987
-Sai?

142
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:11,171
MITANI (VOICEOVER): You jerk.

143
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:18,185
-Ha.

144
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:19,054
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
That guy's playing

145
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:20,224
a completely different game now.

146
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:28,241
--[laughing] I'm
catching up, aren't I?

147
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:33,552
[grunt]

148
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:43,038
-That's five points for me.

149
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:58,872
10 points.

150
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:03,615
15 points.

151
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,901
-That man is cheating.

152
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:13,904
-What should we do, Sai?

153
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:19,816
DAKE: If I keep this up, you're
going to lose a lot of money

154
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:20,299
today.

155
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,325
-Huh?

156
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,127
What?

157
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:26,329
A stone's been moved.

158
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:27,900
When did that happen?

159
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30,138
-Is something wrong
with you, son?

160
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:32,744
You look pale.

161
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:35,148
There's quite a bit of
cash riding on this game.

162
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:38,089
You should start paying
attention to what you're doing.

163
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:38,689
-Mitani?

164
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:45,704
-That's a very good move.

165
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:47,174
You don't give up
easily, do you?

166
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:49,713
I didn't expect you
to last this long.

167
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:52,351
[laughing]

168
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,990
[go pieces rattling]

169
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,785
MITANI (VOICEOVER):
This pointless.

170
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:11,726
He's a stronger player than
I am, and he's moving stones.

171
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,931
Oh, I'm going to lose.

172
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:16,335
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

173
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,268
-Game over, son.

174
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:20,471
Have you figured out who won?

175
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:22,007
I'll give you a hint.

176
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:24,948
It ain't going to be you unless
you cheat on the final count.

177
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,158
You're too slow.

178
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,898
Hurry it up.

179
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:34,000
MITANI (VOICEOVER): No way.

180
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,870
He's using my own
trick against me.

181
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:42,017
-Let's see, including the Komi,
I win by 12 and a half points.

182
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,393
That will be 10,000 yen.

183
00:11:46,426 --> 00:11:47,829
Cheer up.

184
00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:49,399
At least, you played
a clean honest game.

185
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:08,039
[sighing]

186
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:08,940
-You played well.

187
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:20,164
-Take it.

188
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,171
DAKE: Let me count that.

189
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:29,417
Five, six, seven,
eight, plus the change.

190
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:30,953
You're still 20 yen short.

191
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:31,521
Cough it up.

192
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:35,162
-Don't worry about it.

193
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:36,164
I'll loan you the money.

194
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:37,233
-Hey, Shu.

195
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,302
Can I borrow 20 yen?

196
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:40,507
I'll pay you back
first thing tomorrow.

197
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:41,409
-Please take it.

198
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:47,388
-Thanks a lot.

199
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:48,390
-Hey, kiddo.

200
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:50,261
Think you'll stop cheating now?

201
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:52,967
When you rip off
customers, they call me.

202
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:53,408
-Dake.

203
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,864
-I think I'd like to borrow
that 20 yen after all.

204
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:15,581
-Thank you.

205
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:17,151
-Wait a sec.

206
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,994
-What's your rush?

207
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:23,398
-Yuki.

208
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:24,934
-Get away from me.

209
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:25,535
-Watch it.

210
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:26,872
-What?

211
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,578
Are they running a daycare
down here or something?

212
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,013
-Where are you?

213
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:40,567
-Relax, Hikaru.

214
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,438
This is likely the best thing
that could have happened.

215
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:45,143
It's good medicine.

216
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:47,582
A cheater must feel the
pain of their own sting

217
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:50,221
before they can fully
realize the agony

218
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:52,960
that they inflict on others.

219
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:54,664
However--

220
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:55,633
-Sai, it was a trap.

221
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,601
Yuki was set up.

222
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,070
When his game
started, that old guy

223
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,674
pretended that he
barely knew how to play.

224
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,211
Remember?

225
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:02,413
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: I do.

226
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:06,455
Deceiving a child is a
cruel and a despicable act.

227
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:07,691
-Mitani learned his lesson.

228
00:14:07,924 --> 00:14:10,297
And I know that's
important, but I

229
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,467
don't think it should
cost him 10,000 yen.

230
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:15,073
We should win that
money back for him.

231
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:17,478
Come on.

232
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:20,619
-I cannot sit idly by and allow
this sort of thing to happen.

233
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,690
We must teach this man a lesson.

234
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:24,092
He will not go unpunished.

235
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:27,666
-Hey, what do you think?

236
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,403
Who would you say is
the greatest Go player

237
00:14:29,437 --> 00:14:30,673
in the world, living or dead?

238
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:31,642
-Hm.

239
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:33,078
Toya Meijin.

240
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:34,581
There's a couple of
younger players who

241
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:39,057
are pretty good like Kurata
4-dan or Ogata 9-dan.

242
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,363
GO PLAYER : I just read an
article where a reporter asked

243
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:43,467
a pro player that same question.

244
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,535
-Oh really.

245
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:46,239
GO PLAYER : You know
what the pro said?

246
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:49,145
Honinbo Shusaku
from the Edo period.

247
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:50,047
Can you believe that?

248
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,686
I nearly fell off my chair.

249
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:53,521
-Huh.

250
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:55,358
Go was much simpler back then.

251
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:58,164
They wouldn't stand a
chance playing today's game.

252
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,503
-Tomorrow, we'll give Yuki
back all of his money.

253
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:03,242
Then, I'll ask him to
join the Go club again.

254
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,279
Sai, are you sure
you can beat him?

255
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:07,518
He seemed like he was
a pretty strong player.

256
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:09,255
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: I
saw his skill level.

257
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,092
He will lose.

258
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,695
-What if he tries to
move a stone again?

259
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:14,499
-I'll notice it immediately.

260
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:16,737
Then you can tell him that
you witnessed his deception

261
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,009
and challenge him to beat
you without resorting

262
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:20,779
to such dishonesty.

263
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:23,284
HIKARU: What if he
lies about his score?

264
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:25,422
-He won't get a chance
to count his territory.

265
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:26,591
I will force him to resign.

266
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:34,408
-That boy wasn't
always so mischievous.

267
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:37,147
He only began cheating recently.

268
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,418
Nobody seemed to
mind losing to him.

269
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:42,023
It was like giving money
to your own grandson,

270
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:44,229
but I couldn't allow
him to continue.

271
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:45,731
That's why I called you in.

272
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:49,072
It was too late to tell Yuki
that I knew what he was up to.

273
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:51,811
I figured it would have
upset him too much.

274
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:55,452
I guess I wound up upsetting
him any how, didn't I?

275
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:56,655
-You did what you had to do.

276
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:59,661
So did I. There's no
point in feeling guilty.

277
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:03,602
[laughing] My usual fee
is 20,000 plus the 10,000

278
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:04,672
that I gave you earlier.

279
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:09,315
For a grand total of
30,000 yen, my friend.

280
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:12,121
-I doubt that Yuki will ever
want to set foot in this place

281
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:12,655
again.

282
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,158
It's really too bad.

283
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:18,234
I'm going to miss
having that kid around.

284
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,336
-Huh.

285
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:21,273
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

286
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:22,777
Now, I think I'll
hang out here and see

287
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,081
if another sucker comes in.

288
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:26,184
-Your work here is done.

289
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:27,553
Why don't you head on
home and leave me alone?

290
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,324
I think I've had
enough for today.

291
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:30,259
-That's cold.

292
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:34,100
I came down here
to do you a favor.

293
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,737
-Hey, mister.

294
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,207
I'm a friend of Yuki's.

295
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,242
I want a game.

296
00:16:38,276 --> 00:16:39,311
[laugh]

297
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,382
-If beat you, I want
the 10,000 yen back

298
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,354
you took from my friend.

299
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:44,623
-No problem.

300
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,760
But if I win, you're going
to have to pay me 10,000 yen.

301
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:49,199
So do we have a deal or what?

302
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:50,469
-You will not lose.

303
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:52,706
-If you won't agree to
my terms, the bet is off.

304
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,443
Gambling is always a risk, son.

305
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:55,479
Don't you forget it.

306
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:56,649
SHU: That's enough, Dake.

307
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,316
Listen, kid.

308
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,418
Just go home.

309
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,256
You're too young to make
that kind of a wager.

310
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:01,725
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI:
Don't listen to them.

311
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,799
I will defeat this man.

312
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,471
Hikaru.

313
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:08,440
HIKARU: Fine.

314
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:10,678
If I lose, I'll
pay you 10,000 yen.

315
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:11,746
DAKE: Now we're talking.

316
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,851
Grab a chair, and let's
get down to business.

317
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:14,753
SHU: Stop this.

318
00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:20,532
-Let's set a handicap.

319
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:21,634
All right.

320
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:22,737
-Don't bother.

321
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,141
I'm not going to need one.

322
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:26,478
-Are you sure about that?

323
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:27,447
-Young fool.

324
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,549
He's nuts.

325
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,419
Kids these days have
lost their minds.

326
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:31,221
M

327
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:32,457
-Aren't you confident?

328
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,595
Now, you already know that
I'm a pretty strong player.

329
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:37,234
Maybe you wouldn't mind telling
me just how good you are.

330
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,570
-I'm not quite sure.

331
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:43,447
Uh, well, I'm probably about
as good as Honinbo Shusaku.

332
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:46,587
--[laughing] You're
a really funny guy.

333
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,190
Keep those jokes coming.

334
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,662
Shusaku, that's priceless.

335
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,335
-The only person who'd have
any hope of beating Shusaku

336
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:54,670
would be Toya Meijin.

337
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:57,176
That'd be a great
match to watch.

338
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,579
-Pass me those blacks stones.

339
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:05,193
I'll play using my left
hand out of respect

340
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:06,195
for the great Shusaku.

341
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:06,930
Shall we begin, Honinbo?

342
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:12,308
-3-4 in the upper left.

343
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:17,753
17-5.

344
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,642
6-17.

345
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:42,906
COMMENTATOR (ON TV): The
catcher signals the pitcher.

346
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,910
The batter glances
toward the dugout.

347
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:47,515
We're still waiting
for that next pitch.

348
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:52,526
-Hm.

349
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:18,882
COMMENTATOR (ON
TV): Strike three.

350
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:21,387
COMMENTATOR 2 (ON TV):
Hey, after those first two

351
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:24,427
fast balls, there was no way
he could have hit that pitch.

352
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:25,830
COMMENTATOR (ON
TV): Foul ball's up.

353
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,801
It's heading for the outfield.

354
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,604
That's going to be an easy out.

355
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,275
These hitters are
having a tough day.

356
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,579
So far it's shaping up
to be a pretty slow game.

357
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:34,047
-Hm?

358
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:34,713
[chair scraping]

359
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:35,154
-Hm.

360
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,694
[sigh] That didn't take long.

361
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:43,433
Do me a favor, and don't play
any more kids in here, OK?

362
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,453
He's a child.

363
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:55,793
I don't understand how you
can take his money like that.

364
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:58,599
I suppose that he
brought this on himself.

365
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:01,973
He must have been out of
his mind to challenge you.

366
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:04,412
Listen, you can finish
your tea, but after that, I

367
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:05,714
want you to leave.

368
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:09,455
Now, let me have a look to see
how well the boy managed to do.

369
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:12,462
[groaning]

370
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:16,805
-What's with you?

371
00:20:16,838 --> 00:20:20,078
[groaning]

372
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:21,013
-Hm.

373
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,750
What happened?

374
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:29,932
DAKE: He was as good
as-- as Honinbo Shusaku.

375
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:36,813
COMMENTATOR (ON
TV): There it goes.

376
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:39,352
Oh, and it's a grand slam.

377
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:41,656
What an absolutely
incredible hit.

378
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,026
Nobody could have
seen that coming.

379
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,997
-Once I give Yuki
his money, he'll

380
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,133
be sure to join the Go club.

381
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,636
We'll finally have
three members.

382
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:49,673
Then we'll be able to compete
in the upcoming tournament.

383
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,479
We did it, Sai!

384
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:54,334
[theme music]

385
00:22:22,002 --> 00:22:24,507
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: The tournament
is only a short time away.

386
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,244
Your training is
progressing well.

387
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:28,100
HIKARU: I just hope our
team sticks together.

388
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,769
We've got to win this year.

389
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:33,005
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: Akira
will be a strong opponent.

390
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,108
Every day his knowledge
of the game increases.

391
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:37,710
HIKARU: All he cares
about is having

392
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:41,146
another rematch against me.

393
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,016
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: Next
time, no cheating allowed.

394
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:47,386
HIKARU: All I care
about is beating Kaio.
