[theme music]

2
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:49,723
-I resign.

3
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:50,658
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Huh?

4
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:53,464
But--

5
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:55,233
SAI (VOICEOVER): It
was a great match.

6
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:59,309
Hikaru has proven he's
the better player.

7
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:00,811
-Sai.

8
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:03,584
That was the name of the
player on the internet.

9
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:04,786
He was awesome.

10
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:05,688
-Mm-hm.

11
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:07,525
Yeah, I remember.

12
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:09,529
-Well, today you did it.

13
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,666
You played as well as sai.

14
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,769
-Shindou's no threat to me.

15
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:15,241
-Underestimate him
and you'll lose!

16
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:16,209
-And what if I win?

17
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:17,779
What if I actually beat Shindou?

18
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:20,417
Maybe then you'll start to
treat me like a serious rival.

19
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:27,165
HIKARU: Ochi.

20
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:27,766
-Hey Shindou.

21
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,672
You really to lose today?

22
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:34,380
I've been playing Akira
Toya almost every night,

23
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:36,249
just so I can beat you today.

24
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:48,374
-Toya?

25
00:02:57,326 --> 00:02:58,461
You've been playing him?

26
00:02:58,494 --> 00:02:59,163
-That's right.

27
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:00,565
Almost every day.

28
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,802
-How come?

29
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:03,171
-Because he wanted to.

30
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:06,210
He spent more time helping
me than he planned to.

31
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:07,580
-I don't get it.

32
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:14,895
Why would he help you
practice for the pro exam?

33
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,667
-Let go of me!

34
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,871
I wanted some
coaching from a pro.

35
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:21,808
You got a problem with that?

36
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:24,247
-But a minute ago, you told
me you played against Toya

37
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,850
just so you could beat me.

38
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,687
-Yeah, and your point is?

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,457
-Why did it have to be Toya?

40
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:31,261
You're not telling
me everything.

41
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,232
-I don't know what
you're talking about.

42
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:35,369
But I've been studying with
Toya to improve my game.

43
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:40,028
-Ochi!

44
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:44,522
-Hm?

45
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:52,271
-Did Toya-- Did he-- When he
played, did he say anything?

46
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:56,212
What I mean is, did he
say anything about me?

47
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:01,322
-And right here is
where I resigned.

48
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:02,658
-You what?

49
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:03,526
I don't believe it.

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,630
And this was two years ago?

51
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,368
-I was defeated.

52
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:10,875
Never underestimate Shindou!

53
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:12,544
-Well?

54
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:14,281
-Of course he didn't
talk about you.

55
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:15,918
Why would he?

56
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:19,325
Don't flatter yourself!

57
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,995
Sure we talked
about the pro exam,

58
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,732
but in all the weeks
we played together,

59
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,536
he never mentioned you once.

60
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:27,909
I doubt he even knows you exist.

61
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:29,780
SAI (VOICEOVER): Hikaru.

62
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:33,354
OCHIL Have you got any idea
how good a player he is?

63
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:34,656
-Huh?

64
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:37,829
-He hasn't lost once since
he turned professional.

65
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,866
Undefeated since April.

66
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,938
He's better than
anyone else around.

67
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:46,815
I mean, think about it.

68
00:04:46,815 --> 00:04:49,887
Why would he even give
you the time of day?

69
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:50,956
-I know he's good.

70
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:52,860
It's not like I don't
take him seriously.

71
00:04:56,835 --> 00:05:01,276
-Of course, Toya thinks my
skills are very advanced.

72
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:04,584
Our match today is gonna be the
most important one of the exam,

73
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:06,888
and even Toya's
interested in it.

74
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:08,725
-What did he say about it?

75
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:13,301
-Well, you he me, If I beat
you, then I'll become his rival.

76
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:15,305
-Oh really?

77
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:17,676
-Yeah.

78
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,884
-If you beat me?

79
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:24,490
What do you think
he meant by that?

80
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:29,868
-Uh, what he meant was, i-- if
I won all my remaining matches,

81
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:32,106
then he'd allow me
to be his rival.

82
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,412
It's got nothing to do with you.

83
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:36,347
That's what he meant.

84
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:45,867
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I don't know
if I can believe him or not.

85
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,006
What if Toya's using
him to get to me.

86
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:51,745
-The point is, if
I beat you today,

87
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:53,783
Toya's gonna
recognize my strength

88
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:55,119
and see me as his rival!

89
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:58,426
-In that case, if I beat you,
Toya's gonna see my strength,

90
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,432
and I'll be his rival!

91
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:02,500
You'll see.

92
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:02,984
Both of you!

93
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,989
-Hmph!

94
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:13,590
-Ochi!

95
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:17,665
-Huh?

96
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:18,147
Ochi?

97
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,046
What do you think's up with him?

98
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:27,084
-I thought I heard
Shindou's voice.

99
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:30,124
Sounded like they were
arguing about something.

100
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:30,992
-It's all right.

101
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:32,395
Just a little pre-match battle.

102
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,077
-Are you sure he's
going to be OK?

103
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,781
-He's just psyching himself up.

104
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:43,150
Weird because
there's no pressure.

105
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:44,753
He's already passed.

106
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:46,423
But that's Ochi for you.

107
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:51,734
-You know what?

108
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:54,072
I have a feeling
Ochi's gonna win today.

109
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:56,577
Shindou will never pull it off.

110
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,082
Think him and Waya will
end up in a playoff?

111
00:06:59,115 --> 00:06:59,683
-Hm?

112
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,562
WAYA: Talking about me
behind my back, are we?

113
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:08,534
-Oh, hi Waya.

114
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:10,138
-Hey there.

115
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:11,507
-So, one match to go.

116
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,044
How you feeling?

117
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:14,079
-I'm feeling fine.

118
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:15,148
Why would I?

119
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,754
-Your final opponent
is your nemesis, Fuku.

120
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,423
If you lose, you're
gonna have to face

121
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:21,728
Isumi in a tough playoff.

122
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:22,730
-Aw, come on!

123
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:24,567
You think I don't
already know that?

124
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,772
-You realize if Isumi
happens to lose today,

125
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:28,442
you and Shindou
would automatically

126
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:30,980
pass the test without
needing a playoff?

127
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:34,621
Then again, when you look at who
he's playing, that's a big if.

128
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,689
-Yeah.

129
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:38,862
Isumi's gonna win
this game no problem.

130
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:40,800
He'll be waiting to see
how the rest of us do.

131
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:53,793
-OK.

132
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,496
That's enough talk
about everyone else.

133
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:58,135
I gotta focus on
my own game now.

134
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:02,009
My whole future's at stake here.

135
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,482
-And what future is that?

136
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:06,017
-What?

137
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:08,556
-Well, you said that your
whole future's at stake.

138
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:15,904
But what do you think's gonna
happen to us in the future?

139
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:21,048
What will happen to all of us?

140
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:41,055
-The time has finally come.

141
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:43,192
-Yeah!

142
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:45,230
And I'm gonna win.

143
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:55,199
Hm?

144
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:01,663
Hm.

145
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,232
I can Sam's Toya's behind Ochi.

146
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:21,604
Toya is using him to
see how well I do.

147
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:22,606
I just know it.

148
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:30,087
I'm almost there.

149
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:32,058
You hear that, Toya?

150
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:34,797
I've almost made it
up to your level.

151
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,234
OCHI (VOICEOVER):
Shindou has no idea

152
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:38,805
how strong a player Toya is.

153
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:40,242
If he did, there's
no way he'd dare

154
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:42,212
suggest that they
could be rivals.

155
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,851
The more I played
against Toya, the more

156
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,991
I could feel his
power, his strength!

157
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:50,328
We played each other every
day with one goal in mind.

158
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:55,338
To beat Shindou in
this match today!

159
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:58,813
I won't lose those game.

160
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:01,785
Not with Toya behind me.

161
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:04,691
Who have you got
behind you, Shindou?

162
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:12,607
-Hm.

163
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:27,003
ANNOUNCER (VOICEOVER): The
final day of the pro exam.

164
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:30,042
Three months and 27
matches have gone by.

165
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:33,784
You've all put up a good fight.

166
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:36,723
One of you has already made
it through to being a pro.

167
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:38,727
For others, this game
will be a deciding factor.

168
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:48,413
And for some of you, a future as
a pro is looking less certain.

169
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,782
But you must keep going.

170
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:01,005
To all of you, I
want to say continue

171
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,780
playing with passion and
pride until the very end.

172
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:07,051
And then you'll know
these last three

173
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,220
months have been worthwhile.

174
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:13,764
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is time.

175
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:18,274
When you're ready, please begin.

176
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,971
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai first
appeared to me two years ago.

177
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:04,367
In the same way that
you've been pursuing Sai,

178
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,408
I've been pursuing you.

179
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,412
-Stop messing around!

180
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:11,047
-What?

181
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:11,983
What's wrong?

182
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:19,732
(VOICEOVER) I'll never forget
that look on your face.

183
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,034
-Hey, wait up!

184
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,203
Akira!

185
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:24,942
If you keep on chasing
your phantom image of me,

186
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:27,046
one day I'm going
to catch up to you.

187
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:34,127
-Is that so?

188
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,997
Why wait until then?

189
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,367
Why don't we play
a game right now?

190
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,850
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Toya!

191
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:49,358
Toya, if I win this
match today, then I'll

192
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:54,001
finally be a pro--
just like you!

193
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,437
Are you ready for me?

194
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,062
SAI (VOICEOVER):
The strategy Ochi's

195
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,331
using is quite interesting.

196
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,341
Although the match is
still in its early stages,

197
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:35,050
it's obvious that he is
a very skillful player.

198
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:40,495
But I can see a glimpse of
Toya's influence in his moves.

199
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:43,100
That influence is an
obstacle that certainly

200
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,870
won't make things any
easier for Hikaru.

201
00:13:58,131 --> 00:13:59,366
I see.

202
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,105
He's confident he can hold
onto the top side of the board.

203
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:04,109
If he neglects to
strengthen that area,

204
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,347
there'll be an opportunity
to infiltrate his position.

205
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:12,092
A peep is the only move to make.

206
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:33,068
Their positions are
about equal right now.

207
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:35,606
Ochi may be the stronger
player, but Hikaru

208
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,410
seems to be rising
to the occasion.

209
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:43,055
Hikaru.

210
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:44,024
What are you doing?

211
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:45,126
OCHI (VOICEOVER): Ha.

212
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,896
I think you've
underestimated me, Shindou.

213
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:52,656
-Huh?

214
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,216
-Looks like it's about to
start pouring out there, hm?

215
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:14,185
-Yeah.

216
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:16,689
And it was so
sunny this morning.

217
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:17,926
Now, let's see.

218
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,932
This one's yours,
Sensei, and here's mine.

219
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:22,134
Grab these for me, would you?

220
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,002
-Yes.

221
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:23,603
Of course.

222
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,107
-Thanks.

223
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,478
It'd be nice of the rain held
off 'til everyone made it home.

224
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,480
-Isn't always the way?

225
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,016
The one day I
forget my umbrella,

226
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,219
we get a torrential storm.

227
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:37,064
-Time for lunch.

228
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:38,334
Please stop your clocks.

229
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,320
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): If I
can keep playing like this,

230
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:49,156
I'm going to win.

231
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:56,703
-Hikaru, make sure you
eat a proper lunch.

232
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:57,305
-Yeah.

233
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:57,787
I know.

234
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:06,290
Huh?

235
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:06,773
-Huh?

236
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:35,182
OCHI (VOICEOVER): He's
taking a long time to think.

237
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:37,152
It's not like him at all.

238
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:40,526
I've got him on the run.

239
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,499
All that training Toya
gave me wasn't for nothing.

240
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:53,419
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Why
did I make that move there?

241
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,396
Now Ochi's got
control of the game.

242
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:00,032
How am I going to
come back from this?

243
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,163
Come on.

244
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,167
It can't end this way!

245
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,580
OCHI (VOICEOVER): Feeling
the pressure, Shindou?

246
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:25,684
You thought that move would
work as a counterattack,

247
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:27,488
but you've just left
yourself wide open.

248
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,734
No!

249
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,204
That's not right.

250
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:37,208
This isn't a simple
counterattack.

251
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:39,479
There's some hidden
strategy behind it.

252
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:34,389
You can't fool me that easily.

253
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:37,645
-Huh?

254
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,740
HIKARU (VOICEOVER)
He played a peep?

255
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:45,646
Oh, that was the last
thing I was expecting.

256
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,517
SAI (VOICEOVER): An
interesting move.

257
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,854
This is obviously the result
of this training with Toya.

258
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:55,366
Now Hikaru has to go
back to the drawing board

259
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,472
and rethink his entire strategy.

260
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,676
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): Black
was played by a Korean Insei

261
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:03,682
by the name of Su-yeong
Hung, and Hikaru Shindou

262
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:05,553
played white.

263
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:06,789
OCHI (VOICEOVER): Hold on.

264
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:09,160
You said Shindou
was playing white?

265
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,498
I thought he made a mistake
earlier on in the game,

266
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:15,507
but he was really anticipating
the battle over here.

267
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,210
If this match shows
the kind of level

268
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,815
Shindou's playing at right
now, then three weeks

269
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:20,951
won't be enough!

270
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:23,356
it won't be enough time!

271
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:26,562
-Never underestimate Shindou!

272
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:29,501
OCHI (VOICEOVER): I
would never do that.

273
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,341
If he plans 100 moves
ahead, I'll plan 101.

274
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:36,816
If he plans 1,000,
I'll plan 1,001.

275
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,854
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He
ruined my whole strategy!

276
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:41,359
If I'm not careful, I'll be
in an even worse position

277
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:42,527
than before.

278
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:44,365
This could be the end for me.

279
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:51,480
I've gotta make a good move.

280
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,352
I've gotta stop him from
gaining anymore ground!

281
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:55,253
OK.

282
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:56,255
Calm down.

283
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:57,224
Calm down!

284
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:03,971
I still have a chance to turn
this game around and gain

285
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,443
control.

286
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:09,616
I can't let it slip
out of my hands.

287
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:10,685
I'm gonna make this work.

288
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:11,620
No more weakness.

289
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,588
No more mistakes.

290
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:25,849
-Still hanging in
there, Shindou?

291
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:27,753
So you've decided
not to give up.

292
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:30,625
But I took too long
before making my move.

293
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:33,465
Did I give him time to
get his confidence back?

294
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,800
No.

295
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,877
Well, if that's the case, here's
an attack that will crush you!

296
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:46,791
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Take that!

297
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:55,877
[theme music]

298
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:23,621
HIKARU: Only two matches
are still going on.

299
00:22:23,654 --> 00:22:26,860
Me against Ochi and
Waya against Fuku.

300
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,364
SAI: And if you
don't win, you'll

301
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:29,900
be facing Asumi in a playoff.

302
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,676
HIKARU: But if I
win, I'll finally

303
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,480
make it to the level of pro.

304
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,720
SAI: To defeat
Ochi, you will need

305
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,791
to find a way to outsmart Akira.

306
00:22:42,824 --> 00:22:47,329
HIKARU: Next time, The
Final Day of the Pro Exam.

307
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:50,232
SAI: Who is it going to be?
