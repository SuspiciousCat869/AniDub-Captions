NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,518 --> 00:00:10,525
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:13,633
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:18,210
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

5
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:21,585
[theme music]

6
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:51,364
-One more thing.

7
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:53,770
Toya's already
passed the pro exam.

8
00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:55,641
-A pro?

9
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:57,411
Nah, he's way too young.

10
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:00,285
An eighth grader
can't become a pro.

11
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:03,760
-A lot of top players were only
teenagers when they turned pro.

12
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:06,199
He officially becomes
a pro next spring,

13
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:08,705
and he's sure to advance
faster than anyone else.

14
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:11,178
If you wait until then,
it'll be too late.

15
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:13,183
If you don't put your
all into it right now,

16
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:15,288
you'll never catch up to him.

17
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:16,256
-Wait a sec.

18
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,693
-Hm?

19
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:21,736
-What do I have to do
to take the pro exam?

20
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,577
-So, you want to take
the December Insei test?

21
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,584
You don't mean the exam we're
having this Sunday, do you?

22
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:29,555
We're no longer
accepting applications.

23
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:30,324
Sorry.

24
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,392
-You gotta be joking!

25
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:33,932
I wanna take that test
as soon as possible.

26
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:34,868
-Insei?

27
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:36,238
-You're kidding, right?

28
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:40,915
You wanna be an
Insei, that's fine,

29
00:02:40,948 --> 00:02:43,922
but you won't be allowed to
compete in amateur tournaments.

30
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,523
-What?

31
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,344
-Are you gonna quit the Go club?

32
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:53,846
-Uh.

33
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,814
-Hikaru, tell us!

34
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,986
Are you quitting
the Go club or not?

35
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:57,721
-Uh.

36
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:58,791
Uh, don't get upset.

37
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:00,628
I never meant to
leave the Go club.

38
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:02,265
-Have you thought this through?

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,638
You won't be able to play
in any amateur tournaments

40
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:06,275
if you become an Insei.

41
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:07,645
-An Insei?

42
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:10,719
-Akari, what's an Insei?

43
00:03:10,752 --> 00:03:12,657
-There's no way
Hikaru's quitting.

44
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:15,631
I mean, you were so exciting
about playing in the tournament

45
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:16,113
just now.

46
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,710
-I'm sorry.

47
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:24,318
I just-- You see, Akira,
he-- he's gonna be--

48
00:03:24,352 --> 00:03:25,554
-What's gotten into you anyway?

49
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:27,392
You asked me to
be in the Go club

50
00:03:27,392 --> 00:03:30,666
so we'd be able to enter
the team tournaments.

51
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,371
And now you're
backing out on me?

52
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:33,874
You've got a lot of nerve.

53
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:35,611
-That's enough!

54
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:38,551
-Hey, Kimihiro.

55
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,723
Sorry to crash your
little party like this.

56
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:43,831
I need to hide out
here for a bit.

57
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:44,700
-Are you in trouble?

58
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:45,301
-Sh.

59
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:49,411
-Huh?

60
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:50,347
-Tsutsui!

61
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,852
Where's Kaga?

62
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:53,587
-Kaga?

63
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,589
I haven't seen him.

64
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,640
-That kid is in so much
trouble it's not even funny.

65
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:03,978
Just wait until I
get my hands on him.

66
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:04,981
-Hey guys.

67
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:06,317
Is he gone?

68
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:07,720
-Yeah.

69
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:09,725
-Thanks for the help, guys.

70
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:10,694
-You jerk!

71
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:11,864
What have you done this time?

72
00:04:11,864 --> 00:04:13,367
-Don't get all worked up.

73
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:14,002
-Who is this?

74
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:16,007
Does he go to our school?

75
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,377
-Testuo's a ninth grader.

76
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,881
He's captain of the Shogi club.

77
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:22,389
-He's also the greatest Go
player at Hazo middle school.

78
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:24,761
-You're in the Shogi club,
but you're good at Go?

79
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:26,098
-Sounds iffy to me.

80
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,033
-What?

81
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,504
I'm gonna teach
that guy a lesson.

82
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:29,572
-Calm down!

83
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:30,642
-Bet you think you're
pretty tough, huh?

84
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:36,556
Looks like you managed to find
yourself some more players.

85
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:39,028
Ha ha ha ha!

86
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:42,370
You used to be the only
player in this club, remember?

87
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,606
-Listen.

88
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,943
HIkaru just told
us that he's going

89
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:48,652
to be taking the Insei exam.

90
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:50,489
-Mm.

91
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:51,825
Well, I'm impressed.

92
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,966
The Insei test is tough,
but you gotta go for it.

93
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:58,675
But you look like you're
depressed or something.

94
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,083
-I forgot that once
I become an Insei,

95
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:04,790
I won't be able to
play in tournaments.

96
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,026
-That's what's bugging you?

97
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,697
Who cares about tournaments?

98
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,100
-Who cares about tournaments?

99
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,604
Just what do you mean by that?

100
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:13,711
-No one's talking to you, punk.

101
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:15,816
You got a lot of guts.

102
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,687
If you wanna to become
an Insei, then you're

103
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:21,095
probably aiming higher than
some middle school tournament.

104
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:24,938
KIMIHIRO: HIkaru told us that
he's decided to beat Akira.

105
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:27,845
Did you know that Akira
just passed his pro exam?

106
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,147
Here, check this out.

107
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,617
-Let me see that.

108
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:31,620
Ah.

109
00:05:31,654 --> 00:05:33,090
If the kid wants
to go after Akira,

110
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,562
then he's not gonna have
time for the Go club.

111
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:39,171
The sooner he starts
getting serious, the better.

112
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:40,942
Here's your book.

113
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:43,113
You decided to go
after Akira, huh?

114
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:44,718
He won't be easy
to catch, so you

115
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:46,488
can't let anything distract you.

116
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,593
You do know that, right?

117
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:49,662
-Yeah, I guess.

118
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:53,572
-Oh, Hikaru.

119
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:57,648
He's right.

120
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:59,987
He won't have time to
play in tournaments.

121
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:00,889
-You're crazy.

122
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:02,894
-Kimihiro!

123
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,631
-He's got his sights
set on something

124
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,670
bigger than just
beating the Kaio team.

125
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:07,839
-No, he hasn't!

126
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:09,710
I still haven't heard
Hikaru say a word of it

127
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,746
from his own mouth.

128
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,715
It's like he said.

129
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:12,784
He just forgot
that he wouldn't be

130
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:14,522
able to play at any
of the tournaments!

131
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:15,004
Right?

132
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:21,071
Hikaru!

133
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:22,975
-I know.

134
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,116
TETSUO: You just won't
shut up, will you?

135
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,190
It's up to each person if they
want to be in the club or not.

136
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,860
-Do you know why I
joined the Go club?

137
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:31,930
I'll tell you!

138
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,734
Because Hikaru forced me to.

139
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:36,774
He needed to have a a
team to enter tournaments.

140
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:39,281
Why should I stick around
if he's taking off?

141
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:40,818
You say it's up to each person?

142
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,256
Well, if that's the way it
is, then gonna quit the club.

143
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,094
-You don't mean that.

144
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:46,531
-Sure, do whatever you want.

145
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,001
No one's forcing you to be here.

146
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:50,073
If you want to go, then go.

147
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:51,075
-Take it easy.

148
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:52,077
-Relax.

149
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,282
Hey, how many Go boards you got?

150
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:56,554
-Uh, we've got three.

151
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:58,827
-Go get all of them.

152
00:06:58,827 --> 00:06:59,863
Hikaru.

153
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:02,235
Play three of us in
a simultaneous game.

154
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:03,271
-Hold on!

155
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:05,175
You want me to play
three games at once?

156
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,245
TETSUO: Hey, loud mouth.

157
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:07,715
You're playing too.

158
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:10,020
If Hikaru's serious
about becoming an Insei,

159
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,860
this'll be a good chance for him
to show us what he's made of.

160
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:20,344
KIMIHIRO (VOICEOVER):
Hikaru's wavering

161
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:23,251
and Tetsuo's trying to
give him a nudge forward.

162
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:25,089
We can't let him leave
the club like this.

163
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:26,593
I have to do something.

164
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:33,709
I think Tetsuo is right.

165
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:36,149
Hikaru will play the three
of us at the same time.

166
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:39,657
Akari, I'm going to need some
help setting all the boards up.

167
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:40,292
-Sure.

168
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,296
-Are you gonna play, Yuuki?

169
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,368
This won't really work if
we only have two boards.

170
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:52,722
-I haven't played Go in a while.

171
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,101
-Come on, Yuuki.

172
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:01,909
Let's play a game.

173
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,346
-This'll be the last time.

174
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:41,804
-You know what?

175
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:44,778
If I don't pass the Insei
test, I'll stay in the club.

176
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,983
We can still compete in
tournaments together and--

177
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:48,487
-I don't need your charity!

178
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:52,062
I'm gonna quit, and nothing
you can say will change that.

179
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,265
-Listen, kid!

180
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:55,804
You're the first one who
decided to leave the Go club.

181
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:56,940
You can't have it both ways.

182
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:01,016
OK, enough talking.

183
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:01,751
Let's play.

184
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:18,457
-One second.

185
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:25,909
-What's taking you so long?

186
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,479
-I need a little time to think.

187
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,016
-When you play
three games at once,

188
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,220
you don't have time to think!

189
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:31,422
You have to play by instinct!

190
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:32,959
Now stop stalling.

191
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:34,329
It's your move!

192
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:43,317
-I've got to trust my instincts.

193
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:44,052
All right.

194
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:44,553
Here I go.

195
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:36,075
-(VOICEOVER) I'm really
no match for him.

196
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:37,880
-Stay focused on your game!

197
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:39,450
You're making it
too easy for him!

198
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:56,290
-Hikaru and Yuuki both said that
they're quitting the Go club.

199
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,199
And Kimihiro's gonna
be graduatign soon.

200
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:01,302
This is bad.

201
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,006
Really bad.

202
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,941
-Yeah, it is.

203
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:09,421
This'll hurt the club.

204
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,526
But I won't quit.

205
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,569
I mean-- Hikaru's
gonna keep playing Go.

206
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:18,711
And so am I.

207
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:56,232
(VOICEOVER) He's playing
all the vital points.

208
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:18,318
-Well, that's it.

209
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:19,487
I have to resign.

210
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:28,308
-Hikaru's a pretty
incredible player.

211
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:28,791
-Uh-huh.

212
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,592
TSUTSUI: (VOICEOVER)
Yuuki's game is over, too.

213
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,430
-It's no good.

214
00:12:37,463 --> 00:12:40,270
I can't win.

215
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:43,144
TSUTSUI: He lost by 6 and 1/2
points, counting the Komi.

216
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:19,229
-I have to resign.

217
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,687
-I'm the only one who heard you.

218
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,658
Not just your words,
but your thoughts, too.

219
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,432
You played the very
best game you could.

220
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:40,379
I am sorry.

221
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:42,819
Thank you, Yuuki.

222
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,823
You should be grateful, Hikaru.

223
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:46,394
Your friends'
efforts have put you

224
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:48,198
one step closer to your goal.

225
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:57,787
TETSUO: Think you can predict
who's gonna win this match?

226
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,692
-You are.

227
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:00,861
-Good for you kid.

228
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:04,336
You've figured out how
to count as you play now.

229
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,140
I don't think there's
any need to count.

230
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,379
We both know I've won
by 6 and 1/2 points.

231
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,897
(VOICEOVER) What a jerk.

232
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,637
-I can't beat you.

233
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,544
-You know, I tried to tell
you I'm a real strong player.

234
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:24,450
But actually, if you did
this good playing three games

235
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:27,324
at once, you should be OK.

236
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:28,561
-You think so?

237
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:31,333
-It's like I said, playing
a simultaneous game is

238
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,572
a whole lot different from
playing a regular game.

239
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,312
-Am I really good enough
to pass the Insei test?

240
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:38,317
-Even I couldn't
answer that question.

241
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:41,357
It's not like I'm the
one who gives the test.

242
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,794
-I see.

243
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:44,599
This means if it's
a one on one game,

244
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:46,804
I could probably
beat you, right?

245
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:47,872
-Hey, nobody said that.

246
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,543
I'm miles ahead of you!

247
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:51,615
-Kimihiro, I wanted
to ask you something.

248
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:53,786
Do you know how to
make a game record?

249
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,421
-Sure.

250
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:55,625
Why?

251
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,495
-I was kind of hoping that
you'd be able to show me

252
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,667
how to fill out
these forms properly.

253
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,870
Here, check this out.

254
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:02,742
I've got to bring
three completed game

255
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:04,646
records with me
to my Insei test.

256
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,815
-Wait a minute.

257
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,753
Those games we just played?

258
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,958
You're able to remember
all three of them?

259
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:11,395
-Yeah, of course I can.

260
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:12,831
It's easy.

261
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:14,736
-Hm.

262
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,242
-You're going to need a
red pen and a black pen.

263
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:19,247
Colored pencils are fine, too.

264
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,450
Red is for white.

265
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,287
Make sure to write down
the moves in the same order

266
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,490
that they were made.

267
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:30,306
-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

268
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:32,344
-This kid's got quite
a career ahead of him?

269
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:36,521
-What about ko?

270
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:41,467
-Put the move number right here,
and now write in ko next to it.

271
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,872
-I hope you fail that dumb test.

272
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:45,275
-You're such a baby!

273
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:46,979
When is your whining
ever gonna stop?

274
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,017
I'm sick of hearing it!

275
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:50,756
-What's all this
commotion about?

276
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:52,559
Ah.

277
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,561
Kaga!

278
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:54,531
-Huh?

279
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:56,903
Ah!

280
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:57,505
-Huh?

281
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,409
MITSUKO: All right, let
me get this straight.

282
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:15,848
It's like a school, just
for Ko players, right?

283
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:16,950
HIKARU: Yeah.

284
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:19,690
MITSUKO: The entrance
exam costs a fortune.

285
00:16:19,723 --> 00:16:21,695
Why do they charge
so much, anyway?

286
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:22,965
HIKARU: They only
want applicants

287
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,802
who take the game seriously.

288
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:26,941
It's really hard to
get into this program.

289
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:28,979
-What about the Go class
that you used to take?

290
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:30,482
It was really
close to the house,

291
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:34,391
and it was quite a bit
cheaper than this school.

292
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,862
-That course was
full of old ladies.

293
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,600
You can't get to be
a really good player

294
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:38,870
in a places like that.

295
00:16:38,903 --> 00:16:40,807
-Well, you've never shown
this much interest in anything

296
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,678
before, so I guess it's OK.

297
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:45,385
It is nice to see you
enthusiastic about something.

298
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:47,557
I just wish you were as
excited about your studies

299
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,626
as you are about Go.

300
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,506
-You're Hikaru Shindou, right?

301
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:55,809
This way to the exam room.

302
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:07,084
-Huh?

303
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:13,017
-Please, take off your
shoes and leave them here.

304
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:22,848
-Huh?

305
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,162
-This is it.

306
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:33,599
-Wow.

307
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:35,203
These are all Insei?

308
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:37,141
-This is where it
begins, Hikaru.

309
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:38,110
-Yeah, this is it.

310
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:40,615
My first step toward
beating Akira.

311
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:41,852
I can't back out now.

312
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,790
I've got to pass this test.

313
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,027
[cying]

314
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,997
MAN: You're a talented player.

315
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:49,704
Why don't you come back
when you're a bit stronger?

316
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:50,739
-Thank you very much.

317
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:57,556
-Sensei, the last
applicant has just arrived.

318
00:17:57,589 --> 00:17:58,725
-We'll begin immediately.

319
00:17:58,725 --> 00:17:59,628
Please follow me.

320
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:04,873
Sit down.

321
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:05,742
Make yourself comfortable.

322
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:10,520
-(VOICEOVER) I have
to sit formally?

323
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,999
-May I see your application
and game records?

324
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,510
Let's have a look.

325
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,080
All right.

326
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:24,152
You were white in
all three matches.

327
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:25,155
Is that correct?

328
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,192
-Yes.

329
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:30,032
-Hm.

330
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:32,839
His moves aren't very refined.

331
00:18:32,873 --> 00:18:36,916
He thinks he can pass the Insei
exam with this level of play?

332
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,090
And his opponents in these games
weren't very strong, either.

333
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,135
Who is Tsutsui?

334
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:47,207
-He's my senpai.

335
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:48,877
-And Matani?

336
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:52,687
-A friend from the Go club.

337
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:54,089
-Tetsuo Kaga.

338
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:55,827
Tell me about him.

339
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:57,933
-Kaga's the captain
of the Shogi club.

340
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,636
-Is that so?

341
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,310
(VOICEOVER) His game is
the best of the bunch.

342
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:07,722
Well, this boy does have
Mr. Ogata's recommendation.

343
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,727
Are you ready to start?

344
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,930
-What's my handicap?

345
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,567
-Three stones.

346
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:13,769
-I have a question.

347
00:19:13,804 --> 00:19:15,073
-Yes?

348
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:18,615
-I was just wondering, how long
does this test usually last?

349
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:21,154
-It'll take at least an
hour to complete everything.

350
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:22,925
If you'd like to
wait outside, we'll

351
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,295
let you know when we're done.

352
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,767
-Oh, that's very kind of you.

353
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,605
If you'll excuse me.

354
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,774
I'm going to get a cup of tea.

355
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:31,579
I'll be in the cafe
on the first floor,

356
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:33,851
so just come down and get
me when you're done, OK?

357
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:34,853
-Huh? 'Kay.

358
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,271
-Poor Hikaru.

359
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:44,376
He's not going to pass.

360
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,882
He can't sit on his knees
for longer than five minutes.

361
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:56,037
-Oh, they're doing the
Insei exams today, huh?

362
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:56,806
-Yeah.

363
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,908
A girl just failed.

364
00:19:57,908 --> 00:19:59,044
She was crying.

365
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:00,213
-Whoa.

366
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,218
Is there someone in
there doing the exam now?

367
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:03,621
-Yeah, some guy.

368
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:05,760
I don't know who he is, but
he looks younger than me.

369
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:13,912
I don't know why, but I have
a feeling he's gonna pass.

370
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,182
-Onegai shimasu.

371
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:15,917
-Onegai shimasu.

372
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,139
[theme music]

373
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,816
HIKARU: My next game is gonna
be the most important one ever.

374
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:23,353
SAI: You'll only win
by staying focused.

375
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:23,995
HIKARU: Yeah, yeah.

376
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:26,197
You know, after
I pass this test,

377
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:28,155
everything's gonna
be so awesome!

378
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,190
First, I'll be an
Insei, and then I'll

379
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,827
turn pro and beat Akira
and win some titles!

380
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:34,928
SAI: Hikaru.

381
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:38,432
The outcome of the game
does not look good.

382
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:41,268
HIKARU: Next time,
The Insei Test.

383
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:44,171
SAI: Perhaps I should help you.
