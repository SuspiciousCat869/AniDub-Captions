00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:52,279
HIKARU: You are gonna wanna
play him again, aren't you?

3
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,298
-Yes.

4
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,553
-I wonder if I can
make it happen.

5
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,221
-You wonder if?

6
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,357
You have to do better than that!

7
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,425
-I'm sure I'll figure
something out someday.

8
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,560
You'll just have to wait.

9
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,621
-Someday?

10
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:08,082
When?

11
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:08,661
When?

12
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,396
-How should I know when?

13
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,697
Whenever it happens.

14
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,366
Today was an important
day for me too.

15
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,968
My first game as
a pro, remember?

16
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,269
So don't be so selfish.

17
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,005
I gave up a big chance
to let you play.

18
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,339
You don't get it, do you?

19
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:26,046
I--

20
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,680
-I'm very sorry.

21
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,318
-It's your own fault.

22
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,153
You're the one who
decided to inhabit me.

23
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,158
-Poor Torajiro.

24
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,162
He was intelligent and truly
kind to everyone he met.

25
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,296
-Hmph.

26
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:47,534
So you think I'm stupid
and not kind to anyone?

27
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,135
-Hikaru.

28
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,621
Why did the spirits
of Go bring me

29
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,623
back to this world
to be with Hikaru?

30
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,168
His progress has been
truly remarkable.

31
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,004
And as his teacher, I'm
both proud and happy

32
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,474
to see him do so well.

33
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,143
But what about me?

34
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,144
Will I play Go again?

35
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,660
This existence is painful.

36
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,065
Finally an opportunity
came along for me

37
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,268
to face a Go master,
someone I hoped

38
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,404
would help me in my journey
to find the Divine Move.

39
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:06,747
But it wasn't meant to be.

40
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,685
I couldn't play as I usually
do, and so against him,

41
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,589
it was impossible for me to
have the perfect game I wanted.

42
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,675
If I am unable to
achieve the Divine Move,

43
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,510
then why am I here?

44
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,582
How long must I wait?

45
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,023
It all began over a
thousand years ago.

46
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,698
Every day, I would play
Go at the imperial palace.

47
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,704
Then came that fateful day when
I played another instructor

48
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,440
to see who would have the
honor of teaching the emperor.

49
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,194
There was a white
stone in his Go bowl.

50
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,362
He waited for an
opportune moment,

51
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:33,500
and then he slipped the
stone in with his prisoners.

52
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:38,738
And then, just as I was about
to protest-- What that--

53
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,674
-Scoundrel!

54
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,210
Just now, I saw you take a
black stone from your bowl

55
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,011
and place it among
your prisoners!

56
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,080
-What?

57
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,481
But I just saw you
do the same thing

58
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,383
with a white stone
from your bowl!

59
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,019
-What a pitiful
attempt at an excuse!

60
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,255
While all eyes were
fixed on the board,

61
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,691
you shamelessly took one
of my stones from your bowl

62
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,527
and placed it among
your prisoners!

63
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,195
-No, you were the
one who did that!

64
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:02,996
MAN: Silence!

65
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,698
That's enough.

66
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,200
I refuse to believe that
two members of my court

67
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:11,071
would commit such a discourteous
offense within my presence.

68
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,241
Now, on with the game.

69
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,142
SAI (VOICEOVER):
Unable to calm myself

70
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:20,413
at this disturbing turn of
events, I lost the game.

71
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,021
I was banished from the
capital, my reputation tarnished

72
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,024
by the allegation of treachery.

73
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,593
I had no other skills.

74
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:34,628
No way to make a living.

75
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:46,306
Two days later, I cast
myself into the river.

76
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,441
But I didn't want
to stop playing Go.

77
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:59,019
Unable to find peace, my soul
was trapped within a Go board.

78
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,422
It seemed like an
eternity, until one day,

79
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,358
on the island of
Enoshima in the Seto Sea,

80
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,160
I heard a child's voice.

81
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,728
His name was Torajiro.

82
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,266
Sweet child.

83
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,036
If you are able to see the
stains of my wretched tears,

84
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,505
then perhaps you
have some small space

85
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:23,576
within your soul in
which to house my own.

86
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,980
From that moment, I was
able to play as much

87
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,716
Go as I wanted with him.

88
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,153
-He changed his name to
Shusaku, and before long, he

89
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,155
won the title of Honinbo.

90
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,624
Together with him,
I was confident I

91
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,693
would be able to
achieve the Divine Move.

92
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:49,402
But he could not win the
battle against the epidemic.

93
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,173
Torajiro Honinbo Shusaku.

94
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,246
For all eternity,
I will never forget

95
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,351
the time I spent with him.

96
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,418
Eternity.

97
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,019
HIKARU: Sai.

98
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,757
If that's the way
you wanna play.

99
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,429
SAI (VOICEOVER): Yes.

100
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,431
And then you appeared, Hikaru.

101
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,403
HIKARU: That's funny.

102
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,405
The stain here isn't coming off.

103
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,574
AKARI: Uh, what are
you talking about?

104
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,110
What stain?

105
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,012
HIKARU: This one.

106
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,279
-Show me.

107
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,280
HIKARU: Right here.

108
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,081
-Huh?

109
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,282
There's nothing there.

110
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,617
Look.

111
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,152
-It's right here!

112
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,154
SAI (VOICEOVER): You can see it?

113
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,023
-That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

114
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,290
SAI (VOICEOVER):
You can hear me?

115
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,562
You can really hear
what I'm saying!

116
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:53,066
-I don't see a stain.

117
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,736
-Who-- Who's there?

118
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,340
SAI (VOICEOVER): To the
gods, I offer my gratitude,

119
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:10,183
for once again, I-- I-- I can
finally return to this world!

120
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,570
But I have to admit, I
was worried at first.

121
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,539
Here was a boy who had
never even picked up

122
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,309
a Go stone, let alone
played the game before.

123
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,011
HIKARU: You really
love Go, don't you?

124
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,179
SAI: Oh yes.

125
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,047
HIKARU: And you really
want to play Go, don't you?

126
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:41,614
SAI: Yes!

127
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,715
HIKARU: Too bad.

128
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,417
I don't think I'm never
gonna play the game.

129
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,721
[sobbing]

130
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,290
-What's wrong?

131
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,691
-Is he all right?

132
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,971
HIKARU: Aw, couldn't you, you
know, go bother someone else?

133
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:05,705
-Probably not.

134
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,211
HIKARU: I guess it wouldn't
hurt to play once in awhile.

135
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:17,083
SAI: So tell me, where
are we gonna be paying Go?

136
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,318
HIKARU: At a Go salon?

137
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,426
Gee, It's like a
nursing home in here.

138
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,161
Hey, there's a kid over there.

139
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,696
Can I play him?

140
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,297
-I know he's your age, but--

141
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,369
-Are you looking for
someone to play against?

142
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,373
SAI (VOICEOVER): That was
when I met Akira Toya.

143
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,209
I believe our meeting
was destined by fate.

144
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:57,302
So, fate had brought
Akira and Hikaru together.

145
00:10:57,335 --> 00:10:58,970
-Yes!

146
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,507
-3, 4 in the upper right,
17 across, and 4 down.

00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:08,513
17, one, two, three, four.

00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:11,482
-The way he holds his stones,
he must be a beginner.

149
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:13,117
SAI (VOICEOVER): By
being with Hikaru,

150
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:17,221
I was able to battle Akira Toya
for a total of three games.

151
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:18,456
3, 4 in the lower right.

16, 17.

153
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:22,527
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): 16, 17.

154
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,095
This must be it.

155
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:28,967

Where are you?

160
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:42,113
There it is.

161
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:49,087
AKIRA: That's-- that
isn't the best move.

162
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,456
It's not even a good move.

163
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:54,892
He played it to see
how I'd respond.

164
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:58,029
It's like he's
testing my strength.

165
00:11:58,062 --> 00:12:01,299
He's measuring my skill.

166
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:03,134
From a level far above mine.

167
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:07,271
SAI (VOICEOVER: Akira
Toya was a player

168
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:10,408
who had amazing
potential, even though he

169
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:13,978
was the same age as Hikaru.

170
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:17,248
Then, the following match.

171
00:12:17,281 --> 00:12:18,783
-Have a seat.

172
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:22,020
-Uh, OK.

173
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:26,257
(VOICEOVER): Hey, this
crowd doesn't even bug him.

174
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,259
SAI (VOICEOVER): At that
time, I made a decision

175
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:29,160
to change tactics.

176
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:36,100
Or is he waiting
for the diagonal?

177
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:38,436
Very well, then, I shall comply.

178
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:40,505
The 15, 16 point.

179
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:43,107
The diagonal.

180
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:45,043
Now, we shall see.

181
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,194
-I-- resign.

182
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:09,233
HIKARU: Sai?

183
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:11,102
SAI: He has conceded.

184
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:14,205
Akira knows that he
cannot win this game.

185
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:14,806
-What?

186
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:24,382
-Although he was scared,
he showed bravery

187
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:28,052
by confronting me.

188
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:31,522
Our next battle was not face
to face, but over the internet.

189
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:41,432
-Excellent move.

190
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,511
He's stronger than anyone
I've ever faced before.

191
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:55,480
He's put up a wall
in front of me.

192
00:13:55,513 --> 00:14:04,856
But if it's not
Hikaru-- then who's

193
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:06,124
on the other side of this board?

194
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:20,805
I won't give up.

195
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:32,083
There's nothing I can do.

196
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:33,818
The game is over.

197
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:40,892
-You're still undefeated.

198
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:43,461
Phew.

199
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:45,963
I couldn't tell if that
was actually Akira.

200
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:46,931
You think it was him?

201
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,168
-It's him.

202
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,502
I'm sure of it.

203
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:52,770
-How'd he do?

204
00:14:52,803 --> 00:14:56,841
Was he a tough opponent?

205
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,943
Sai?

206
00:14:58,976 --> 00:14:59,510
-Yes.

207
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,978
He played a strong game.

208
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:03,848
His instincts for the
game are quite developed.

209
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:06,817
He's a patient opponent, and
doesn't make impulsive moves

210
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:09,020
when his stones are in danger.

211
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:10,087
-Hm?

212
00:15:10,121 --> 00:15:14,192
It sounds like he's
gotten a lot better.

213
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:18,829
-He played well, but I am the
one who has become stronger.

214
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:19,997
-Huh?

215
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:21,232
-You too, Hikaru.

216
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:22,833
You're much stronger now.

217
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,035
-Seriously?

218
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:25,303
-You've learned a lot.

219
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:27,338
You spent the entire summer
watching all of my matches.

220
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:32,877
(VOICEOVER) So,
together Hikaru and I

221
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,379
have learned the modern
game of Go from the battles

222
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:38,082
with Akira Toya.

223
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:42,386
Akira has pursued me, and
Hikaru has pursued him.

224
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:49,327
How could I have
forgotten that other game?

225
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,163
The time I played him at
Hikaru's Go club tournament.

226
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:57,134
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): There is
one thing I'd like to know.

227
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:02,173
Have I gotten any closer
to catching up to you?

228
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:06,544
I want to play.

229
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,913
Akira, you've never
stopped chasing after Sai.

230
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:12,216
Well, now it's time for
me to chase after you.

231
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:15,086
I've got to catch up to you.

232
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:15,967
-All right.

233
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,421
13, 4.

234
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:19,490
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I'll play at 11, 8.

235
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:23,527
Then how would I follow that up?

236
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:26,931
-Hikaru, I said 13, 14.

237
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:28,866
SAI (VOICEOVER): I
have to find out.

238
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:29,834
Sorry, Sai.

239
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,302
I know Akira's more
skilled than me,

240
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:34,872
but I'll never know how big that
gap is until I play him myself.

241
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:36,841
I have to make my move.

242
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:38,109
[gasp]

243
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:40,845
-You played 11, 8?

244
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:41,912
-I'm gonna play now.

245
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,185
SAI (VOICEOVER): That was
the first time I recognized

246
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:51,489
Hikaru's own ingenuity and
imagination as a player.

247
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,193
He didn't want to be
told where to move.

248
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:03,301
-Stop messing around!

249
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:03,968
-What?

250
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:06,237
What's wrong?

251
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,340
If you keep on chasing
your phantom image of me,

252
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,542
one day I'm gonna
catch up to you.

253
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:18,015
-Is that so?

254
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:26,190
Why wait until then?

255
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:27,758
Why don't we play
a game right now?

256
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:58,089
SAI (VOICEOVER):
From that day onward,

257
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:02,827
Hikaru began to forge a
tireless path toward Akira Toya.

258
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:08,366
In pursuit of him, he became an
Insei, he passed the pro exam,

259
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:11,302
and he became truly strong.

260
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:11,902
Hikaru.

261
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:20,244
-I wanna know your name!

262
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:21,512
Tell me what's your name.

263
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:23,748
I need to know
what your name is.

264
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,486
-My name's Hikaru Shindou.

265
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,454
Hope you remember it.

266
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:32,957
Hikaru Shindou.

267
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,125
SAI (VOICEOVER): Hm.

268
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:36,761
Now that I think about it,
it was around that time

269
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:38,529
I stopped playing anyone
other than Hikaru.

270
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:43,934
Even though there were
plenty of opportunities

271
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:47,204
to play much stronger players.

272
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:49,907
Hikaru.

273
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,079
Are you not going to
allow me to play anymore?

274
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:58,082
Just when I was getting close
to reaching the Divine Move?

275
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:01,419
Tell me.

276
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:02,953
I need to know.

277
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:07,525
Why have I been brought back to
this world to be with Hikaru?

278
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:08,993
Please answer me!

279
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:51,469
I've been waiting, but I see
you're not going to tell me.

280
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:10,778
Hikaru!

281
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:11,646
-Huh?

282
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,480
-Wake up!

283
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:12,947
Hurry!

284
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:13,581
Rise and shine!

285
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:14,415
Rise and shine!

286
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:15,183
It's time to get up!

287
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:16,484
-What's with all the noise?

288
00:20:16,518 --> 00:20:17,819
It's too early in the morning.

289
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:19,587
Can't you keep it down?

290
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:22,657
-It's time to get up
and play a game with me!

291
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,525
-Huh?

292
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:24,492
Oh, come on.

293
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:26,194
I haven't even
had breakfast yet.

294
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:27,428
I don't wanna.

295
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:29,464
SAI: I'm not taking
that as an excuse!

296
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:30,698
We have to play.

297
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:31,966
Otherwise I'm never gonna be
able to achieve the Divine

298
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,767
Move!

299
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,569
You're all I have, Hikaru!

300
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:35,970
HIKARU: What's
gotten into you, Sai?

301
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:37,472
Let me go back to sleep.

302
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:38,406
SAI: No, listen.

303
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,874
I've come to the
conclusion that this

304
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,042
is the only way, so come on.

305
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,143
Come on!

306
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:44,946
HIKARU: Wake me up
in about an hour.

307
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:45,547
SAI: Hikaru!

308
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,481
Hey!

309
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:48,650
Wake up!

310
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,984
HIKARU: Goodnight.

311
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:51,920
SAI: I need you to play.

312
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:52,921
Hikaru!

313
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,857
[theme music]

314
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:22,910
SAI: Hikaru.

315
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:24,912
These men are selling
fake signatures.

316
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:26,180
They have no honor.

317
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:28,950
HIKARU: I believe you, but
what can I do about it?

318
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:30,051
SAI: Just let me play.

319
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:31,653
I'll teach them a lesson!

320
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:33,921
HIKARU: Maybe we should teach
this guy Kurata one, too.

321
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:36,624
He's bragging like he's
a champion already.

322
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:38,059
SAI: Just give me
the chance, Hikaru.

323
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:44,866
HIKARU: Next time,
