00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:07,248
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:10,455
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:13,561
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:17,602
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

5
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:20,575
[theme music]

6
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:53,496
AKIRA (VOICEOVER):
Excellent move.

7
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,500
He's put up a wall
in front of me.

8
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,836
-Huh?

9
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:58,506
-I'm not gonna
bother you anymore.

10
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,376
You'll never have
to see me again.

11
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:03,249
-Hey, wait up, Akira!

12
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:05,520
If you keep on chasing
your phantom image of me,

13
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,524
one day I'm gonna
catch up to you.

14
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,868
-Hm.

15
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,507
Is that so?

16
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:18,412
-I want to thank you for
all the help you gave me.

17
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:18,895
-Hikaru.

18
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:23,489
-I'm not coming back.

19
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:25,727
Summer break's almost done,
and school's starting soon.

20
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:56,188
Well, Sai, if you can't play
on the internet anymore,

21
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:58,293
I guess there's no other choice.

22
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:00,497
You're gonna have to play me.

23
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:01,666
-Really?

24
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,437
But you haven't offered
to play a game against me

25
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,939
before, Hikaru.

26
00:03:05,174 --> 00:03:07,311
HIKARU: I don't really
wanna play against you.

27
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:09,849
After all, that means I've got
to move two players' stones.

28
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:12,321
What a pain.

29
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:13,891
SAI: But how are
we going to play?

30
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:16,263
You don't have a Go
board in your room.

31
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,866
SAI: I don't have stones either.

32
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,600
-Nice move.

33
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:20,604
-Huh?

34
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:22,508
-You've gotten stronger.

35
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:22,943
-Huh?

36
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:23,610
Really?

37
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:26,449
I have, haven't I?

38
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:27,853
Getting worried?

39
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,659
-I'm reducing your handicap.

40
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:31,861
-The game's over?

41
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:34,465
If you're giving up, you're
supposed to say, I resign.

42
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:35,502
-Ugh.

43
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:37,338
I'm a lot stronger
than you'll ever be!

44
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:39,576
You shouldn't let one little
compliment go to your head!

45
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,883
-Handicap or no handicap,
I just won the last game.

46
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,755
Don't be such a sore loser.

47
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:46,891
-Hey, guys.

48
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:48,695
Miss Tamako got some
money from the club budget

49
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,465
and used it to buy a
couple of Go boards

50
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:51,634
and two sets of stones.

51
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:52,369
-Cool.

52
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:53,438
Can I look at them?

53
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:54,340
-New boards?

54
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,442
HIKARU: Whoa, look at that.

55
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:56,477
It folds in half.

56
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,481
What's this thing
made out of, plastic?

57
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:00,318
I've seen these in toy stores.

58
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:01,654
-I didn't choose them.

59
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:02,589
-Guys!

60
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,426
I found a new member!

61
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,662
Come meet everyone.

62
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:07,566
-I'm Kumiko.

63
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,238
-Aw.

64
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,540
She's just a girl.

65
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:13,344
Just a girl, what
do you mean by that?

66
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:13,979
KUMIKO: Wait!

67
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:15,750
-Kimihiro's graduating soon.

68
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:17,652
We need to find a
guy to replace him,

69
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:20,492
or else we won't be able
to enter tournaments.

70
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:22,262
-Akari, I don't know
anything about Go.

71
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,398
Are you sure it's OK?

72
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:24,533
-Of course I'm sure.

73
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,705
I'm gonna teach you
everything you need to know.

74
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:28,374
-When did you become
a Go instructor?

75
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:29,644
-Know what I did this summer?

76
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:30,746
I practiced!

77
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,583
I've been going to Go
classes for months now.

78
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:33,351
HIKARU: Seriously?

79
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:34,253
AKARI: Seriously.

80
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:35,321
HIKARU: You went by yourself?

81
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:36,290
AKARI: That's right.

82
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:37,259
HIKARU: What's gotten into you?

83
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:38,362
-Know what?

84
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:39,831
The Go club's gonna
be great this year.

85
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,601
Too bad I have to
study for my exams.

86
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:43,772
-But you're still going to
come play once in a while,

87
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:44,808
aren't you?

88
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:47,380
-This got stronger
over the summer break.

89
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,449
-So you've improved?

90
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:49,684
Let's play a game.

91
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:51,688
HIKARU: I won't be
needing a handicap.

92
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:52,957
You sure about that?

93
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,062
AKARI: Yuuki, why don't
you teach us some strategy?

94
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:55,996
YUUKI: Uh.

95
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:56,965
AKARI: Come on.

96
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,702
It'll be fun!

97
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:00,005
YUUKI: Aw.

98
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,541
HIKARU: Hey, Kimihiro.

99
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,947
How much would a Go board
and a set of stones cost?

100
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:07,353
KIMIHIRO: Maybe about
10,000 yen for everything.

101
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:08,422
HIKARU: Wow.

102
00:05:08,422 --> 00:05:09,557
That's not cheap.

103
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:12,029
I guess I could see if my
grandpa will buy me one.

104
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,565
KIMIHIRO: That's
an expensive gift.

105
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:19,812
HEIHACHI: I haven't seen
you in a while, Hikaru.

106
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:21,782
I heard you started playing Go.

107
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:22,918
HIKARU: You just found out?

108
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,922
I've been playing
for more than a year!

109
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:29,030
-I also heard that you joined
a Go club at your school.

110
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,101
-It's funny you
should bring that up.

111
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:34,975
I was hoping you
could do me a favor.

112
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,779
HEIHACHI: A favor, huh?

113
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:38,917
I'm sorry, but I've
already promised your mom

114
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,720
that I wouldn't give
you any more money.

115
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:43,693
I'd like to help you out,
but she made me give my word.

116
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:45,029
-I don't want any money.

117
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:47,968
I want you to get me
a Go board and stones.

118
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:49,003
-Is that all?

119
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:50,574
I thought you already
had one of those.

120
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:52,844
If my grandson wants a
Go board, then that's

121
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:53,846
what he's gonna get.

122
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,550
I'll pick you up a
nice folding one.

123
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:56,719
OK?

124
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:58,623
-I'd really like one that
has legs on the bottom.

125
00:05:58,623 --> 00:05:59,993
Will you get me
that kind of board

126
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,964
if I beat you with no handicap?

127
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:06,639
-You-- You actually think you
can beat me in an even game?

128
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:10,413
You don't know how
good I am, do you?

129
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:11,515
See all these trophies?

130
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:13,921
I won the eighth annual
Local All-Star Cup,

131
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:16,660
and the third annual
Neighborhood Go Championship.

132
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,466
I've won so many of
them, I lost count.

133
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:21,737
-I've seen these a
million times, you know.

134
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,807
The longer we keep
talking, the less time

135
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,911
we have to sit down
and play a game.

136
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:28,684
[grumbling]

137
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:30,020
-If you beat me
in an even match,

138
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,523
then I'll give you this board.

139
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:33,927
-But it's used.

140
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:34,829
-What are you saying?

141
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:36,533
This is a valuable antique here!

142
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,969
-Huh?

143
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:39,439
There's another board.

144
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:40,508
You remember?

145
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,947
The one that you keep
up in your attic?

146
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:49,392
HEIHACHI: You mean the board
you found before you passed out?

147
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,396
You wouldn't want it.

148
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,732
HIKARU: I wouldn't?

149
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:54,536
HEIHACHI: It's
supposedly haunted

150
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:56,841
by a ghost that wears
a nobleman's hat.

151
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:01,884
-That's quite a story.

152
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:04,556
HEIHACHI: Don't tell me
you're afraid of ghosts?

153
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:11,704
My older brother used to collect
all sorts of unusual things.

154
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:14,510
He stumbled across that old
board in an antique shop.

155
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:16,113
After he died, I inherited it.

156
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:19,653
But I've never seen the ghost.

157
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:20,722
Who knows?

158
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:23,428
Maybe my brother made
the whole thing up.

159
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:28,204
SAI: I wonder what
he'd do if he knew

160
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:32,446
that I was here now with Hikaru.

161
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:35,085
Over a century ago,
I was with Shusaku.

162
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:38,892
And before that, I played Go
in the Heian imperial court.

163
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:46,140
A thousand years have
passed since that time.

164
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:58,231
And yet, I still find myself
sitting before a Go board,

165
00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:00,569
studying this game.

166
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:02,473
How much longer will
I be able to pursue

167
00:08:02,473 --> 00:08:04,210
my selfish indulgence?

168
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:04,945
-Ah!

169
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:06,615
I really messed up.

170
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:07,650
No!

171
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,888
All my stones are
about to be captured.

172
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:10,857
-Mm-hm.

173
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,558
Yep.

174
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,760
Look at the board.

175
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:15,165
You wasted a move when you
placed your stone here.

176
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,904
You should've played there
and protected this shape.

177
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:18,772
-Ah.

178
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:20,510
Do you mind if I change my move?

179
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:21,812
MAN: Of course not.

180
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:24,651
-Thanks a lot!

181
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,020
-That was nice of you.

182
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:27,757
You're in a good mood today.

183
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,594
-I'm trying to keep
the game moving.

184
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:31,798
-You've been a completely
different person ever

185
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,536
since Akari started
coming to class.

186
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:36,241
-Hey, I'm just being
a nice guy, OK?

187
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:37,912
-We haven't seen
Hikaru in a while.

188
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:39,014
How's he doing?

189
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:40,116
-Good.

190
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,186
His game's gotten much
better over the summer.

191
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,722
-I think I remember that boy.

192
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,660
He seemed like a nice
enough young man.

193
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,731
You used to come here with
him, isn't that right?

194
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:48,900
-That's right.

195
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:51,305
-Let me ask you a question,
just between us girls.

196
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,542
Do you have a little
crush on Hikaru?

197
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,212
-What?

198
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:56,649
We're just friends.

199
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:57,585
-Don't be embarrassed.

200
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:59,187
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

201
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,926
It's obvious you took
up Go to impress him.

202
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:05,066
-It is?

203
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,268
-Anyway.

204
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:08,138
When you get the chance,
please tell him to drop by.

205
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,944
I wanna hear all
about his training.

206
00:09:10,944 --> 00:09:11,546
-Sure.

207
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,094
I think I better start hanging
out with people my own age.

208
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:25,021
-Hm.

209
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:31,920
-OK.

210
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:34,893
It looks like I'm a
few stones behind you.

211
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:37,097
-Hm.

212
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:39,702
-Grandpa, can you
stop being so noisy?

213
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:40,704
It's really distracting.

214
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:47,117
-You've improved quite a
bit since we've played.

215
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:50,290
And you've only been
practicing for one year.

216
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:55,000
-You have-- You've become
a really strong player.

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,169
-Honestly?

218
00:09:56,202 --> 00:10:00,143
-Guess this is why you can't
underestimate children.

219
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:01,914
You are quite a
talented opponent.

220
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:02,749
-Really?

221
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:05,722
Does that mean I'm winning?

222
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,692
-Don't get too carried away.

223
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:09,796
Even if you manage to
play a perfect end game,

224
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,934
you're still gonna lose.

225
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:12,936
-Aw.

226
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:14,272
There goes my Go board.

227
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:16,310
-Told you I was good,
but you wouldn't listen.

228
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:19,984
I beat Mr. Inoue from Katsua,
and that man's a legend.

229
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:21,286
-I think you're exaggerating.

230
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:22,689
I've never heard of him.

231
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:29,035
-A Go board with legs.

232
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:30,671
All right, I'll tell you what.

233
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:32,977
I can probably afford to get
you one of the cheaper ones.

234
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,181
If that's what it takes to
encourage you to play more,

235
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,885
then it's a small price to pay.

236
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,120
-Thanks, Grandpa.

237
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:39,156
[doorbell]

238
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:41,160
MAN: Delivery!

239
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,299
MITSUKO: Oh, I'll sign for that.

240
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:46,905
Hikaru, there's a package
for you in the front hall.

241
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:49,042
HIKARU: Woo hoo!

242
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:50,211
MITSUKO: What?

243
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:52,048
50,000 yen?

244
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:52,883
-I know.

245
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,152
Grandpa bought it for me.

246
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,254
-That board cost a lot.

247
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,758
I hope you remember
to thank him.

248
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,260
-Of course I did.

249
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:02,168
[humming]

250
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,774
-I really didn't think you'd
keep playing Go for this long.

251
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,680
Well, you keep at
it, OK, Hikaru?

252
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,285
Well, you keep at
it, OK, Hikaru?

253
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,990
-I don't believe it,
I don't believe it!

254
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:14,060
It's too good to be true!

255
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:15,195
Hikaru has his own Go board.

256
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:17,867
I never thought
this day would come.

257
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,872
-Now we can practice
whenever we want to.

258
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,040
This is gonna be awesome!

259
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,209
-Enough talk!

260
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:25,015
We have to play
the game right now!

261
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:26,952
-Let me go.

262
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,188
Will you look at this board?

263
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,257
It's brand new.

264
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,461
We're gonna be the
first people to use it.

265
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:35,002
SAI: Hikaru, you can have as
much of a handicap as you like.

266
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:37,072
-And just what is
that supposed to mean?

267
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:38,375
I don't need a handicap.

268
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:42,383
I want to have an even game.

269
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,786
You choose for color.

270
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,924
-But that's not possible.

271
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:48,028
How can I pick up any stones?

272
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:48,996
-I see your point.

273
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,400
I'll be black, and
you'll be white.

274
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,036
The Komi is 5 and 1/2 points.

275
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:53,739
Are you ready to play?

276
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:55,075
SAI: Sure.

277
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:57,881
-Here we go.

278
00:11:57,914 --> 00:11:58,983
-4, 3, please.

279
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:05,897
4, 3, Hikaru.

280
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,932
-Huh?

281
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,002
Oh, that's right.

282
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:09,304
I'll place your stones.

283
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:17,855
-I'll take 17, 16.

284
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:18,790
-This is annoying.

285
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:20,861
I wish you could
do this yourself.

286
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:21,830
-It's not that bad.

287
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:24,267
You'll get used to it.

288
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,503
-Why don't you sit over there?

289
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:28,877
I can't concentrate with you
looking over my shoulder.

290
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,015
-Just a moment.

291
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:32,484
-That's much better.

292
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:34,154
Your move.

293
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,526
-10, 3, please.

294
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,762
-Here you go.

295
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,369
-Wait.

296
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:44,074
You accidentally put my
stone in the wrong spot.

297
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:44,776
-Uh-uh!

298
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:45,310
Look.

299
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,548
10, 3 is right there.

300
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:50,788
-10 3 is over here.

301
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:52,892
I'm sitting on the
wrong side of the board!

302
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:54,328
Everything is upside down!

303
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:56,499
How can you expect me to
play under these conditions?

304
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,804
-You don't have to tell me
where you're gonna move!

305
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:00,874
Just point to where
you want to go.

306
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:15,237
See?

307
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,941
This is much easier, isn't it?

308
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:22,251
-That tastes just about right.

309
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:23,788
HIKARU: You're
being a real jerk!

310
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:25,390
This game is over!

311
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:28,463
How am I supposed to win if
you're gonna play all out?

312
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:30,067
[nervous laughter]

313
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,504
-What is your problem?

314
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:33,941
You took it easy on Akira
the first time you faced him.

315
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:36,045
Would it kill you to play
a teaching game with me?

316
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,314
-Don't be upset.

317
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,586
I'm sure you'll feel better
after we play another game.

318
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,955
-Keep it down!

319
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:42,859
You're yelling so loud,
the walls are shaking.

320
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:45,063
Who are you talking to?

321
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:48,036
-I am not yelling!

322
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,973
Sai, clean this mess up for me.

323
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:50,408
-What?

324
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:51,410
But how?

325
00:13:51,443 --> 00:13:54,349
you know I can't pick things up.

326
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:55,084
Hikaru?

327
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:56,353
Are you listening?

328
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:56,955
Hikaru?

329
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,273
TSUTSUI: 53, 54, 55, 56.

330
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:08,044
You beat me by two points.

331
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:09,213
-Yeah!

332
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:12,152
I gave you two stones,
and I still won the game.

333
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,487
-Darn it!

334
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:14,389
-Huh?

335
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:16,260
[gasp]

336
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:18,397
-You know what bugs me?

337
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:21,237
I'm going to be so busy
studying for my entrance exams

338
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,042
that I won't get a chance
to hang out with you guys.

339
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:26,213
You're turning into a
great player, Hikaru.

340
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:29,286
It's too bad we won't
have time for many games.

341
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,889
The club's grown a lot.

342
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:33,528
All you are going to have a
really amazing time this year.

343
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:36,100
Yuuki, Akari, and Kumiko
are great teammates.

344
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:41,411
I can't wait to
watch the four of you

345
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:42,446
in the winter tournament.

346
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,217
But you'd better
find another member.

347
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,023
You'll need one more guy to
sign up for team tournaments.

348
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,191
-What if I make a new poster?

349
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:50,129
It worked for us last year.

350
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:52,900
-I'm glad that you've stopped
playing so recklessly.

351
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,003
You've learned a lot.

352
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:55,907
-We all felt pretty bad
when Kaio defeated us,

353
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:58,312
but we're going to show them a
thing or two this time round.

354
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,927
-I resign.

355
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,394
-Hold on.

356
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:13,676
-Thank you very
much for the game.

357
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,410
-Same to you.

358
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:15,312
It was a good match.

359
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:30,276
-I must resign.

360
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,278
-Thank you for the game.

361
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:40,063
-Really?

362
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:42,434
You want to keep playing
me through to the end?

363
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,564
-I resign.

364
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:58,399
-Thank you.

365
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:01,138
It was an interesting match.

366
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:04,111
[groan]

367
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:08,119
[crying]

368
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,688
-We weren't good enough
to beat Kaio last time,

369
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:27,692
but wait until they see
how much I've improved.

370
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:31,633
They'll never know what hit 'em.

371
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,072
-He's got that crazy
look in his eyes.

372
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:37,678
[laughter]

373
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:38,780
-Wow.

374
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:40,684
You're sure playing
well today, Mr. Akota.

375
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:43,457
-I appreciate your compliment,
but you ain't seen nothin' yet.

376
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,526
Ha ha ha ha ha!

377
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:53,544
-Hm.

378
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,548
Your skills have developed a
great deal in the past year.

379
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,320
That Go club of yours
is doing a fantastic job

380
00:16:58,353 --> 00:16:59,657
with your training.

381
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,128
-The boy's still got a long way
to go if he wants to beat me.

382
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:03,163
I'm the best of the best!

383
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,675
-I hope you'll keep
visiting us, Hikaru.

384
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,279
They don't keep you too busy
at your middle school, do they?

385
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:17,559
(VOICEOVER) He's concentrating
so hard on the game

386
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,028
that he doesn't even hear me.

387
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:26,544
-Thanks for everything, Sensei.

388
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:28,514
And thanks for the
game, Mr. Akota.

389
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,151
It was a lot of fun.

390
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:30,719
-Huh?

391
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,155
Hold on, I'm coming.

392
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:34,226
See you next week, Sensei.

393
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:35,495
Why don't you ever wait?

394
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:38,668
Don't forget to practice!

395
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:40,472
-I let my guard down
because he's a kid!

396
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:42,409
Who's have guessed he'd
turn the tables on me?

397
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:44,279
I have no idea how
he managed to make

398
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,682
such an incredible comeback.

399
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:47,754
I should have never let
that compliment of yours go

400
00:17:47,787 --> 00:17:49,123
to my head.

401
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:51,494
You're not gonna tell anyone
I lost to him, will you?

402
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:53,131
-He's extraordinarily.

403
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:54,601
-Wha--

404
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,203
-You're too quick
to blame yourself.

405
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:58,274
You didn't make
any real mistakes.

406
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:00,211
And neither did Hikaru.

407
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,347
he made a great comeback.

408
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,385
I've never seen a young
man with that kind

409
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,621
of focus and discipline.

410
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:11,401
Either the coach of his Go club
is a very talented teacher,

411
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:14,139
or Hikaru is very
passionate about his game.

412
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:25,496
-Hm.

413
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:28,102
Is something
bothering you, Hikaru?

414
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:29,204
-I was thinking.

415
00:18:29,237 --> 00:18:30,806
It takes an experienced
player to recognize

416
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,710
how strong their opponent is.

417
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:33,880
-Huh?

418
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,487
-I figured that out in the
middle of today's game.

419
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,328
I was able to see how
talented Mr. Akota is.

420
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:42,563
-But you won.

421
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:44,501
Doesn't that prove you're
a better player than he is?

422
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,578
-It does.

423
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:53,352
It won't be long before I'm
good enough to beat Yuuki.

424
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:56,224
-It's too bad you couldn't have
played this good at last year's

425
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:57,494
tournament.

426
00:18:57,528 --> 00:18:59,832
Maybe then Akira wouldn't have
yelled his head off at you

427
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:03,339
and made a big scene.

428
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:04,542
-Don't remind me.

429
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,422
(VOICEOVER) Akira.

430
00:19:11,422 --> 00:19:14,295
Improving my game a little won't
make a difference against him.

431
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:22,912
Oh, yeah!

432
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:25,817
Hikaru Shindou
beats Yuuki Mitani!

433
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:26,719
I beat Yuuki!

434
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,721
I beat Yuuki!

435
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,491
And I did it without a handicap!

436
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:30,928
-Don't let it go to your head!

437
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:33,166
I've won dozens of games
against you, you know?

438
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:34,335
You've only beat me once.

439
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:35,604
I want a rematch.

440
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:37,174
HIKARU: I win!

441
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:38,176
YUUKI: A remathc!

442
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:38,944
You got that?

443
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,882
HIKARU: You'll lose again.

444
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:42,351
YUUKI: Choose for color!

445
00:19:42,384 --> 00:19:43,854
-(VOICEOVER) I always thought
that Hikaru would catch up

446
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:46,627
to Yuuki one day, but I can't
believe that he's already able

447
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,962
to beat him.

448
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:49,866
How does he learn
so quickly, anyway?

449
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:52,204
I can't wait for this
year's tournament.

450
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,342
We might actually defeat Kaio.

451
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:57,982
It just might be possible that
Hikaru will make it happen.

452
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:02,725
It'd be amazing if
he can pull it off.

453
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,296
I hope he stays focused.

454
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,430
-Are we going to spend
the day reading manga?

455
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:23,768
-I need to get a textbook
for one of my classes.

456
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:25,237
You can help me look for it.

457
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:26,717
It's around here somewhere.

458
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:28,452
-I'll be glad to help you study.

459
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,053
-Let's see.

460
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:33,056
Where is it?

461
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,892
Doesn't that guy play for Kaio?

462
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:35,374
-Huh?

463
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:39,111
Hold on.

464
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:48,939
Do you have some
free time right now?

465
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:52,876
-Uh-- uh--

466

SAI: You're coming to
a cross road, Hikaru.

468
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:26,670
HIKARU: I know.

469
00:22:26,703 --> 00:22:28,071
If I want to become
stronger, like Akira,

470
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:30,107
I'm going to have to
practice with new opponents.

471
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,409
But I also want to keep playing
against the guys in the Go

club.

of the Kaio team

will give you advice
on what to do.

HIKARU: That guy?

476
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:38,048
He's such a know it all.

477
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:41,818
All he does is talk, and
talk, and drink black coffee.
