00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,540
[theme song]

2
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,412
SAI (VOICEOVER): 140
years ago, Torajiro

3
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,049
allowed me to guide him.

4
00:01:56,083 --> 00:02:01,388
If Torajiro existed
for my sake, then

5
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,190
I have existed
for Hikaru's sake.

6
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,163
And what's more, Hikaru will now
exist for someone else's sake.

7
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,671
Then that person will be
there for someone else.

8
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,676
And so it will continue,
year after year,

9
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,011
millennium after millennium.

10
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,551
The long path that leads us
all toward the divine move.

11
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,030
My part in the
journey is now over.

12
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,752
-Hey, Sai?

13
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:06,720
Where are you?

14
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,689
Are you trying to hide from me?

15
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,757
I'm only playing because
you wanted me to.

16
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,993
I'd rather be sleeping.

17
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,327
This is annoying.

18
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,429
Where are you?

19
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,269
Hmph.

20
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,136
Forget it.

21
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,304
I'm going to bed.

22
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,549
OK, Sai, cut it out.

23
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,383
This isn't funny.

24
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,424
Huh.

25
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,692
Hm?

26
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,361
Hm.

27
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,163
Hm.

28
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,365
-What are you doing?

29
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,034
-This is really weird.

30
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,435
-You can say that again.

31
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,437
You've been acting
strange lately.

32
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,340
-Maybe I lost him on the
way back from the hotel.

33
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,143
No, he definitely
came home with me.

34
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,277
-Huh?

35
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,012
-It wasn't just my imagination.

36
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,715
We were playing go up in my room
until just a few minutes ago.

37
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,384
-Is something the
matter, Hikaru?

38
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,386
-I did leave the window open.

39
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,021
There's no way he
would have jumped.

40
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,358
Maybe he was carried
off by the wind.

41
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,192
Hey, mom?

42
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,228
I'm going out for a while.

43
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,429
-Uh, wait a minute.

44
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,697
Where are you going?

45
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:24,698
-I don't know.

46
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,999
Out somewhere.

47
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,400
Go association.

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,268
-OK then.

49
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,342
-OK, if he was carried
off by the wind,

50
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,544
then he could have taken it
as a chance to go anywhere

51
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,311
he wanted.

52
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,183
But he's been around
me for over two years,

53
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,185
and nothing like this
has ever happened before.

54
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,019
I don't understand.

55
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,298
He's not here.

56
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,120
Sai?

57
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,624
Huh.

58
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,142
Hey there, Sai.

59
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,611
You in here?

60
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,212
Sai?

61
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,019
Well, he's definitely not there.

62
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,155
Where else could
he have gone to?

63
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,157
He can't just disappear
all of a sudden!

64
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:28,261
No.

65
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,398
He couldn't have.

66
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,000
-Hikaru, what's so
important you can't even

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,136
stop to say hi to your grandpa?

68
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:36,636
-Nothing.

69
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,237
Sorry.

70
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,675
-So what's up?

71
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,543
Did you forget something
the last time you were here?

72
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,416
-[gasp]

73
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,324
-The blood stain.

74
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,027
It's completely gone.

75
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:01,761
But why?

76
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,531
How is that possible?

77
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,033
Sai was playing go
with me in my room.

78
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,069
It was just like normal.

79
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,136
That's what we always did.

80
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,342
Last time I was here,
I remember thinking

81
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,111
the stain looked lighter.

82
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:22,415
And that's when Sai was
talking about disappearing.

83
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,418
What did he mean by that?

84
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,488
He couldn't have-- couldn't
have gone for good.

85
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:31,097
Could he?

86
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,232
That's crazy.

87
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:33,633
He wouldn't have left
without saying goodbye.

88
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,570
The two of us have been
together for all this time!

89
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,045
-Hikaru, are you
sure everything's

90
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:46,246
all right up there?

91
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,481
If you stay up there too
long, the ghosts of the attic

92
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:50,083
might come haunt you!

93
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,484
-That's exactly what I want!

94
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:53,620
-Huh?

95
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,058
-Grandpa, do ghosts
ever just disappear?

96
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:01,027
-They disappear when they can
rest in peace-- when there's

97
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:04,231
no more unfinished business
for them to deal with on Earth.

98
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:06,967
-That's what I thought.

99
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:07,467
-Huh?

100
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,502
Hey, Hikaru, wait!

101
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:10,937
Going home already?

102
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:14,941
-Sai couldn't have
gone, because he

103
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,409
hasn't mastered the
divine move yet.

104
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:19,980
He'd stay for however long it
took-- for thousands of years.

105
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,348
He's gotta be in my room.

106
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:22,582
He must be hiding somewhere.

107
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:25,919
I mean, he was
there this morning!

108
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:26,486
I'm home!

109
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:29,923
Sai?

110
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:43,236
Sai?

111
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:04,291
I guess he decided
to go somewhere.

112
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:06,192
He's never done it
before, but there's

113
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:11,331
no reason why he couldn't
learn to do it if he wanted to.

114
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:13,366
He has been kind
of moody lately.

115
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,602
He probably thought he needed
a break from everything,

116
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:16,970
so he went off somewhere.

117
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:24,511
Maybe he could actually fly.

118
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:29,115
Well, if he learned
how to do that,

119
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:31,017
he could have flown
off to any place!

120
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:33,420
The least he could've done is
told me where he was going!

121
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:36,623
[phone ringing]

122
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,627
-Yes?

123
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:42,262
Hello?

124
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:43,229
Oh, Hikaru!

125
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,298
Why'd you run off
all of a sudden?

126
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:47,567
After coming all
this way, you should

127
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,103
have stayed so we could
play a quick game.

128
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:51,271
What?

129
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:54,240
What do you mean, where
would a ghost want to go?

130
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:57,177
How on Earth would I know?

131
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,044
-Come on!

132
00:08:58,078 --> 00:08:59,412
You must have some kind of idea!

133
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:01,381
I need to know!

134
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:03,583
-You're serious about
this, aren't you?

135
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:06,486
-Maybe he'd go back to his
own grave, or a place that

136
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:09,356
held special memories for him.

137
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,558
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I don't
think Sai even has a grave.

138
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:14,494
So what place would
be special to him?

139
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:15,228
-Sorry, Grandpa.

140
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:16,096
Gotta go.

141
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:17,632
I think I've worked it out. Thanks.

142
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:18,498
-What? H-Hikar--

143
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,635
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Sai wasn't in the attic

144
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,104
where we first met.

145
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:28,508
What if he's gone somewhere
from another part of his life?

146
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,142
-Torajiro.

147
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,647
I remember Sai saying he
met Torajiro in Inoshima.

148
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:39,552
This is what I was looking for.

149
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:40,487
Now let's see.

150
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,922
Inoshima is where?

151
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:44,057
Near Hiroshima?

152
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,328
Gah, but that's like
hundreds of miles away!

153
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,498
Here it is.

154
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:54,401
He always complained
about me, but he never

155
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:56,102
had a bad thing to
say about Torajiro.

156
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:01,941
[scoff] So what?

157
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:03,676
I spent lots of
time with Sai, too.

158
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,650
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I'll do
whatever it takes to find you.

159
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:12,919
You can't just leave
without saying a word.

160
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:14,621
That's not fair!

161
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:16,222
I'm going to find you, Sai!

162
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,267
-What am I doing?

163
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,502
Inoshima's so far away.

164
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:31,271
I don't know if I can
make it all the way

165
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:32,672
there and back in a day!

166
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:34,574
But if I don't go, I
might never find him.

167
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,109
So I have to try.

168
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:38,411
It's going to be worth it if
I can find some sort of clue

169
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:40,480
to help me figure
out where he is.

170
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:42,682
[honking]

171
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:43,483
-Hey, kiddo!

172
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,218
Where are you going?

173
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:46,486
Can I give you a ride anywhere?

174
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:47,320
-Hi, Mr. Kawai.

175
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:52,058
-The train station, huh?

176
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:54,194
You going on a trip?

177
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:57,163
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
but isn't Inoshima the place

178
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:59,999
where Honinbo Shusaku was born?

179
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,067
It's nice out there.

180
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:02,969
I'd love to have
a break like that.

181
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:05,171
I had to work all the way
through Golden Week this year

182
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,140
without a day off.

183
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:09,042
OK, that settles it.

184
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:12,278
Just let me swing by the office
so I can drop off the car.

185
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:14,247
-What?

186
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,349
-I'm coming with you
to Inoshima, kiddo.

187
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:28,661
-Look at that.

188
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:30,930
Isn't that the best view of
Mount Fuji you've ever seen?

189
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:32,098
It looks great!

190
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:34,067
-It's only a mountain, and
you can see it anytime.

191
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,505
-Aw, don't be so grumpy.

192
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:41,407
You're not going to be very
good company with that attitude.

193
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:43,543
-Well, I never asked
you to come with me.

194
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:50,617
-Now we've got to find the
bus that takes us to Inoshima.

195
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,385
-What, you mean like
that one over there?

196
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:54,621
It says Inoshima on the front.

197
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:55,522
Hurry up!

198
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:56,990
We don't want to miss it!

199
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,158
We'd better make a run for it.

200
00:11:58,191 --> 00:11:59,492
-They'll wait for us.

201
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:01,394
Why do kids always have
to be in such a rush?

202
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,305
-Is that the ocean?

203
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:13,406
-Of course it is.

204
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,008
Don't you know
shima means island?

205
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:19,345
What do they teach you
kids in school nowadays?

206
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,947
Won't be long until we're there.

207
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,283
Once we get off, the
Shusaku Memorial Museum's

208
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:24,951
just a 15 minute walk away.

209
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:27,320
-Shusaku Memorial Museum?

210
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:28,521
-That's right.

211
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:31,124
It's on the site of the
house where Shusaku was born.

212
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:34,627
That is where you
wanted to go, isn't it?

213
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,296
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
A memorial museum?

214
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,465
Would Sai have come here?

215
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:40,533
Maybe.

216
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,168
But I bet it would just
give him the creeps.

217
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,039
-Well, here we are.

218
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:46,940
What do you think?

219
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:49,943
Aren't you excited?

220
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:51,444
-Sai, are you here?

221
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:56,282
-The actual museum's at
the back of the property.

222
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:57,283
-Hey, Sai!

223
00:12:57,317 --> 00:13:01,387
Why are you hiding from me?

224
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:03,223
He doesn't seem to be here.

225
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:04,037
Sai?

226
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:10,630
It looks like I came all the
way down here for nothing

227
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,665
after all.

228
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:14,434
-Hey, what are you
doing over there?

229
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:15,668
The museum's this way.

230
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:17,971
What were you doing,
praying or something?

231
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:24,978
-Where is he?

232
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:42,262
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
He isn't here.

233
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:43,329
-Look.

234
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:45,531
See that really ancient
go board over there?

235
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:46,132
-Huh?

236
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:53,439
So this board-- it's the one
Torajiro played on as a kid?

237
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:54,540
-Who's Torajiro?

238
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,176
-That was Shusaku-sensei's
name as a child.

239
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,414
And yes, he and his mother used
to play on that very board.

240
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:02,982
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai?

241
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,951
Sai, can you hear me?

242
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,187
Sai?

243
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:15,061
-Now, if you come
this way, you can

244
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:18,398
see where Shusaku-sensei
is buried.

245
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:22,635
-Hey, why are you always
running off on me?

246
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:23,503
Kids today.

247
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:25,638
Never walk when they can run.

248
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:27,540
He's a professional
go player, you know.

249
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:30,243
And he just became a
1-Dan earlier this year.

250
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:30,677
-Really?

251
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,145
How wonderful.

252
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:35,214
-He's always wanted to see
where Honinbo Shusaku was born,

253
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:37,483
so I thought, why not
bring him here on a trip?

254
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:38,518
And here we are.

255
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:42,488
-Sai!

256
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:43,990
Sai?

257
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,792
Where are you?

258
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:47,653
Sai?

259
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,311
Huh?

260
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,401
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): This is it.

261
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:23,096
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai.

262
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:24,630
Where have you gone?

263
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:29,669
I wish I knew what happened.

264
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:45,251
[sigh] I can't give up yet.

265
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:48,921
I have to keep looking.

266
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:50,690
[gasp]

267
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:06,372
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
It's no good.

268
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:08,141
He's definitely not here.

269
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:10,943
Where the heck
could he have gone?

270
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:17,116
I came all this way
to look for you.

271
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,650
Come on, Sai!

272
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:18,918
Please!

273
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:20,686
Why won't you answer me?

274
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,122
You can hear me, can't you?

275
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:28,428
-You spent a long time
at his grave, kiddo.

276
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:31,964
I had no idea you were
such a fan of Shusaku.

277
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:33,966
-You don't get it.

278
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,402
-It's OK, I won't tell anyone.

279
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:39,138
But I already know where
I'm going to take you next.

280
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,173
-Huh?

281
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:42,575
-The Takehara Hosenji Temple.

282
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:45,244
The lady at the museum
recommended we pay a visit.

283
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,215
She said it was one of Shusaku's
favorite places to play go.

284
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:54,253
-This is the actual
go board that Shusaku

285
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:55,455
used when he was here.

286
00:16:55,488 --> 00:16:57,523
And in here, we have the stones.

287
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:59,592
-Wow, the real thing?

288
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,994
Shouldn't this be behind
glass or something like that?

289
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:08,201
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I
remember Sai telling me

290
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:09,302
about this place.

291
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:12,371
He came here with
Torajiro a long time ago.

292
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:18,411
-Obviously, we take a great deal
of care to store them properly.

293
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,580
But we also feel it's
important for people

294
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:23,516
to see them close up so they
can connect with the past.

295
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:27,587
-You mean I'm allowed
to play a stone?

296
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,658
[laughs] Just wait until I
tell the boys at the go salon!

297
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:36,529
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai? Sai!

298
00:17:38,364 --> 00:17:40,633
I don't think he's here, either.

299
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,401
I don't understand, Sai.

300
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:45,271
Why wouldn't you want to
come back to Torajiro's home?

301
00:17:51,143 --> 00:17:51,978
-Going home?

302
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:53,246
You've gotta be kidding me!

303
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:56,115
You can't go from Tokyo to
Hiroshima and back in a day!

304
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:58,084
It's too late to travel now!

305
00:17:58,117 --> 00:17:58,551
-I don't care.

306
00:17:58,584 --> 00:17:59,952
I want to go.

307
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:01,587
I told my mom I was only
going out for a little while.

308
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:04,357
And I've got school
in the morning.

309
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,225
-Fine, but you'll be
going home on your own.

310
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,228
I'm staying to visit more
Shusaku sights tomorrow.

311
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:09,996
-What?

312
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:11,264
You mean there's more?

313
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:13,699
-The monk at the temple told
me about a couple other places

314
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,234
we can stop by.

315
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:16,602
-I want to see them!

316
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:18,337
The thing is, I
don't have the money

317
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:19,605
to stay the night in a hotel.

318
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:20,473
-How convenient.

319
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:22,008
I'll lend you the cash.

320
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:24,243
-Wait, I need to
call home first.

321
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:26,078
-Hey, the phone's this way!

322
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:49,535
-What's the matter?

323
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:52,271
You haven't even
touched your food.

324
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:55,541
We had a busy morning checking
out those other places.

325
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,209
You must be really hungry.

326
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:58,110
I know I am.

327
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:03,349
Take your time, why don't you?

328
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:04,450
I'll see you later.

329
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:05,184
-What?

330
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:06,652
Where are you going?

331
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:10,389
-Remember that sign we saw
earlier for a go salon?

332
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:12,525
I'm going to go have a game
with some of the locals.

333
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,560
I'll take care of the bill here.

334
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:17,263
You can come and find
me when you're all done.

335
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:24,036
-[sigh]

336
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,037
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai.

337
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:44,023
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I've searched

338
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:48,194
everywhere I could think
of, but I couldn't find him.

339
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:52,198
Not yesterday, not today.

340
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:56,936
If he's not here, I guess I
should head back to Tokyo.

341
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,409
I know!

342
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:04,977
Maybe he went back
to my room when

343
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:06,412
I was looking for him down here!

344
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:10,650
If he's there when
I go home, I'm

345
00:20:10,683 --> 00:20:12,551
gonna promise to bring
him back here someday.

346
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:15,421
It'd be so great to show him
around all the different places

347
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:16,122
I went to.

348
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:18,024
He'd love it!

349
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:27,500
I know Mr. Kawai wanted
to stay a bit longer,

350
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:31,003
but I'm going back to Tokyo even
if I have to drag him with me!

351
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:31,604
-Mr. Kawai?

352
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,272
Are you there?

353
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:34,173
-50,000?

354
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:35,441
-Huh?

355
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:38,678
-Don't try anything with me,
you idiot, or you'll regret it!

356
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:42,081
-You're the one who
suggested it, not me.

357
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:43,215
-Yeah, says who?

358
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:44,050
-Says me.

359
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,452
You lost, so now you pay up.

360
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:47,987
-Uh, Mr. Kawai?

361
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,994
[theme song]

362
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:23,115
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): OK,
so Mr. Kawai got himself

363
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:24,416
into a tough situation.

364
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,418
But why did I have to
end up getting involved?

365
00:22:26,452 --> 00:22:30,356
All I wanted to do was head
back home to Tokyo, not play go!

366
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,562
And this guy is no pushover.

367
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:39,632
He's representing Japan in
the next World Amateur Go

368
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:40,266
Championship.

369
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:46,472
Next time, "Hiroshima's
Top Player."
