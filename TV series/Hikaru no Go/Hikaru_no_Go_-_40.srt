ISUMI (VOICEOVER):
It's almost over.

00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,548
Don't panic.

5
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:58,385
It's going to be hard for
Shindo to make a comeback now.

6
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,554
Try to ignore them.

7
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,156
I'm playing Shindo now, so
forget about Toya and Su-Yong.

[alarm sounding]

9
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,998
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): I went for
an atari from the wrong side.

10
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:15,102
HIKARU: Sai, did he
just move his stone?

11
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,703
Changing your mind
after your fingers

12
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,439
have left the stone means you
have to forfeit the match.

13
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,596
Sai, did Isumi take his
fingers off the stone

14
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,764
before he moved it?

15
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,240
-It did look as though
that's what happened,

16
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,642
but I can't say for sure.

17
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,511
If he did move the
stone, he should

18
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,613
be disqualified immediately.

19
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,213
Hikaru?

20
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,491
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He
hasn't said anything.

21
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,662
Is it because he didn't
actually let go of the stone?

22
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,398
Or is it because--
no, he wouldn't.

23
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,674
I have to know if his hand
came off the stone or not.

24
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,343
Do you think it'd be
OK if I just ask him?

25
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,513
[gasp]

26
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,116
-You are not really going
to confront him, are you?

27
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,511
Hikaru!

28
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,988
--[sigh] Isumi's
still undefeated.

29
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:46,560
I've got one loss, and only
three of us can become pros.

30
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:51,131
-Hikaru, don't you want
to finish playing the game

31
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:55,368
and win on your own merits?

32
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,404
You do have a strategy
for a comeback.

33
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,394
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
It's not going to work.

34
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,262
I know it.

35
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,697
If we keep going, he'll beat me.

36
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,603
But if I challenge
him about that move,

37
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,371
I'm guarantee to win.

38
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,707
Isumi's been trying for
years to pass the pro exam,

39
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,075
and he hasn't done it yet.

40
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,478
That just shows how
important every win is.

41
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,446
I need to win.

42
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,654
The reason Isumi's
not saying anything

43
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,458
is because he wants to win, and
he's hoping I didn't noticed.

44
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,295
-Hikaru, just be
careful that you don't--

45
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,129
-Isu--

46
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,563
-I'm resigning.

47
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,085
[sigh]

48
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,998
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He knows
he cheated, so he resigned.

49
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,337
At least, I won the game.

50
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,705
This is a big win for me.

51
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:51,692
OCHI (VOICEOVER): Huh?

52
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:52,760
Shindo?

53
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:53,827
Is the match over already?

54
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:59,001
Huh?

55
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,204
Shindo's recording the result.

56
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,719
How did he win?

57
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,988
Isumi was in total
control of the game.

58
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:21,989
What happened?

59
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,408
[gulping]

feeling about this win?

62

WAYA (VOICEOVER):
Isumi, you're not

63
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,491
playing anywhere near
as good as usual.

64
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,002
So you lost to Shindo yesterday.

65
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:43,871
You shouldn't let it
get to you like this.

66
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,839
You haven't said a word to me.

67
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:46,974
That's not like you, Isumi.

68
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:54,848
Sure.

69
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:56,617
It must have been a tough loss,
but you've got to get over it.

70
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:09,930
If you let it
affect you this bad,

71
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:11,565
you're going to
ruin your chances.

72
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,570
No one here is easy to
beat, especially me.

73
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:31,752
-I resign.

74
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,090
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Yes!

75
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:38,725
This year I might
make it through.

76
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:47,701
What's gotten into him?

77
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:48,936
I can't worry about it.

78
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:52,506
I've got to focus on my
next match against Ochi.

79
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,684
-Hm.

80
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:05,085
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
What's going on?

81
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:06,954
I'm not playing good at all.

82
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:09,022
I shouldn't have a
problem beating Fuku.

83
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:14,761
But after I took that
win from Isumi yesterday,

84
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:17,431
I can't get the thought of
that match out of my mind.

85
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,099
It shouldn't have
ended that way.

86
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,533
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI (VOICEOVER): I
was afraid this might happen.

87
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:56,069
Yesterday's victory has left
a bitter taste in his mouth.

88
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:57,804
He's fallen too far behind.

89
00:09:57,838 --> 00:10:02,643
He should concede the match,
but he's determined to play on.

90
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,827
HIKARU: I lost by nine
and a half points.

91
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:23,769
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI
(VOICEOVER): Hikaru.

92
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,987
-The reason I lost my match
today was all because of Isumi.

93
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,122
How could he do that to me?

94
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:42,124
He completely ruined
my concentration.

95
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:43,492
He ruined everything.

96
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:44,126
-Hikaru.

97
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:44,581
Hikaru.

98
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:48,730
-I had given up.

99
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,232
I could have won.

100
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,234
I knew it was only
a slim chance,

101
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:54,603
but I had a plan for a comeback.

102
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:56,605
I could have done it.

103
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:12,053
When I saw him move the stone,
I knew I had a chance to win,

104
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:13,221
and I jumped at it.

105
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:14,990
I wanted to win
whatever the cost.

106
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,261
But that was the easy way out.

107
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:23,231
I was weak, so I tried
to win by default

108
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,366
instead of playing the game.

109
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:29,471
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: Hikaru.

110
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:48,456
-Huh.

111
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,360
-Hikaru, we could always
finish the game now.

112
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,463
I can take Isumi's place
and play as he would play.

113
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:57,966
You can find out if you'd
have won with your comeback.

114
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,267
Move on with a clear conscience.

115
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:06,107
-I want to be able to
trust in my own ability.

116
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,243
I want to be strong.

117
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:09,644
I'm never going to
play another match

118
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:13,715
like the ones I played
yesterday or today ever again.

119
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:17,485
-Hikaru, you know something,
that sort of resolve

120
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:19,721
is worth losing a game
or two along the way.

121
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:28,396
So are you ready to begin?

122
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:28,997
-Mhm.

123
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:39,741
[train whistle]

124
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,485
OCHI (VOICEOVER): Today,
my opponent is Waya.

125
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:53,488
I have to play my
best against him.

126
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:56,024
He's probably my biggest threat
to getting through the exam

127
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,192
undefeated.

128
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:59,628
I used to be worried about
Isumi, but not anymore.

129
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:06,101
Not since, he lost both of his
games against Shindo and Waya.

130
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,637
But I still can't work
out how Shindo beat him

131
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,505
unless Isumi made
some sort of mistake.

132
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:15,744
But he doesn't normally
make those kinds of errors.

133
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:17,412
There must be
something on his mind.

134
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:38,733
You lost your nerve
against Shindo, huh?

135
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:46,574
Remember, on the day you
played the game against Shindo,

136
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:49,477
I was telling you
about Akira Toya.

137
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,513
I wonder if you were
thinking about that,

138
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:54,249
so you lost your concentration
and made a mistake.

139
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,116
Is that it?

140
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,088
Are you not going to tell me,
because you don't want anyone

141
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:02,724
to know what really happened
in your game with Shindo?

142
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:07,962
Well?

143
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:08,496
Am I right?

144
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:13,702
Come on.

145
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:16,571
Just answer the question.

146
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:17,305
-Hey, Isumi.

147
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:25,213
Hm.

148
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:29,951
Ochi, what were you guys
talking about just now?

149
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:33,054
I hope you weren't asking him
about his match with Shindo.

150
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:37,625
He hasn't even told me
anything, so there's

151
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,194
no way he'd talk to you.

152
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:45,166
I've got no idea
how or why he lost,

153
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,471
but he needs to get that match
out of his system and move on.

154
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,406
I wish he'd talk about it.

155
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,074
I can't figure him out at all.

156
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,646
-He made a mistake.

157
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,615
That's all.

158
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:03,084
When I saw their game,
Isumi was in control,

159
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:04,619
and I was sure he
was going to win.

160
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:06,321
So I went to watch
your match instead.

161
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:11,459
And when I looked back
after that, it was all over.

162
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,228
There's no way the
game could have turned

163
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:15,997
that quickly unless
Isumi made a big mistake.

164
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,633
-A mistake?

165
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,734
-I don't know exactly.

166
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:22,203
But the point is, Isumi
couldn't deal with it,

167
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:23,972
and it affected his
game against you.

168
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:26,207
Whatever happened in that
game also affected Shindo,

169
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:28,410
because he went on
to lose against Fuku.

170
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:30,412
Unless we've been
overrating them both.

171
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:33,615
-Yeah, maybe.

172
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:39,487
Well, it's starting
to look like you're

173
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,056
going to have no problem
passing the pro exam.

174
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,124
-Yeah, I know.

175
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:45,360
Nobody's going to
beat me, not even you.

176
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,966
-Morning, guys.

177
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:52,508
-Hey.

178
00:15:58,006 --> 00:16:00,074
GO OFFICIAL (ON LOUDSPEAKER):
Ladies and gentlemen,

179
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,276
it's time to begin.

180
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:03,411
Everyone please make their
way to the match room.

181
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,285
-Look at him.

182
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:12,253
Do you think he's still
depressed about what happened?

183
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:19,093
How could he have made
a mistake like that?

184
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:22,530
Something must have
distracted him.

185
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,631
-Hikaru.

186
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:25,099
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Yeah, I know.

187
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:28,503
I've got to stop
thinking about it.

188
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:31,005
-That's right.

189
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,240
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I'll be OK.

190
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,575
I've got everything
under control.

191
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:40,648
GO OFFICIAL: When you're
ready, please begin.

192
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:41,649
-(GROUP) Onegaishimasu.

193
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:01,636
I stayed calm and everything
went right in today's game.

194
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:06,474
Now, let's see.

195
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:08,009
How did Isumi do?

196
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:10,378
Oh.

197
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:11,513
-Are you done yet?

198
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:12,514
I need to stamp mine.

199
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:13,448
-Ochi.

200
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:16,084
Oh, so you beat Waya.

201
00:17:21,556 --> 00:17:22,123
-Hm.

202
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:31,733
-Are you OK?

203
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:38,239
-I don't think I
played a bad game.

204
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:41,109
Things were looking good
for me on the left side,

205
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:43,478
but then he got me
on the defensive.

206
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:45,346
Started jumping
around the board.

207
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,515
The game was really close.

208
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:49,551
I ended up losing by
two and a half points.

209
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:58,026
What about you?

210
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,328
-I won.

211
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,196
Waya, I'm worried about Isumi.

212
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,298
He lost again today.

213
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:07,569
He was playing Fuku.

214
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:08,536
[gasp]

215
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,486
OCHI'S GRANDFATHER: I
guess that's it then.

216
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:29,090
You had me fooled for the
longest time in this area.

217
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:31,192
Oh dear, oh dear,
it looks like I'm

218
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:34,362
going to have to add another
stone to my handicap.

219
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:36,497
Are you sure you want to
be playing someone like me

220
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:38,232
in the middle of your pro exams?

221
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:40,001
Shouldn't you be
playing someone better?

222
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,235
-Uh-uh.

223
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:42,070
I don't mind.

224
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:43,438
It's a nice change of pace.

225
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:44,372
-Hm.

226
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:48,343
Did you see the Go Weekly?

227
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:50,445
Toya 2-dan won his
game in the first round

228
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:53,381
of the Meijin
Tournament prelims.

229
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:54,983
OCHI: So?

230
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:56,951
-He also won his match
in the second round

231
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:58,219
of the Honinbo Tournament.

232
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:01,623
He hasn't lost a single game
since his debut as a pro.

233
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:05,393
That's an impressive
record, huh?

234
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:06,494
Don't forget.

235
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,096
He's been kind enough
to offer you the chance

236
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:10,531
to play with him as often
as his schedule permits.

237
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,367
I think you should
take him up on it.

238
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:19,107
-I don't need Toya.

239
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,709
I beat Waya, and I've
already beaten Honda.

240
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:26,014
I'm going to pass
the exam undefeated.

241
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:27,649
-Pass the exam undefeated?

242
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:30,318
[laughs] Sounds promising.

243
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:32,286
But don't get too
over confident.

244
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,255
You haven't played
that Isumi boy yet.

245
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:36,457
I think you said that
out of all the players

246
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:37,625
he was your main rival.

247
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:42,230
-I'm really not
worried about him now.

248
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,304
I'm going to make it through
this exam undefeated.

249
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:51,673
That's going to
boost my confidence

250
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,374
when I become a pro for sure.

251
00:19:57,745 --> 00:20:00,048
Isumi's playing so bad
he's not a threat anymore,

252
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:02,684
and beating Shindo
should be easy enough.

253
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:05,653
I got nothing to worry about.

254
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:08,523
[laughing] I'm not going
to need Toya's help.

255
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:19,033
I hear you even lost
to Fuku yesterday.

256
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,335
Too bad.

257
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:23,738
I was kind of disappointed.

258
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:26,174
You were my biggest hurdle
to getting through this exam

259
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:28,242
undefeated, but not anymore.

260
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:30,978
You haven't even recovered
from that game against Shindo,

261
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:32,313
have you?

262
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:35,583
I don't know why I ever thought
of you as a serious threat.

263
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:38,419
My goal of staying undefeated
is much easier now.

264
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:39,220
Thanks to you.

265
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:40,354
ISUMI: Ochi.

266
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:43,191
-Huh?

267
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:46,427
-Shut your mouth.

268
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:48,329
GO OFFICIAL: When you're
ready, please begin.

269

274
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:23,224
HIKARU: What a showdown
between Ochi and Isumi.

275
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:24,458
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: Ah.

276
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:27,628
It's nice to see Isumi back
to his normal self again.

277
00:22:27,662 --> 00:22:29,397
You should pay
attention, Hikaru,

278
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,633
because your final match
will be against Ochi.

279
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:34,068
HIKARU: I can't wait.

280
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:36,070
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI: Three
weeks left of the finals,

281
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:39,707
and there's still
everything left to play for.

282
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,378
HIKARU: Next time, "Three
Weeks Isn't Enough."

283
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:46,113
FUJIWARA-NO-SAI:
Watch out, Hikaru.

284
00:22:46,113 --> 00:22:48,749
Ochi's getting some
extra coaching.
