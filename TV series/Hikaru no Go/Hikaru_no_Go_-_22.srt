00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:07,481
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:10,621
a spirit from the past
known as Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,654 --> 00:00:13,727
has returned, visible
only to Hikaru Shindou.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,270
A master of Go, Sai seeks
to play the Divine Move.

5
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:21,276
[theme music]

6
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:48,749
-Oh.

7
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:51,087
They're doing the
Insei exams today, huh?

8
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,222
-Yep.

9
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:53,491
-Is there someone in
their doing the exam now?

10
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:54,761
-Yeah, some guy.

11
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:56,764
I don't know who he is, but
he looks younger than me.

12
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:04,113
I don't know why, but I have
a feeling he's going to pass.

13
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:05,248
-Onegai shimasu.

14
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:05,782
-Onegai shimasu.

15
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:56,416
SAI (VOICEOVER): Hikaru.

16
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:11,178
Oh no!

17
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:13,917
Surely he's not going
to put a stone there.

18
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,589
He should've never made
that last attachment.

19
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:19,762
He's already lost the advantage
of his three stone handicap.

20
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,206
Hikaru must realize this.

21
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,210
That's why he's
beginning to panic.

22
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:29,682
He's trying too hard.

23
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:31,953
He's no match for such
a seasoned opponent.

24
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:40,770
HIkaru.

25
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,674
If you continue like this,
you're going to lose.

26
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:45,613
If you want, I can
help you win this game.

27
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:48,452
Just this one time,
allow me to-- Hikaru!

28
00:03:59,274 --> 00:03:59,723
Hikaru?

29
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,494
He doesn't even hear me.

30
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:11,531
He has such great concentration.

31
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:14,704
It's a shame he doesn't have
the technical skill to match.

32
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:15,639
At least not yet.

33
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:21,685
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): It's no use.

34
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:22,754
I can't win.

35
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:28,966
If I go too deep, this
guy's gonna destroy me.

36
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:31,237
But if I don't do
something soon,

37
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,474
he'll keep getting
farther away from me.

38
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:39,353
Toya.

39
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:46,734
Toya.

40
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:47,702
-Come now.

41
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:48,571
It's OK.

42
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:50,341
-Ah?

43
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,710
-I don't know why
you're so tense.

44
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:52,946
Relax.

45
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,952
Even if you lose this game,
you may still be accepted.

46
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:57,756
I'm merely assessing
your strength.

47
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:03,568
-What?

48
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,372
Aw man, you could've told
me that at the start!

49
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,809
-Don't speak to me like that!

50
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:08,911
-Hikaru.

51
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,915
I Think you should be
more polite to this man.

52
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:11,617
-Right.

53
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,652
I'm sorry, sensei.

54
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,461
-What is it you're doing,
lying there like that?

55
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:18,563
-I'm sorry, it's my leg!

56
00:05:18,563 --> 00:05:19,833
It I fell asleep.

57
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,536
I can't feel it!

58
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:22,771
I can't move it!

59
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:25,077
-If you need to shift your
legs into a more comfortable

60
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,348
position during a game,
all you need to say

61
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:30,989
is excuse me to your
opponent and then do it.

62
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:35,430
-Why didn't you say
so before we started?

63
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:37,801
[excited chatter]

64
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:40,307
-That's awesome.

65
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,014
[groan]

66
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:45,317
-What's up?

67
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:47,321
Don't tell me that you
went and lost again.

68
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:48,456
-Yeah.

69
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:50,594
That's the third time in
a row Fukui's beaten me.

70
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,437
-That's 'cause I'm
better than you, Waya!

71
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,973
-I'm just as good
as he is, but it's

72
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,610
like I'm jinxed or something.

73
00:05:58,643 --> 00:05:59,612
-There's no jinx.

74
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:01,481
You just need to
believe you can do it.

75
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:04,655
-I guess Toya's also
got a jinx on you.

76
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,594
-Nobody can beat Toya, so
stop being such an idiot.

77
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:15,810
-All right.

78
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:17,080
I think that's about enough.

79
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:19,017
Let's stop here.

80
00:06:19,017 --> 00:06:23,892
-Wha-- It would've been
better to pull back here.

81
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,865
That way, white would
have been in trouble.

82
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:27,834
And here.

83
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:30,840
This is a difficult
shape for black.

84
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:31,908
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): So?

85
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:32,910
What's the deal?

86
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:34,948
Did I pass?

87
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:35,950
Did I make it though?

88
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:44,366
-Hm.

89
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:46,370
To be honest, he's not
that strong of a player,

90
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:48,408
but on the other
hand his application

91
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,646
said he's only been
playing Go for a year.

92
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,654
It reminds me of the incredible
progress made by Kurata 5-dan.

93
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:56,792
Although he turned
professional after two years,

94
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,831
he'd been studying with the
pros soon after he started.

95
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:03,671
But this boy's only been
playing in a school Go club.

96
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:05,742
If he's become this good
with so little training,

97
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,746
he may have incredible
natural talent.

98
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:12,622
Tell me.

99
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:15,061
Is it true that no one
has been teaching you?

100
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,766
-Uh, well, no sir.

101
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,772
Actually, I do have a teacher,
and he follows me around

102
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:21,841
like a dog.

103
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:22,676
-What?

104
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,611
Did you just call me a dog?

105
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,949
Thanks a lot!

106
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,888
-Hm.

107
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:33,063
Now, about these
three games of yours.

108
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:36,570
Your moves seem to be haphazard
without much planning involved.

109
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:38,508
Oh, I see, you played
them on the same day.

110
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,712
-Not only that, but
I played 'em-- uh,

111
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:42,047
played them at the same time.

112
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:43,951
I've never played three
games at once before.

113
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:45,722
It was really tough.

114
00:07:45,722 --> 00:07:46,657
-Huh?

115
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,893
You mean that-- Guh!

116
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,539
Three games played
simultaneously?

117
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:56,743
His first time playing
simultaneous games

118
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,950
and he did this well?

119
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:00,885
-Very good.

120
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,822
You can join us
as of next month.

121
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:05,060
You can call your mother in now.

122
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:05,928
HIKARU: All right!

123
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:06,663
SAI: All right!

124
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:07,965
You did it, Hikaru!

125
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:08,600
HIKARU: Yeah!

126
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,581
-This is the main room.

127
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:18,720
It looks like most of the
games are finishing up.

128
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:19,255
-I see.

129
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,799
-What if you had done
an exchange here?

130
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:26,469
-Yeah, might've worked.

131
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,807
-Mark my score down, would you?

132
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,644
-Matsura's won four in a row.

133
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,615
MITSUKO (VOICEOVER):
Some of the kids here are

134
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:34,251
younger than Hikaru.

135
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:37,156
No wonder he passed
entrance exam.

136
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:38,793
-Over here we have
the match schedule,

137
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:39,829
if you'd like to see it.

138
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:41,064
-Yes, of course.

139
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:42,935
-Oh.

140
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:45,807
Hikaru, let's go and see
what's happening over there.

141
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:46,675
-What's going on?

142
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,243
-OK, then.

143
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,014
What if I played here?

144
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:51,285
-That'd put black
in a bad position.

145
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:53,589
-How about if I attached here?

146
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:55,092
-I might back off.

147
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:55,927
-Yeah right.

148
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:56,795
You're just being chicken.

149
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:02,640
Oh.

150
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,212
So, did you pass?

151
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:06,815
-Huh?

152
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:08,184
-Mhmm.

153
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:11,090
-Did you come here to take
the Insei entrance test?

154
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:13,127
Any idea who this guy is, Waya?

155
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:15,666
-No, but I saw him
outside in the hall.

156
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,173
I overheard him say he
was gonna beat Akira Toya.

157
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:22,747
BOY: I said the same thing
when I started going here.

158
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,684
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
What's wrong with that?

159
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:27,322
WAYA: I played against him
twice during the pro test.

160
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:30,095
I didn't like him one bit.

161
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:31,932
-So you've played
against him before?

162
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:32,934
-Yeah, it's no big deal.

163
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:33,769
What about you?

164
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:34,871
Have you played him?

165
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:36,741
-Yeah, I played him in
a Go club tournament.

166
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,680
He was a member of a team
from Kaio Middle School.

167
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,817
-Akira Toya in a Go club?

168
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:43,154
No way.

169
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,991
-I remember hearing
Kuwabara-sensei

170
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,029
and Ishio-sensei discussing it.

171
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:48,031
They went on and on.

172
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:49,833
They couldn't stop
laughing about it.

173
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,971
The idea of Meijin's
son joining a Go club

174
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:54,143
and playing at a middle
school tournament.

175
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,111
-So, it's true.

176
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:56,079
I don't believe it.

177
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,751
-What are you guys
talking about?

178
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:00,722
-The final match between
the team captains

179
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:02,191
must've been amazing.

180
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:05,097
Imagine, a future Insei
against Akira Toya.

181
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,865
-Mm-mm.

182
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:06,734
We both played third.

183
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,170
-You both played what?

184
00:10:08,203 --> 00:10:10,007
-Back then, I didn't
have enough experience

185
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,777
to play as the team captain.

186
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,648
-Maybe you weren't good
enough, but there's

187
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,852
no way Toya would ever
play that position.

188
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:17,188
He's far too good for that.

189
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:19,727
-He wanted to play against
me, so he forced them

190
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:22,198
into letting him play third.

191
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,701
-No way.

192
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:24,803
-Forced them?

193
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:26,072
-That's the kind of guy he is.

194
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:28,276
The only reason he joined the
Go club in the first place

195
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:30,748
was so that he could get a
chance to play against me.

196
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:33,053
-No, Hikaru!

197
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:37,628
[gasping]

198
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,607
-Hikaru, it's time to go.

199
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:44,942
He doesn't start
until next month,

200
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,312
and already he's
made some friends.

201
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:50,086
I hope you'll take
good care of him.

202
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,088
-Is that true?

203
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:52,023
-Did he just say--

204
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:52,658
-No way.

205
00:10:57,668 --> 00:10:58,169
-Oh, no.

206
00:10:58,202 --> 00:10:59,405
Why'd I say all that?

207
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:08,657
BOY: Akira Toya is what?

208
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,627
BOY: Apparently his rival.

209
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:11,796
BOY: Rival?

210
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,363
BOY: Hey, guys.

211
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:13,767
What's up?

212
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,236
You know the new
kid's starting today?

213
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:17,006
Word is, he's a
really strong player.

214
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,812
Akira Toya is supposed to have
entered a Go club tournament

215
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,116
just so he could
play against him.

216
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,185
BOY: Wow.

217
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:24,788
-And you want to
know something else?

218
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:25,312
He--

219
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:32,871
-Hey, there.

220
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:33,772
How you doing?

221
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:41,255
-Hm?

222
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:41,955
-Hi.

223
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:44,661
Good morning?

224
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:48,335
Sai, why is everyone
staring at me?

225
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:52,009
SAI: They believe a powerful
new opponent has emerged.

226
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:55,282
It's all because of what
you told them about Akira.

227
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,987
-How could I have been so dumb?

228
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:00,325
-Hey, did you hear about the
new guy who's starting today?

229
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:01,360
-Yeah.

230
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,396
-You know, Waya and
the others, like,

231
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,233
haven't stopped
talking about him.

232
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:07,439
-Rumor is that Akira
Toya is his rival.

233
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:09,376
He's only in middle school.

234
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,115
-I think that's the guy I've got
to play my first match against.

235
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,119
Do you think he's really
going to be that good?

236
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,096
-(VOICEOVER) Hm.

237
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:22,135
Bet they were talking
about me behind my back.

238
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:23,905
Anyone here called Uchida?

239
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:24,373
-Yeah.

240
00:12:24,373 --> 00:12:27,412
That's me.

241
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,917
This is our board here.

242
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,320
-(VOICEOVER) A girl?

243
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:34,259
My match schedule's only got
people's last names on it.

244
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,743
She's ranked 5th in the
B league, and I'm 25th.

245
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:47,284
Guess I have to start at the
bottom and work my way up.

246
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:47,886
Huh?

247
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:54,065
Is everyone here
playing in the B league?

248
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:55,969
Where are the A league players?

249
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:57,038
-Everyone's here.

250
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,941
The people in the A
league are over there.

251
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:13,470
-You'll have to improve before
you move up to the A league.

252
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:15,240
-I guess so.

253
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:17,845
-Those of us in the B league
not good enough for you?

254
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:18,447
-Sorry.

255
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,882
I didn't mean it like that.

256
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:00,796
(VOICEOVER) It's not that I
don't care about the B league,

257
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:03,402
but Akira is way better than
those kids in the A league,

258
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:05,072
and they're the
best players here.

259
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,345
But I did it.

260
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,583
I passed the Insei exam.

261
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,021
I'm not the same
player I was before.

262
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:27,082
[sigh]

263
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,919
-I resign.

264
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:29,821
-That was a good game.

265
00:14:29,854 --> 00:14:31,090
Thanks.

266
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,560
-I read that game all wrong!

267
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:33,529
I threw it away.

268
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:34,965
I was a total idiot.

269
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:35,439
-Yeah.

270
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:36,602
You were.

271
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,908
I wonder how the new guy's
game is going over there?

272
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,512
-These stones have no eyes.

273
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:44,516
It would have been
better to cut here.

274
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,287
Then you could have
gone after this area.

275
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:54,370
This mistake is what
cost black the game.

276
00:14:54,403 --> 00:14:56,407
-(VOICEOVER) Looks like he lost.

277
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:57,476
-How'd it go?

278
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:58,878
-Uchida won the game.

279
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:11,002
-Thank you.

280
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:11,445
I resign.

281
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:14,584
-Huh?

282
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:22,158
-(VOICEOVER) He's supposed
to be Akira Toya's rival?

283
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:24,563
-It was a waste of time
for you to play here.

284
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:26,299
-Yeah, I guess so.

285
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,503
-OK, this is what happened
in the game, right?

286
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:31,376
What if you played here instead?

287
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:33,680
-Yeah, but that wouldn't
have stopped him from losing.

288
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:36,887
Even if he'd done this,
it wouldn't have worked.

289
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,290
-You had nowhere to go.

290
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:42,966
-Two losses in a row.

291
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:45,270
It's not looking good.

292
00:15:45,304 --> 00:15:46,673
-If he carries on
playing like that,

293
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,343
we'll have nothing
to be afraid of.

294
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:49,645
-Do you think he
could be nervous

295
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,916
because this is
his first day here?

296
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,186
-Hm.

297
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,058
Are you saying we should
keep a close eye on him?

298
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,272
Hey, Waya, what do you
say we go get some lunch?

299
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:03,755
-Sure.

300
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:08,717
-Hey, man.

301
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,052
What are you doing for lunch?

302
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:10,687
-Huh?

303
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:11,589
I don't know.

304
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:12,691
I need to go buy something.

305
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:15,964
CLERK: Thanks!

306
00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:16,933
Have a nice day.

307
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:22,477
-So, how do you know Akira Toya?

308
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,648
-Did you two go to the
same elementary school,

309
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,084
or something?

310
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,720
-Naw.

311
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,560
-You said you played against
him in a Go club tournament.

312
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:32,597
Why would someone like
him join a Go club?

313
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:39,010
It doesn't make
sense that he'd do

314
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:40,546
all that just to
play against you.

315
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,650
From what I've seen, you're
not that good a player.

316
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:44,053
I don't understand.

317
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,090
You sure you're his rival?

318
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:47,260
-Of course I am!

319
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:48,529
I'm his rival, and he's mine.

320
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:50,131
Why would I make that up?

321
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:52,437
-But he's way better than you.

322
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,106
-I'll catch up to him someday.

323
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:55,108
You'll see.

324
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:58,047
-Why would he even
consider you his rival?

325
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,216
-Huh?

326
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,755
Well, I guess 'cause he's
looking at my potential

327
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,157
as a Go player.

328
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,496
He can see my natural ability.

329
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,397
Hmph.

330
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:09,236
-He can see your
natural ability?

331
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,539
-Oh.

332
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:14,079
-That sounded very good, Hikaru.

333
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:16,517
But unfortunately,
it's not true, is it?

334
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:17,553
-It doesn't matter.

335
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:19,456
I'm gonna make it come true.

336
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:27,588
Hm?

337
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:33,151
What's up?

338
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:36,490
Something else you
want to ask me?

339
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:39,763
-What happened when you played
against the team from Kaio?

340
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:41,467
-We lost all three games.

341
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,072
Even without Toya on the
team, they would've beaten us.

342
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,711
Kaio's got go many good
players to choose from.

343
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:51,019
-I know the Kaio Go club's
got a reputation, but--

344
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:53,524
-Kaio's team captain is
a totally awesome player.

345
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:55,394
we had a match later
on at a Go salon,

346
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:56,797
and I didn't stand a chance.

347
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:59,570
-Maybe it's got less to
do with him being good,

348
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:03,276
and more to do with you
being a lousy player.

349
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,278
-Aw!

350
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:06,449
I went and pressed
the wrong button!

351
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:07,451
-Hm?

352
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:08,520
-No fair!

353
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:11,326
I wanted tea, and I
ended up with coffee!

354
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,296
Here, you have it, Isumi!

355
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,200
Wah!

356
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:16,102
-Hey, wait!

357
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,075
I don't drink black coffee.

358
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:21,613
I need a ton of cream,
and at least six sugars

359
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:23,383
before I can drink this stuff.

360
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:24,585
Hey man, you want it?

361
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,222
-Nope.

362
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:29,529
-Maybe I'll see if one of the
instructors would like it.

363
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:32,735
-Hey, talking about that coffee
reminds me, remember that kid?

364
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:35,206
The one who always
drank black coffee?

365
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:36,743
And he was only
in seventh grade.

366
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:37,578
-Yeah, I think so.

367
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:40,149
Uh, what was his name, again?

368
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:43,724
-What sort of drink is
black coffee, Hikaru?

369
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:45,561
-It's really bitter.

370
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:48,132
You know, I've never heard of
a kid drinking his coffee black

371
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:49,101
before.

372
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:50,503
Tell me, is he a good player?

373
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:51,806
-You gotta be kidding me.

374
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,611
He stuck around for about
a year, and then he quit.

375
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:56,850
-He never got above
the B league, right?

376
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,654
-Actually, he did make it up
to the A league, but just once.

377
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,358
That's where I got to play him.

378
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:02,293
-Oh, yeah.

379
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:03,830
I played a game
against him, too.

380
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:05,500
And he wasn't that good.

381
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,270
-I beat him no problem.

382
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:09,374
-I didn't realize you two
have been in the A league

383
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:11,445
for as long as that.

384
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:14,117
-To be honest, it's not
really anything to brag about.

385
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:17,357
-Do you think we're ever going
to pass that stupid pro test?

386
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,294
Waya?

387
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:21,665
-What do you think happened
to the coffee guy, anyways?

388
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:25,439
Do you think he's still
playing go somewhere out there?

389
00:19:25,473 --> 00:19:26,441
-He was real smart.

390
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:27,710
A bit of a geek.

391
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:28,712
Let's see.

392
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:30,516
I think he went to Kaio.

393
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,389
I wish I could
remember his name.

394
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,526
He was really
tall, wore glasses.

395
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:37,797
He'd be in ninth grade now.

396
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:38,666
Got it!

397
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:40,235
It was Kishimoto!

398
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:41,170
Yeah, that's it.

399
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:45,813
Back then, he was
kind of a weirdo.

400
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:47,382
-He never looked
like he belonged.

401
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,551
Remember those goofy glasses?

402
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:49,486
-He was awful.

403
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,655
I thrashed him at Go.

404
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,190
-Really?

405
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:51,892
Whatever.

406
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:52,794
He didn't look like he was--

407
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:54,196
-Yes, do you remember that guy?

408
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,931
-I remember that guy.

409
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:55,699
He was so goofy.

410
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:56,701
-Man!

411
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:57,703
He stunk.

412
00:19:57,703 --> 00:20:01,244
He even stunk at Go.

413
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:04,550
-I remember that guy.

414
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,854
-He was terrible!

415
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:07,856
-Kay, gotta go.

416
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,458
Coming?

417
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,311
-Yeah, right.

418
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:18,793
Hm?

419
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:23,855
Oh, by the way.

420
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,835
The captain of the Go club at
Kaio you were talking about,

421
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:27,703
what was his name?

422
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:31,907
Hey, you!

423
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:40,249
Kaio's Captain Kishimoto was
in the B league the whole time?

424
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:41,617
If he couldn't get
higher than that,

425
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,152
how will I ever make
it into the A league?

426
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:52,527
[theme music]

427
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:21,883
HIKARU: I never knew being
an Insei would be so tough.

428
00:22:22,117 --> 00:22:24,186
SAI: Well, this is the
path you've chosen.

429
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,121
You must stick with it.

430
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:30,425
HIKARU: But I've lost six
games in a row already.

431
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:35,263
SAI: Which means your comeback
will be even more impressive!

432
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:38,300
HIKARU: Next time,
The Championship Room.

433
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,801
SAI: Akira is going
to be surprised

434
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:42,404
when he sees you here.
