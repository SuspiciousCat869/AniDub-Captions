[theme music]

2
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,046
-What's the matter, Sai?

3
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,314
SAI: Your move here.

4
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:57,517
It looks like the kind
of move I would make.

5
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,086
-Really, you think so?

6
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,687
I tried to imagine
where you'd play,

7
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,658
and that's what I came up with.

8
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,028
When I play Waya, it's
gonna be a tougher

9
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,098
match than the one against Ochi.

10
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,532
Ochi's already passed
the exam, so he

11
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,134
won't be as desperate
to win as Waya.

12
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:20,741
I'm starting to feel kind
of nervous about this game.

13
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,976
WAYA (VOICEOVER): This is
gonna decide the match.

14
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,412
If I can turn this
shape into my territory,

15
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,315
he's gonna lose for sure.

16
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,651
If his stone stays
there, he'll win!

17
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,712
-You can do it.

18
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,314
You'll be joining the pros.

19
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,683
WAYA (VOICEOVER):
I'm almost there,

20
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:06,353
as long as I don't rush
and make any mistakes.

21
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,721
I'm gonna make it, Sensei.

22
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,132
SAI (VOICEOVER): Hikaru.

23
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,072
WAYA (VOICEOVER):
Come on, Shindou.

24
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,375
You don't need that
much time to think.

25
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:34,147
-I, uh-- I resign.

26
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,166
WAYA (VOICEOVER): I guess
that means Honda's out.

27
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,211
I knew his chances of
passing were pretty slim,

28
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,545
but now there's no way.

29
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,074
-Huh?

30
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:53,660
-I'm sorry.

31
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,996
I think I'm gonna walk.

32
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:00,433
-OK, if that's what you want.

33
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,736
I've got a feeling some fresh
air might do you some good.

34
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,473
-Cheer up!

35
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,241
You can always try
again next year!

36
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,325
[bawling]

37
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,644
WAYA (VOICEOVER): Just
three of us left now.

38
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,246
Me, Isumi, and Shindou.

39
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,354
We're all fighting for
the two remaining places,

40
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,691
and one of them's gonna be mine.

41
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:02,996
Honda's out of the picture, so
if I win this one, I'm through!

42
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,130
I'm gonna be a pro!

43
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,073
-Hm.

44
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,408
WAYA (VOICEOVER): What's
taking so long, Shindou?

45
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,377
Just make your move.

46
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,379
It doesn't matter where
you go, because you're

47
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,716
gonna lose anyway.

48
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,185
SAI (VOICEOVER): There's
one way and one way only

49
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,521
for black to survive, but
it's a difficult move to see.

50
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,325
-Hm.

51
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:40,312
I can't see a way out of this.

52
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:48,320
But-- But if I was
Sai, if it was him

53
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:52,724
playing, not me, with all
this space on the board,

54
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:56,828
he'd find a way to make
the black stones survive.

55
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:57,896
Where would he move?

56
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:01,433
OK.

57
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,034
Imagine he'd been
playing this game,

58
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:07,672
and then imagine that I'm
playing in Waya's place,

59
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:13,545
and that I'm making the
same moves as he would.

60
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:15,947
If I was Waya, what
plan would I use

61
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:17,549
to try and kill off
the black stones.

62
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,354
Is there any way those
stones can survive?

63
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:26,658
There's just no way.

64
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:30,562
That's what I'd be thinking.

65
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:31,663
The game would be over.

66
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:33,598
Black would be finished.

67
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:37,035
But then, just when things
were looking hopeless,

68
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:38,637
I'd look up at Sai.

69
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,510
And then he'd-- He would--

70
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:57,689
WAYA (VOICEOVER): I
figured he might do that,

71
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:59,824
but it's useless for
him to keep going.

72
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:37,962
Why didn't I see that?

73
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:12,297
How could I have missed it?

74
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:14,699
Can he come back from here?

75
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:15,367
No!

76
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,900
It's impossible!

77
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:21,840
SAI (VOICEOVER): He found it.

78
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,342
It took him time,
but he found the way

79
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:26,711
to turn the board
to his advantage.

80
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:30,682
Now if he can just
keep his concentration,

81
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:32,450
he has chance of winning.

82
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:04,649
At last.

83
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:09,421
Hikaru has found the way,
the narrow and winding path

84
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:09,954
to victory.

85
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:14,826
WAYA (VOICEOVER): He can
make an eye in the center.

86
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:20,298
But I can't just
ignore my own group!

87
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:26,704
He's got me trapped either way.

88
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,412
I can't kill them off now.

89
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:36,815
Those black stones I thought
were dead are back in the game!

90
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:45,857
-Now listen, you're
going to pass.

91
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,326
Let me say it one more time.

92
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:50,295
You're going to pass.

93
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:52,931
You gotta be confident, Waya.

94
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:55,467
If you do that,
you'll join the pros.

95
00:10:57,969 --> 00:10:58,570
WAYA: Sensei!

96
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:47,785
-I resign.

97
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:48,386
-But--

98
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:55,960
SAI (VOICEOVER): It
was a great match.

99
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,598
Hikaru has proven he's
the better player.

100
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:04,502
-Thank you very
much for the game.

101
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:05,370
-Yeah.

102
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:06,070
Thanks for the game, Shindou.

103
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:22,875
-Sai.

104
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,795
-Huh?

105
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,527
-Sai.

106
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,930
That was the name of the
player on the internet.

107
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:32,630
He was awesome.

108
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:38,736
You remember the first
time I played you?

109
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,738
I told you something.

110
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:42,674
I said I thought
you could someday

111
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:45,043
become as strong
a player as Sai.

112
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:46,411
-Mm-hm.

113
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:49,314
Yeah, I remember.

114
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:51,349
-Well, today you did it.

115
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:52,750
You played as well as Sai.

116
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,461
-Thanks, Waya.

117
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:11,703
SAI (VOICEOVER): He's right.

118
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:14,706
Hikaru has taken his game
to a whole new level.

119
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,845
[sigh]

120
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,783
-OK!

121
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:26,818
Last opponent is Ochi.

122
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:35,300
-So, aren't you going to
tell me how it went today?

123
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:40,872
-If you're really
interested, I won.

124
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,140
-Congratulations.

125
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:45,610
That means you'll pass the
test with the best game record.

126
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:47,212
-You couldn't care less.

127
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,381
-Hey, that isn't true.

128
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:52,450
You've managed to prove
what a good player you are.

129
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:53,118
I'm impressed.

130
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,824
-Don't you want to know
how Shindou's been doing?

131
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:03,428
Or are you waiting until his
match with me to find out?

132
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:06,264
-Well, uh, how did he do?

133
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,200
-He won his game.

134
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:11,469
So he stays at three losses.

135
00:14:11,503 --> 00:14:13,438
-Interesting.

136
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:14,506
-I knew it.

137
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:16,608
Hmph.

138
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:19,511
(VOICEOVER) He only cares
about what happens to Shindo.

139
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:25,116
Even though I'm the one who will
finish the exam in first place.

140
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,184
-What's bothering you?

141
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,322
Good evening.

142
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:32,991
-Toya-sensei, I just had
to come and say thank you

143
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:34,492
for all you've done.

144
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:36,995
With your help, Kosuke
was able to pass the test

145
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,597
and finish in top position.

146
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,999
Oh, please feel
free to sit down.

147
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:42,067
-Thank you.

148
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,002
-You know, I've been thinking.

149
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:45,937
I'd like to throw a
party to celebrate

150
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:47,439
Kosuke becoming a pro.

151
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,274
AKIRA: That sounds
like a good idea.

152
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:50,575
-Yes.

153
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:53,245
And we would be very honored
if you could come and join us.

154
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:55,480
-I don't think we should
be talking about that yet.

155
00:14:55,513 --> 00:14:59,117
Let's wait and see if Ochi
manages to win his final match.

156
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,186
We don't want him to lose focus.

157
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:02,220
-Hm.

158
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:03,388
Yeah, you're right.

159
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:05,590
Even though he's guaranteed
to pass the test,

160
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:08,593
another loss wouldn't look
very good on his record.

161
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:10,862
It's strange, but I
get the impression

162
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:14,099
you're not convinced Kosuke is
going to win his last match.

163
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:16,568
-No, not at all.

164
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:19,304
It's just, you should never
underestimate your opponent.

165
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:20,505
Whoever they are.

166
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:21,406
-Well, of course.

167
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:23,608
I agree with that.

168
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:25,110
But by the way
you're talking, it

169
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,346
sounds like you don't think
Kosuke's good enough to win.

170
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,982
This last opponent of yours
can't be that much of a threat,

171
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:33,218
can he?

172
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:34,219
Kosuke?

173
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:35,320
-Shindou's no threat to me.

174
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:37,222
-Underestimate him,
and you'll lose.

175
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:38,490
-And what if I win?

176
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,225
What if I actually beat Shindou?

177
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:45,096
Maybe then you'll start to
treat me like a serious rival.

178
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,533
If I win, I want you to help
me get into Toya Meijin's study

179
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:49,134
sessions.

180
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,384
-All right, then.

181
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:09,854
If you win, I'll ask my
father to invite you.

182
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:10,989
-That's wonderful!

183
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:13,024
You don't know how
grateful we are.

184
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:15,093
I can't think of a
better place for Kosuke

185
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,294
to continue his studies.

186
00:16:16,328 --> 00:16:18,096
He'd practice with the best.

187
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,498
I mean, Ogata Nine-Dan is
one of the Meijin's students,

188
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:22,834
and he's at the top
of his game right now.

189
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:26,071
What an amazing opportunity
that would be for you.

190
00:16:26,104 --> 00:16:28,473
All you have to go in
win your last match.

191
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:36,081
OCHI (VOICEOVER): Shindou,
I'm ready for you!

192
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,959
-I feel kind of sorry for Waya.

193
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:50,195
I don't think he
can beat Fuku today.

194
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:52,364
-Yeah, I know.

195
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:54,432
He usually has trouble
playing against Fuku,

196
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:57,102
and this time he's gonna
be under a lot of pressure.

197
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,470
-You know what I think?

198
00:16:58,503 --> 00:17:02,073
There will be a playoff
between Isumi and Waya.

199
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:03,508
-What about Shindou?

200
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:04,376
-Huh?

201
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:06,077
-Who do you think's gonna win?

202
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:07,245
Shindou or Ochi?

203
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:09,080
-I think it'll be Shindou.

204
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:10,882
Ochi's already through, right?

205
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:12,951
So he doesn't need to
go all out for a win.

206
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:19,224
-I'm not so sure about that.

207
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:20,325
-What do you mean?

208
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:23,928
-Have you forgotten
what Ochi can be like?

209
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:26,431
I know he lost that
one game against Isumi,

210
00:17:26,464 --> 00:17:28,967
but he wanted to get
through undefeated.

211
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,301
-I guess you're right.

212
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:33,071
He's not going to let Shindou
win without a bit of a fight,

213
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,472
is he?

214
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:36,074
-Mm-hm.

215
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:38,877
I tell you, if I had to pick
the odds in their match--

216
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,378
-Well, what would they be?

217
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:50,522
-I'll say 50-50.

218
00:17:50,555 --> 00:17:53,358
-50-50?

219
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:56,094
Your opinion of Shindou
sure seems to have gone up.

220
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:03,201
-Ah, Sensei?

221
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:05,437
Should we be thinking
about a playoff?

222
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,540
-Yes, as far as I remember,
Isumi has four losses,

223
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:11,075
and Shindou and Waya
have three each.

224
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,246
Of course, it all
comes down to how

225
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,982
they do in their matches
today, but a playoff

226
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:19,117
looks very likely.

227
00:18:19,117 --> 00:18:21,186
If Waya and Shindou
both lose their games,

228
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:23,388
then we'll have three
people tied at four losses.

229
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:26,024
How does a playoff work when
there's three players fighting

230
00:18:26,057 --> 00:18:27,559
for the two remaining places?

231
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:32,197
-Well, if that happens we'll
have to draw for the pairings,

232
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,234
have the first match tomorrow,
and the second one on, uh-- oh,

233
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:37,235
dear.

234
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:38,470
I can see this is
going to be tough.

235
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:44,542
-Shindou.

236
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:46,244
How long have you been there?

237
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:48,012
-A while.

238
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:50,582
-Why didn't you say hello
so we knew you were there?

239
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:52,884
-You were so busy
gossipping about me,

240
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:55,353
I didn't want to interrupt.

241
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:56,821
Well, I'm here now.

242
00:18:56,855 --> 00:18:57,956
Hi.

243
00:18:57,989 --> 00:18:58,828
-Hi.

244
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:02,227
Shindou?

245
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,196
-Huh?

246
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,534
-Uh-- it doesn't matter.

247
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,903
-Been to the match room yet?

248
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:13,938
Anyone in there?

249
00:19:13,972 --> 00:19:15,373
-I think Fuku's there.

250
00:19:15,373 --> 00:19:18,309
I haven't seen Isumi
and the others yet.

251
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:19,844
-Oh, OK.

252
00:19:19,878 --> 00:19:20,345
I'll go check.

253
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:27,018
-Just now, what were yo
going to say to Shindou?

254
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:29,087
-If he wins today, then
he'll have made it through

255
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:30,321
to become a pro.

256
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,357
I was gonna wish him
good luck for the game,

257
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,992
but then I thought
it would be better

258
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:35,960
if I didn't say anything.

259
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:37,161
-Why?

260
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:38,963
-Wishing him luck isn't
going to make the slightest

261
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:40,331
bit of difference now.

262
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:43,001
He's under so much pressure,
I'm sure he doesn't need someone

263
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:46,971
like me reminding him how
important the match is.

264
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:50,375
We're the ones who need some
luck around here, not him.

265
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:52,944
Oh, what am I
gonna do next year?

266
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:58,049
Hm.

267
00:19:58,082 --> 00:20:00,852
-So, shall we head
to the match room?

268
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:02,253
-Sure.

269
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:03,521
Tell you what.

270
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:06,157
I'm gonna go outside and get
some fresh air before we start.

271
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,092
Huh?

272
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:09,427
Ochi.

273
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,495
-Hey, Shindou.

274
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:12,597
You ready to lose today?

275
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,831
-Don't just stand there.

276
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:14,966
Say something!

277
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:16,968
You aren't gonna let him
insult you like that.

278
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:19,103
At least tell him that's
what you were going to say.

279
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:19,971
Come on!

280
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:21,606
-That's what I was gonna say!

281
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,078
OCHI: I've been playing Akira
Toya almost every night,

282
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:30,181
just so I can bet you today.

283
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:31,375
-Toya?

284
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:39,290
Ochi's been training with Toya!

285
00:20:45,296 --> 00:20:47,966
-That's why I know I'm
gonna win this match.

[theme music]

287
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:23,027
HIKARU: Toya's been
helping Ochi get

288
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:25,830
ready for the game against me.

289
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:28,166
SAI: He may believe there's
someone training you.

HIKARU: Toya's gonna have
to recognize me as a rival

00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:32,904
if I win this game.

292

SAI: That won't be easy.

00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:40,011
They've developed a strategy
specifically to defeat you.

HIKARU: Next time,
Hikaru Versus Ochi.

biggest challenge yet.
