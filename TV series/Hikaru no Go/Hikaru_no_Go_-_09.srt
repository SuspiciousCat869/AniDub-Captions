NARRATOR: After many
years inside a Go board,

2
00:00:07,414 --> 00:00:10,454
a spirit from the past
known Fujiwara-no-Sai

3
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:14,996
has returned, visible only to
Hikaru Shindou A master of Go,

4
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:18,402
Sai seeks to play
the Divine Move.

5
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:21,375
[theme music]

6
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,343
-I've got an idea.

7
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:50,779
We can tie up his
hands and feet and make

8
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:53,118
him place the stones
with his teeth.

9
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:54,387
-I kinda like that idea.

10
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,869
-Huh?

11
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:36,368
-Hm?

12
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,304
Where's Ito and Kojima?

13
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:39,607
Anyone seen them?

14
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:41,177
-I saw them earlier.

15
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,314
-They snuck out of here
about 15 minutes ago.

16
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:45,285
I think they were with
that new guy, Okumura.

17
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:46,821
He's a seventh grader.

18
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,391
-Do you know where
they were going?

19
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:48,832
-No.

20
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,280
-Wow.

21
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,918
This place is a
real mess, isn't it?

22
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,289
The Go club used to meet
here, way back when they only

23
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:07,460
had a few members.

24
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:09,164
I need you to clean
up all this stuff.

25
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,505
Mr. Yun's direct orders.

26
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:14,941
He wants to convert
this whole place

27
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:16,879
into a break room for the
girls so they can use it

28
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:18,181
during the next tournament.

29
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:20,185
So, do you think
you can help us out?

30
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:22,857
Someone in the seventh
grade's gotta do it.

31
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:25,262
I noticed you were looking
pretty bored today.

32
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:27,566
This should keep you
busy for a while.

33
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,301
-No problem.

34
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:35,916
Look at all these old
magazines and game diagrams.

35
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,424
Some of this material dates
back to the early Showa period.

36
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:41,793
This book is so old!

37
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:51,779
A classic joseki.

38
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:55,687
It reminds me of the first
time I played Hikaru.

39
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,726
Normally, black would
play right here,

40
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:01,464
and then atari underneath.

41
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:04,470
That's usually accepted
as a good move.

42
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:07,409
But he extended and
used an outdated joseki.

43
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:12,720
It's still a strong move,
but it creates an opening

44
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,857
that can be taken advantage of.

45
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,894
Hikaru never gave me
the chance though.

46
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:19,733
He overwhelmed me
before I could attack.

47
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,839
Normal skills aren't going
to be enough to defeat him.

48
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,709
If I ever want to
surpass him, I'll

49
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:27,949
have to invent a
brand new joseki.

50
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:30,754
-Let's play a game while
you straighten up the place.

51
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:31,756
-Hm?

52
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:34,328
-Toya, I didn't
say you could stop.

53
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:37,501
I don't wanna see you
looking at this board.

54
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,437
I just told you to do something.

55
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,607
What are you waiting for?

56
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,474
-Sorry.

57
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:42,778
Are you asking me to play blind?

58
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:45,249
-Mm-hm.

59
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:46,651
-I don't understand.

60
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:48,855
You asked me to come
in here and clean up.

61
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,659
-It's not your
job to understand.

62
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,565
It's your job to do what
your senpai tells you to.

63
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:55,601
If you wanna be a member
of the Kaio Go club,

64
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:57,472
then you're gonna have
to do as you're told.

65
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,741
You got that?

66
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:01,613
-Even a pro would find it
difficult to play a game blind.

67
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:02,816
This isn't Shogi, you know.

68
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,421
Go is played on a
much larger board.

69
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,524
-But you are the
great Akira Toya.

70
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,695
Aren't you supposed
to be a future Meijin?

71
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:11,799
No one can hold a candle
to you at the tournaments.

72
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,369
We all know that.

73
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:15,907
I wish you'd just turn pro
already, win your four or five

74
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,344
titles, and retire.

75
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:19,013
But you won't do that, will you?

76
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:21,618
You'll stick around our Go
club and constantly remind

77
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:24,424
everyone of how much
better you are than us.

78
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,359
Hm.

79
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,661
This is a real surprise.

80
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:28,732
I would've never guessed
that our best player would

81
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:30,569
be afraid of a
friendly little game.

82
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:36,781
-So I'm your best player?

83
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:40,688
-I thought so, thought you
were, but I'm not sure anymore.

84
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:43,728
-If I am the best,
then I should be

85
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,465
able to beat you
with my eyes closed.

86
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:46,834
I'm going to accept
your challenge.

87
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:54,047
Call your first move.

88
00:05:58,657 --> 00:05:59,098
-Fine.

89
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:00,000
16, 4.

90
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,906
The star point.

91
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:04,910
-4, 15, star point.

92
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:06,079
-4, 16 it is.

93
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:13,025
I'll take 16, 17, the small eye.

94
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:16,765
AKIRA: 4, 4, the star point.

95
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:17,800
-4, 4.

96
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:20,005
Right on the star point.

97
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,808
You're gonna make
me a legend at Kaio.

98
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:22,910
You know that, right?

99
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:24,781
I'll be the guy who beat
Touya in an even game

100
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:25,983
without a handicap.

101
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:27,987
But I need one more favor.

102
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,089
-Hm?

103
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:30,659
-Try not to make this
too boring, all right?

104
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:32,663
If you could avoid making
too many wrong moves,

105
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:35,402
it'll probably make my victory
a little more memorable.

106
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:36,804
-I don't mind if
you brag, but please

107
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:38,106
wait until after you beat me.

108
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,177
It'll be more satisfying.

109
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:41,079
-Aren't you clever?

110
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:42,581
You're the one
who said that even

111
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:44,987
a pro would have
trouble playing blind.

112
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,960
We'll see how good you
are, won't we, Toya?

113
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:52,768
Approach at 6, 4.

114
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:53,251
AKIRA: 3, 6.

115
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,945
-6, 6.

116
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:02,921
AKIRA: 4, 14.

117
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,090
-Toya's been in there awhile.

118
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,693
Do you think he's
struggling yet?

119
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,895
-Probably.

120
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,100
Playing Go without looking
is practically impossible.

121
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,168
-Yeah.

122
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:12,106
-We actually found a
way to make Toya play

123
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:14,577
with his hands and feet tied up.

124
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,111
We're brilliant!

125
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:22,893
-It's my turn to
defeat the whiz kid.

126
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:23,828
-Not yet.

127
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:24,997
Ito's probably
still playing him.

128
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,837
-I know, but I want to
see Toya in a cold sweat.

129
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:30,106
Hey, guys.

130
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,643
I get to play next.

131
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:40,308
Ito.

132
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,770
What happened?

133
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:46,872
You resigned?

134
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:49,812
But you're barely
halfway through the game!

135
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,581
-I wasn't expecting
another challenger.

136
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,724
I'd be happy to play a game
against you too, Senpai.

137
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:02,870
-Ito was defeated because
it was one on one.

138
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:04,473
Toya beat him quickly
so he wouldn't

139
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:09,483
have to remember a lot of
moves, and I'll get beaten too.

140
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:14,893
Toya can't be defeated by one
lone player, but against two--

141
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,162
-Okamura!

142
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,865
Get in here right now!

143
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:18,833
-Hm?

144
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:21,004
-You and Kojima are
both gonna play.

145
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:25,647
-Wha-- So Akira's supposed to
face two opponents and still

146
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,250
not look at the boards?

147
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:30,489
-In a one on one game,
we don't stand a chance.

148
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:31,825
-That's crazy!

149
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:33,629
-Two games at the same time?

150
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:34,697
-Something wrong?

151
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:35,900
Are you afraid?

152
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,737
No one's forcing you to be here.

153
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,539
Go ahead.

154
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:39,541
Walk away.

155
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:41,043
But if you chicken
out and run home,

156
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,546
you're just leaving this room.

157
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:44,182
You're leaving the Kaio Go club.

158
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:45,885
We don't want you here!

159
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,369
-Hm.

160
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,264
Call out your first moves.

161
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,734
But know this.

162
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:57,274
I'm not gonna make this
easy for either of you.

163
00:08:57,508 --> 00:08:58,843
-What's wrong?

164
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:00,781
A future Meijin has
just challenged you

165
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:03,185
to a friendly game.

166
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:04,889
-Fine.

167
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:08,730
16, 4, the star point.

168
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:11,068
-4, 16, star point.

169
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:14,841
-4, 16, at the star point.

170
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:18,716
-17, 4, the small eye.

171
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,285
-4, 3, the small eye.

172
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:28,901
-16, 17, the small eye

173
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,772
AKIRA: 4, 4, the star point.

174
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:36,917
-16, 17, the small eye.

175
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:40,057
AKIRA: 4, 16.

176
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:44,866
-Approach at 6, 17.

177
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:48,639
-16, 15.

178
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:54,016
-15, 3.

179
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,018
-16, 15.

180
00:09:58,024 --> 00:10:00,328
OKAMURA: 13, 17.

181
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:00,997
AKIRA: 17, 17.

182
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,943
KOJIMA: 17, 15.

183
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:08,912
-17, 14.

184
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:16,660
-17, 18.

185
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:17,628
-17, 16.

186
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:20,735
KOJIMA: 3, 3.

187
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,007
AKIRA: 5, 3.

188
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:28,082
OKAMURA: 5, 17.

189
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,226
-4, 17.

190
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:39,838
KOJIMA: 6, 6.

191
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:40,740
-7, 5.

192
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:44,280
ITO (VOICEOVER): Hm.

193
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,384
Kojima isn't half
the player I am,

194
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:50,926
and Okamura is just
playing terrible.

195
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,698
-5, 18.

196
00:10:53,732 --> 00:10:55,168
ITO (VOICEOVER): At
this pace, they're

197
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:56,370
gonna lose faster than I did.

198
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:00,378
-Come on.

199
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,315
What's taking you so long?

200
00:11:02,348 --> 00:11:06,657
-Uh-- b-- block at 4, 18.

201
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:09,295
-About time.

202
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:10,130
KOJIMA: 2, 4.

203
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:14,638
-Extend at 10, 4.

204
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,915
-Um, 6, 18.

205
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:22,186
Got that?

206
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:23,689
-(VOICEOVER) What
a horrible move.

207
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:27,763
-Huh?

208
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:31,170
Hello?

209
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,172
Why do you take so long with me?

210
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:33,742
You're playing
quicker with Kojima.

211
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:38,684
-(VOICEOVER) Something's
wrong with Toya.

212
00:11:38,684 --> 00:11:40,154
Both these games
have barely begun,

213
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:41,857
and he's already slowing down.

214
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:43,895
But not against Kojima.

215
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:47,167
Why's he struggling
against Okamura?

216
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:47,769
Ah!

217
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:58,957
That's it!

218
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:01,094
Okamura may be a weak
player, but Toya's still

219
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:02,163
gonna lose to him.

220
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:04,234
He won't last
another five minutes.

221
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:10,746
-It's your turn.

222
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,717
Hurry up, already.

223
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,721
[laughter]

224
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,215
OKAMURA: This is
getting ridiculous!

225
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,319
I haven't got all day, you know?

226
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:37,932
-(VOICEOVER) Okamura
plays go like a child.

227
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,167
His moves make no sense.

228
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:40,436
They're awful.

229
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,307
Toya's trying to follow
the field of a game.

230
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,144
The logical flow of moves.

231
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:47,016
That's how he can remember
what the board looks like.

232
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,719
But Okamura isn't
making expected moves,

233
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,423
and that's missing
up Toya's rhythm.

234
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,393
Akira is too dependent
on logic, but that's not

235
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:53,228
going to work here.

236
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:54,063
This is hilarious.

237
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:59,907
-10-- 17.

238
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,876
-All right.

239
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:01,377
10, 17.

240
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:09,025
Toya, I've already one
of my stones there.

241
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,830
-Focus.

242
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:13,067
Side extension.

243
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,936
4, 9.

244
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:15,438
-4, 9.

245
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:16,506
OK.

246
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,011
This game has started
to fall to pieces.

247
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:22,785
Now all I have to do is
tighten up my strategy.

248
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,521
(VOICEOVER) The only
strategy you should use

249
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:26,992
is your awful technique.

250
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:27,527
-My turn.

251
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,299
Approach at 3, 14.

252
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,367
-I'll take 4, 11.

253
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:36,778
OKAMURA: Extend at 10, 4.

254
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:41,554
-17.

255
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,892
6.

256
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:46,196
-(VOICEOVER) I've got you
cornered now, don't I?

257
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:50,138
Any minute now I'm gonna
see you crash and burn.

258
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:50,612
HIDAKA: Toya?

259
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,310
Are you in here?

260
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:55,781
-Hidaka-senpai?

261
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:56,283
-Ito?

262
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,353
Kojima?

263
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:00,457
Ah, Toya.

264
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:02,194
You promised me a
teaching game today.

265
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:02,795
Come on.

266
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,146
Hm.

267
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,215
You're a seventh grader.

268
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:15,486
What are you doing here?

269
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,390
Answer me when I talk to you.

270
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,262
-It's like-- it's kind of
like we were just, uh-- uh--

271
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:21,965
-Mr. Yun wanted this
room cleaned up.

272
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:24,504
He said I should-- I should, uh,
get a seventh grader to do it,

273
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:27,509
so I asked, uh,
Toya to help us out.

274
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,914
OKAMURA: I wanted Toya to
play a teaching game with us,

275
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:32,052
but he seemed kind of busy,
and his hands were full.

276
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:34,389
So I thought that maybe
he could, well, you know--

277
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:35,992
-Spit it out.

278
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:40,200
-I asked-- we asked
him to play us blind.

279
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:41,436
-Idiots!

280
00:14:41,469 --> 00:14:43,841
Do you two think you're too
good to help him clean up?

281
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:45,477
You guys have really
got a lot of nerve.

282
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,546
You should be ashamed.

283
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:47,281
And you!

284
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:48,917
Are you behind all this?

285
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,518
-No.

286
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:50,621
Not really.

287
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:52,023
I just--

288
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:52,591
-Toya!

289
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,527
You should know matter.

290
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,596
What were you thinking?

291
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,400
I'll take care of
cleaning up, all right?

292
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,273
I want you to sit down
and finish up your games.

293
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:01,308
AKIRA: Ah, Hidaka-senpai?

294
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:06,317
I agreed to play both
these matches blind.

295
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,552
I gave my word.

296
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:08,521
I am sorry.

297
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:09,623
-Don't be stupid.

298
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:12,062
I'm not gonna stand here
and allow this bullying

299
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,398
to continue.

300
00:15:13,398 --> 00:15:15,067
-But I said I would.

301
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,202
-Stop it.

302
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:18,140
-Just stop talking and
listen for a change.

303
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:20,612
You've been nothing but trouble
ever since you got here.

304
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:23,116
What's worse is that you
brought all this on yourself.

305
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,920
Why did you accept
their stupid challenge?

306
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:26,289
You're encouraging them!

307
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,527
If you hadn't come
here, this wouldn't--

308
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:42,086
Akira, what I mean is-- you're
not just a Kaio student,

309
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:44,056
you're also an important
member of our Go club.

310
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,262
You should hold
your head up high.

311
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,033
You owe it to yourself
to play them fair

312
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:50,435
and square, and
beat them that way.

313
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:54,143
Don't let anyone
push you around.

314
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:56,481
-Right.

315
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:57,449
I understand, Hidaka.

316
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:01,590
Oh.

317
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:02,993
These games shouldn't
take more than about

318
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:05,931
five minutes to finish,
but after that, I'd

319
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,069
be happy to play a
practice game with you.

320
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:22,931
I'm so sorry to
keep you waiting.

321
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:23,466
Let's continue.

322
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:32,716
HIKARU: Kimihiro!

323
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,485
Where are you?

324
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,329
I found us a new member.

325
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:42,101
And she already
knows how to play.

326
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:42,576
-Really?

327
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:48,529
-Ah--

328
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:52,689
-This is great.

329
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:53,958
Now we can enter the tournament.

330
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,602
-So, uh, you know
how to play Go?

331
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:01,104
-Of course I do.

332
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:02,374
-Not that it matters.

333
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:04,478
Our club is open to anyone
who wants to learn the game.

334
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:06,248
-What are you talking about?

335
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:09,354
It's better if we get an
experienced player on our team.

336
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:11,491
-I'm afraid it doesn't
matter how good she is.

337
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:12,560
-Hm?

338
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:13,996
-She still won't be
able to compete with us.

339
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,166
The boys and girls are
split into two divisions.

340
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,102
Nice try, though.

341
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:17,970
-That's right.

342
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,106
I forgot.

343
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,743
We could throw some pants
and a jacket on her.

344
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:22,279
She'd pass for a
boy, no problem.

345
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:28,491
-What a waste of time.

346
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:30,695
You said all I had to do
was play in the tournaments.

347
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:33,199
I'm too busy with volleyball
to deal with this stuff.

348
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:35,103
-Wait!

349
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,675
-Hikaru, you really
shouldn't have said that.

350
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:43,052
-Let's see if I got
this straight, OK?

351
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:44,789
There has to be three
members on a Go team?

352
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,258
-Yep. you got it.

353
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,761
And we're still one guy short.

354
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:55,008
It'd be great to
find a decent player.

355
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,077
The stronger the better.

356
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:02,522
Got any suggestions, Sai?

357
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:04,560
-You should consider
asking Akira's father.

358
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,495
He's a very strong.

359
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:09,603
-I can see it now.

360
00:18:09,637 --> 00:18:11,607
Toya's dad would look really
cool in a school uniform.

361
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:20,157
Hey, I've got a great idea.

362
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,459
We can put up a new poster.

363
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:23,697
It'll have a life and
death problem on it.

364
00:18:23,697 --> 00:18:26,536
Whoever solves it gets
invited to join our team.

365
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:28,072
-Just calm down.

366
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:29,541
The person doesn't
have to be good.

367
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,645
We'll take anyone!

368
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,152
-Doesn't Kaio's club have
dozens and dozens of members

369
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:36,154
to pick from?

370
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:37,490
-Yeah, they do.

371
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:38,592
They the cream of the crop.

372
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:39,193
Hmph.

373
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,429
It's so unfair.

374
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:41,564
-Come on.

375
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,468
We who we are, right?

376
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,138
Who'd wanna go to Kaio?

377
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:46,074
I wouldn't.

378
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:46,548
-Hm.

379
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:01,303
Wait up!

380
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:05,511
Ito, the eighth greater.

381
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,685
He just told me he's
quitting the Go club.

382
00:19:09,718 --> 00:19:13,092
I just thought that you
might wanna know that, Toya.

383
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:15,630
Your presence has put
everyone here on edge.

384
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,601
Our members are
nervous around you.

385
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:21,776
Even I'm nervous around you,
and I'm the captain of the club.

386
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,278
I have to tell you something.

387
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:25,616
I've actually been meaning to
ask you to play a teaching game

388
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:27,119
with me, but I won't.

389
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,091
Kaio can't afford to see their
captain humiliated by a younger

390
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:31,394
player.

391
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:33,497
What I'd really like to do is
to sit down and battle it out

392
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:35,635
with you, like Aoki did.

393
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:36,838
But I don't have that luxury.

394
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,307
Not like you, Toya.

395
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,482
You're here because of
some childish vendetta.

396
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,820
I've heard all the stories
about your big showdowns

397
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:48,694
against that bot who goes to
Haze Middle, Hikaru Shindou.

398
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:51,365
That must really drive you
nuts, losing to some kid

399
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,668
your own age.

400
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:54,605
I think you should ask
yourself one question.

401
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:58,546
Is it really worth it?

402
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,549
Every one in the Go club is
suffering because if you.

403
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,687
You've caused nothing but
problems since you arrived.

404
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,630
-Hikaru keeps
refusing to play me.

405
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:11,438
I don't know why, but to be
honest, I don't really care.

406
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:13,541
If he won't face
me alone, then I'll

407
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,547
do whatever it takes to
force him into a match.

408
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:19,419
Even if it means playing in
a middle school tournament.

409
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,757
You've accused me of
causing nothing but problems

410
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,659
since I arrived.

411
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:25,364
-Huh?

412
00:20:25,397 --> 00:20:27,167
-Shindou's playing at
the next tournament.

413
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,238
Think that'll be a problem
for your precious club?

414
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:33,546
So, choose.

415
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:36,466
Kick me out because I might
embarrass you, or accept

416
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:39,769
I'm the only player who's
got a chance at being Hikaru.

417
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:42,738
[theme music]

418
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:23,406
HIKARU: Guess what, Sai?

419
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:24,740
I found someone
else at my school

420
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:26,609
who knows how to play Go!

421
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:27,810
He's really good.

422
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:30,680
He might be better
than Kimihiro.

423
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:34,584
SAI: There's something
about him that troubles me.

424
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:35,851
HIKARU: Oh, come on.

425
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:37,887
If he joins the club, we'll
win the tournament for sure.

426
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,628
Next time, the Third Player.

427
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:46,629
-SAI: Hikaru.

428
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:47,496
He's cheating!

429
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,398
HIKARU: No way!
