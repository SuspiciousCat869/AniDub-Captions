[theme music]

2
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,411
-If I beat you today, Toya's
gonna recognize my strength

3
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,313
and see me as his rival!

4
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,049
-In that case, if I beat you,
Toya's gonna see my strength,

5
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,252
and I'll be his rival!

6
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,654
You'll see.

7
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:04,157
Both of you!

8
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,726
OCHI (VOICEOVER): I
won't lose this game.

9
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,994
Not with Toya behind me.

10
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,766
Who have you got
behind you, Shindou?

11
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,405
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): If
I win this match today,

12
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:23,377
then I'll finally be
a pro, just like you.

13
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,378
Are you ready for me?

14
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,352
-Here's an attack
that will crush you!

15
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:37,724
-Take that!

16
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,638
-Hi.

17
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,974
We're from the Go
Association magazine.

18
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,175
Nice to meet you.

19
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,177
We're here to do some
interviews with the new pros who

20
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,645
passed the exam.

21
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,514
-You're a bit early for that.

22
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,749
There's only one player
who's through for sure,

23
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,752
and I doubt we're gonna find
out who the other two are today.

24
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,722
MAN: That's what we heard.

25
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,525
We checked out the game
records before we came.

26
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,528
We could be looking at a
three way playoff, right?

27
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,696
-Yeah.

28
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,397
It's gonna be a while
before the results are in,

29
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,533
so make yourself comfortable
and I'll grab some tea.

30
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,133
-Thanks.

31
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,669
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): There!

32
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,974
OCHI (VOICEOVER): I'm
in for the attack!

33
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,759
He won't know what hit him!

34
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,701
No!

35
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,614
How-- How could I
have missed that?

36
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,381
Shindou's stones!

37
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,052
SAI (VOICEOVER): There was one
weakness in Ochi's game plan

38
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:50,390
that he didn't anticipate,
and Hikaru discovered it.

39
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,126
Hikaru's stones at the
bottom right of the board

40
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,295
survived the attack and
made up the lost ground.

41
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,601
It's anyone's game now.

42
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,549
Toya.

43
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,617
The player you see
before you now is Hikaru.

44
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,063
The player you lost to two
years ago was actually me.

45
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,736
You can see my influence
in the way Hikaru plays.

46
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,677
I'm sure you must
have been wondering

47
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,512
who your opponent was back then.

48
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:53,186
Well, that was me,
Fujiwara-no-Sai.

49
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,255
But now you need
to pay attention

50
00:05:55,288 --> 00:06:01,294
to Hikaru, who grows stronger
every day under my guidance.

51
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,395
Toya.

52
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,732
The next time we meet,
you won't be facing me.

53
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,300
You'll be facing Hikaru Shindou.

54
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:14,935
-Oh my.

55
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,737
The more I play,
the more I realize

56
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,205
I've got so much to learn.

57
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:19,239
-Yes.

58
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:23,043
But I think you have
definite potential.

59
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,978
-Thank you very
much for the lesson.

60
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:25,813
-You're welcome.

61
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:26,568
Huh?

62
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,654
-I hear your father managed
to defend his Meijin title.

63
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:35,689
Please, send him
my congratulations.

64
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:38,659
One day, maybe it'll be you
who's gonna have the title.

65
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:39,693
I'll be cheering for you.

66
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:40,561
-Thanks.

67
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:42,062
I'll try my best.

68
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:44,164
-Well, I better get going.

69
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:45,632
Thanks for everything.

70
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,800
AMANO: Ah, Toya.

71
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,601
-Hm?

72
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:49,002
You're from the magazine?

73
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:50,003
-I'm Amano.

74
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:51,205
We met before.

75
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,707
I wondered if you
had a few moments.

76
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,310
I'd be interested in doing
an interview with you

77
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:58,846
about your long winning streak.

78
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,848
You're at about 20
consecutive wins, right?

79
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,549
Now, when you think
of winning streaks,

80
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:06,753
Kurata comes to mind at 25,
and Kuwabara-sensei with 27.

81
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:08,589
But they're experienced
players and you're

82
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:10,958
a rookie, which makes
it even more remarkable.

83
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,060
Do you ever think about
breaking the record?

84
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:14,228
-Not really.

85
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:16,129
-And what about your
ambitions for the future?

86
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,265
Do you want to be a greater
player than your father?

87
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:21,568
Do you dream of being
the best in the world?

88
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:23,070
Toya?

89
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,037
-Yes?

90
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,539
-We've been thinking
for some time

91
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:27,007
that we'd like to
do an article on you

92
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,209
in the association's
monthly magazine.

93
00:07:29,243 --> 00:07:31,078
We started out with
the idea of talking

94
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:33,714
with you and your father,
Toya Meijin together,

95
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:35,983
but I think the article would
be just as strong with you

96
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,084
on your own.

97
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:38,952
And, well, some say
it's too soon for this,

98
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:43,690
but I want to call it pro
players for the 21st century.

99
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,692
It would be great to get
some comments from you

100
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:47,895
that would help lead the
way for a new generation.

101
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,630
How about after
you're done teaching,

102
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:51,798
we get something to eat
and do the interview then?

103
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:57,938
-I've got another appointment
after I finish up here.

104
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:03,043
I'll be done teaching
by 7:40, so it's

105
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:07,848
gonna be pretty late by the time
I actually get to Ochi's house.

106
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,550
-Well, never mind.

107
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,051
We can do it some other time.

108
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:13,887
I apologize for disturbing
you during your break.

109
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:15,756
-Oh, that's OK.

110
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:17,724
-Well, now, is it
that time already?

111
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:20,761
I'd better call the study center
and see how they're doing.

112
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:24,064
The results of pro
exam might be in.

113
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:25,065
-Wait!

114
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:26,166
Can I come too?

115
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,602
Uh, you see, I want
to know the results!

116
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:38,779
-There are still two
matches going on,

117
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:42,249
and both are crucial to find out
who's going to pass the exam.

118
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:46,086
Two of the players are
tied at three losses each,

119
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:47,988
and then there's
that guy out there.

120
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:50,724
He's at four losses, so he
must be a nervous wreck waiting

121
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:53,293
to hear the final results.

122
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:55,195
His chances of
making it through all

123
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:57,531
depend on how these
two matches turn out.

124
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:12,145
-It's raining.

125
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,962
[excited whispering]

126
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:49,082
ISUMI (VOICEOVER): Waya won.

127
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:52,219
Which means that he's the
second one to make it through.

128
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:55,555
He's gonna become a pro.

129
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:57,791
It's what we've all been
aiming for from the start.

130
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:02,663
We used to hang out
together and laugh

131
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:04,297
about what would happen
if we got promoted.

132
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:12,005
But only three of
us can become pros.

133
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,075
Now all that's left is
Shindou's match against Ochi.

134
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:21,648
If Shindou loses, then I get
one final chance at a playoff.

135
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:26,953
[excited whispering]

136
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:27,854
-I think they're done!

137
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,941
-Who won?

138
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:50,811
No-one.

139
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:51,812
No-one's coming.

140
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,853
I mean, if Shindou lost, then
we'd have to go to a playoff,

141
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:01,588
and someone would come get me.

142
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:03,757
They would tell me that
I'm needed for the playoff.

143
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:22,709
I guess that means Shindou won.

144
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:31,251
[laughter]

145
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:50,771
-Kosuke, you can't
mope around forever.

146
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:53,073
Now, of course I understand
you're disappointed

147
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:56,576
you didn't meet that Shindou
boy today, but remember,

148
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:59,813
you still managed to pass the
test with the best record.

149
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:01,615
You'll get plenty
of opportunities

150
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:03,717
to get even when you
play each other as pros.

151
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:09,856
We've got to start making
preparations for that party

152
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,124
I promised you.

153
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,692
[doorbell]

154
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:15,028
-Huh?

155
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:17,230
-Don't bother answering it.

156
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:18,298
It's probably just Toya.

157
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:22,702
-It's all right.

158
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:23,270
Thanks.

159
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:25,105
I'll goo see who it is.

160
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:34,748
Yes?

161
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:36,650
-It's Toya here.

162
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:38,051
-Ah, hello.

163
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:41,588
I thought your coaching
sessions ended yesterday.

164
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:44,591
Unless you're coming by to find
out how Ochi did in this match

165
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:45,859
today?

166
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:47,227
-Uh, no.

167
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,596
I found out the results earlier.

168
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:52,599
-If you don't mind me
asking, why are you here?

169
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:54,701
-I know it's getting late,
and I should have called

170
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:57,170
or something, but I
was kind of hoping

171
00:12:57,204 --> 00:12:59,206
Ochi would be able to
replay the match for me.

172
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:11,918
-He says he's not interested in
replaying a match that he lost.

173
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:18,859
-All right, then.

174
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,193
I understand.

175
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,094
I'll go now.

176
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:34,841
-Honestly, sometimes
you can be so difficult.

177
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:44,951
-1 and 1/2 points.

178
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:47,787
And what a huge 1 and
1/2 points they were.

179
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:49,990
Shindou showed great
strength and determination

180
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,992
by not giving up.

181
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:54,895
Now I think I can understand
why your goal of beating him

182
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:56,196
was so important to you.

183
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:01,101
You also played a
good game, Ochi.

184
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,710
AKIRA (VOICEOVER): So,
Shindou, you're on your way.

185
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:13,580
Soon we'll be
meeting face to face,

186
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,982
and then I'll get to see what
kind of player you really are.

187
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:23,223
I'm going to finally find out.

188
00:14:23,256 --> 00:14:24,858
Come on, Shindou.

189
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:30,563
I'm waiting for you-- in
the world of the pros!

190
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,776
WOMAN: Congratulations.

191
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:45,078
Hikaru told me the
news this morning.

192
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:47,080
MITSUKO: Thank you.

193
00:14:47,113 --> 00:14:49,849
-I'd already that he'd become
a professional a couple of days

194
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:51,017
ago.

195
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:54,087
Honestly, I have to admit
I'm a little surprised.

196
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,891
It's hard to believe he's done
so well in such a short time.

197
00:14:57,924 --> 00:14:59,592
Although, as one
of his teachers,

198
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:01,828
maybe I should have paid a
little more attention to what

199
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:03,229
was going on.

200
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:05,732
-You think he would
have mentioned it to us.

201
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:08,768
We are his parents, after all.

202
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:09,836
Oh, dear.

203
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:11,538
This is all very
sudden, and I can't

204
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:13,740
help feeling a little worried.

205
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:14,774
-But why are you worried?

206
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:17,644
Is he going to be
missing a lot of school?

207
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,245
-Oh, I wish I knew.

208
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,048
-Now that he's a pro, he'll
be getting paid to play.

209
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:24,951
Do you, uh, know how much
he's going to be making?

210
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:28,621
-He really hasn't told
us anything about it.

211
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,724
I'm concerned he might
start to ignore schoolwork.

212
00:15:30,757 --> 00:15:32,325
Or if he's off playing
Go all the time,

213
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,661
he might end up losing
a lot of his friends.

214
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:36,696
He's still only a teenager.

215
00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:38,064
-Yes, I know.

216
00:15:38,098 --> 00:15:41,134
-And then, what happens
about high school?

217
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:42,836
There's another
employee who also

218
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:44,971
pased the test, called Waya.

219
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:47,741
He's a year older than
Hikaru, in the ninth grade,

220
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:51,311
and I heard he's going to
skip high school altogether.

221
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:52,846
-But surely Hikaru
wouldn't think

222
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:55,015
of doing something like that.

223
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,717
-He hasn't mentioned
anything yet.

224
00:15:57,717 --> 00:16:01,121
It's still a year away before
he has to make that decision.

225
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:04,958
-They'll let him go to
high school, won't they?

226
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:08,661
Then again, maybe if he's out
earning lots of money as a pro,

227
00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:09,829
he wouldn't need to.

228
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:12,966
I really don't understand
the world of Go at all.

229
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:16,569
-It's a mystery to me, too.

230
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:18,138
Anyway, I thought I
would try and meet

231
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:19,806
with the parents
of this boy, Waya,

232
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,975
and see if they can answer
some of the questions I've

233
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:23,977
got about this whole thing.

234
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:25,011
-Uh-huh?

235
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:26,579
-When I talked to
Hikaru about it,

236
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,715
he just shouted at me
to mind my own business.

237
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:29,716
But how can I do that?

238
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:30,583
I'm his mother.

239
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,018
Of course it's my business.

240
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:34,988
-I know.

241
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:39,259
-I-- I didn't tell him I
was coming here to see you.

242
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:43,063
[school bell]

243
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:45,565
-On the positive side,
he doesn't actually

244
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:47,700
start as a pro for
quite a while yet.

245
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:50,103
Not until next spring, is it?

246
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:53,239
Now, you will keep in touch
and let me know how things go?

247
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:54,074
-Yes.

248
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:54,941
And thanks for your help.

249
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:06,286
-Hey.

250
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,254
-Look who it is.

251
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:10,757
So, I've heard
you've become a pro.

252
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,724
-That's right.

253
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:16,963
-Well.

254
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:18,531
-Huh?

255
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:21,446
-I guess I should
wish you good luck.

256
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:42,108
-So Sai, you think the
Go club's playing today?

257
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:44,677
-I don't see why
they wouldn't be.

258
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:46,545
-Hm?

259
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,114
SAI: Look, it's Akari.

260
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:49,615
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
It's hard to believe

261
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:54,253
the club Kimihiro
started is still going.

262
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:55,321
-Should we get started?

263
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,323
-Hey, did you hear
the news bout Hikaru?

264
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:58,624
I heard he passed the pro exam.

265
00:17:58,658 --> 00:17:59,458
-Yep.

266
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:02,328
He told me about it himself.

267
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:03,596
-Wow.

268
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:04,697
-Who's this Hikaru guy?

269
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,532
Is he the one that used
to be in the Go club,

270
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:08,200
and went off to become an Insei?

271
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:09,535
-Isn't it awesome?

272
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,070
-Mm-hm.

273
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,506
I'll see if I can get
him to drop by sometime.

274
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:16,409
We should have a little
party for him to celebrate.

275
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,144
-You all right?

276
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:20,246
-I'm OK.

277
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,548
-I can't imagine what it must
be like to actually make it

278
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:23,749
to the level of a pro.

279
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:24,784
-Me, either.

280
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:26,252
You know what?

281
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:28,654
Maybe we should all pitch
in and buy him a gift.

282
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:31,390
To say congratulations.

283
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,758
-Hey, everyone!

284
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,527
I'm here!

285
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:35,394
-Koneko!

286
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:36,495
You decided to come back again?

287
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:37,430
That's great!

288
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:39,265
-But what about your volleyball?

289
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:42,134
-Well, I thought I'd
concentrate on playing Go.

290
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:44,336
The last time the three of
us entered a tournament,

291
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,706
we didn't even manage to make
it through the first round.

292
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:49,675
I want to make sure we do
way better than that when

293
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,644
we compete in the
tournament this year.

294
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:53,079
-You bet we will!

295
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:55,448
I can't believe you're
serious about it.

296
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,516
-We'll h train hard.

297
00:18:57,516 --> 00:19:00,653
-What do you think the chances
are that Yuuki will show up?

298
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,121
-He'd better.

299
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:05,324
Otherwise we won't be able to
enter the team competition.

300
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:07,727
-What if you just wrote his
name on the application form?

301
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,795
you can always change it later.

302
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:11,330
-We can't do that.

303
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:13,532
He's already said he
won't be on a team.

304
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:15,267
-Oh, it's gonna be fine.

305
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,069
Natsuma, you need to
take more initiative

306
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:19,138
if you're gonna be the
captain of the Go club.

307
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:19,739
-Huh?

308
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,373
-She's right, Captain.

309
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:24,143
-Who asked your opinion?

310
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:26,378
-What's all the fuss about?

311
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:27,246
[gasp]

312
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:27,813
-Mitani!

313
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:29,235
What are you doing here?

314
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,550
-Fuss? What fuss? No fuss.

315
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:34,053
-Good to see ya, Captain.

316
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:35,054
Captain?

317
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:36,388
-Yeah.

318
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:38,357
You're gonna be captain of the
boys' team in the tournament,

319
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,191
right?

320
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,259
-What are you talking about?

321
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,061
I never said I was gonna
play with you guys,

322
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:44,663
let alone be your captain
in some tournament.

323
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:45,598
Listen up, Kaneko--

324
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:46,265
-I don't know.

325
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:48,067
-You gotta do it.

326
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,435
-You know you want to.

327
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:04,353
-Hey, Shindou!

328
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,621
I heard a rumor going
around the class

329
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:10,756
that you're gonna be a
professional Go player.

330
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,225
Is that true?

331
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:14,560
-Yeah, it is.

332
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:18,130
Guess that means our Go club
must be one of the best around.

333
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:19,698
With you on the team,
it's a sure thing

334
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:21,467
we're going to win
every tournament!

335
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,435
-I can't enter even
if I wanted to!

336
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:25,771
I'm a pro!

337
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:26,405
Oh.

338
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:28,374
You can play?

339
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:32,812
So I guess being a pro
isn't much fun then.

340
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:36,382
HIKARU: What would you
know about being a pro?

341
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:39,118
-Hey!

342
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:42,788
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Toya's
already been a pro for a year,

343
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:46,058
and now I'm about
to join his world.

344
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:47,059
Get ready for me, Toya.

345
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:55,367
[theme music]

346
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,789
-I get to be in
Toya's world now,

347
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:25,791
and I'm gonna play
all the top pros.

348
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,327
-It takes time.

349
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,796
HIKARU: First I wanna get a game
against Toya, and then Ogata,

350
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:32,698
and the Meijin!

351
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:35,367
SAI: Your first opponent
is going to be announced.

352
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:37,703
HIKARU: Whoever it is,
I'll be ready for them!

353
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:45,177
Next time, Into the
World of the Pros!

354
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,571
SAI: I wonder if Hikaru
will need me much longer.
