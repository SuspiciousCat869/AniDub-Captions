-What about you?

00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,278
You want to play a game?

00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,080
-Just who are you, anyway?

00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,315
-Mr. Shuhei is going
to be representing

00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,318
Japan in the next world
amateur championship.

8
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,420
He's probably the best
amateur in the country.

-You're not using
any of your time.

You should probably

Huh?

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,375
-He might be playing fast.

13
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,143
But he knows what he's doing.

He's just a kid.

you can tell he's a pro.

-[gasp] (THINKING) I set a trap.

17
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:34,388
But he saw right through
it in the blink of an eye.

-(THINKING) This is amazing.

19
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,025
Shindo's a completely
different player

20
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,359
from when I saw him last year.

21
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:42,729
How could he have
changed so much?

-(THINKING) Yes!

Whew.

24
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,299
Sai, how'd I do?

appear anywhere around here,

it was a dead end.

Hope I've got the right key.

34

You sure you never
knew about this room?

What is this place?

There's so many books.

-Yeah.

43
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,433
They're kifu, game
records from long ago.

44

This room is where we've
been storing all of them.

The [inaudible] is the
oldest one we have.

-All this old stuff.

47
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,411
Is that why you thought there
might be a ghost in here?

48
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,346
--[laughing] Well,
at least we tried.

49
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,149
I guess the ghosts don't
think we're worth haunting.

50
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,187
-Hmm.

51
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,323
-Did you want to have a
look at anything here?

52

-No thanks.

53

That's OK.

-You sure, after
coming all this way?

55
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,328
-Oh, OK.

56
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,063
Uh, something by Shusaku.

57
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,231
-Interesting choice.

58
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,465
Now let's see.

59
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,534
Shusaku was from the
[inaudible] period.

60
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,469
Where would that be?

61
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,037
-I can't believe
I've never checked

62
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,673
out any of Shusaku's
game records.

63
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,175
-Really?

64
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,277
You haven't seen
any of them before,

65
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,712
not even the ones
that get published

66
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,547
in modern collections?

67
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:43,257
You should take a look at
some of the game records

68
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,224
from history.

69
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:45,959
You might learn something.

70
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:47,060
Now what's this here?

71
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,263
Ah, here we go.

72
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:50,164
-Oh!

73
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:51,698
-Hey, what are you dong?

-Sorry. I'm sorry.

-You've got to be more careful.

76
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:56,236
These are valuable.

77
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,337
-I know.

78

Come get me when
you're finished.

82
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:06,046
I'm leaving in about 30 minutes.

You'll have to be done by
then, so I can lock up.

00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:13,687
-(THINKING) These are the
matches that Sai played.

85
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,357
At least, it was Sai
playing through Torajiro.

86

-And don't damage any
of these books, OK?

87
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:20,828
HIKARU: I won't.

88
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:28,969
(THINKING) I know what kind
of player Sai is today.

89
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:31,271
But how strong was he back then?

--[gasp] (THINKING) This
move Sai made, it's awesome.

92
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:05,973
He must have thought about
every possible angle.

93
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:14,615
It's the kind of move that
would make any opponent give up

94
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:15,349
the will to fight.

95
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:28,061
Sai, he was a-- he
was a total genius.

96
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,665
I should have let him play
for me whenever he wanted to.

97
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:32,799
But no.

98
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:35,068
I always wanted to
be the one to play.

99
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:37,004
If only I'd realized before.

100
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:41,074
Toya would've been
much happier if he'd

101
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,176
been able to play
Sai instead of me.

102
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:44,311
He was a genius.

103
00:06:44,344 --> 00:06:48,315
And I should have let him
play every single game.

104
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:49,349
Of course.

105
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:51,718
That must have been
what Torajiro did.

106
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:57,858
When Torajiro first met Sai,
he already knew how to play Go.

107
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:00,394
And he was interested in
becoming a good player.

108
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:02,663
Because of that, he
could see straight away

109
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:04,698
how strong Sai was.

110
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:07,200
That's why he let
Sai play through him.

111
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:08,702
Oh!

112
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:11,672
Man, when I started I didn't
know the first thing about Go.

113
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:15,375
So I had no idea how
much of a genius Sai was.

114
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:18,679
All I ever thought about
was me wanting to play.

115
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:20,847
Even when I realized
how good Sai was,

116
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:23,784
I had to keep on
playing on my own.

117
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:26,353
I was so selfish.

118
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:28,789
I was such a fool.

[gasp] Oh no.

122
00:07:54,314 --> 00:08:01,321
Why didn't I let Sai play all
the games from the very start?

123

What an idiot I've been.

Anyone can see it
would have been better

125

to let him play instead of me.

126

Every game, every
game, every game.

127

I don't need to play.

I'll never be so selfish again.

bring him back.

00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:23,323
-Not a clue.

165
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:24,658
And it's time to get started.

166
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:26,159
We can't wait any longer.

167
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,328
-He should have been at the
dan promotion league game

168
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:28,962
this week.

169
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:29,896
He didn't show.

170
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,630
-No way.

171
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:31,364
Is he OK?

172
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:32,699
-Is he sick, or something?

173
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:34,201
-I'm sure he would
have phoned to let

174
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:35,936
them know if he was sick.

175
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:39,072
He never went to Morashida's
sensei study session, either.

176
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,107
There's something
else going on here.

177
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:41,675
-Argh!

178
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,391
(THINKING) Shindo.

179
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:59,583
[church bells]

180
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:00,584
-What?

181
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:03,521
Fujiwara-No-Sai doesn't exist?

182
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:05,589
-I don't know why you're
looking at me like that.

183
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:07,424
I've done as much
research as I can.

184
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,660
You said he was an aristocrat
who taught the emperor

185
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:11,428
to play Go in the Heian period.

186
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:13,397
Well, not according
to my research.

187
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:16,500
And I even got the boss
to double check it for me.

188
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:17,968
-That's impossible.

189
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:19,303
Because I know.

190
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:20,437
Sai does exist.

191
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:21,238
-Oh, come on.

192
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:22,373
How could you know that?

193
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:24,341
Have you got any
proof to back it up?

194
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,644
-No, OK, maybe it
was wrong of me

195
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:29,280
to categorically
say he didn't exist.

196
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:31,148
I guess it would be
more accurate to say

197
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:33,350
we don't know if
he existed or not.

198
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:34,952
The point is, we
have no evidence

199
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:36,654
to say for sure one
way or the other.

200
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:42,126
-Oh, thank you.

201
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:49,366
-(THINKING) We don't know
if he existed or not?

202
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,602
Of course he existed.

203
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:55,272
And I'm the only
one who knows that.

204
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:57,541
-Hikaru?

205
00:12:57,575 --> 00:12:59,977
[giggling] How are things going?

206
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:01,378
What were you
talking to Mr. Matsui

207
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:03,347
about, just a moment ago?

208
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,349
-Nothing important.

209
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:07,484
-By the way, did
you hear I managed

210
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:10,221
to reduce my handicap
against Kaneko by one stone?

211
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:12,590
[giggling] It would be great
to have another game with you

212
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:13,557
some time.

213
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:15,926
HIKARU: I'm not
going to play again.

214
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,528
-Oh, don't be such a meanie.

215
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:20,497
Last time we played, I
learned so much from you.

216
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:21,932
How's life as a pro?

217
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,167
Is it hard work?

218
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,269
-I told you, I'm never
going to play again.

219
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:26,537
-Huh?

220
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,505
I suppose we're not good enough
for you now you're a pro.

221
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:29,673
Is that it?

222
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:30,674
Forget it.

223
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,644
[music playing]

224
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:49,159
-(THINKING) No more study
sessions with Morashita Sensei.

225
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:52,296
And no more visits to Mr.
Kuwai's [inaudible] either.

226
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,234
-See ya later.

227
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:59,937
-(THINKING) Toya had his
sights set on playing Sai.

228
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,373
But I wanted them set on me.

229
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:03,607
That was never going to happen.

230
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:09,513
There's no way I could have
ever reached Sai's level.

231
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,660
Sai, why did you disappear?

232
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,076
-Hey, Waya.

233
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:41,378
You got things pretty
neat and tidy in here.

234
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:43,480
-That's easy when you
don't have any stuff.

235
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,982
Man, this place is empty.

236
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:46,317
-You haven't even got a fridge.

237
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,518
What do you do for food?

238
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:49,353
You can't eat out all the time.

239
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:51,255
And how are you going
to do your laundry?

240
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:52,289
-I'll just take it home.

241
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:53,590
Mom's going to do it for me.

242
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,526
And I'll probably eat at
home most of the time.

243
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,262
Or I could always go
over to sensei's place.

244
00:14:58,295 --> 00:14:59,530
-You haven't moved out.

245
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:03,667
The only thing that's
different is where you sleep.

246
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:07,504
-All I need is a Go
board, and some stones.

247
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:08,639
-This is awesome.

248
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:11,275
I wish I could move
out, and live on my own.

249
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:13,677
-You can stay over any
time you like, Komea,

250
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:16,547
as long as you bring
snacks with you.

251
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,515
There's going to be a
group of pros coming over

252
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:20,451
to play every Saturday.

253
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:21,151
-Oh yeah?

254
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,252
Who's coming over?

255
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:25,322
-Sayeki, Okada,
Nokayama, guys like that.

256
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:27,658
-What about Shindo.

257
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:29,126
-I would have invited him.

258
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:33,364
But he hasn't been at the Go
association for a while now.

259
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:36,233
-So what do you think's
happened to him.

260
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:37,334
-Don't know.

261
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,103
Morishita Sensei is
taking it personally.

262
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:40,904
And he doesn't want
to see him again.

263
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:45,008
-Hey, listen, Waya, can I
sit on your Saturday session?

264
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:48,412
I mean, I know
I'm not a pro yet.

265
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:50,381
I don't have any other
classes on Saturday.

266
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,249
So it would be cool
if I could come.

267
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:53,117
-Sure you can come.

268
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:54,218
You can all come.

269
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,555
-It's OK for Honda and Kumiya..

270
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,190
They're both strong
enough players.

271
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:02,092
But me, I'm at a
way lower level.

272
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:03,560
I'd hold you guys back.

273
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:06,530
-You're never going to improve
with that sort of attitude.

274
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:07,698
-It's so depressing.

275
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:09,566
I've got to go through
all the qualifying rounds

276
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,135
for the pro exam.

277
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:12,669
Riyo's given up being an insei.

278
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:14,138
So I'm on my own.

279
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:16,373
I'm beginning to wonder if
I should just call it quits.

280
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:23,180
Oh, by the way, do
you know what I heard?

281
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:25,382
A bunch of players from the
Kusekei went on this trip

282
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:26,583
to China.

283
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:28,385
They were like goodwill
ambassadors for the Japanese Go

284
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:29,353
association.

285
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:30,254
-Oh yeah?

286
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:31,555
Good for them.

287
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,690
-The interesting thing is that
one of the players on the trip

288
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:35,125
was Isumi.

289
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:35,559
-Isumi?

290
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:38,128
No way.

291
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:42,433
-Ah, so he did decide to
keep on playing Go after all.

292
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:43,634
-Hm.

293
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,502
-I guess that means he'll
be taking the pro exam again

294
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:48,238
next year.

295
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:50,140
-Of course, he's not
an insei anymore.

296
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:52,309
So he'll have to go through
all the qualifying rounds

297
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:54,511
in a couple of months.

298
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:55,979
-It'll be good to see him.

299
00:16:55,979 --> 00:17:00,184
Maybe we'll get to play him
in some of the later rounds.

300
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:02,119
-So Isumi went to China.

301
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:03,620
That's going to be interesting.

-Hikaru?

We're in different classes, so
I don't see him around much.

-If you're looking for
Shindo, he's in the library.

find the library,

go through the front door.

Then head up to
the second floor.

-Nothing much.

317

To tell you the truth, he
seemed a bit out of it.

-You sure it was Hikaru you saw?

00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,048
on the internet, he
seemed to change.

324
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:40,450
Did something happened to
him that I didn't know about?

325
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:46,273
-Shindo.

326
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:49,524
-Hmm?

327
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:53,564
-[sounds of alarm and surprise]

328
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:54,565
-Huh?

329
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:56,433
HIKARU: Toya, what
are you doing here?

330
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:57,501
I don't believe this.

331
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,303
You come here, and
sneak up me like that?

332
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:00,671
You almost gave
me a heart attack.

333
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:03,407
Don't ever do that again, OK?

334
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,510
-Shindo, why didn't you
come to the Young Lions

335
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:11,615
tournament, or the
dan promotion league?

336
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:13,116
You didn't show up there either.

337
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,619
-I didn't go because
I'm not good enough.

338
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:16,620
-Hmm?

339
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:18,188
What do you mean
you're not good enough?

340
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:20,057
Of course you are.

341
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,659
-There's no point in me playing
Go anymore, and that's that.

342
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:23,694
-Hmm?

343
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:26,096
STUDENT: Would you
keep the noise down?

344
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,131
-I think you're more
than good enough.

345
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:29,099
-Huh?

346
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:30,270
Toya?

347
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,542
(THINKING) The only
reason you think

348
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:41,545
that is because you're
looking at Sai instead of me.

349
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:46,283
I'm never going to play again.

350
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:50,020
--[gasp] (SHOUTING)
You can't do that.

351
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,956
You have to play, you hear?

352
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,959
-(THINKING) The one you're
waiting for isn't me.

353
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:56,493
It's Sai.

354
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:01,398
But now Sai has disappeared.

355
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:08,005
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:08,438
-Shindo!

357
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:16,146
-(THINKING) I'm sorry,
Toya, but Sai is gone.

358
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:18,382
I wish I could let you play him.

359
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:21,685
But he's gone.

360
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:23,420
-Shindo, wait.

361
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:25,355
Have you forgotten
why you became a pro

362
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:26,990
in the first place?

363
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:29,559
-(THINKING) Why did you
have to leave me, Sai?

364
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:31,662
Why?

365
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:34,031
-You became a pro so
you could play me.

366
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,032
Hey, Shindo!

367
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:44,307
(THINKING) Shindo.

368
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:52,649
-Sai!

369
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:57,087
[music playing]

370
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:21,538
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Next time, we're

371
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:24,441
going back to when I
was in seventh grade.

372
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:26,343
There's this girl who's
trying to get back

373
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:29,546
an expensive bowl that was
stolen from her grandfather.

374
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,515
Me and Sai want to help her out.

375
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:33,016
We're going to
play a game of Go.

376
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,551
And the winner gets the bowl.

377
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:37,287
But the owner of the
store says he's a 5-dan.

378
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,555
This won't be an easy match.

379
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,363
Next time, [inaudible]
flower bowls.
