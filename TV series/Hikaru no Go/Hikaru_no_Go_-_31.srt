00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,729
-Huh?

169
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,630
[music playing]

170
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,475
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Oh come on.

171
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,011
Where is he?

172
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:05,979
[music playing]

173
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,655
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): He's been
gone for like half an hour.

174
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,892
What could he be doing?

175
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:19,859
[music playing]

176
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,806
-Huh?

177
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,010
-At least now we can
continue on with the game.

178
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,011
[music playing]

179
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,031
-Come on, Hikaru.

180
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,132
Don't lose your composure.

181
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,541
[music playing]

182
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,076
-He put the stone
back in his bowl.

183
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,444
Why'd he do that?

184
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,718
-Ladies and gentlemen
it's time for lunch.

185
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,719
Please stop your clocks.

186
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,791
-Hey, you want to go grab
a quick bite to eat, kid?

187
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,960
-Who, me?

188
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,562
-You're one of the Insei, right?

189
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,064
So you've got to know the
best place to eat around here.

190
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:05,898
Show me.

191
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:06,799
-Hikaru, what are you doing?

192
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,700
Don't go!

193
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,935
-I don't think I have a choice.

194
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,210
-Tough luck, Shindou.

195
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,177
-A burger?

196
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,646
Don't be stupid.

197
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,180
I can't eat that.

198
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,116
Look, let's try this
place, what do you say?

199
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:23,716
Huh?

200
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,224
Don't look so worried.

201
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,659
This lunch is on me.

202
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,927
Save your allowance for
something else, kid.

203
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,597
-I wasn't really worried
about that, but thanks.

204
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,066
-So what is bugging you?

205
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,902
Now tell me, what
was your name again?

206
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,070
-It's Shindou.

207
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,040
-Well my name's Tsubaki,
just like the samurai.

208
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,508
Pretty cool, don't you think?

209
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,510
There was once a
mighty samurai who

210
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,079
went by the name
of Sanjuro Tsubaki.

211
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,681
-Yeah right.

212
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,683
-What, don't you believe me?

213
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,784
-Can I ask you something?

214
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,752
You know when you
disappeared for the first 30

215
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:00,653
minutes of the match?

216
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,155
Where did you go exactly?

217
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,590
-I went for a quick
ride on my bike.

218
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,093
It helps me to relax a bit.

219
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,795
Yeah, believe it or
not, even someone

220
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,496
like me feels the pressure.

221
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,931
Gets to us all in the end.

222
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,733
I ain't gonna win
unless I play my best.

223
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,468
And I play my best
when I'm calm.

224
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,937
You play when you're all tense,
and you're not going to win.

225
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,640
So I took a break for a
half hour just to chill out.

226
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,443
But you seem to be getting
more and more wound up.

227
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,781
We're given two hours to play.

228
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,150
It's totally up to
me how I use it.

229
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,087
-I never realized you
were allowed to do that.

230
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,755
-Well, how much
game time do they

231
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,657
give you to play as
an Insei student?

232
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,759
-Well, if you're in the
A league you get an hour.

233
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,927
But if you're in the B league?

234
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,961
Just 30 minutes.

235
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,596
-So I guess this
is your first match

236
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,732
with two hours of playing time.

237
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,899
-Yep.

238
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,668
-And that means this is
the first time you've ever

239
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,436
had a break in the
middle of the game?

240
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,638
-Yep.

241
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,173
-Explains why you let
me have the chance

242
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,842
to play the last stone.

243
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,176
-Huh?

244
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,045
-I made sure the
morning session ended

245
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,848
while it was still
my turn to move.

246
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:06,052
So now I can think about
my next move, while I eat.

247
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,120
Take my time.

248
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,490
And decide exactly
where I want to move.

249
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,959
-Oh.

250
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,527
-Nice position to be in.

251
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,529
You have no idea
where I'll move,

252
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,231
so you can't plan
anything of your own.

253
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,532
All you can do is wonder.

254
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,603
Seems all I have
to do is look at

255
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,938
and you wet your pants, kiddo.

256
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,140
-I'm not scared of you!

257
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,741
Not a bit.

258
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,577
-I guess most of your games
have been against other kids.

259
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,746
In which case, it's time
for you to wise up and learn

260
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,716
how things work in
the grownup world.

261
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,552
Eat up before your
noodles go soggy.

262
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,221
-I'm not hungry anymore.

263
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,824
-Hikaru is completely
intimidated.

264
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,093
There's no way he can win now.

265
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,027
[locusts]

266
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,768
-Oh!

267
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,770
-It's over, kid.

268
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,725
-Mhm.

269
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,911
-So, did you win?

270
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:05,511
-Mhm.

271
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,886
-I win by four
and a half points.

272
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,856
Hey, thanks for the game, kiddo.

273
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:17,657
-Thanks.

274
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,158
You played a strong game.

275
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,193
-Oh, come on.

276
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,994
You can't let one little
loss get you down.

277
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,796
Pull yourself together.

278
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,665
I don't know about you,
but after that game,

279
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:30,636
I feel like I'm on a bit of
a roll, all because of you.

280
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,737
See you, kid.

281
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,779
-What a jerk.

282
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,781
-Um, Shindou.

283
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:42,648
-What's the matter?

284
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,650
Did you lose the game?

285
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,152
-Yeah, and all
because I didn't know

286
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,121
how important the last
move before the break was.

287
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:52,525
-What are you talking about?

288
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,893
-You're so silly.

289
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,228
It's no big deal.

290
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,696
-Are you sure?

291
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,465
-Sometimes it's better to forget
about the game during lunch.

292
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,067
What's important is
the change of pace.

293
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,603
I like going into the break
when it's the other guys turn,

294
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,705
and that way I get
a chance to relax.

295
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,139
-I don't care either way.

296
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,908
-I'm with the
gorilla on this one.

297
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,110
I like having a chance
to plan my next move.

298
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,146
Sometimes that extra hour
makes all the difference.

299
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,514
-You think too much about it.

300
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,782
You might make a mistake.

301
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,618
Anyway, the point
is, it doesn't really

302
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,753
matter who has the next
turn after the break.

303
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,489
It's not like we
have to seal a move.

304
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,557
-What's seal a move?

305
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,925
-Seal a move is seal a move.

306
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,994
You mean you don't know?

307
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,161
-Nope.

308
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,063
-You know that the big
title matches happen over

309
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,164
two days, right?

310
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:33,933
When they get to the
end of the first day,

311
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,434
the next move isn't played.

312
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,904
It's written down and sealed
in an envelope, ready for when

313
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,572
they start up
again the next day.

314
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,207
That way it's fair
for both players.

315
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,708
-Two days?

316
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,877
There are matches that
last for two days?

317
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,079
-I can't believe you
don't even know that.

318
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,782
Yes, there are matches
that last for two days.

319
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,951
Of course, only a few
of the world's top pros

320
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,519
actually get to play in them.

321
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,091
It's going to be a long
time before any of us

322
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,127
reach that level.

323
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,629
Now you've got to learn to
stop worrying about your match

324
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,931
during the lunch break.

325
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,599
And you've got to learn not to
let the other guy intimidate

326
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,767
you.

327
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,001
The only reason he quit
the room for half an hour

328
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,436
was to try and throw you off.

329
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:12,704
Scare tactics.

330
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:14,573
He had it all planned,
and you fell for it.

331
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,807
-I know.

332
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,108
-How are you ever going to
cope if you let something

333
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:18,543
like that affect your game?

334
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,412
Remember that once
we get to the finals,

335
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,813
we all have three hours to play.

336
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:22,914
Not two.

337
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,716
-Why are you making such
a big deal about it?

338
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,985
-Because I'm the one who's
playing gorilla man tomorrow,

339
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:27,819
OK?

340
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,454
And I'm going to beat him.

341
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:30,789
-This is my station.

342
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:31,756
I'll see ya.

343
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,960
-See ya later!

344
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,127
-Poor Shindou.

345
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,562
-Huh?

346
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:39,931
-He doesn't seem to know
very much about title matches

347
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,466
and stuff, does he?

348
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:42,834
-Guess not.

349
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,470
-And gorilla man
really freaked him out.

350
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:46,972
-That guy'd freak anyone out.

351
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,407
He's horrible.

352
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,710
-You know how we started
playing in a Go Salon?

353
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,612
We got to play all
sorts of adults.

354
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,747
And some of them were
pretty high ranking, too.

355
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,783
I get the impression
Shindou's never done that.

356
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,951
-Yeah.

357
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,587
And then we went on to
study with a pro for awhile.

358
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,556
-The only training
Shindou seems to have had

359
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,691
was a year in a
junior high Go club.

360
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,560
And he's had very
little experience

361
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:09,961
competing in tournaments.

362
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:12,097
I think he's only entered
a couple small ones.

363
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,832
-What are you getting at?

364
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,567
-With that sort
of background, how

365
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,535
come he's this close
to turning pro?

366
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:20,071
-Are you saying that
he's some sort of genius?

367
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,573
-I don't know about genius.

368
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,675
But have you noticed
how fragile he is, even

369
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,543
when he's playing well?

370
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:29,981
They say the faster you
rise, the harder you fall.

371
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,818
Not that it's anything
to do with me.

372
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:34,886
-Uh, Hikaru.

373
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,821
Your father and I have
to go out tomorrow.

374
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:38,590
Could you keep an eye
on the house for us?

375
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:40,959
-Sorry, I've got another
pro exam tomorrow.

376
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,693
-You what?

377
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,094
What exam's that?

378
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,563
-For professional Go players.

379
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:47,132
-Who's taking this exam?

380
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,100
-I am.

381
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,970
-And what's it for again?

382
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:54,906
-It's the pro exam, mom.

383
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,540
-Ah!

384
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:57,342
Oh my goodness.

385
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,513
So Hikaru, you're taking an
exam to play Go as a pro?

386
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:02,514
-Yeah.

387
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:05,016
-But Hikaru, why
would you do that?

388
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,551
You're just a teenager.

389
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:07,786
-So what?

390
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,087
Why shouldn't I take it?

391
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,656
There are other kids my age who
have already made it as pros.

392
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,661
-But Hikaru, you mean you want
to play Go professionally?

393
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,862
As a career?

394
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,098
Well you haven't mentioned
anything about this to me

395
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,533
before, dear.

396
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:22,968
-Oh, thought I had.

397
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,936
-Earlier on you
said another exam.

398
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,471
How long's this been going--

399
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:29,441
-Mom, stop bugging me!

400
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:30,942
-Don't you talk to me like that.

401
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,944
If you really want to
play Go professionally,

402
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,713
then I should know about it.

403
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:39,417
-What I want to do with my
life is my business, not yours.

404
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:40,719
-Now hold on.

405
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,721
I don't have a problem with you
playing Go in your spare time,

406
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,122
if that's what you want to do.

407
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,824
But not when your
grades at school

408
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,726
have been getting
worse and worse.

409
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,694
If you spent more time
studying, then you

410
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:51,596
could play Go or whatever
else you wanted to,

411
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:53,098
and I wouldn't mind a bit.

412
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,100
-Who cares about grades?

413
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,735
Once I pass the
pro exam, they're

414
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,570
not going to matter anyway.

415
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:00,605
-Oh!

416
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:04,976
-Now I understand why Waya's
so desperate to pass the test.

417
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,512
If you want to know,
I lost my game today.

418
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:09,581
Are you happy now?

419
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:10,882
-Hikaru.

420
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:13,651
-Call me when dinner's ready.

421
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,653
A pro?

422
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,689
But what is he thinking?

423
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,891
He can't be serious, can he?

424
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,600
-Gorilla man's here already?

425
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,834
Hm.

426
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:30,702
Why should I care?

427
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,003
I'm not playing him today.

428
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,039
He can't intimidate me anymore.

429
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,713
I've got to make sure he
comes nowhere near me.

430
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:44,015
-Nothing I can say will help
you with this one, Hikaru.

431
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:49,921
-Where is he?

432
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:50,955
I can't see him anywhere.

433
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,980
-Oh, hi!

434
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:01,699
-Hi there!

435
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,835
-Yo!

436
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:04,969
Good luck today, kiddo.

437
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,472
Don't let the fact you lost
yesterday get you down.

438
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:09,641
Remember, we only need to
win three out of the five

439
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:10,942
to get through to the finals.

440
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:11,743
Hahaha.

441
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,344
-Haha yourself.

442
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,319
-But as soon as you lose three
games you're out for good, kiddo!

443
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:20,729
-What is it with him?

444
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:23,532
I've only lost one game so far.

445
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:24,199
-Uhoh.

446
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,068
Shindou's letting it get to him.

-Will you stop shouting at me?

452

Can't you see I'm trying
to concentrate here?

453
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:29,991
-The greater the pressure,
