2
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,406
-I don't think he's here either.

3
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:07,144
I don't understand Sai.

4
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:09,816
Why wouldn't you want to
come back to Torajiro's home?

5
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:17,664
-OK, that's it.

6
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:19,368
I've had enough.

7
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,372
Why can't you get it
through your thick skull,

8
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:23,810
I never said anything
about 50,000 yen.

9
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,814
Where did you get that idea?

10
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:26,783
Huh?

11
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:29,287
Come on, say
something, you moron.

12
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:30,556
-Mr. Kawai, what's wrong?

13
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:37,202
-Don't give me that attitude!

14
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:38,839
I'm not done dealing
with you yet.

15
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:43,714
-You held up five fingers.

16
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:46,287
That means 50,000, right?

17
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,558
Anyone with half a
brain would know that.

18
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:49,726
-No, it does not.

19
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,797
It means 5,000 no 50.

20
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:52,866
-Not my problem.

21
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:54,769
You should have made
that clear at the start.

22
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:56,439
It's too late now, you loser.

23
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,808
-Who are you calling a loser?

24
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:59,512
You're the loser.

25
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:00,614
-Let's get out of here.

26
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,685
-Are you with that guy
in the sunglasses who's

27
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:04,187
causing all this trouble?

28
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:05,590
-Uh, yeah.

29
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,926
-A little word of advice.

30
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,729
Around here it isn't
such a good idea

31
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:11,902
to brag about being
a Giant's fan.

32
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:14,741
You've got to remember,
this is home territory

33
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,612
for the Hiroshima Carp.

34
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:19,183
I know Shuhai brought up
the subject of baseball,

35
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:19,951
but even so.

36
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:21,420
-Baseball?

37
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:24,226
-Your friend should have know
better than to insult the Carp.

38
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,697
He deserves whatever's
coming to him.

39
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:28,501
-Him and his big mouth.

40
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:31,606
-Just leave whatever cash
you've got and get out of here.

41
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:33,777
Think of it as a
cheap go lesson.

42
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:35,247
-A lesson from you?

43
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,850
Who do you think you are?

44
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,487
Play another game,
then we'll see

45
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,858
who needs to be taught a lesson.

46
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:41,593
-Oh, forget it.

47
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:42,427
Forget it.

48
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,364
It would be a waste of my time.

49
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:46,435
-Mr. Kawai, come on.

50
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:47,504
-Hm.

51
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:49,274
-If you want to get
yourself into a fight,

52
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:50,610
them I'm going to go home.

53
00:03:50,643 --> 00:03:51,912
-Can't you wait for one game?

54
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:54,183
It won't take long, I promise.

55
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:55,887
SHUHAI (VOICEOVER): Is
that who I think it is?

56
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,222
-Hurry up.

57
00:03:57,222 --> 00:03:58,291
Get your stones off the
board so we can play.

58
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,226
-Do it yourself.

59
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:00,562
I'm done with you.

60
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:01,664
-What do you mean?

61
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:02,666
-What about you?

62
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,704
You want to play a game?

63
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:07,643
And I'll tell you
what, if you win,

64
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:11,751
I'll forget about the money
your friend here owes me.

65
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,656
-Oh, you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

66
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:16,393
You're in for a surprise.

67
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:18,564
he may look like an
ordinary kid to you,

68
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:19,933
but he-- -I know who he is.

69
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,837
He's Shindou, the pro, right?

70
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,437
[growl]

71
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:22,939
-Huh?

72
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,341
That kid is a pro?

73
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,845
-But he's just a boy.

74
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:27,514
MALE SPEAKER 1 (VOICEOVER): He
doesn't look like a pro to me.

75
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:29,918
MALE SPEAKER 2 (VOICEOVER): He's
the same age as my grandson.

76
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:33,326
-So if you know he's a pro,
how come you're so confident?

77
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:36,799
-I saw one of his games in
Go Weekly against the Meijin

78
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:37,968
in the Shin Showdown Series.

79
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:41,241
He played badly.

80
00:04:41,274 --> 00:04:43,812
You'd expect the pros to
play better than us amateurs,

81
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:46,451
wouldn't you?

82
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,287
-Just who are you anyway?

83
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,491
-Mr. Shuhai is going
to be representing

84
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:53,497
Japan in the next world
amateur championship.

85
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:56,370
He's probably the best
amateur in the country.

86
00:04:56,403 --> 00:05:00,043
-The best amateur
in the country?

87
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:03,717
-When I play pros from Gonzai,
I play without a handicap.

88
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:08,793
So 5,000 yen really is
a cheap lesson for you.

89
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:10,564
-You're pitch-hitting for me.

90
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:11,399
-What?

91
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:12,801
I don't wanna.

92
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:13,970
-Get a move on.

93
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:16,608
You're going to teach
this guy a lesson.

94
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:17,410
-Wait a minute.

95
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,982
Mr. Kawai.

96
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:23,455
-Sit down and play, all right?

97
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,860
Now, this will wipe the
smirk off your face.

98
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:26,795
-Didn't you hear me?

99
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:30,335
I already said
I'm done with you.

100
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:32,305
-Hey, I'm counting
on you, kiddo.

101
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,474
Don't lose.

102
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:35,845
-Mr. Kawai, you sure
this is a good idea?

103
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,417
-All right, then.

104
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:40,020
Let's have ourselves a game.

105
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,826
-Mr. Shuhai is actually
going to play a pro?

106
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:43,895
-This I got to see.

107
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:44,830
Come on, let's watch.

108
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:50,340
-I'm going to play first.

109
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,010

111
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,483
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Looks like I'm

112
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:56,886
playing whether
I want to or not.

113
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:10,412
-By the way, what
brought the two of you

114
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:11,848
all the way out here?

115
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:12,883
-A little break.

116
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:14,687
-But why come here?

117
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,024
-We wanted to visit all the
different Honinbo Shusaku

118
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:17,793
sites.

119
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:18,761
We even found his grave.

120
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,576
-You know Shusaku has a
memorial in Tokyo too?

121
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,511
-Huh?

122
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:29,382
There's one in Tokyo?

123
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:30,618
-Yes.

124
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:33,089
Although Shusaku spent his
childhood here in Innoshima,

125
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:36,595
once he began playing in the
castle games, he moved to Edo.

126
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,134
After his untimely
death, his followers

127
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:41,138
built a second memorial there.

128
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:42,006
You didn't know?

129
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,790
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Torajiro
has another memorial?

130
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,932
-Do you know where
it is in Tokyo?

131
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:58,070
-Who really cares
about that right now?

132
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,074
Concentrate on playing the game.

133
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:01,644
-Your friend is right.

134
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:03,815
You don't want to lose
to an amateur, do you?

135
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:13,099
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): If Torajiro
has a memorial in Tokyo,

136
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,741
then maybe that's where Sai is.

137
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:18,810
That's got to be it.

138
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,714
Sai would never have
made it out to somehwere

139
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:21,816
as far as Hiroshima.

140
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:27,093
He's still in Tokyo.

141
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,163
He has to be.

142
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:30,867
-So where's this memorial?

143
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,837
-I'll find out after
the game's finished.

144
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,574
You focus on winning, OK?

145
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:37,847
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sai.

146
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,695
I want to go back home
right now, back to Tokyo.

147
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:09,474
-The kid's playing real fast.

148
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:11,545
-You can tell he's a pro.

149
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:14,184
-You're not using
any of your time.

150
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:16,488
You should probably
think about your moves.

151
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:20,830
-What do you think you're doing?

152
00:08:20,863 --> 00:08:21,597
Take your time.

153
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,834
Don't rush.

154
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,071
If you play that fast, you're
going to make a mistake.

155
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,807
-Looks like you're
going to have to wipe

156
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,045
the smirk off your face.

157
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:30,548
-Take it easy there, kiddo.

158
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:31,884
Please, just play
more carefully.

159
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,961
Didn't you hear me?

160
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:38,029
Slow down!

161
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:41,503
-Hm.

162
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:54,309
Hm.

163
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:00,171
-Look at that.

164
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:02,877
I think the kid's playing even
faster than he was before.

165
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:04,914
-I sure hope he's not
underestimating Shuhai.

166
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:06,918
MALE SPEAKER 2 (VOICEOVER):
The kid's bluffing.

167
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:08,621
Thinks he can get
Shuhai all flustered.

168
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:09,557
Not a chance.

169
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,792
-You think he's bluffing?

170
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,530
If you knew Shindou, you'd
know he doesn't bluff.

171
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:19,542
-He might be playing fast,
but he knows what he's doing.

172
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:22,815
He's just a kid, but without a
doubt, you can tell he's a pro.

173
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:37,209
SHUHAI (VOICEOVER): Now that
he's captured the corners,

174
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,549
he's got more territory than me.

175
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:42,052
Even though I'm using
my time to think,

176
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:45,258
he's still managing to
stay one step ahead of me.

177
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,095
-Feeling the pressure yet?

178
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:48,097
-You keep out of this.

179
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:49,533
We've just started.

180
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,838
Like the Hiroshima Carp, I
don't show my real strength

181
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,908
until the later innings.

182
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:56,046
SHUHAI (VOICEOVER):
Don't rush the game.

183
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,148
I've got to take my time.

184
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:06,165
It's hard not to get sucked
into playing at his pace.

185
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:08,569
If he won't slow down, I'll
have to try another tactic.

186
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:15,315
I'll set a trap and force
him into making an error.

187
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:24,333
Huh?

188
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,136
He saw right through it
in the blink of an eye.

189
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:30,713
-Playing this fast ain't fair.

190
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:33,985
He's just doing it to get
his opponent all flustered.

191
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:34,987
-Are you sure?

192
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:36,290
Most people would
have made a mistake

193
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:37,726
by now playing like that.

194
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,819
-I don't understand how he
can make his move so quickly.

195
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:54,257
Surely, he's not making
it up on the spot?

196
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,263
-Nope, he's got plenty
of time to think.

197
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:58,833
-Hm?

198
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,770
-Look.

199
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:03,909
While Shuhai is thinking
about his next move,

200
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:07,182
the kid is already planning
how he is going to respond.

201
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,869
KAWAI (VOICEOVER):
This is amazing.

202
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:19,673
Shindou is a completely
different player

203
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:21,610
from when I saw him last year.

204
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:22,979
How could he have
changed so much?

205
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:37,975
-Take that.

206
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,858
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Chances are pretty

207
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:05,327
good that he'll
bump my stone here.

208
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:08,000
If he doesn't, he'll
attach over here,

209
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,402
and I'll play on the other side.

210
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,746
Yes.

211
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:35,319
Now, if I can get over
here, I'll stay in control.

212
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,188
-OK, I resign.

213
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:59,431
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Yes.

214
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:01,969
-Whoo.

215
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:05,175
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Sai, how'd I do?

216
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:05,777
-Huh?

217
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:11,721
Why are you looking at me?

218
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:12,891
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Oh, yeah.

219
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:13,993
I forgot.

220
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,396
Sai isn't here.

221
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,765
He's in Tokyo.

222
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:20,104
-So where exactly is
this Shusaku memorial?

223
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:23,110
-It's in Sugamo, at the--
what's it called now?

224
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:25,081
Oh yes, at Honmiogi.

225
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,784
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Honmiogi in Sugamo.

226
00:13:29,456 --> 00:13:31,493
-Thank you very
much for the game.

227
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,163
OK, you ready to go home?

228
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:35,333
-Uh, sure.

229
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,302
-Not so fast.

230
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,981
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Uh-oh.

231
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:44,084
What's he going to do?

232
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:47,758
I know I beat him, but
it was only a game.

233
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,895
-I'll give you both a
ride to the station.

234
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,500
Follow me.

235
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:53,102
-But?

236
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:02,352
-I never expected you
to give us a ride.

237
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:03,421
What's up?

238
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:05,291
You feel like you've
got to be nice to us

239
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:06,894
because the kid demolished you?

240
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:10,835
-Don't think so, seeing as how I
demolished you first, remember?

241
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:11,904
-Dah.

242
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:13,908
Hey, you want to let
me take over the wheel?

243
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:16,146
I'm a professional
cab driver back home.

244
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:17,815
-This isn't your
town, so you wouldn't

245
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:18,918
know where you were going.

246
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:20,454
You stay back there.

247
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:21,389
-What?

248
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:22,525
-Stop fighting, would you?

249
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:25,096
I just want to get there
as fast as possible.

250
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,265
-You're in a rush, huh?

251
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,868
Then I'll take you
to a station where

252
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:29,337
you can catch the bullet train.

253
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:32,844
-Whoa.

254
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,425
This guy drives
crazier than I do.

255
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,464
-Yeah, believe me,
that's saying something.

256
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:45,202
-I got an idea, Shindou.

257
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:46,404
I know that you beat me today.

258
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,146
I'll be coming up
to Tokyo to play

259
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:54,085
in the world amateur
championship.

260
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:56,891
How about you and me
meeting up for a rematch?

261
00:14:56,924 --> 00:15:00,130
-Hey, I'm not letting him
play someone like you.

262
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:02,100
-No one asked you, so be quiet.

263
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:15,860
-Hikaru Shindou.

264
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,404
I can't believe he's
still in the ninth grade.

265
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,577
That kid's got a bright future.

266
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:27,583
One day he's going to have
the world of Go at his feet.

267
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,485
That's for sure.

268
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:35,832
But that game he played
against Toya Meijin

269
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:39,306
in the Shin Showdown
Series, it was terrible.

270
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:42,177
He played so badly.

271
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:43,380
It doesn't make any sense.

272
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,605
-Hey.

273
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,509
Where are you going?

274
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:00,112
What's the big rush anyway?

275
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:14,606
-Sai?

276
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,545
Sai?

277
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,351
Hey, Sai.

278
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:22,589
Where are you?

279
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:23,424
Sai?

280
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:26,295
Come on, I know you're here.

281
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:28,500
Sai, it's me.

282
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,972
Sai.

283
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:31,973
Where are you?

284
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:38,452
Come on, Sai.

285
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:40,523
Sai?

286
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:41,124
Sai!

287
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:47,937
It doesn't look like
he's here either.

288
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,420
Sai.

289
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:57,389
-Hey, you seen enough?

290
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:58,925
Oh boy.

291
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,530
You've been running all over the
place at these memorials sites.

292
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:03,033
What's going with you?

293
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:04,703
Are you looking for something?

294
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:10,147
You tried the Go Association?

295
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,451
They got all sorts of
affluent Go in there.

296
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:15,624
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I
already looked there.

297
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:19,130
He wasn't at Grandpa's either.

298
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,303
Sai, where have you gone to?

299
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:23,973
-Are you all right?

300
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:26,612
Huh, kiddo?

301
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:30,987
-Would you get
your hands off me?

302
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,189
Just leave me alone.

303
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:32,656
-Wait.

304
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,193
Where you going?

305
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:37,366
You could at least say goodbye,
or come by the Go salon.

306
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:39,670
Everyone there's cheering
for you, you know?

307
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:44,178
I give up.

308
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:46,216
I don't even understand
why we went to Hiroshima

309
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:49,122
in the first place.

310
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:50,357
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I'm home.

311
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:52,528
-Hikaru, where have you been?

312
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:54,966
You could have called me.

313
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,536
I've told you before,
you need to tell me

314
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,675
where you're going
when you go out.

315
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,579
You've got a lot going on.

316
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:04,685
I understand, and
that's OK, but you

317
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,457
have to realize
you're still a child.

318
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,728
Hikaru, come back here.

319
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:10,329
-Sai?

320
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:33,507
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Playing
against that Shuhai guy

321
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,479
was tough.

322
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,349
I'm beat.

323
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,618
-You try the Go Association?

324
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:46,131
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
Maybe I should

325
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:48,101
go take another look,
just to be sure.

326
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:53,311
-Huh?

327
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:55,449
Hikaru, wait a minute.

328
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,219
Where are you going?

329
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:58,321
-Go Association.

330
00:18:58,355 --> 00:19:00,024
-But it's late.

331
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:00,659
What about dinner?

332
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:01,260
Hikaru!

333
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:15,120
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I
guess he isn't here.

334
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:15,603
Sai.

335
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:19,395
Why did you just disappear?

336
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:23,603
It doesn't make sense.

337
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:30,684
I remember him saying
something about it

338
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:34,491
at Grandpa's house, something
about him leaving me.

339
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:39,768
But I didn't take him seriously.

340
00:19:42,707 --> 00:19:47,582
I mean, I never thought
he would disappear.

341
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:57,468
I never imagined it
could actually happen.

342
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:04,649
-Who's there?

343
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:09,826
Shindou, what are you
doing here so late?

344
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:10,861
Did you forget something?

345
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:16,872
-Is there anywhere
here I could--

346
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:17,540
-Huh?

347
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,809
What's that?

348
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,615
-I know this sounds silly, but
where could I see a ghost here?

349
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:23,719
-You want to see a ghost?

350
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:27,125
(LAUGHING) Well, the
building is fairly old,

351
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,332
and it is night time, so I guess
the chances are fairly good.

352
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:36,209
-Thanks anyway.

353
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:36,676
-Wait.

354
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:38,113
Let me think.

355
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:41,820
I did hear about this one room.

356
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:43,523
-Which room?

357
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:45,594
-Uh-hm.

358
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:46,362
I'll show you.

359
00:20:53,910 --> 00:21:04,163
[theme music]

360
00:22:21,846 --> 00:22:24,384
-If I knew Sai was going
to disappear like this,

361
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,843
I would have let him play
all the games he wanted.

362
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:29,878
Toya wants to have
a game against me,

363
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:32,644
but what's the point
of playing anymore?

364
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:36,882
Without Sai around, I'm never
going to get any better.

365
00:22:36,915 --> 00:22:38,650
From now on, I
won't play anyone.

366
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:39,885
That's it.

367
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:40,886
I'm finished.

368
00:22:40,886 --> 00:22:43,722
It's all over.

369
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:48,159
Next time, I'm never
going to play again.
