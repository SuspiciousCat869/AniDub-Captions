00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:07,611
NARRATOR: After many
years inside a go board,

2
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:11,483
a spirit from the past known as
Fujiwara no Sai has returned.

3
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:14,989
Visible only to Hikaru
Shindo, master of go,

4
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:17,526
Sai seeks to play
the divine move.

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,529
[theme music]

6
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,129
-I resign.

7
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:55,568
[sigh]

8
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:59,340
-I used to think that you were
capable of the divine move.

9
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:00,042
I was wrong.

10
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:08,454
-I'm having a little
trouble trying

11
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:09,789
to figure out my next move.

12
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:11,525
Should I try to connect here?

13
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:14,696
-But what if your opponent
puts you in atari?

14
00:02:14,696 --> 00:02:17,434
-I hear that Akira-sensei
is taking the pro test.

15
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:18,168
-Oh?

16
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:19,335
Yeah, so it seems.

17
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:22,507
-I heard the same thing
this morning from Mr. Muroi.

18
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,645
-Miss Ichikawa, is
Toya taking the test?

19
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,613
-Yes.

20
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,384
-Ah, so it is true.

21
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,820
Well, that's really big news.

22
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:35,426
The world of go is going to
get pretty exciting next year.

23
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,197
-I have to admit, I'm
a little surprised.

24
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:40,100
I was under the impression
that Akira-sensei

25
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,670
had decided not
to take the test.

26
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,507
Do you have any idea
why he changed his mind?

27
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,409
Did something happen?

28
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:47,677
-I don't know.

29
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,548
I asked him how things
were going at the go club,

30
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:55,255
and he told me that
he'd had enough of it.

31
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:59,261
He said it was just
a diversion anyway.

32
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:01,631
-Could I get another cup of tea?

33
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:03,199
-Be right there.

34
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,102
-Hey, the NCC Cup
is about to come on.

35
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,218
-Sign up for an
annual subscription

36
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:20,291
to Go Weekly Magazine and you'll
save 10% off the cover price.

37
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:22,761
-Thanks to the internet, you
can now play go against people

38
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:24,664
all over the world.

39
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:26,167
This computer's already online.

40
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,469
Why not give it a go?

41
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:29,604
-Seat 29.

42
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:30,740
Here it is!

43
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:37,750
-Don't you think we're kind
of far away from the front?

44
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,487
How much fun is this going to
be if we can't see the match?

45
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,789
-You worry too much, Hikaru.

46
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:43,392
A couple of pros
will be analyzing

47
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:45,628
each move on a huge board.

48
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:46,729
-Are you serious?

49
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:48,532
If there's people
talking during the game,

50
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:51,771
won't it bother the players?

51
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:54,775
-I don't think they mind.

52
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:58,280
-Oh, look at that go board!

53
00:03:58,314 --> 00:04:02,352
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): I'm glad
Sai sounds like he's having fun.

54
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:05,157
-The game should
start any minute now.

55
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,491
-Good afternoon, everyone.

56
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,430
Welcome to the 14th
annual NCC Cup.

57
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:12,334
We're about to begin game
five of the first round.

58
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:15,839
Today's match will be
between Kikuo Fujisawa 9-dan,

59
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:18,109
and Koichi Takada 7-dan.

60
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:19,577
Please give them a
round of applause.

61
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:20,579
[applause]

62
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:23,316
-Our commentators
are Murase 9-dan,

63
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,451
assisted by Yoshinaga 2-dan.

64
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,795
Now the match is about to begin.

65
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,502
Mr. Murase, can you
give our audience

66
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:40,108
a quick rundown on what we can
expect to see in today's game?

67
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:41,376
-It'd be my pleasure.

68
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,447
As we all know, Fujisawa 9-dan
has set his sights on both

69
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:45,415
the Mejin and--

70
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:46,550
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
I'm not really

71
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:48,252
proud of what I did to Sai.

72
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:50,555
He was really looking
forward to facing Akira,

73
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:51,791
and I wound up playing instead.

74
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:52,659
Oh, man.

75
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:57,833
I have to find out.

76
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,635
I know Akira's more
skilled than me,

77
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,407
but I'll never know how big that
gap is until I play him myself.

78
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,276
I have to make my move!

79
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:10,451
-Stop messing around!

80
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,889
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Akira wanted
to play against Sai so much.

81
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:16,360
What I did to him was horrible.

82
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:18,763
-A fascinating move!

83
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:21,702
I'd like to take a closer look
at some of these formations.

84
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:23,136
Look here.

85
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,376
My guess is that white will
probably take this point.

86
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,346
-You're at 25 seconds.

87
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,282
6, 7.

88
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:32,550
-White 4-12.

89
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,652
-Aha.

90
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:35,555
-Sensei, it seems your
prediction was great.

91
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:38,859
-Well, I'm not a TV analyst
just because I'm good looking,

92
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:39,461
you know.

93
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:10,406
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Hm.

94
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,243
I just don't know
what I should do.

95
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:15,880
I want to let Sai
play once in a while,

96
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:18,417
but then I'll wind up the
king of the fluke wins.

97
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,591
But forcing him to watch my
games all the time isn't fair.

98
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,295
-This friendly match has now
turned into a fierce showdown.

99
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:28,165
-You're at 20 seconds.

100
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:31,402
1, 2, 3, 4.

101
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:32,838
-Black 4-13.

102
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:36,677
-That seems like a rushed move.

103
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,678
-What just happened?

104
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:39,381
I haven't been watching
the game at all.

105
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:42,552
-It appears this stone
is about to be captured.

106
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:43,821
-You're completely right.

107
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,891
He could have attempted
an atari from this side.

108
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:48,327
But would it have worked?

109
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,796
Let's give it a try and see.

110
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,600
So if white played here,
then black would move here.

111
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:55,370
-Kimihiro, how long do you
want to keep watching this?

112
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:56,473
-Are you bored already?

113
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:58,342
We're not even halfway
through the match yet.

114
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,844
-I'm going to go hang
out in the lobby.

115
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,246
Catch you later.

116
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:01,813
-Hold on!

117
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:02,849
-Don't leave!

118
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,818
-I can't sit still
without doing anything

119
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:06,653
for the whole afternoon.

120
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:11,327
-This isn't fair! (CRYING)
I had been looking forward

121
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,532
to this all week!

122
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:15,014
-Relax.

123
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:18,720
-[crying]

124
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:21,424
-Hey, look, they're
selling some cool go books.

125
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:22,526
-Huh?

126
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:23,827
-And over there, you can
play go on a computer.

127
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,296
You want to try?

128
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,030
-Huh?

129
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:27,866
-Come on, let's go check it out.

130
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,365
-Did you come here
with your father?

131
00:07:49,398 --> 00:07:50,032
-Uh, no.

132
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:51,668
I'm with a friend.

133
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:53,671
-Oh, you're a go fan, huh?

134
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:55,006
Do you have your own computer?

135
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,408
-Uh, no, I don't.

136
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:57,543
-That's too bad.

137
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,646
Did you know that you can
play go on the internet?

138
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,814
-Can you show me how?

139
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,615
-Absolutely.

140
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,717
That's what I'm here for.

141
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,054
This boy is in the
middle of an online game.

142
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:07,057
He's playing as black.

143
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,526
Look.

144
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:10,361
His opponent has just placed
a white stone on the board.

145
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:12,431
Now it's black's turn to move.

146
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:14,000
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
What's this guy doing?

147
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:15,303
He shouldn't play there.

148
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:20,443
Told you.

149
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:22,680
-[growling]

150
00:08:22,713 --> 00:08:24,015
-Hey!

151
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:25,050
What are you doing?

152
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:26,919
This isn't a video game.

153
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:29,589
I'd better send his
opponent an apology.

154
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:35,031
Sorry for quitting in
the middle of the game.

155
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:35,832
Oh.

156
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:37,635
-What did he say?

157
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:38,836
You loser.

158
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:40,939
You shouldn't quit just
because you lost a few stones.

159
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:43,509
Grow up, moron?

160
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:45,713
-I wasn't fast enough.

161
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:47,549
-Oh, that's really cool!

162
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:50,354
-I bet this person is a kid.

163
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:51,621
-Really?

164
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:52,990
What makes you say that?

165
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:55,828
-Well, just look at his
username and the kind of message

166
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:58,398
he writes.

167
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:00,468
-What's a username?

168
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:04,540
-It's a name you can
use on the internet.

169
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:06,343
-Zelda?

170
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:08,446
And you think it's a kid, huh?

171
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,481
-That's my guess.

172
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:10,583
You see, when you're
online, you don't

173
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,884
have to reveal
what you look like,

174
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,422
or how old you are, or
even your real name.

175
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:15,390
Look.

176
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:16,491
All these people
from other countries

177
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:19,362
are playing here, too.

178
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:24,369
JPN stands for Japan, CHN
is China, and CAN is Canada.

179
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:27,340
There are also many players from
Germany and the United States.

180
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:28,709
-What's NLD?

181
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:29,978
-The Netherlands.

182
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:32,748
People on this list challenge
each other to matches.

183
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,584
The whole process is
really quick to learn.

184
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:35,051
Here.

185
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:36,487
I'll show you.

186
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:38,857
The first thing you have to
do is send a game request.

187
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:41,828
So you pick up an
opponent, click on match,

188
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:44,031
and see if they accept.

189
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:44,899
It's pretty simple.

190
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:47,002
See?

191
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:48,971
Want to give it a try?

192
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,441
-I'm not ready.

193
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:52,944
I've still got a bunch of
questions I'd like to ask you.

194
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:55,881
Would you mind showing me how
I can start playing a game?

195
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:56,650
-All right.

196
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:57,751
Where should we start?

197
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:59,887
Do you want to see how
to find our website?

198
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:01,023
-Yeah.

199
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:01,857
-OK.

200
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,660
We should open up a new window.

201
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:05,596
Now I'm going to
run a search for--

202
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,065
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): You don't
have to reveal who you are.

203
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:07,966
This is great.

204
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,669
-You click here and here.

205
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:22,821
-Sorry about this.

206
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,556
I'm still not very good at go.

207
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,625
-Don't worry about it.

208
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,728
What should you do if
white escapes here?

209
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:28,362
-Hm.

210
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:31,634
I'd move here.

211
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:32,702
How's that?

212
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:34,104
-Good.

213
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:35,607
-Are you sure?

214
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,008
Should I have played here?

215
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,711
-They're both good moves.

216
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:39,712
You're learning fast.

217
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:40,514
-Thanks.

218
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:42,350
That's nice of you to say.

219
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,950
-Hey, guys.

220
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:43,718
What's up?

221
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:45,053
Hm?

222
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:47,557
Hikaru isn't here?

223
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,426
-Aw, he's playing
go on the internet.

224
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,928
-That didn't take long.

225
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:51,863
When did he leave?

226
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:53,366
-What didn't take long?

227
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,502
-We both went to see a
professional game yesterday,

228
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:58,406
but he got bored pretty
quickly, so he took off.

229
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,776
It's kind of hard to get that
guy to sit still sometimes.

230
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:02,846
He didn't even bother to
ask who won the match.

231
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,080
-Huh.

232
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:05,683
Seriously?

233
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:07,152
-So where did he go?

234
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:08,922
-He was hanging
out in the lobby.

235
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:11,725
There was an online go
demonstration set up out there.

236
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,995
I have no idea why he
was so interested in it,

237
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:16,399
but he spent the entire
afternoon listening to this guy

238
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:18,902
explain how it worked.

239
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:20,738
It was really hard
to get those tickets.

240
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:22,875
I had to buy them
weeks in advance.

241
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:31,487
It's weird.

242
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:32,790
Why did he make such
a big deal about it?

243
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:34,692
He doesn't even own a computer.

244
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:37,163
-Yuki's sister has a part
time job at an internet cafe.

245
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,433
He could use a
computer there, right?

246
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,701
-Where is it?

247
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,903
-It's not far.

248
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,506
Hikaru ran out of here as
soon as I told him about it.

249
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,543
I bet he's down there
right now playing

250
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:48,045
against online opponents.

251
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,949
-Huh.

252
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:53,119
-Kimihiro, want to play?

253
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:53,820
-Maybe later.

254
00:11:56,858 --> 00:12:00,062
-Come on.

255
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:01,398
-Oh, all right.

256
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:03,166
How are the practices
coming along, anyway?

257
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:06,538
-Yuki taught me about
the ladder and the net.

258
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,074
-Great.

259
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:09,943
-The schoolyear will
be ending pretty soon.

260
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:11,712
What are we going to
do about the go club?

261
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:13,882
-I'm taking some study
classes this summer.

262
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:15,585
That'll keep me busy.

263
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:16,887
-That's right.

264
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,991
You have to get ready for your
high school entrance exams.

265
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:22,795
And Hikaru-- he'll probably
spend the whole break

266
00:12:22,795 --> 00:12:24,765
on the computer playing
go on the internet.

267
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:28,737
-I think maybe I'll go
back to the go salon

268
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:30,540
and see how the guys are doing.

269
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,942
-That's cool.

270
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:33,911
I've been thinking
about taking a few go

271
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:36,516
classes at the same
place Hikaru used to go.

272
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:39,119
Next semester, I'm going
to find two other girls

273
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:40,654
to be in our club.

274
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:42,691
I'm really looking forward to
competing in some tournaments.

275
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:45,595
-Akari, why don't you enter
a one on one tournament?

276
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:47,598
-Because I want
to play on a team!

277
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:50,436
You guys were having an awesome
time competing together.

278
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,605
It seems pretty obvious that
team tournaments are way

279
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,406
more fun.

280
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:58,648
-Mmhmm.

281
00:12:58,681 --> 00:13:00,884
I agree.

282
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:04,957
We may have lost to Kaio,
but we sure had lots of fun.

283
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,492
-You're right.

284
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:09,831
I can't wait until the
next team tournament.

285
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,435
-[laughing]

286
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:15,071
-I just had an idea.

287
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:17,575
Why don't we meet once a
week during summer break?

288
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:18,443
-All right.

289
00:13:18,477 --> 00:13:19,778
I could probably manage that.

290
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:20,947
-Yeah, me too.

291
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:31,027
-I'll help you get started.

292
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,832
So you wanted to check
out the World E-Go Net?

293
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:34,900
-Yeah.

294
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,736
-Well, I can help you
find their website,

295
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,740
but I'm afraid I don't really
know very much about go.

296
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:40,809
-That's no problem.

297
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:42,512
I'm sure I'll be able
to figure it out.

298
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,615
I'm a pretty quick learner.

299
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:46,450
-Huh.

300
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:47,752
World E-Go Net.

301
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:51,825
Here we go.

302
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:53,861
One second.

303
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:55,129
Hey, is that it?

304
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:56,498
-Yep.

305
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:59,702
You can play go against people
from all over the world.

306
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:00,838
-That sounds pretty amazing.

307
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:02,707
You do know how to surf
the internet, right?

308
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:03,909
-Sort of.

309
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,711
It wouldn't hurt to know
how, but I just want to play,

310
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:09,117
so it shouldn't be a problem.

311
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,587
-Hikaru, you were
looking at a device

312
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,057
similar to this
yesterday, but this one

313
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,626
doesn't seem to be as flat.

314
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,594
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
You're right,

315
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:17,863
but the insides
are all the same.

316
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,201
-I don't understand.

317
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:23,204
Can you show me how
this device works?

318
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,472
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Sure.

319
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:26,142
I'll let you play as
many games as you want.

320
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:28,177
Come here and check this out.

321
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:29,780
-What?

322
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:31,749
Hikaru, are you serious?

323
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,953
HIKARU (VOICEOVER): Guess
you'll have to wait and see.

324
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:37,925
-I was wondering.

325
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,896
Do you know where Yuki
learned to play go?

326
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:42,932
-He first learned it
from our grandfather.

327
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,002
Then when he was in
elementary school,

328
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:48,241
there was this one teacher he
practiced with all the time.

329
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,978
After he graduated, he started
hanging out in go salons.

330
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:52,480
-Huh.

331
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,215
-Is he a good player?

332
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:55,885
-Uh, of course.

333
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:57,954
He's awesome.

334
00:14:57,988 --> 00:14:58,622
-Huh.

335
00:14:58,622 --> 00:14:59,891
Is that right?

336
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:01,593
How about you?

337
00:15:01,627 --> 00:15:02,060
-Me?

338
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:04,597
I don't know.

339
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm OK.

340
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:09,004
-If you're just OK, then why
you so excited about playing

341
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:11,674
against people all
over the world?

342
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:13,010
-Long story.

343
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,144
-I'm sorry about that.

344
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:16,882
It doesn't matter
how good you are.

345
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,152
You think you can
handle it from here?

346
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,555
-Uh-huh.

347
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,225
Are you sure I
don't have to pay?

348
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:26,029
-It'll be fine, but
please don't tell anybody.

349
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:29,768
And you should only play
on days I'm working.

350
00:15:29,801 --> 00:15:31,269
-You can trust me.

351
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:32,972
-Just let me know
when you're done, OK?

352
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:33,940
-I will.

353
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:35,842
-Later.

354
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,578
-First, we'll need a name.

355
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:40,149
How about Sai?

356
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,584
-Is it true?

357
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:44,655
I can really play as
much go as I want?

358
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:49,563
-Yeah.

359
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:51,065
Let's get started.

360
00:15:54,270 --> 00:16:00,278
S-A-I. Sai.

361
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,056
OK, let's do it.

362
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,791
-That's right, Mom.

363
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,061
Next month, I'm going to be
spending about a week in Japan.

364
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:37,098
I'm excited.

365
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:39,802
I've been chosen to represent
the US in the World Amateur

366
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:40,737
Championship.

367
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:42,039
There'll be some
tough opponents.

368
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:46,746
How many?

369
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,816
I'd say there's
around 50 countries.

370
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,184
Each one sends a single player.

371
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,921
Winning first place at the
US preliminaries was hard,

372
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:56,527
but this is going to be
the ultimate challenge.

373
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:58,096
Well, I've got to
agree with you there.

374
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,664
Asia is incredibly strong.

375
00:16:59,697 --> 00:17:03,570
China, Japan, and Korea are
all going to be hard to beat.

376
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:05,139
We placed eighth
last year, but it's

377
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,076
going to be more difficult
this time around.

378
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:08,812
Well, it's because
of the internet.

379
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:10,714
I can always find a
skilled opponent online.

380
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:13,151
It gives competitors
everywhere the opportunity

381
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:16,122
to train against
powerful players.

382
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:18,225
Some people are saying
Japan is getting weaker,

383
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:19,961
but I don't know if that's true.

384
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:23,732
[laughs] I'll do my best, OK?

385
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,235
Huh?

386
00:17:25,268 --> 00:17:28,707
Someone's asking me
for an online game.

387
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,908
Thanks for calling, Mom.

388
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:30,391
All right.

389
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,074
Bye.

390
00:17:39,185 --> 00:17:39,987
Sai?

391
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:43,292
Never seen that name before.

392
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:47,398
Well, I might as well
see what this guy can do.

393
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:48,500
-He accepted our challenge!

394
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,012
[laughing]

395
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:13,269
-Teacher, it's time
for my go lesson.

396
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:14,203
-Shh.

397
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:15,505
-Hm?

398
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:16,874
-Keep quiet.

399
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:18,843
Our teacher is in the
middle of a game right now.

400
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:20,979
He's training online for
next month's World Amateur

401
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:21,455
Championship.

402
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:28,432
-Hm.

403
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:29,934
-Oh well.

404
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:31,770
I guess there's no lesson today.

405
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:32,805
-Grab a seat.

406
00:18:32,838 --> 00:18:34,374
I've got some time
if you want to play.

407
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:35,475
-That would be great.

408
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,245
I really want to
work on my game.

409
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,777
-In a couple of years,
maybe some of us

410
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:01,780
will be skilled enough to
help our teacher train.

411
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:06,454
-Our teacher is really talented.

412
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:07,956
He's representing
the Netherlands

413
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:09,459
for the second year in a row.

414
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:11,527
It's an honor to be his student.

415
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:14,365
-I was really impressed when
he finished in sixth place

416
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:15,567
last year.

417
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,403
Maybe this year, he'll
manage to break Asia's grip

418
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:18,905
on the top five.

419
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:20,240
-I've heard that
his employers have

420
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:21,909
been getting pretty
upset with him.

421
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:24,146
He's so passionate about
teaching that he's already

422
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,151
opened up his won go academy.

423
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:28,986
-What if he gets fired
from his current job?

424
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,856
He's a good assistant professor.

425
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,792
[laughing]

426
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:33,274
-Huh?

427
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:37,447
-Sensei?

428
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,183
-Huh.

429
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:39,699
[gasp]

430
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:45,107
[laughing]

431
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:46,242
I get it now!

432
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:47,377
He's a pro!

433
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:50,415
I should've known!

434
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:51,249
Of course.

435
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:52,384
That's it!

436
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:54,421
You never know who you're
playing on the internet.

437
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,590
I heard that pros
in Asia sometimes

438
00:19:56,624 --> 00:19:58,660
play online against amateurs.

439
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,697
But I wouldn't have
believed it if I

440
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,533
hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

441
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:03,267
-Sensei?

442
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,970
-What happened?

443
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,177
-I'm sorry to ask,
but did you just lose?

444
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,081
--[laughing] That's
an understatement.

445
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:14,717
I think slaughtered
would be more accurate.

446
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,986
He was so strong I almost
had a heart attack.

447
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,129
Whoever he was, he
just logged off.

448
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:24,998
That's the first time
I've seen that name.

449
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:27,302
I suppose I could ask some
of my contacts about him,

450
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:30,439
but I doubt anyone's
ever heard of this Sai.

451
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:33,277
Who could he be?

452
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:34,612
-You really enjoyed that, huh?

453
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:36,348
-Yes!

454
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:37,382
-Great.

455
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,651
We've got the whole
summer ahead of us.

456
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:41,655
We can play every
day if you want to.

457
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:42,724
-Really?

458
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:45,094
You will allow me to
play every single day?

459
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:48,194
-I'll let you play so
much go you'll never

460
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:49,974
want to see a bowl
of stones again.

461
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,976
-Oh, thank you!

462
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,911
[theme music]

463
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:23,801
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
This is totally cool!

464
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,369
We're going to get to
play against Zelda!

465
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:26,904
SAI (VOICEOVER): Zelda?

466
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:28,439
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
That's his username.

467
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,142
I think he's a
really good player.

468
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:33,711
SAI (VOICEOVER): There are so
many players across the world,

469
00:22:33,744 --> 00:22:35,112
and now they all know my name.

470
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:36,280
Will we be discovered?

471
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,882
HIKARU (VOICEOVER):
We'd better not,

472
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:40,117
or else I'm gonna have to
do a lot of explaining.

473
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:46,223
Next time, Who Is Sai?

474
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:49,260
SAI (VOICEOVER): How long can
you keep my identity a secret?
