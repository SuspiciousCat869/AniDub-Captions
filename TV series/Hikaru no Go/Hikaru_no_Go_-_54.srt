00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,975
[theme music]

2
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:52,679
-I, um-- I don't play Go
on the internet, either.

3
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,582
But the thing is, there's
this friend of mine

4
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,418
who's played lots of times.

5
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,221
And I know he'd
love to play you.

6
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,157
He's wanted to forever.

7
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,394
And the name he uses
when he plays is Sei.

8
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,699
-All right, then.

9
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,168
It'll be a nice distraction
from the pressure of the Judan

10
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,538
championship games.

11
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,606
-Toya-sensei.

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,442
You're gonna play your
best against Sai, right?

13
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,211
-I've made up my mind.

14
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,079
If I lose to your
friend, then I will

15
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,582
retire as a professional player.

16
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,151
I won't play again.

17
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,687
The game will take place
one week from today.

18
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,355
We will begin at
10:00 in the morning

19
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:40,193
and have a tie limit
of three hours each.

20
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,595
-Thank you for doing this.

21
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,415
-I can't see Koyo
Toya's name anywhere.

22
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,016
-Well, I'm sure
he's really busy.

23
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,685
He's got pro games to play.

24
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,421
Toya is the Meijin
champion, after all.

25
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,723
-Do you think this Koyo
Toya is really him?

26
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,225
I mean, it could be
anyone, couldn't it?

27
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,660
-No, it's him, all right.

28
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,030
He beat the pro Achiryu
just the other day.

29
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,499
Achiryu's one of the top
players in Japan right now,

30
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,435
so if he managed
to win against him,

31
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,170
then there's a good
chance this actually

32
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,572
is the real Toya Meijin.

33
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,276
You know, internet Go is getting
more interesting every year.

34
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,344
-It reminds me of the
time Sai was online.

35
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,483
-Oh yeah.

36
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,218
I remember that guy.

37
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,020
A few years ago, when
I was representing

38
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,522
the US in the international
amateur tournament,

39
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,625
he was the player everyone
was talking about.

40
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,028
You know, we never did
find out his true identity.

41
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,188
-Mm.

42
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,027
MAN: Frank, Is that you?

43
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,162
-Hm?

44
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,498
-We haven't seen
you around for ages.

45
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,199
-Hello, Mr. Ewyer.

46
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,169
Work's been keeping me
fairly busy these days.

47
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,138
-Well, we missed having
one of the best players

48
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,440
from the Netherlands in
our midst, that's for sure.

49
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,009
What do you say to a quick
game, you and me, eh?

50
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:36,710
-Sure, why not?

51
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,483
-By the way, I saw Koyo
Toya play the other day.

52
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,618
-Oh really?

53
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,286
-Toya Meijin of Japan.

54
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,688
I didn't know he
was in the country.

55
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,257
-He's not here.

56
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,225
I saw him play online.

57
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,561
-Toya Meijin's playing
on the internet?

58
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,164
Are you sure it's really him?

59
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,532
-It's hard to say.

60
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,001
The guy he was playing
wasn't the strongest opponent

61
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,102
in the world.

62
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,037
And he logged off before
anyone had the chance

63
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,505
to chat with him about the game.

64
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,307
-Hm.

65
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,075
Sounds like an imposter.

66
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,746
A few months back, some guy
showed up pretending to be Sai.

67
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,215
He soon disappeared again.

68
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,249
-Who's this Sai?

69
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,050
-Ha!

70
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,385
You've never heard of Sai?

71
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,621
He caused quite a sensation
on the net a while back.

72
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,424
Easily as strong a
player as Toya Meijin.

73
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,560
-That's quite some comparison.

74
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,428
What else do you know about him?

75
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,030
-He's a mystery.

76
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,099
He did identify
himself as being JPN.

77
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,267
-JPN, huh?

78
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,235
So, he's Japanese.

79
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,108
-(VOICEOVER) When I went to
the international amateur

80
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,411
tournament in Japan a
couple of years ago,

81
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,547
one of my goals was to try and
find out who this Sai really

82
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,648
was.

83
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,483
Everyone knew about him
from his games online,

84
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,619
but no one knew
his true identity.

85
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,455
Then without any warning, he
disappeared from the internet.

86
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,624
I wonder if he'll
show up online again.

87
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,480
MAN: Oh, that's it.

88
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,450
There's no way Ogata
can come back from this.

89
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,385
-Guess that means
it'll all be over soon.

90
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,687
-The Meijin is too strong!

91
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,557
-Must be enormously
frustrating for Mr. Ogata.

92
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,026
He was doing so well at
the start of the series.

93
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,728
-If he'd won, he'd
have taken the title.

94
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,229
Ogata Judan.

95
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,064
-He's been in good
form lately, and he's

96
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,432
playing better than ever.

97
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,168
It's just a matter of time
before he wins a championship.

98
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:45,038
-I bet he'd be the
first to agree.

99
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,674
It takes some nerve to challenge
your teacher for a title.

100
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:54,414
Ogata tries so hard to act cool,
but I see right through him.

101
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,983
He makes the press believe
he's no more than a practice

102
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,286
partner for Toya Meijin,
when in reality he

103
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,321
wants to take away the title.

104
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,057
-But defeating Toya Meijin
is a huge obstacle for him

105
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,392
to overcome.

106
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,694
-Don't forget, Toya collapsed
with a heart attack last week.

107
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,463
He looks much better, but who
knows what toll its taken?

108
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,399
He hasn't been released
from the hospital.

109
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,669
-He's got his wife here
to help look after him.

110
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,137
-He's fine.

111
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,672
He's the sort of
guy that'll be back

112
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,540
at full strength in no time.

113
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,274
MAN: Looks.

114
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,342
Like they're finished.

115
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,376
MAN: Hm.

116
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,679
I'd say he's won by
6 and 1/2 points.

117
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,980
Let's go review the game.

118
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,153
Ogata you played a little
too cautiously here.

119
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,022
Toya picked up on it and
used it to his advantage.

120
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,692
This is the point where he
took control of the game.

121
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,994
-Yes, I knew I was going
to be in trouble when

122
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,296
white decided to play there.

123
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,398
-I was expecting black
to make a counterattack

124
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:46,666
by connecting here.

125
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,268
-Sure, that makes sense.

126
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,704
-So, the game was over
from that point on?

127
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,339
-Certainly looks like it.

128
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,674
The rest of the game was good,
a fight across the board.

129
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:59,512
But that one mistake was
what cost you the win, Ogata.

130
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,348
-Excuse me, Toya-sensei.

131
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,084
I just wanted to say, I
hope you're feeling better.

132
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,152
-I'm feeling great, thank you.

133
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,089
In fact, I could play the
fifth match right here and now.

134
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,690
-I gather you haven't
been officially

135
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,158
released from the hospital yet.

136
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,660
-He likes being
treated like a king,

137
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,729
so of course he's
not been released.

138
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,732
And besides, he started
playing Go on the internet.

139
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,600
-You're playing online?

140
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,403
-The other day, I noticed
someone called Toya logged on.

141
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,473
Never in a million years
did I think it would be him.

142
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,541
I mean, Toya-sensei
is the last person

143
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,377
you'd expect to see online.

144
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,279
I thought, I'm gonna teach
this imposter a lesson.

145
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,548
How dare he impersonate
the Toya Meijin.

146
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,318
So I challenged him to a game.

147
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,452
-No way.

148
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,222
Ichiru Kisei versus Toya
Meijin on the internet?

149
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,425
-He showed no mercy, attacking
every little mistake I made.

150
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,060
It's really him, I thought.

151
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,496
What on Earth's doing
here of all places?

152
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,031
Then he captured
one of my stones!

153
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,537
-It's just to keep me occupied
until I leave the hospital.

154
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,572
I prefer the feel of
stones in my fingers

155
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,441
more than a keyboard.

156
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,744
-Oh, so you won't be going
online for much longer, then?

157
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,479
-Well, if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen.

158
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:09,983
I should get going.

159
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,553
-Mr. Ogata-- Don't you want
to go for a drink with us?

160
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,187
Ogata-sensei?

161
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,529
-Anyone else get the
impression he's upset?

162
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,563
-It's getting late.

163
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,765
Maybe we should be
heading back, Sensei?

164
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,535
We don't want your wife to
start worrying about you.

165
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,536
-Oh, all right.

166
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:30,970
Let's call it a night.

167
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,640
So, the Judan series is now
tied at two games apiece.

168
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,975
The title's going to be
decided in a final game.

169
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,426
-You seem a lot
better today, dear.

170
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,260
It's so lovey here.

171
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,029
I wish we could stay longer.

172
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,997
Why don't we take a bit
of a detour on our way

173
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,432
back to the hospital?

174
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,367
-I'd rather not.

175
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,970
I don't wanna take any
time out right now.

176
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,173
I've got another game
I have to focus on.

177
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,275
-What do you mean
by another game?

178
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,278
The fifth match of the Judan
series isn't until next week.

179
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,032
-Ah, hello.

180
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,368
Hello.

181
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,637
You're not playing
Go again, are you?

182
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,306
You were playing in that
championship all day yesterday.

183
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,375
You must be worn out by now.

184
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,044
-It's amazing what a win
can do for his energy level.

185
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,214
I'm sure he thinks
he's invincible.

186
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,682
-I've heard that before.

187
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,551
But don't forget, the
reason you collapsed

188
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,020
was because you were
pushing yourself too hard.

189
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:58,658
I really think you should
get some rest today.

190
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,060
I'll let you play online
if you can assure me

191
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,630
it's just for fun, and
there's no stress involved.

192
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,698
-It helps pass the time.

193
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:09,969
Although, there are still some
games I can't afford to lose.

194
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,195
May I ask a small favor, doctor?

195
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:40,099
Can you make sure I don't
get any visitors tomorrow?

196
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,001
-Why's that, Mr. Toya?

197
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,538
-I'd like a day to play Go
without anyone disturbing me.

198
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,038
-Oh, boy.

199
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,506
Always Go.

200
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,809
Does he ever do anything
but play this game?

201
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,078
I don't know how you put
up with it, Mrs. Toya.

202
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:59,051
Hm.

203
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,253
If you could pull yourself
away from that computer

204
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,922
for a minute, please?

205
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,791
I'm sure you're fine, but no
harm in doing a quick check up.

206
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,738
Well, it looks like
everything's back to normal.

207
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,874
Now, I can't tell a Go
player not to play Go,

208
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,610
but from now on, I'd like you to
watch your health more closely.

209
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,681
I think it'll be
OK to release him

210
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,549
the day after
tomorrow, as planned.

211
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,951
And I'll leave a
note with the staff

212
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,687
that no visitors are
allowed tomorrow.

213
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,755
-Thank you, Doctor.

214
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,161
-Don't worry about coming
to visit me tomorrow.

215
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,930
And tell Akira he
doesn't have to, either.

216
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,733
-Akira said he had plans to
spend the day in a study group

217
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,568
with some other
young pro players,

218
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,871
so I don't think he'll
have the time to stop by.

219
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:52,505
-Good.

220
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,172
That's fine.

221
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:17,730
-Huh?

222
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:37,483
So, this Koyo Toya I'm
playing right now--

223
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,953
he's certainly strong enough
to be Toya Meijin of Japan.

224
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:45,758
Yes.

225
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,959
It has to be him.

226
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,898
No one else I know could
play this quickly, and still

227
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,833
make such great moves.

228
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:02,379
[gasp]

229
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:10,921
-It's really him.

230
00:14:10,954 --> 00:14:14,758
Toya Meijin is actually
playing against Lin Shin Lee.

231
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,326
Lee doesn't stand a chance.

232
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,761
There's no way he
could win this one.

233
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:24,401
[phone ringing]

234
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:25,703
-Hello, Frank here.

235
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:26,804
MAN (OVER PHONE): Morning.

236
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:28,405
It's me.

237
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:30,307
You've got to turn
on your computer.

238
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,077
Koyo Toya is playing.

239
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,011
-Yeah, I know.

240
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:35,479
I've been watching.

241
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:37,648
I logged in about
half an hour ago.

242
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:38,615
There's no question.

243
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,517
This has to be the real Toya.

244
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:42,319
It's great.

245
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:43,620
No doubt at all.

246
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:47,825
I mean, who else could crunch
an opponent like Lee so easily?

247
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:48,926
-Morning, how are you?

248
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,527
FRANK: You know
who he is, right?

249
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:52,796
He's China's top amateur player.

250
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,599
He was international
amateur champion last year.

251
00:14:55,632 --> 00:14:56,934
That's right.

252
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:57,935
Did you see?

253
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:59,403
He's resigned.

254
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:00,671
Oh, yeah.

255
00:15:00,704 --> 00:15:02,973
It'll be great if we get to
see more games like this one.

256
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:04,441
-I don't know yet.

257
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:05,442
FRANK: OK. Bye.

258
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,648
-What's all the
excitement about?

259
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:14,885
-Toya Meijin of Japan
is playing Go online.

260
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,420
You have heard of
him, haven't you?

261
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:17,387
Toya Meijin!

262
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:18,689
-Uh--

263
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:20,791
FRANK: I know that more and more
pros have been playing online

264
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:23,527
in the last couple of years,
but to have him playing?

265
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,762
This is amazing!

266
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:25,863
What am I going to do?

267
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:27,331
I'd love to challenge
him to a game online,

268
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:28,699
but how does
someone like me even

269
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:30,400
go about asking
someone like him?

270
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:32,536
Oh, what am I going to do?

271
00:15:41,588 --> 00:15:43,857
HIKARU: Toya Meijin is
such an amazing player.

272
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,858
Look at this game.

273
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:47,327
The move he made
here is unbelievable.

274
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,431
I never would have thought
of a move like that.

275
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:53,833
You should see what they said
about it in the magazine.

276
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,235
They've got interviews
with pros who

277
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:58,405
say they've never
seen anything like it.

278
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,206
SAI: Sometimes there
are possibilities

279
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,609
that can only be seen
by the person playing.

280
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:04,878
There is an enormous
difference between being

281
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:09,215
a spectator of the game, and
being a participant in it.

282
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:12,085
There can never be the
same involvement or passion

283
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:14,821
when merely watching
from the sidelines.

284
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,057
How could there be?

285
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,327
Only the ones playing can
see deep into the game,

286
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,829
far into the depths
of the universe that's

287
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:25,498
found within the board.

288
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:29,202
That's why you can only begin
to know an opponent's true power

289
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:33,006
when you face him in
person across the board.

290
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,374
MITSUKO: Hikaru!

291
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:36,343
Akari's here to see you.

292
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:37,077
-Huh?

293
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,944
Really?

294
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:38,578
-Yeah.

295
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:40,113
-What are you doing here?

296
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:41,881
Aren't you supposed
to be at the Go club?

297
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:43,316
Did you skip out of it?

298
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,451
-No, I didn't.

299
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:46,052
It's just that
everyone else seemed

300
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:48,855
to have other stuff to do today.

301
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,323
So I thought I'd
come around and see

302
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:52,158
if you wanted to play a game.

303
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:54,227
-What? With you?

304
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,396
-Well, if you're busy, then--

305
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:57,097
-Yes, I'm busy.

306
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,832
Of course I'm busy!

307
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:01,134
(VOICEOVER) We've got a
big game to play tomorrow.

308
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:05,372
SAI: It wouldn't hurt to
give her a game, Hikaru.

309
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:06,439
-Sai?

310
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:08,341
-I don't mind playing her.

311
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,377
I'd like nothing better.

312
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,945
-Are you sure?

313
00:17:11,945 --> 00:17:14,147
-Hikaru, that's not
very nice of you.

314
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,615
Akari came all this way.

315
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:16,182
-I know.

316
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:17,250
I'm sorry.

317
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:18,318
I guess I've got time
to give you a game.

318
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,153
If you're still interested.

319
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:21,064
-Really?

320
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:24,090
Thanks, Hikaru!

321
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:27,193
-I'll bring you some cake and
tea a little bit later on, OK?

322
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:28,328
-Thanks, Mrs. Shindou.

323
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:29,028
Sounds great.

324
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,408
Hm?

325
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:43,977
I didn't realize you
were studying tonight.

326
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,345
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:46,112
-It's fine.

328
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:46,980
Don't worry.

329
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:52,352
So, have you gotten any better
since the last time we played?

330
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:52,986
-Oh, yeah.

331
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:54,154
Way better.

332
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:56,956
I learned a lot more about
the game from Kaneko.

333
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,591
We've all been practicing hard.

334
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,394
-Hm.

335
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:03,963
-Mitani drops in and out
when he feels like it.

336
00:18:03,997 --> 00:18:05,064
Same as before.

337
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:07,033
We've got the big tournament
coming up in June.

338
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,436
It's the last one for us now
we're in the ninth grade,

339
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:12,906
so we're hoping Mitani
will show up for that.

340
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:14,407
Can I put down nine stones?

341
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:16,075
Is that OK?

342
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:18,378
-You won't stand a chance
if you only put down nine.

343
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,847
You gotta put down
more than that.

344
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,216
-Hikaru, nine stones will do.

345
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,186
That's enough for me to
make sure it's a good game.

346
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:27,086
-All right, then.

347
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,955
Put down nine.

348
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:29,422
-OK.

349
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:37,931
-I'm not sure why you
want to play this game.

350
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:40,200
I mean, this is Akari
we're talking about here.

351
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,302
How's that gonna help you
play Toya's dad tomorrow?

352
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,838
Aren't you just
wasting your time?

353
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,840
-Playing against
someone like Akari

354
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:49,075
will be a good way for
me to calm my nerves.

355
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:50,310
There's no pressure in this.

356
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:54,848
-Well, if you say so.

357
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,954
Onegai shimasu.

358
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:02,322
-Onegai shimasu.

359
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:05,091
-Onegai shimasu.

360
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:05,925
17, 6.

361
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,645
-Next stone, 16, 13.

362
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:17,606
Thanks.

363
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:21,064
-Hm.

364
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:26,513
SAI: 15, 6.

365
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:47,133
-This is how Hikaru used to
play when he started out, too.

366
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,836
More than two years have
passed since I came back

367
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:51,204
to this world.

368
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,540
It was soon after my return
that I learned of Toya Meijin.

369
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:10,924
From the first time
I saw him, I sensed

370
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:13,326
that he and I shared
the same path.

371
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:19,866
The path towards
the Divine Move.

372
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:24,938
-Next time we play, let's
make it an even game.

373
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:25,838
SAI (VOICEOVER): Yes.

374
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:36,015
Tomorrow.

375
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:43,056
Tomorrow will be my chance.

376
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,291
My chance to make
the Divine Move.

377
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:56,002
[theme music]

378
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:24,190
HIKARU: You finally get to have
your game against Toya Meijin.

379
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,058
SAI: Yes.

380
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:27,326
My dream has become a reality.

381
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:29,195
HIKARU: Your identity's
a total secret.

382
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:31,164
You think that gives
you the advantage?

383
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:32,131
SAI: No.

384
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:34,300
This will be evenly
matched battle.

385
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,203
HIKARU: And it could
be his last game ever.

386
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:45,611
Next time, Sai Verses Koyo Toya!

387
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:49,048
SAI: It may be my
last game as well.
