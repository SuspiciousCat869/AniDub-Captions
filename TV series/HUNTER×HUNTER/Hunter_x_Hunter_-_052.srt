[announcer] Attention, passengers. 
We will be making an emergency stop.

11
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,801
-Please watch your step. 
-Wait, did something happen?

12
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,053
Dunno.

Are they here?

16
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,227
Yeah, it's got to be them!

17
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,690
They're the only ones I can think of 
who are powerful enough

18
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,568
to take on a whole crowd on their own!

Listen! Figure out how many enemies 
we're up against!

22
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,244
Do whatever it takes to stop them!

23
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,455
Don't let them 
anywhere near this building!

24
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,463
[grumbling] They're late!

25
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,596
Our escorts aren't here? 
Their names are Melody and Basho.

26
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,724
Unfortunately, sir, all the traffic 
in Yorknew City

27
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,269
has come to a grinding halt. 
They're probably stuck.

28
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,898
[Nostrade] [grumbling] 
It's dangerous for Neon to be here.

29
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,733
Isn't there any way to get her out?

30
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,862
[guard] The ambulance we requested 
is already on its way.

31
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,864
It shouldn't be much longer, sir.

32
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,368
[Nostrade] 
Ambulance? Oh, yes, that's right.

33
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,370
[Kurapika] Something's wrong here.

34
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,874
The man entered the building with Neon 
and then called for a doctor...

35
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,751
Wait, sir?

36
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:35,966
Kurapika, do not leave my daughter's side 
until the ambulance arrives. Understand?

37
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,760
But sir, my assignment 
is to kill the Phantom Troupe--

38
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,055
That was when I thought 
Neon would be home already.

39
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,476
Instead, she's here and unconscious, 
completely exposed to the Troupe.

40
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,020
I must ensure her safety.

41
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,314
I want you here for the time being.

42
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,900
Please, Kurapika.

43
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,695
I understand.

[assassin snickering]

45
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:19,509
It's such a pity, isn't it? 
They aren't putting up much of a fight.

46
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,679
Well, I guess it was stupid to expect--

Damn it! They're crazier than I thought.

50
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,486
They're trying to launch 
a full-frontal attack

51
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,904
with only ten people.

52
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,661
[doctor] My goodness.

53
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,582
When the hell did this place turn 
into such a damn warzone, huh?

54
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,667
So, where is the patient?

[EMTs gasping]

56
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,255
[Bean] I don’t have any reason to believe

57
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,633
that you aren’t a member 
of the Phantom Troupe.

58
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,677
Make just one funny move 
and I'll blow your head off.

59
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,722
Follow me.

60
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,896
I will need to inspect all of you.

61
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,855
What's that?

62
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,359
Damn you.

63
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,488
-[indistinct chatter] 
-[man] Give me a break!

64
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,824
[announcer] 
All trains have been stopped at this time.

65
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,702
The safety of our customers 
is of utmost importance to us.

66
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,789
So we ask that you continue 
to wait patiently for now

67
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,752
[Gon] 
I'm not getting any reception down here.

68
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,172
And we don't know when the trains 
will start moving again.

69
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,800
Then I guess we'll just have to run.

70
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,520
[sighs]

71
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,940
Weren't you hired here as an assassin?

72
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,943
Why don't you quit hiding out 
in this room and go fight?

73
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,405
Unless you got too scared 
when the Phantom Troupe showed up?

74
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:08,618
Well, actually, I requested 
that Kurapika stay here.

75
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,580
I understand that he's been hired 
by the Ten Dons,

76
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,748
but I'm a bit worried about my daughter.

77
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,043
It's fine. I won't sell you out.

78
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,882
But still, I know you're being paid well, 
so I expect you to do your job.

79
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,593
[chuckles]

80
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,598
He's right, 
I really should do something to help out.

81
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,309
I could patrol the building 
at the very least.

82
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,144
I suppose so.

83
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,647
But you must come back immediately 
if I call on you.

84
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,108
My daughter's safety takes precedence.

85
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,401
[Kurapika] Yes, sir.

86
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,446
[man 1] 
How long do we have to wait?

87
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,823
[man 2] 
Hey, what's going on outside?

88
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,867
[man 3] 
Yeah, I hear explosions nearby!

89
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,994
When is the auction gonna start?

90
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,246
What the hell is going on here, anyway?

91
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,498
[stammering] 
Please, sir, it shouldn't be much longer.

92
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,751
Is the auction still on or isn't it?

93
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:03,256
[Kurapika] Everyone here is either 
a leader or an executive member.

94
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,259
They're endangering themselves needlessly

95
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,346
only to prove they aren't afraid 
of the Troupe.

96
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,767
Give me back my phone! 
I don't know what's happening out there.

97
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,644
I need my weapons back, too!

98
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,896
[auctioneer stammering] 
As you know, sir, the rule state

99
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,940
that weapons are banned 
during the auction.

100
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,025
[man] What happens if they get inside?

101
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,444
We fight them with our bare hands?

102
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,572
[Kurapika] 
It's starting to get chaotic in here.

103
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,409
If they're not careful, 
the auction organizers will lose control

104
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,787
of the situation before much longer.

105
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,332
[phone vibrating]

106
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,792
Yes. Hello?

107
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,502
-[Gon] Hey! Kurapika? 
-[gasps]

108
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,296
[Gon] 
Oh, good! We finally got a hold of you.

109
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,757
-[Kurapika] Gon? 
-Yeah, can you talk right now?

110
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,219
Uh, I'm a little busy. 
So I'll have to call you back.

111
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,012
[Gon] Wait! Just give me a minute!

112
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,973
I have something I really need 
to tell you.

113
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,517
Killua and I found the Troupe.

114
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,561
-[gasps] 
-[Gon] Actually, they kind of caught us.

115
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,981
[Kurapika] 
What in the hell were you thinking?

116
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,651
Do you have any idea 
how dangerous they are?

117
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:05,902
My turn.

118
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,614
I thought I knew until we met them.

119
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,992
They're really tough.

120
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,078
As it stands, we don't have a chance 
against them.

121
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,997
That's why we need your help.

122
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,541
And we want to help you, too.

123
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,211
[Kurapika] This isn't a game.

124
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,797
I'm not going to help you 
get yourselves killed.

125
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,550
We found their base. 
Wanna know where it is?

126
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,635
[Kurapika] I have my own sources.

127
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,638
We learned some of their abilities. 
Don't you wanna know about them?

128
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,933
[Kurapika] That's enough! 
Just stay away from the Phantom Troupe!

129
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,688
[Killua] You're the "chain user" 
who killed one of them, right?

130
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,483
You do realize that they're dead set 
on finding you?

131
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:49,154
But if you won't even consider thinking 
of me and Gon as your friends and equals,

132
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,699
we'll do whatever the hell it takes 
to make you help us. [grumbles]

133
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,536
[Gon] Kurapika...

134
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,707
One of the Phantom Troupe guys... 
he started crying right in front of us.

135
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,544
He said that he could never forgive 
whoever killed his friend.

136
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,134
And then when I saw him do that, 
it made me really angry.

137
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,553
I couldn't forgive them.

138
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,390
Look, we want to stop them too!

139
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,186
So, please, Kurapika.

140
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,941
[Kurapika] I'll... call you back later.

141
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,740
[Killua] But if you won't even consider 
thinking of me and Gon

142
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,200
as your friends and equals...

143
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,286
[Gon] Look! We want to stop them too!

144
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,292
[crowd gasping]

145
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,211
-[Mafioso 1] Here they come! 
-[Mafioso 2] Don't let them escape!

146
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,879
-[Mafioso 3] I can feel the heat! 
-[Mafioso 4] Someone's coming!

147
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,798
-[Mafioso 5] Does he have a gun? 
-[Mafioso 6] Who's stationed here?

148
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,424
[man] Go! Go back! It's no use.

149
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,885
The Troupe is too powerful!

150
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,388
I'm serious. We don't stand 
a chance against them.

151
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,769
Do you wanna see how strong they are? 
'Cause I can show you!

152
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,024
They're this strong! [laughs maniacally]

153
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,778
Damn it!

154
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,616
[laughter stops]

155
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,955
[Shalnark] Aww, he broke.

156
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,749
I need to find my next puppet.

157
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,337
[Mafioso] Are you okay? I found the corpse 
of one of the assassins!

158
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,296
[gasps]

159
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,508
Someone has already gotten 
inside the building!

160
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
[Kurapika] Damn.

161
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,309
-[man 1] Who are these guys? 
-[man 2] It's hopeless!

162
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,186
Come on! Get back here and fight!

163
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,662
[sighs] What's going on? 
It's me. Where the hell is our backup?

164
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,913
What are you doing?

165
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,709
[Mafioso] They should be there any minute. 
And we'll be arriving shortly--

166
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,002
[grunting in pain]

167
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,720
[Bean] Is this really happening?

168
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,056
The 2,000 armed men 
that were supposed to assemble here...

169
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,976
Are they all getting killed?

170
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,897
Now what?

171
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,774
There are Troupe members 
inside the building already.

172
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,696
It's me, Bean!

173
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,449
Get the Ten Dons on the line. 
And hurry!

174
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,788
[Kurapika] The intruder must be 
a member of the Troupe.

175
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,208
They're trying to steal the rest 
of the merchandise

176
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,918
and avenge their comrade.

177
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,796
He said he could never forgive 
whoever killed his friend.

178
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,050
[Kurapika] That's what I'm hoping for!

179
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,176
[glass smashing]

180
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,306
[man] Hey! Enough already! 
Give us the weapons we handed over!

181
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,682
And do it now!

182
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,392
[auctioneer] 
But, sir, the rules state that--

183
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,728
To hell with the damn rules, 
hear me?

184
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,313
You know what's happening, don't you?

185
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,691
I'm not stupid. 
You've got professional assassins here.

186
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,610
I've been seeing them all over the place.

187
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,364
If you're gonna depend on those freaks, 
then you might as well let us fight!

188
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,831
For those of you who don't know, 
my name is Zeno Zoldyck.

189
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,961
Zoldyck? Like the famous family 
of assassins?

190
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,297
Did the Ten Dons actually call in 
these monsters?

191
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,803
At the moment, 
one bandit has infiltrated this building.

192
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,845
[crowd gasping]

193
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,640
He has already killed a number 
of the assassins

194
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,475
that were hired by your people.

195
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,025
It wouldn't much matter if each of you 
was armed to the teeth.

196
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,946
I could still eliminate the lot of you 
in under seven seconds.

197
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,699
The enemy is every bit as capable.

198
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,158
[crowd gasping]

199
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,412
If you understand, 
then just shut up and wait.

200
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,998
Disregard if you would rather die.

201
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,267
Well, then?

202
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,562
[Silva] A single strike from behind. 
Impressive.

203
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,857
His bloodlust was only exposed 
for a brief instant,

204
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,942
and barely a trace remains.

205
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,861
[sighs]

206
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,448
I suppose I'll have to use En.

207
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,035
although it really is 
such an exhausting technique.

208
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,789
Let's start from the roof 
and then make our way down.

209
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,917
[Silva] 
This building's radius is 100 meters.

210
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,711
Think you can handle it, Dad?

211
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,757
You fool. I could do 300 meters, easily.

212
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,759
[cracks knuckles]

213
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,095
One thing is certain. 
We're not getting paid enough for this.

214
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,540
[phone vibrating]

215
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,751
Kurapika, you're late!

216
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,879
Hurry back at once 
and stay by Neon's side!

217
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,508
Yes, sir. I'm on my way.

218
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,677
Damn it!

219
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,792
[Chrollo] We meet again.

220
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,252
[Silva] You remember me?

221
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:24,090
[Chrollo] How could I forget? 
You did kill one of my people.

222
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,633
[Silva] It wasn't easy.

223
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,513
Now, Dad, be careful.

224
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,516
He can steal people's abilities.

225
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,470
[gasps]

226
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,015
[Silva] Huh?

227
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,771
[panting]

228
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,899
[Chrollo] Two on one sure is rough.

229
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,903
[Silva] Hmm. Must be a good knife 
if it can scratch my skin.

230
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,906
A mid-era Ben's knife by the looks of it.

231
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,576
Hmm. The shape must mean it's poisoned.

232
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,872
You all right?

233
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,457
Not a problem.

234
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,000
[Chrollo] Not a problem?

235
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:45,463
Point one milligrams of that stuff 
is more than enough to paralyze a whale.

236
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,342
[Zeno] 
So you can steal other people's Nen?

237
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,968
Then you're a Specialist.

238
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,389
You might even be a threat if you could 
use those stolen powers freely.

239
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,936
However, that implies 
a higher activation cost.

240
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,688
You couldn't have gotten 
the ability, otherwise.

241
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,691
If I had to make a guess,

242
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:10,154
you must clear four or five conditions 
before stealing an ability.

243
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,741
[Chrollo] He's right. 
The old man's a tough customer.

244
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,078
Trying to meet those conditions 
while fighting both of us

245
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,665
will be difficult indeed, 
meaning that you won't be able

246
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,961
to steal our abilities as long 
as we keep you engaged in battle.

247
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,589
That poisoned knife of yours is proof.

248
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,801
[Chrollo] Right again. 
Guess I have no choice.

249
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,225
-Watch my back, Silva. 
-Hmm?

250
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,018
As soon as I have him pinned down,

251
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,188
even if you have to kill me, 
end him.

252
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,023
Got it.

253
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,875
[Chrollo] He focused his aura 
into his hand.

254
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:09,547
The energy potential will be huge. 
I don't have the defenses to block it.

255
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,554
-[Zeno] Huh. 
-[Silva] Hmm.

256
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,683
SKILL HUNTER: BANDIT'S SECRET

257
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,863
[Zeno] A conjured cloak, eh?

258
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,283
Hmm. This could be trouble.

259
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:44,165
Even if it's a stolen ability, 
it would be reckless to attack

260
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,083
without knowing what it does.

261
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,631
Or so the average person would think.

262
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,215
But...

263
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,141
DRAGON HEAD: LONG-TOU XI-HUA

264
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,813
DRAGON LANCE

265
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,615
[snickers and yells]

266
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,371
[Zeno] I see what he's doing.

267
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,625
He can trap the abilities of others 
in the conjured book,

268
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,170
take them out and use them 
any time he pleases.

269
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,386
But there's a catch. 
He can't use those abilities

270
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,305
unless he holds the book open 
the entire time.

271
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,394
The cloak is also a conjured item.

272
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,063
It doesn't look like he's planning 
to attack,

273
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,983
but it's obvious that he's attempting 
to close the distance between us.

274
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,986
So, it must be a defensive tool 
that can be utilized

275
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,448
to draw closer to an enemy, 
and counter-attack.

276
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,036
We can lower the risk 
if we keep our distance.

277
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,872
We'll wait for our chance, 
then strike!

278
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,668
[Chrollo] 
This old man is really something.

279
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,462
He managed to read my mind in an instant.

280
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,425
Doubt I'd capture him alive.

281
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,220
[Silva] So the ability disappears 
whenever he closes the book.

282
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,477
In any case, he's impressive.

283
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:33,899
He's dodging Dad's attacks by a hair, 
all while keeping an eye on me.

284
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,238
His attacks have improved since last time.

285
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,033
So we don't have any clue 
what he's capable of.

286
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:48,038
If we were to stop him, 
we may just have to pay with our lives.

287
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,208
[Chrollo] Huh?

288
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,683
Silva! Do it now!

289
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,525
[laughs]

290
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,070
[Silva grunts]

291
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,543
[narrator] A thunderous tremor ripped 
through Yorknew City.

292
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:41,133
Kurapika had no idea that those shockwaves 
would lead to an unexpected development.

293
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,221
[theme music playing]

294
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,373
-[Gon] Coming up, Gon... 
-[Killua] And Killua's...

295
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,708
[both] Hunterpedia!

296
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,668
-I'm Gon! 
-I'm Killua!

297
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:58,836
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

298
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,006
Today, we're introducing Shalnark, 
a member of the Troupe

299
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,174
who's really smart, knowledgeable 
and cunning!

300
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,260
He can put a Nen antenna 
right on his targets,

301
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,803
and control them by phone!

302
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,346
[both] Black voice!

303
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,230
[Gon] Next time: 
"Fake and Psyche."

304
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:21,108
-[Gon] Kopitor? 
-[Killua] Kotorpi?

305
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,401
[Gon] Kortopi!
