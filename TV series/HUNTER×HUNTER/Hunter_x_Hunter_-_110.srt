Welfin: No, you’re wrong.

230
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:57,818
I would guess pouf’s en
only reached the stairway.

231
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,088
The intruder saw that aura and
gave up on going any further.

It all makes sense.

233
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:06,660
The question now is what
the intruder’s objective was

234
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,930
and whether he’s still
hiding around here somewhere.

Do I tell youpi?

236

Welfin: I should report
to pitou or pouf.

239
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,040
Pouf would be best.

240
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,909
And, if possible,
I need to determine

241
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,046
exactly what the intruder’s
objective was.

242
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,582
Otherwise, my report would be

243
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,351
that the intruder somehow
made it inside the palace,

244
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:33,988
but turned and ran
when he felt pouf’s en.

245
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:37,124
I won’t get
any credit for that.

246
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,860
I guess I can make up
an objective,

247
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,661
but if the intruder is captured,

248
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,797
they’ll find out
I lied for sure.

249
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,933
But then if I tell
the royal guard

250
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,735
about my suspicion
and the intruder is never found,

251
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,972
it would only waste their time
and damage my own credibility.

252
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,139

00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:03,883
So the intruder
captured one of my men.

256
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:08,455
Leol tells me that this intruder
is able to teleport.

257
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,890
He may be working
with your woman,

258
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,960
and they might have
teleported out together.

259
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,898
Bizeff: Damn, but why
in the world would they do that?

Welfin: Yes,
that’s the question.

261
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,137

to discern their objective.

262

268

Welfin: What’s the rush?

269
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,584
We can tell them right after
you and I find the bomb.

270
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,453
Bizeff: But there’s no time!

271
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,854
Welfin: Just calm down,

272
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,857
and think about it
from their perspective.

273
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,726
If they want
to blow up the palace,

274
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,594
then they’ll wait
until the king’s here.

275
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:48,863
And when’s that?

276
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:51,832
When all the citizens
have been assembled,

277
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,768
before the ceremony begins.

278
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,970
That’s five million humans.

279
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,772
Can you believe it?

280
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,974
It’ll be a sight to behold.

281
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,578
The king wouldn’t let a decoy
steal that glory from him,

282
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,780
and that’s why
he’ll be there in person.

283
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,682
It’s safe to assume

284
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,117
that the enemy’s reached
the same conclusion.

285
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,887
Bizeff: True.
I stood by the former leader

286
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:16,190
as he conducted
similar celebrations.

287
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:19,727
The experience brings
indescribable ecstasy.

288
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,996
It’s even better than sex.

289
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,965
Welfin: There is still
over half a day left to go.

290
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,767
If I use my nose
to track the intruder,

291
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:30,804
then we can locate the bomb
with time to spare.

292
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:33,641
We’ll need proof when we report.

293
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:36,010
The royal guard
should know that we’re serious.

294
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,479
If we save the king’s life,

295
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:42,116
they’re bound to be
grateful to us. Right?

296
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:46,220
Bizeff: Yes,
that’s--that’s true.

297
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:50,023
Welfin: As soon as I find
the bomb, i’ll contact you.

( Chuckles ) Bit by bit,

302
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:05,139
i’m getting closer to becoming
the king behind the scenes.

303
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,548
Morel: Seven minutes.

304
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,784
I’ll call you when it’s
down to a minute left.

305
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,586
Then gather near the exit.

306
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,589
Stand by here until then.

307
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,625

308

309
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,528
I’ll tap your shoulder

310
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,564
ten seconds
before I need to breathe,

311
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,067
and then i’ll tap you when I
start to hold my breath again,

312
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,169
so don’t you forget.

313
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,071
( Knuckle laughs ) Fine,

314
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,772
but there’s no need
to push your limits.

315
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,108
Give yourself
all the buffer you need.

316

just go ahead, and do it.

their sense of smell

321

All three of them were gathered
on top of the main gate

Pitou stayed,
while youpi went back inside.

As for pouf,
he returned to the air,

336

anything has changed.

until we head out of here.

340
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,281
Killua:
That eliminates the chance

341
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,750
the royal guard
will be out of the palace.

Ikalgo: Well,
I can pretty much guarantee

344

that they’ll be near the king.

Killua: Hey,
you don’t know that.

346

We have to be ready
for anything.

We don’t want to be caught
off guard if something happens.

Ikalgo: If you knew
how loyal they were,
you wouldn’t say that.

349
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,670
I’m telling you there’s no way
they’d ever leave the king!

350
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,172
The royal guard is always
right there by his side!

We just need to be prepared
if there are any exceptions.

Morel: Reproducing is
one of his objectives,

361
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,428
and we still have no idea

362
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,930
what the king does
when he’s in the palace,

363
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:46,099
so maybe he’s been
making babies.

Killua: Yeah, I guess.

Knuckle: I hadn’t
thought of that,

366
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,405
but I guess it would
give the king a good reason

367
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,675
to keep the royal guard
far away from his chamber.

368

You think what bizeff was doing

369
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,713
was snatching up
all those ladies for the king?

happening to palm

been bracing for it,

completely caught off guard.

I’m telling you, you can
never overthink something.

lots of other things

Killua: It bothers me,

391

but the existence
of a third party, woman or not,

392
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,434
is a good thing to consider.

393
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,270
If there is a third party,

394
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,139
I bet that could be
the reason I feel so anxious.

395
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:01,308
So does anybody have an idea

396
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,076
why the king
might have injured himself?

Knuckle: Hold on a second.

I thought that was just a theory
you were thinking about.

399
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,850
Killua: Yeah, but you agreed

400
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:12,085
that there was
no other logical explanation.

that there could be
other exceptions?

Following that logic,

405
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,464
