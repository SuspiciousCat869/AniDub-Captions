youpi proved his worth.

324
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:10,711
There, standing in the middle
of the gaping chasm

325
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:13,814
between lingering pleasure
and numbing despair,

326
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:16,583
youpi was trying
desperately to figure out

327
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:19,019
how to utilize
this self-indulgent ability

328
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:23,223
in a way that would
better benefit the king.

329
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,626
Menthuthuyoupi: Selflessness.

Narrator:
The instincts of an ant

331
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:32,933
and his nature as a magical
beast functioned calmly

332
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:36,703
even after discovering
his explosive emotions.

333
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,940
Menthuthuyoupi:
The best way I can think of

334
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:43,543
to serve the king
is to control this fury

335
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,480
without being consumed
by emotion.

336
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:53,821
In other words, I need to use it
to destroy these pests.

337
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,557
Narrator: Youpi was now armed

338
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,561
with both passion
and presence of mind,

339
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:04,598
which meant that, for knuckle,
the risks were incredibly high.

340
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,669
Three minutes have passed
