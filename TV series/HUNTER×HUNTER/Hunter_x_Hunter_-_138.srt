Narrator: On August eighth,
at precisely 12 A.M.

16
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,346
The voting
to elect a 13th chairman

17
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,714
who would succeed netero

18
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:24,518
began inside the hunter
association headquarters.

19
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:29,656
The rules were set by ging,
and one provision

20
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:35,062
made all 661 members
both voter and candidate.

21
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:39,132
On this day, voter turnout
was below the required 95%,

22
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,235
and the rules stated
that a revote must be held.

23
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,272
However, the second vote

24
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,641
also failed
to meet the requirements,

25
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,510
and of course, as per the rules,

26
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,245
the process
would have to start again.

28
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,251
from the first
two rounds of voting,

29
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,752
I have two proposals.

30
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,588
One, have Mr. Beans
review all ballots

31
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,725
in order to reduce
the number of invalid votes.

32
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,060
Two, hunters who break the rules

33
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,429
by abstaining
or submitting invalid votes

34
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,332
will have their licenses
temporarily confiscated.

35
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,635
Now, what do all of you
think about that?

36
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,037
Saiyu: If we
implement the first,

37
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,039
do we still need the second?

38
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,442
I mean, just getting rid
of the invalid votes

39
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,343
would put us over 95%.

40
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,179
Pariston: Eh, i’m not so sure.

41
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,781
Some hunters may play hooky

42
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,617
when they learn they
can’t submit invalid votes.

43
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,654
There are people who want
to spit on netero’s wishes.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,322
Kanzai: Wait. What?

45
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,524
Mizaistom: Drop it.
You’re just gonna drag this out.

46
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,461
Pariston: I’m sorry.
Did I say something wrong?

47
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:45,298
The former chairman declared
that a 95% turnout was required.

48
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,568
Invalid votes and no-shows
disrespect his memory.

49
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,471
Kanzai: No! They just don’t want
to see you become the chairman!

50
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,773
Don’t you get it?

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,308
Pariston:
Then they should exercise

52
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,409
their right to vote
for someone else.

53
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,679
I’m certain that there are other
qualified candidates out there,

54
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,348
though it appears
that the majority

55
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,117
of hunters may disagree.

56
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,153
It’s possible,
with your limited vocabulary

57
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,422
and math skills,
that’s hard to grasp.

Mizaistom: I said
don’t drag this out.

61
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,533
This is your warning, kanzai.

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,569
Cheadle:
I think we should take the time

63
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,737
to broadcast
each candidate’s message

64
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,739
before we start
adding new rules.

65
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,442
Abstaining and
casting invalid votes

66
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,077
aren’t really violations.

67
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,078
Pariston: I fully agree
with your first statement,

68
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,148
but the second makes me wonder
if I heard you right.

69
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,684
I can’t imagine that you,
miss cheadle,

70
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,686
the faction leader
for the former chairman,

71
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,154
would speak that way.

72
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,190
The former chairman said

73
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,626
the election’s
difficulty level would be d,

74
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,627
which means that,
for us starred hunters,

75
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,664
this should be
a relatively simple task.

76
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,701
Relax. The chairman
trusted us to handle this,

77
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,369
and i’m confident we will.

78
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,770
Cluck: Pariston, you’re a pain!

79
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,272
Don’t talk! Shut up!

80
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,074
Piyon: It shows
that he trusts the zodiacs,

81
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,743
so we really
shouldn’t read any more

82
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,345
into the difficulty level
than that.

83
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,747
"S" means get moving.

84
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,449
An "f" means
he’s really challenging us.

85
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,685
Saiyu: Look,
spin it however you want,

86
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,722
but nobody’s actually violated
the rules here, scumbag.

87
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:18,058
Pariston: I call them violations
as a wake-up call

88
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,693
to all those
who might think that they’re

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,030
respecting the former chairman
by trying to gum up the works.

90
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,565
I want them to know
they owe it to him

91
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,468
to make this election
run smoothly and quickly.

92
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,537
Kanzai: Then say it
during your speech.

93
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,373
It’s coercion to make it
part of the damn rules!

94
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,275
Pariston: Is coercion
such a bad thing

95
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,543

96

Got it. We’re done.

with either suggestion.

I know our motivations
are very different,

99
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,255
but I do agree that
all hunters should participate,

100
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:51,192
unless they have
a good reason not to.

101

that those who have
had their licenses confiscated

105
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,334
shouldn’t be
counted as hunters?

to manipulate the vote.

111
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,215
We’ll just hold licenses.
That’s all.

112
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,217

- Pariston: Hmm?

A pro hunter knows better

114

than to lose their license.

115
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,623
If they do,
they may be a screw-up,

116
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,226
but they still remain a hunter
under the official bylaws.

117
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,029
Pariston: Hmm. Now let’s see.

118
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,664
It sounds like you’re saying

119
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,133
that someone could use
the threat of a hunter license

120
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,703
going missing
to manipulate the election.

121
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,639
Sadly, that’s just
not something we can prevent.

122
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,042
Make a note of this
in the minutes, please!

123
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,412
Even those hunters who have
misplaced their licenses

124
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,349
will still be able
to cast their vote!

125
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,185
That way, we guarantee
that no one can manipulate

126
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,355
the turnout or the majority.
Problem solved.

I hate to admit it,

129
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:04,231
but unless we do something
to get out the vote,

130
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:08,102
we’ll never be able to wipe that
smirk off of pariston’s face.

131
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,003
Ginta, cluck, and piyon

132
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,205
are manipulating
the votes for themselves.

133
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,074
That much is obvious.

134
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,711
But if they can’t pull it off,

135
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,080
we’re all screwed.

136
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,019
I am furious with myself
for thinking this,

137
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:30,624
but part of me
wishes that ging were here.

138
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:38,799
He’s a monster,
and he’s out of control.

139
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,739
Why did the chairman select him,
of all people,

140
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,707
to be the vice-chairman?

141

my second-in-command myself,

142

it would be
boring to have a yes man.

143
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:06,292
It should be someone
I can’t even stand to look at.

144
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,329
That’s exactly
the kind of person
