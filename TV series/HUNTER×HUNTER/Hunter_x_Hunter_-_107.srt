This is the world
i’d always dreamed about,

the world I longed
to be a part of,

328
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:38,378
but deep down, I thought
it was beyond my reach,

329
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:40,047
that it wasn’t meant for me,

given up hope on!

it was meant to be.

Give me a break.

Killua: The world that you’re
about to step into with me,

it’s more brutal
than what you’re used to.

340
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:19,820
It may seem similar,
but there’s a huge difference

never think
of throwing their lives away.

But if you can take
perfect care of your body

346

and drink poison that’s
barely under the lethal dose

347

without the least hesitation,
you can survive.

How do you always say
the words I most want to hear?

Thanks for the warning,
but all I see is paradise.

353

I’ll go, no matter the cost.

I’ve seen the other side.
