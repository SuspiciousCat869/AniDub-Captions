00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,503
[narrator] Heavens Arena.

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,797
The 251-story building

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:09,134
which stands 991 meters tall

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,386
is a mecca for fighters.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,847
When combatants win a fight,

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,891
they may advance by one class,

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,477
and receive a corresponding reward.

8
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,773
After reaching the 100th floor, 
they are assigned a private room.

9
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,901
And those contestants 
who are skilled and fortunate enough

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,986
to reach the 200th floor,

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,366
earn the right to challenge 
the strongest fighters, the Floor Masters,

12
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,868
in an intense battle for survival.

13
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,746
This is, without a doubt,

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,707
the best stage a warrior could ask for.

15
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,260
[theme song playing]

16
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,377
[Sadaso] 
Today, I’ll beat Killua for my sixth win.

17
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,881
Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon 
for my seventh win.

18
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,716
After that

19
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,886
all I’ll need to do 
is find three more suckers...

20
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,179
[chuckling]

21
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,556
...then I’ll be a Floor Master!

22
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,476
With the kind of fame and fortune 
that’ll get me,

23
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,645
I’ll be set for the rest of my life!

24
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,188
[gasps]

25
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,026
[Killua] You move, you die.

26
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,403
You use Nen and you die.

27
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,364
Make a sound and you die.

28
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,158
If you understand, close your eyes.

29
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,455
Do you see what happens 
when you break your promises?

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,042
If you do, open your eyes,

31
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,295
look at me in the mirror 
and listen carefully.

32
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,136
Don’t ever show your dirty face 
in front of us again.

33
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,889
You’ll keep this promise.

34
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:06,395
POWER x TO x AVENGE

35
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,858
[narrator] There are many who would resort 
to using underhanded tactics

36
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,652
to become a Floor Master.

37
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,946
Gon, on the other hand,

38
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,531
has been fiercely concentrating

39
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,325
on improving his Nen 
and growing stronger.

40
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,620
And tonight, 
he has his battle with Sadaso.

41
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,124
[Sadaso] His eyes…

42
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,544
they belong to someone 
who lives in the world of darkness.

43
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,839
I was filled with despair.

44
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,467
I could sense the difference in strength 
the second our eyes met.

45
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,388
It was clear that he was the predator 
and I was his prey.

46
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,475
It was a huge mistake 
to underestimate him.

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,686
He isn’t just some normal kid.

48
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,190
I don’t want to die,

49
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,401
so I’m getting the hell out of here.

50
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,069
You should be careful.

51
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,488
He’ll be coming after you guys next!

52
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,246
[disconnected call signal]

53
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,500
[Gido] Now what?

54
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,045
Well, I’m still in.

55
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,048
And I’m willing to do whatever it takes.

56
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,510
I’m almost a Floor Master.

57
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,263
Ten victories on this floor

58
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,141
and you’re allowed 
to challenge a Floor Master.

59
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:31,021
If you win, 
you get an entire floor to yourself.

60
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,898
[uneasy grunting]

61
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,776
And as soon as that title is in your hand,

62
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,820
you can lecture, teach, and advise.

63
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,281
Or start up a martial arts school.

64
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,909
For the rest of your life,

65
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,494
you’ve got it made.

66
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,123
[Gido] Do you think that kid’s 
gonna come back here to threaten us?

67
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,044
[Riehlvelt] 
The boy has no clue what my abilities are.

68
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,005
As long as we’re careful about it,

69
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,758
we should be able 
to handle him quite easily.

70
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,968
-[Killua] You're wrong. 
-[Riehlvelt and Gido gasp]

71
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,765
It doesn’t really matter 
what your abilities are.

72
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,850
[Gido groans]

73
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,895
There’s no rush.

74
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,772
You see… I can always get to you.

75
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,527
Whenever and wherever I want.

76
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,863
At night, when you’re sound asleep 
in your bed...

77
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,157
when you’re taking a crap…

78
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,826
Right?

79
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,546
Listen up.

80
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,840
You should follow the rules.

81
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,050
Without the rules,

82
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,262
the only ones benefitting would be us.

83
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,272
[chuckles]

84
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,026
As I was saying: 
cheating is a terrible idea.

85
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,820
A fair fight is the way to go.

86
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,071
Right.

87
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,830
[referee] Sadaso’s time is up!

88
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,124
Gon wins by default!

89
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,710
[spectator 1] What? Again?

90
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,462

Yeah, what the hell is Sadaso doing?

92
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:32,225

JUNE 4

00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,361
[Wing] All right. So today…

96
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,530
Gon will be fighting Gido.

97
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,324
After that, of course,

98
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,951
Killua will be going up against Riehlvelt.

99
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,621
Are you both feeling all right?

100
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,580
[both] Yes sir.

101
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,708
Now, this will be your second match 
against Gido,

102
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,628
so I doubt you’ll require much advice.

103
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,589
Have you settled on a strategy?

104
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,882
Yes.

105
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,927
I, uh... think I have. 
Well, here’s the thing…

106
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,140
My strategy is to use that.

107
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,808
[Killua] Huh?

108
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,727
Yes, I understand.

109
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,481
[cheering]

110
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,067
[Cocco] The rematch 
you’ve all been waiting for

111
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,193
is finally here!

112
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,528
Gido versus Gon!

113
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,281
Their last match landed Gon 
in the hospital

114
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,117
but there’s no telling 
what we’re in for this time!

115
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,746
For today’s match, 
Gon is carrying a fishing rod!

116
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,500
But how exactly does he plan to use it?

117
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,294
Will he be incorporating it 
into his fighting style?

118
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,129
Let’s find out!

119
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,966
This is a points and KO system.

120
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,550
No time limit!

121
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,260
Begin!

122
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,890
[Cocco] Right off the bat, 
Gon takes off in a mad dash!

123
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,477
But it looks like Gido 
was prepared for this!

124
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,938
He’s already responding 
with his Tornado Top!

125
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,274
If Gon charges in,

126
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,860
he’ll be in the same position 
he was last time!

127
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,988
[Gon] He’s way ahead of me.

128
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,490
[Gido cackling]

129
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,617
[Gido] I know what you’re thinking.

130
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,160
Once I’ve started spinning,

131
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,287
it’s virtually impossible to stop me!

132
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,457
The only logical course would be to hit me

133
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,627
with a preemptive attack 
before I even start.

134
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,047
Well, if you’re not going to make a move, 
I will!

135
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,091
Shotgun Blues!

136
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,634
SHOTGUN BLUES

137
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,262
He can fire off his tops mid-spin?

138
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,597
[Gido] As you can see,

139
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,100
this technique 
is nothing like the Battle Waltz!

140
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,978
All my tops will be aiming right for you!

141
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,313
You’ll never be able to dodge them all!

142
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,690
Ren!

143
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,778
[Gido] What?!

144
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,780
-[audience] Ooh! 
-Whoa! He stopped them!

145
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,532
Did you just see that?

146
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:53,783
Oh, wow…

147
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,994
[Cocco] That was incredible!

148
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,413
Gon just blocked the tops head-on!

149
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,459
He is not the same competitor 
he was two months ago!

150
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,505
[Gido] Argh! Damn!

151
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,008
His Nen defenses have shot way up!

152
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,427
Will my tops still be enough to beat him?

153
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,139
[Killua] 
Those tops were coming straight at him.

154
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,058
With his reflexes,

155
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,894
Gon could’ve knocked them all down 
with his fishing rod.

156
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,147
But he chose to go with Ren instead…

157
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,609
and that did way 
more psychological damage to Gido.

158
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,823
He must be thinking about 
how they used Zushi to blackmail us...

159
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,784
and he’s furious.

160
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,952
Okay, it’s my turn now!

161
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,748
[Cocco] I wonder what technique 
Gon will use this time, folks!

162
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,626
[Gido] He’s using a fishing rod

163
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,961
and that can only mean one thing…

164
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,341
he’ll try to snag my clothes 
and bring my spinning to a halt!

165
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,803
But it’s not going to be that easy.

166
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,518
[grunts]

167
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,021
[Cocco] There it is! 
He’s going straight for Gido!

168
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,440
[cackling] I knew it.

169
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,609
Not gonna happen!

170
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,489
[Cocco] Oh, no!

171
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,116
His attack missed its target!

172
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,369
[Gido] 
[cackling] What were you even aiming at?

173
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,707
[roaring]

174
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,376
What the--?!

175
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,254
[Cocco] Unbelievable!

176
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,257
Gon flipped the floor tile 
and Gido along with it!

177
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,676
[screaming]

178
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,890
[groaning]

179
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,433
[yells]

180
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,229
[grunts]

181
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,316
-[roaring] 
-No! Wait!

182
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,704
[Cocco] G-- Gon has just broken 
Gido’s steel prosthetic leg,

183
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,457
making it very unlikely 
that he’ll be able to continue the fight!

184
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,836
[Gon] If you guys resort to any means,

185
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,754
then we won’t hold back, either!

186
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,883
And if you even touch Zushi ever again,

187
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,136
next time I see you, 
I’ll break your face in half!

188
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,889
[moaning]

189
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,727
[referee] The winner is... Gon!

190
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,687
[cheering]

191
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,733
[Cocco] Gon was finally able 
to avenge his initial loss to Gido!

192
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,528
His record on the 200th floor 
is now two to one!

193
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,208
All right. Guess I’m up next.

194
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,128
[Cocco] 
And now for the main event of the day…

195
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,088
Killua versus Riehlvelt!

196
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,550
Since Sadaso forfeited the previous match,

197
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,970
this will technically be Killua’s 
200th floor debut!

198
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,349
What kind of strategy 
are we about to see now?

199
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,894
You do realize 
that you broke your promise first.

200
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,188
There’s no way I’ll let you win now.

201
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,692
[Sadaso] His eyes…

202
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,321
they belong to someone 
who lives in the world of darkness.

203
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,617
[Riehlvelt] “Someone who lives 
in the world of darkness”?

204
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,538
So, what if this brat 
is a professional assassin?

205
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,791
Heavens Arena is my turf!

206
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,669
It’s time for me to show him

207
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,713
that within the four sides 
of this square stage…

208
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,382
I rule!

209
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,138
Go, Killua! You can do it!

210
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,437
This is a points and KO system!

211
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,022
No time limit!

212
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,691
Begin!

213
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,486
He vanished?

214
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,201
Behind me!

215
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,661
Aura Burst!

216
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,455
AURA BURST

217
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,834
[Cocco] 
Riehlvelt boosted out of harm’s way!

218
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,629
He propels his wheelchair 
by releasing his stored aura,

219
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,257
guiding it to wherever he wants to go!

220
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,010
I jumped too high.

221
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,179
Whew. That was close.

222
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,978
Two Headed Snake: Twin Serpents!

223
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,778
Song of Defense!

224
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,155
SONG OF DEFENSE

225
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,157
[Cocco] There it is, folks!

226
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,159
Riehlvelt’s Song of Defense!

227
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,161
He protects himself with two whips,

228
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,996
moving at ridiculously high speeds

229
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,957
then waits patiently 
for his chance to strike!

230
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,295
[Riehlvelt] You planned to attack first 
and take the lead.

231
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,714
Too bad that didn’t work for ya!

232
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,549
Now that I’ve taken this stance,

233
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,926
there is no way you could possibly win!

234
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,303
Why’s that?

235
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,638
[Riehlvelt] It’s obvious, isn’t it?

236
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,726
No normal person on the planet 
can keep up with these two whips!

237
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,439
And on this little platform, 
there’s nowhere you can run and hide!

238
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,028
[sighs]

239
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,746
Take this!

240
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,339
Yeah? Well, I’m not normal.

241
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,507
Sorry ‘bout that.

242
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,133
[Riehlvelt] What?!

243
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,593
Fine, then.

244
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,393
Thunder Serpent!

245
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,436
[Killua straining]

246
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,275
Hmm...

247
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,948
I’m surprised, Killua!

248
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,535
You’re the first person I’ve fought 
who could see my whips in motion!

249
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,329
So, I’ve got a little present for you!

250
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,999
Those two whips together 
carry one million volts!

251
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,504
More than enough 
to paralyze and incapacitate a giant!

252
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,215
Anyone foolish enough to resist my whips,

253
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,843
will fall victim 
to the mighty Thunder Serpent!

254
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,429
[Riehlvelt shrieking]

255
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,266
I’m trained to endure torture,

256
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,976
so electricity won’t work.

257
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,978
It has no effect on me.

258
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,564
I mean, I can tolerate it...

259
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,399
But it isn’t like it makes me happy.

260
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,485
It still really hurts a lot 
and everything.

261
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,821
That's why I'm a little pissed.

262
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,197
[crazed chuckle]

263
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,951
[Killua] There’s no way you can survive 
a fall from that height.

264
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,953
So, what do you wanna do?

265
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,456
[Riehlvelt] 
Catch me! Please! Don’t let me die!

266
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,124
Okay then.

267
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,877
Don’t worry; I’m right here for you!

268
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,421
[frightened cry]

269
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,049
[high-pitched scream of pain]

270
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,010
[crazed chuckle]

271
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,220
[shuddering breath]

272
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,514
Damn it.

273
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,559
At least now you know 
how much that hurts, you idiot.

274
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,231
Riehlvelt is down 
and so, by virtue of a knockdown,

275
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,900
Killua takes the victory!

276
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,943
[cheering]

277
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,864
[Zushi shouting and laughing]

278
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,791
Nice job, Killua!

279
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,502
[Killua chuckles]

280
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,670
Thanks!

281
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,257
That means you’re up next.

282
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,052
How long ‘til you fight him? Ten days?

283
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,513
Yup. It’ll be on June 10th.

284
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,350
Just remember what worked for me 
isn’t gonna work for you, okay?

285
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,936
If those electric whips 
so much as touch you,

286
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,855
you’ll be out cold 
before you even know what’s happening.

287
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,023
Mm-hmm.

288
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,901
What’s your strategy?

289
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,612
Oh, don’t worry. I think I have an idea.

290
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,113
Oh?

291
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,367
You weren’t watching for nothing, were ya?

292
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,578
Guess you prefer combat to observing, too.

293
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,838
Hmm...

294
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,257
[chuckles quietly]

295
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,639
JUNE 9

296
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,934
[Cocco] It appears that the damage 
Gido sustained in his match with Gon

297
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,185
was so severe

298
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,813
that he hasn’t returned for today’s fight.

299
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,942
[referee] 
The winner by default is… Killua!

300
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,571
JUNE 10

301
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,872
[Cocco] After losing to Killua, 
Riehlvelt’s record is five-three.

302
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,083
He can’t afford another loss!

303
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,837
As you know, after four losses 
you’re out of the contest

304
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,464
and have to start over from square one!

305
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,594
He must be wary of Gon’s speed,

306
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,929
because he’s got his whips out already.

307
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,808
Meanwhile, Gon isn’t carrying 
his fishing rod.

308
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,060
He’s completely empty-handed!

309
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,396
How does he plan to fight this time?

310
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,024
Begin!

311
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,319
[Cocco] 
Song of Defense, right from the start!

312
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,031
Riehlvelt wants to end this fight 
in a hurry!

313
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,616
Hmm...

314
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,955
[Cocco] What’s this? Gon is… squatting?

315
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,876
[roaring]

316
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,839
[Cocco] He just ripped up the stone tile 
with his bare hands, folks!

317
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,384
-[roars] 
-[Cocco] And now he threw it!

318
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,053
[Riehlvelt] Aura Burst!

319
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,640
[Cocco] He escaped in the nick of time!

320
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,810
[Killua] 
He left him a way out on purpose….

321
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,896
[Riehlvelt gasps in shock]

322
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,856
[Cocco] But Gon anticipated that move,

323
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,858
and he’s already one step ahead!

324
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,112
[Hisoka] 
When you’re trying to escape,

325
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,698
every fraction of a second counts.

326
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,451
And without time to change direction,

327
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,912
all you can do is continue 
to move forward.

328
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:28,334
And accelerating as quickly as that 
will throw you off-balance.

329
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,921
His only option at that point 
was to stop the whips.

330
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,299
That’s the time to move in!

331
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,184
[screaming in pain]

332
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,731
[wheezing]

333
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,319
So, this is the switch, huh?

334
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,737
Let’s see…

335
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,739
I’ll just turn it up to the max.

336
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,658
No! Stop!

337
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,159
Switch it…

338
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,994
Stop it!

339
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:08,082
...on!

340
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,841
Just kidding.

341
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,428
Riehlvelt is down!

342
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,346
That counts as a knockout.

343
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,724
The win goes to Gon!

344
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,726
[cheering]

345
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,728
Hey, Gon!

346
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,751
[clapping]

347
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,925
Splendid. Just splendid.

348
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,511
Including your last two matches,

349
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,722
you’ve made progress.

350
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,517
You've made the grade,

351
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,020
so set the time and place 
of your choosing.

352
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,941
I’ll take you on any time.

353
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,031
[determined grunt]

354
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,421
[narrator] The strength that Gon 
demonstrated in his matches

355
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,632
did not escape Hisoka unnoticed.

356
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,052
It won’t be long now 
before their fight begins.

357
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,141
[theme song playing]

358
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,166
[Gon] Coming up:

359
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,585
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

360
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,128
[both] Hunterpedia!

361
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,838
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

362
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,339
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

363
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,508
Today, we're introducing Cocco.

364
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,052
She announces all of the fights 
at Heavens Arena!

365
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,638
Oh. You mean the lady 
who’s always talking, huh?

366
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,807
I wonder… how many of her are there?

367
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,434
You think there are mor--?!

368
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,939
[Gon] Next time: “The x True x Pass”!

369
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,274
Killua.

370
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,359
What does ‘so-and-so 
and such-and-such’ mean?

371
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,777
[Killua] You really don’t know?

372
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,905
It means "so and so and such and such"!
