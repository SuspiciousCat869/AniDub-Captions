Narrator: He first releases
a ball of aura as a nucleus.

164
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,558
He then envelops it
with smoke aura,

165
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,828
creating
a free-moving smoke puppet,

166
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,563
one that he can command

167
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,432
through programmed nen
within the nucleus.

168
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,766
His ability allows him

169
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,604
to sustain 216 puppets
at a single time.

170

Morel: I’ve made my soldiers
more responsive,

171
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,478
so in the event
that the enemy retaliates,

172
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:14,015
I can maintain
50 of them at once,

173
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,016
and they’re highly effective.

174
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,421
One big advantage
to doing it this way

175
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,956
is that en can’t differentiate

176
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,692
between one of these
and a human being.

177
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,995
But chimera ants are still ants,

178
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,499
so neferpitou won’t leave
the king’s side.

179
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,769
He’s recalled the controlled
humans to the capital

180
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,338
for defensive positions,
as expected.

181
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,774
that tells me
they’ve made a decision

182
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,509
about their priorities,

183
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:45,146
and the king’s safety
is number one.

184
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,749
So restricting the movement
of the royal guard

185
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,550
should be a piece of cake.

186
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,954
The only question is,
how will the king respond?

187
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,756
If he’s impulsive,

188
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,760
it’ll be harder
to anticipate his actions.

The king is nearly

to come out there

We’ll be there to protect him,
of course,
