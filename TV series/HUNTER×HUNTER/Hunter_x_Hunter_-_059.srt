Hunter: With your paltry nen,

321
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:41,582
it’d be game over for you
in no time.

322
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,317
Gon: Damn that guy!

323
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,118
I’ll show him game over!

324
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,388
Kurapika: I see
you’re hard at work.

325
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:49,890
Gon: Kurapika!
You feeling any better?

326
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:53,994
Yeah. My fever broke,
so i’m all right now.

327
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,297
Gon: Wow.
He sure doesn’t look all right.

328
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,266
But if kurapika finds out

329
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,935
that the spiders
are still in yorknew city,

330
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,572
will there be
any way to stop him?

331
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,173
Kurapika: Tell me,

332
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,376
how did everything go
at the auction?

333
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,245
I believe you were going
after an expensive game.

334
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,614
Gon: Uh, yeah.

335
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,117
Kurapika: I see.

336
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,619
So they’re screening players,
are they?

337
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:23,423
Gon: Hey, what kind of training
did you do while you were gone?

338
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:27,094
Kurapika: Once I decided
I wanted to conjure chains,

339
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,562
mostly imagery training.

340
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,032
Not only did I feel them
with my eyes closed,

341
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,434
I drew hundreds,
maybe thousands of sketches.

342
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,338
I looked at chains
and even tasted them,

343
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:38,939
smelled, and listened.

344
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,108
My master told me
to play with them constantly,

345
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,411
so that’s exactly what I did.

346
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,414
After a while,
he took them away from me,

347
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,418
and it was then that I began
to hallucinate chains.

348
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:55,555
It wasn’t long after that
the hallucinations felt heavy,

349
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,358
I could feel them,
cold and grating,

350
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,127
and once that happened,

351
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,529
I was able
to conjure chains myself.

352
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:05,299
But otherwise,
it was the same as you,

353
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,733
just ten and ren.

354
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,168
Gon: ’kay.

( Gasps )

356
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,004
I’ve got an idea.

357
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,740
You can be my master.

358
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:15,409
You can point out
what i’m doing right

359
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,344
and what i’ve got wrong.

360
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:21,548
This way, I can keep kurapika
busy while the auction happens.

361
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:23,684
Kurapika: I’m sorry,
but I can’t.

362
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,652
- Gon: What?
- Kurapika: I’m afraid

363
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:28,122
that my boss
will be leaving tomorrow,

364
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,758
and i’m obligated
to accompany her.

365
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,159
Gon: You’re leaving yorknew?

366
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,560
Kurapika: Yes,

367
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:37,231
although i’m still concerned
about the spiders.

368
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,399
But it has been two days now,

369
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,336
so I suppose
they probably left already.

370
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:46,173
( Gon sighs ) Well,
it’s probably for the best.

371
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,708
Kurapika: But what about you?

372
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,176
Who taught you nen?

373
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,577
You should ask them.

374
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:53,080
They’d be a better resource
than I am.

375
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,049
( Wing laughs )

376
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,451
A special attack?

377
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,186
That’s just like you two.

378
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,088
I can tell you this much.

379
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,790
Enhancers really don’t need
a special attack at all.

380
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:05,392
Gon: But why not?

381
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,295
Wing: Well, because enhancers
are the most balanced,

382
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,163
both in offense and defense.

383
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,433
If you can master ten and ren,

384
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:15,703
you will produce enough force
to be quite destructive indeed.

385
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:18,572
Gon: What if I don’t have
that much time?

386
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,474
The screening’s
just four days away.

387
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,410
Wing: Gon, if I were a judge,

388
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,278
I would be very disappointed

389
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:28,115
if someone showed me
an improvised special attack.

390

No matter what happens,

393

you must not try
to emulate kurapika.

If you think about it,

395
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,528
i’m sure you won’t need me
to tell you why.

Gon: No, sir.

Wing: So just be yourself.

398

You’re powerful enough
on your own merits

399
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,335
that you really have no need
to imitate others.

Gon: You think so?

401

Wing: I do.
I want you to reflect

that you’re capable of.
