1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,587
[Gon] He’s so far beyond me.

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,549
But he’s not so far out of reach 
I can’t catch up someday.

3
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,803
I need more training in Nen.

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,932
I’ve gotta find a power 
that’s as strong as Hisoka’s!

5
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,233
[theme song playing]

00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,976
[birds squawking]

7
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,569
[Gon] Aunt Mito!

8
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,614
Aunt Mito!

9
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,993
Aunt Mito, hey!

10
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,706
Gon.

11
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,334
Gon!

12
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,920
Aunt Mito!

13
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,672
[Gon laughs]

14
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,633
I’m finally home!

15
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,718
Welcome back.

16
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,808
And you must be Killua.

17
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,685
What?

18
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,650
GING X AND X GON

19
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,944
[Mito] My goodness,

20
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,280
I wish you’d let me know 
you were coming home.

21
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,949
I didn’t have time to prepare!

22
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,036
It’s fine. No big deal.

23
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,954
Maybe not to you!

24
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,248
But your friend just came all this way…

25
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,042
[Killua] Oh, don’t worry about me!

26
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,504
[Mito] 
Honestly, you should’ve called at least!

27
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,922
I’ve been worried sick!

28
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,009
[Mito] Are you listening?

29
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,387
[muffled laughter]

30
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,471
[Mito] Oh, right.

31
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,557
You two go and take your baths 
while I finish supper.

32
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,601
And put out all of your dirty clothes.

33
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,852
I’ll do laundry.

34
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,729
-[Gon] Okay, later. 
-Right now!

35
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,189
You’ve got ten seconds!

36
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,858
-One. Two. Three. 
-[Gon] Ooh!

37
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,652
-Is she always like this? 
-[Mito] Four.

38
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,653
-Five. 
-Pretty much.

39
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,822
-[Mito] Six. Seven. 
-Come on. Hurry up!

40
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,907
[Mito] Eight. Nine. Ten.

41
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,496
Yeah… Now this is what I call living!

42
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,792
[Mito] Okay, let's eat.

43
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,461
[Killua] Wow! It looks delicious!

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,891
What’s going on?

45
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,769
We’re offering our gratitude.

46
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,398
-‘Kay, what does that mean? 
-Well? Let’s dig in!

47
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,734
Please, help yourself 
to whatever you like!

48
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:54,735
[Killua] Thanks!

49
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,959
-[Gon] Oh yeah… Aunt Mito. 
-Hmm?

50
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,544
Look!

51
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,379
This is a Hunter License.

52
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,300
Wow…

53
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,427
It looks pretty ordinary.

54
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:22,929
There.

55
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,640
[Gon yelps] 
Come on! What do you think you’re doing?!

56
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,184
[Mito laughs] I’m kidding!

57
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,227
You know I wouldn’t do that.

58
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,314
[Gon] Well… I just hope it still works.

59
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,404
Aunt Mito!

60
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,573
I’m gonna go show Killua 
around the island! ‘Kay?

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,910
But won’t that take a while?

62
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,745
Want me to pack lunch?

63
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,705
[Gon] It’s okay!

64
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,665
We’ll find something to eat in the forest!

65
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,172
[Gon] Whoa!

66
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,882
[both laughing]

67
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,402
-[Killua straining] 
-[both laughing]

68
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,344
Where are they? It’s getting late.

69
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,764
It’s been a little while 
since he was last home.

70
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,892
And it’s the first time 
he brought a friend with him.

71
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,896
They’ll be back pretty late.

72
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,273
I’m sure they’re fine.

73
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,567
Yes, you’re probably right.

74
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,781
Maybe I should take some food out to them.

75
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,078
[crickets chirping]

76
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,878
-[Killua] Hey, Gon… 
-Hm?

77
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,840
So, uh… What are you gonna do now?

78
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,014
[Gon] Well, I think I’m gonna rest up here 
for a little bit

79
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,558
while I gather all the information 
that I’m gonna need.

80
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,853
For when I finally go to Yorknew City 
to find my dad.

81
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,187
[Killua] Oh.

82
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,939
I gotcha.

83
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,402
What do you think I should do?

84
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,447
You should stay here, too!

85
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,198
Then go to Yorknew City with me!

86
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,701
I know. I am coming with you.

87
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,828
But that isn’t what I meant.

88
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,457
I was just thinking I admire you.

89
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,377
There’s nothing I wanna do.

90
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,588
You’ve got your thing.

91
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,214
I don’t have anything.

92
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,432
There are plenty of things 
I don’t wanna do, though.

93
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,935
Like stay in that house,

94
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,562
or take over the family business.

95
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,026
I guess I’m a little bit... jealous.

96
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,863
-[Gon] Killua. 
-Huh?

97
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,949
It’s fun.

98
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,742
Hanging out with you, I mean.

99
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,621
Hey… Where did that come from?

100
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,957
Whale Island’s an outpost.

101
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,794
It’s where fishermen stay 
when they’re at sea a long time.

102
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,089
Not a lot of people who live here 
are natives.

103
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,883
There is a girl around my age

104
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,219
but I just never got to know her 
very well.

105
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,429
So, you’re kinda my first friend.

106
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,306
My same age and everything!

107
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,602
Yeah, I know what you mean.

108
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,938
Being stuck in that house all day…

109
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,191
and spending all my time 
learning how to kill people.

110
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,902
You were my first real friend.

111
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,279
When we’re together, you have fun, right?

112
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,447
Huh?

113
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,742
I guess so, yeah.

114
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,829
I do too, so I think 
we should stick together!

115
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,541
Let’s travel around 
and see the whole world!

116
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,001
Just you and me!

117
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,546
You don’t know how embarrassing 
you’re being right now, huh?

118
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,548
[Gon chuckles sheepishly]

119
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,971
I’ll go look for my dad…

120
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,309
and you can look for something 
you really want to do.

121
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,608
It’s gonna be so fun!

122
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,446
You’re right.

123
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,115
Doesn’t sound half bad.

124
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,828
Fine! I’ll look for something to do…

125
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,581
but in the meantime, 
I’ll help you find your dad!

126
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,582
Mhm.

127
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,958
Oh...

128
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,335
I forgot.

129
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,463
You never told me what your mom does.

130
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,265
[Gon] It’s hard to ask about my dad,

131
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,060
but asking about my mom’s even harder.

132
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,773
It’s just that since Aunt Mito 
raised me all by herself…

133
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,566
it feels weird, you know?

134
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,401
Like it’s wrong or something.

135
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,487
Is that how it works?

136
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,822
[Gon] When I was little,

137
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,785
Aunt Mito told me that both my parents 
died in a traffic accident.

138
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,247
She thought if I learned my dad 
was alive and a Hunter,

139
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,751
that I might end up just like he did, so…

140
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,254
She didn’t know how right she was, huh?

141
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,508
[Gon] When I found out about my dad…

142
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,926
I dunno, I guess

143
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,012
I kind of decided 
that if he was still alive somewhere,

144
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,306
my mom must’ve been the one who died.

145
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,351
That’s pretty harsh. Seriously.

146
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,395
Ever since then…

147
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,773
I’ve thought of Aunt Mito as my mom.

148
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,818
The only one I’ve got.

149
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,403
So, there’s nothing for me to ask

150
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,780
and I don’t need to.

151
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,241
I see.

152
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,078
Ah, man…

153
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,248
I wish I had a mom 
that was as cool as your Aunt Mito.

154
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,624
She’s awesome!

155
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,459
Even if she does nag a lot.

156
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,628
[Killua] That's nothing.

157
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,465
If I just say I want to go outside, 
my mom immediately starts crying.

158
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,633
No kidding!

159
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,052
-She gets hysterical and everything. 
-[both laughing]

160
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,973
[Killua] Just the other day…

161
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,949
-Hey, Gon…? 
-Yeah?

162
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,368
How long will you two be staying here?

163
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,668
Maybe about… a month?

164
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,508
And after that…

165
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,971
I’m thinking about going 
to look for my dad.

166
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,807
[sighs]

167
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,860
What’s that?

168
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,487
-It’s something Ging left with me. 
-What?

169
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,657
He asked me to give this to you 
when you became a Hunter.

170
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,245
[Gon] So Dad left this for me?

171
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,496
[Mito] If you want…

172
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,167
I’ll tell you all I know about Ging.

173
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,551
Well, Gon, Ging is my cousin.

174
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,138
My first memory of him 
is actually of his back.

175
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,642
I ran after him everywhere he went.

176
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,312
I think I was about three…

177
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,232
Looking back on it now,

178
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,360
it feels like all I ever did 
was try to keep up with him.

179
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,363
When he was just twelve years old,

180
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,990
Ging left the island 
and took the Hunter Exam,

181
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,325
same as you.

182
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,706
Out of nowhere, 
he just said he was leaving.

183
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,416
But when I asked him why,

184
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,335
all he said was…

185
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,546
“There’s something I want.”

186
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,803
But then, he never actually told me 
what it was he wanted.

187
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,721
So, we argued.

188
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,267
Rather... I was the only one 
doing all the arguing.

189
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,313
But… I never got to see Ging again 
before he packed up and left.

190
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,483
[Great Grandmother] 
Originally, you were told

191
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,736
your parents died 
in a traffic accident, right?

192
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,407
That was actually 
what happened to Mito’s parents.

193
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:03,950
Oh...

194
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:08,079
[Great Grandmother] It happened 
not long after Ging left the island.

195
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,872
After that,

196
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,791
Ging’s dad went on a fishing trip

197
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,127
and then just mysteriously disappeared.

198
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,297
In the end,

199
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,550
I lost both of my sons 
in a very short time.

200
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,636
Yes.

201
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,015
All that happened after he went away.

202
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:33,271
Ging eventually returned to the island 
nearly ten years later.

203
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,023
When he did,

204
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,816
he was carrying you with him.

205
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,401
You were still just a little baby.

206
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,322
He just showed up, 
completely out of the blue

207
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,991
and asked us to take care of you 
for a while.

208
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,368
I asked him about your mother

209
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,204
but all he would say is 
they were separated.

210
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,292
And right when I was about 
to agree to take you,

211
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,461
all of a sudden, she started yelling:

212
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,796
“Are you crazy?!” just like that.

213
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,674
And I imagine everyone on the island 
heard it.

214
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,593
Grandma! You don’t need to tell 'em that!

215
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,762
Now, as I was saying…

216
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,015
I knew we couldn’t rely on Ging 
to raise you by himself.

217
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:15,063
Anyway, we really don’t know 
anything about your mother.

218
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,024
Mito even yelled:

219
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,234
“Don’t you ever come back here!”

220
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,278
And... She was crying and everything.

221
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,488
Please! Grandma!

222
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,198
Where was I?

223
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,366
Oh, yes.

224
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,951
That’s when Ging left this little box 
with us.

225
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,372
This girl…

226
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,333
She tried to throw it away so many times…

227
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,876
Well, I wouldn’t have had to,

228
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,338
if someone didn’t keep putting it back 
right where it was every time!

229
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,715
[Great Grandmother] 
If you really wanted to get rid of it,

230
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,425
you wouldn’t have tossed it 
in a trash can.

231
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,053
You’d have burned it 
or buried it at least.

232
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,930
[huffs]

233
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,394
[sighs] You understand?

234
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,106
And that’s pretty much it.

235
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,692
That’s every last thing 
I know about Ging Freecss.

236
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,865
[Gon] Ging.

237
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,159
Ging, huh?

238
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:11,994
I mean...

239
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,538
Is that…?

240
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,706
Yeah! Yeah, that sounds better!

241
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,874
Ging…

242
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,085
Aunt Mito…

243
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,420
Tell me more about him.

244
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,088
What was Ging like when he was little?

245
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,800
Oh… sorry.

246
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,261
Does it sound weird for me 
to use his name?

247
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,888
It just felt more… natural, I guess.

248
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,099
[sighs] No, that’s not it.

249
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,144
You want to hear what he was like 
as a child?

250
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,353
Yes!

251
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,192
So… did Ging have any other friends here?

252
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,444
Like, his age?

253
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,736
Not really.

254
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,990
The only kids around here 
were myself and your father.

255
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,408
Of course,

256
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,578
I was always practically begging him 
to go and play with me,

257
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,038
but when I did, he would just run off.

258
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,792
You’d follow him 
and you’d get lost every time.

259
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,960
Really?

260
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,379
Thanks! 
We can always count on you, Grandma!

261
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,300
You’d follow Ging 
way up into the mountains

262
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,302
but then you wouldn’t return.

263
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,097
The whole village would panic 
when Ging came back by himself.

264
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,308
And it happened many times.

265
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,979
But when we would all go off 
into the mountains to search,

266
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,607
Ging would always be 
the first to find you,

267
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,774
without fail.

268
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,902
It didn’t matter where you were hiding.

269
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,905
It happened so often,

270
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,659
people started to wonder if it wasn’t 
you and Ging’s idea of a little prank.

271
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,163
What? I would never do 
something like that!

272
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,123
[Great Grandmother] Well, maybe not…

273
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,125
but you were always hiding in places

274
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,294
none of us would ever think to look!

275
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,255
It was almost like 
you didn’t want to be found.

276
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,883
I don’t remember that…

277
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,246
Was that really how it was?

278
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,336
Oh! That reminds me of another time 
that Ging and I…

279
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,713
[snoring]

280
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,223
[Killua] Hmm…

281
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,601
Okay. So...

282
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,271
this… is the box, huh?

283
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,356
Hmm... Let's see...

284
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,485
Uh… how do you open this thing?

285
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,489
I tried a whole buncha things 
but it wouldn’t even budge.

286
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,616
Mind if I use a bit of force?

287
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:56,867
Go ahead.

288
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,744
All right…

289
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,080
[straining]

290
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,543
[panting]

291
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,086
No use.

292
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,337
This thing’s not normal!

293
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,300
I could twist open a regular steel box 
no problem.

294
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,342
Mhmm.

295
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,595
And since we have no idea what’s inside,

296
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,722
we can’t exactly smash it, can we?

297
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,849
Doesn’t make a sound…

298
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,225
[Gon] Hmm...

299
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,021
[Killua] Your dad told Aunt Mito 
she was only supposed to give you this

300
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,064
after you became a Hunter, right?

301
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,983
[Gon] Yeah, that’s what I heard.

302
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,528
Not ‘til you had become a Hunter… huh…

303
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:35,906
Whoa…

304
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,620
Wait a sec…

305
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,455
I got it!

306
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,748
Gon…

307
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,167
There’s still one thing 
we haven’t tried yet!

308
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,126
Huh?

309
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,711
What’s something you have now

310
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,963
that you didn’t have 
before you were a Hunter?

311
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,423
Hey! You’re right!

312
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,675
My Hunter License!

313
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,261
Except… there’s no opening for the card,

314
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,679
so that can’t be it.

315
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,306
[Killua] No, not that.

316
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,141
I meant Nen.

317
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,912
[clatter]

318
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,665
That’s what’s inside?

319
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,000
-Another box? 
-Uh-huh.

320
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,464
Regular steel plates.

321
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,384
No trace of adhesives.

322
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,178
What is it?

323
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,389
[Killua] That design…

324
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,182
Look familiar?

325
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,309
[Gon] Wait this is…

326
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,519
I know!

327
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,522
This looks just like the pattern 
on the promise thread

328
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,232
Mister Wing gave me.

329
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,111
The promise thread

330
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,697
was designed to snap 
if Nen was ever used,

331
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:58,823
wasn’t it?

332
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,077
I’ll bet you this pattern

333
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,413
holds a power similar to Nen.

334
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,039
And it looks like…

335
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,333
maybe the card goes in here.

336
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,714
-Hey! It worked! 
-Bingo!

337
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,300
[Gon] A ring...

338
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,136
and a cassette tape...

339
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,762
And a memory card?

340
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:25,307
Look.

341
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,893
That pattern’s 
on the back of the ring, too.

342
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,063
You should be real careful 
before you try putting it on.

343
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,273
‘Kay.

344
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,816
You think Ging would…

345
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,026
try to do something to me?

346
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,696
[Killua] Better safe than sorry.

347
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,742
Well… We can start by listening 
to the cassette tape.

348
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,785
Guess so.

349
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,288
Oh! Can you copy it first?

350
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,081
Yeah, sure. But why?

351
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,875
Better safe than sorry.

352
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,229
[static crackling]

353
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,898
[Ging on a tape] Hey… Gon.

354
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,569
So, you became a Hunter too, huh?

355
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:21,906
Anyway…

356
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,616
I have a question for you.

357
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:27,870
Do you…

358
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,080
want to see me?

359
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,880
[narrator] It was the first time 
Gon had ever heard his father’s voice.

360
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,592
And it felt to him like Ging 
was reading his mind

361
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,719
and getting right to the point.

362
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,058
[theme song playing]

363
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,584
[Gon] Coming up:

364
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,960
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

365
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,545
[both] Hunterpedia!

366
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,297
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

367
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,923
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

368
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,633
Today, we're introducing Aunt Mito!

369
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,759
She raised me,

370
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,304
so she’ll always be my mom 
as far as I’m concerned.

371
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,347
I really wish I had a mom like Aunt Mito.

372
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,808
She’s the best! 
But she does nag a whole lot.

373
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:13,767
[both giggle]

374
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,317
[Gon] Next time: “Reply x From x Dad”!

375
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,819
Earthquakes, thunderstorms, fires, or Dad…

376
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,779
[Killua] 
Which one of those scares you most?

377
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:26,822
[Gon] Aunt Mito.
