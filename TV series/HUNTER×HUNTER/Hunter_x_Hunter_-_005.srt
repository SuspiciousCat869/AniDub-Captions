are called...

Hunters.

So you are the real one.

17
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,716
The Examiners are Hunters.

18
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,512
Each is hand-picked by the Exam committee 
to do this job without pay.

Anyone who holds the title 
we're vying for ourselves

20
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,729
could have deflected that attack. 
And quite easily, I might add.

21
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,066
I shall take that as a compliment. 
Thank you.

22

Still, should you choose 
to attack me again for any reason,

23
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:36,823
I will have no choice but to report you 
for attacking an Examiner

24
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,409
and have you immediately disqualified.

Guys, here's our chance.

38
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,041
I say we take advantage of the fog 
and get rid of him.

-Yeah?

-Right.

41
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,223
The last thing we want to do is 
lose sight of the Examiner right now.

42
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,268
I just want to put a little more distance 
between Hisoka and us.

43
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,979
Staying too close is dangerous.

44
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,273
I can smell it.

45
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:35,859
Smell, huh?

to the front of the pack.

Hey, calm down, 
don't you feel the tension in the air?

You idiot!

I'd already be there.

we can't tell which way we're going.

It's okay. As long as we don't lose sight

Oh, the drink Tonpa had.

Yeah, probably so. 
But I could have escaped without it.

I'm still pretty worried 
about Leorio and Kurapika.

Forget about them.

We can still make it 
if we start right now.

ever since we met last year.

00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:31,005
Do you really think you can figure out 
which way the main pack went in all this?

132
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,174
He's right. 
We all failed this year.

No way we can catch up

Hunters require prey,

The fact of the matter is,

he's far more experienced

00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,375
and we can't afford to waste more 
on a fight we can't even win.

168
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,065
[cawing]

169
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,068
[loudly] 
Now, run!

170
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,489
[footsteps growing fainter]

171
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:48,870
Hm.

172
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,455
I see.

173
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,457
A wise decision.

174
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,753
[laughs]

175
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,760
Hm?

176
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,851
[Leorio] 
I just couldn't do it.

177
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,396
This may not be my fight,

178
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,732
but I can't sit back 
and pretend nothing happened.

179
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,318
That's not my style.

180
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,490
See, the thing is... 
[loudly] I can't run away.

181
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,408
Leorio!

182
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,119
[yelling loudly]

183
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,415
Hm. 
I adore that look.

184
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,298
What?

185
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,691
[Hisoka grunts]

186
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,449
[Leorio] 
Gon!

187
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,284
Did I make it?

188
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,870
[Hisoka sighs]

189
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,499
Not bad, little boy.

190
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,044
Is that a fishing pole?

191
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,463
How original.

192
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,681
I'd like to see it. Do you mind?

193
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,393
[Leorio] 
Leave him alone.

194
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,439
[yells] 
Your fight's with me!

195
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,361
[Gon cries out]

196
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,157
[grunts]

197
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,201
[Hisoka] 
Did you come here to help your friend?

198
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,619
[gasps]

199
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,456
Such a good boy.

200
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,585
Hm. I adore that look.

201
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,087
[grunts]

202
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,718
Well done.

203
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,928
Very nice.

204
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,307
I'm beginning to get excited.

205
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,268
Right.

206
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,281
[Gon cries out]

207
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,910
[grunts]

208
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,040
[Gon gasping for air]

209
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:49,509
[laughs] 
It's so delightful.

210
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,141
I love that look.

211
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,103
[Hisoka gasps]

212
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,981
[Gon grunts and coughs]

213
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,610
[Hisoka] 
Don't worry.

214
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,822
I didn't kill your friend. 
He's going to be just fine.

215
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,409
And that's because he passed.

216
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,620
[Hisoka laughs]

217
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,792
And yes, you pass as well.

218
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,419
Now go and become a good Hunter.

219
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,215
[beeping]

220
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,635
[man] 
Hisoka. You should get back here.

221
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,930
We're almost reached the site 
of the Second Phase.

222
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,432
Okay, be right there.

223
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,813
It's good to have friends, isn't it?

224
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,526
Can you find your own way back?

225
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,365
Good boy.

226
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,417
[Gon pants]

227
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,136
[Kurapika] 
Gon, are you all right?

228
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,321
Ah, man.

229
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,407
Where is he? 
I was sure Gon would be here.

230
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,118
[chattering]

231
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,177
[Gon] 
This way.

232
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,681
-So you can really tell by the smell? 
-Yeah.

233
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,226
Leorio's always wearing 
this very unique kind of cologne.

234
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,563
I can smell him from 
a few kilometers away, no problem.

235
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,023
[Kurapika] 
Hm.

236
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,155
Hey, I've been thinking.

237
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,076
What do you think Hisoka was talking about 
when he said that we both passed?

238
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,581
I'm not sure but I think 
he might have been playing judge.

239
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,792
-Judge? 
-Yes.

240
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,753
[Kurapika] 
He must have his own benchmarks

241
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,005
for evaluating a person's power.

242
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,634
It's possible that he was measuring 
the strength of each applicant.

243
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,221
Apparently you and Leorio 
met his standards.

244
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,806
Whatever those happen to be.

245
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,058
Okay, right.

246
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,645
That makes sense. But I was powerless 
to do anything to stop him.

247
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,107
You landed your first hit on him. 
That's something, right?

248
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,150
That's only because I surprised him.

249
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,445
And besides, 
Leorio didn't win his fight.

250
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,322
But Hisoka passed him anyway.

251
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,991
[Kurapika] 
Hm, I wonder.

252
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,328
He could have sensed that the two of you 
were sort of kindred spirits.

253
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,038
He sensed it?

254
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,542
It's possible that Hisoka could qualify 
as a Hunter,

255
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,752
but I sincerely doubt it.

256
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,546
However,

257
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,298
I must admit that I'm impressed

258
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,175
by his superhuman agility

259
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,636
and the gracefulness of his technique.

260
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,889
Those who are blessed with unique talents

261
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,143
are often drawn to others 
with unique gifts of their own.

262
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,896
It's likely that 
based on his intuition and experience

263
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,359
Hisoka could tell that you both had 
the skill and potential to become Hunters.

264
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,197
So from his perspective,

265
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,783
killing the two of you now 
would have been a waste.

266
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,414
Oh no. Sorry. 
That must sound horrible.

267
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,999
[Gon] 
Mm-mm.

268
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,627
But I've got to say, it was actually 
pretty exciting back there.

269
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,045
[Kurapika] 
Huh?

270
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,090
[Gon] I was so scared that all I wanted 
to do was run away.

271
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,467
But I couldn't.

272
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,386
because I was excited at the same time.

273
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:03,888
Isn't that weird?

274
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,291
[narrator] Gon had experienced mortal fear 
for the first time.

275
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,668
And although the unfamiliar feelings

276
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,671
that accompany that fear 
are quite confusing to him,

277
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:42,301
he cannot help but give in 
to his growing curiosity.

278
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,934
At this stage, 220 candidates 
have withdrawn from the Exam,

279
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,187
and 148 remain.

280
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,323
[Gon] Next time. 
"A x Surprising x Challenge."

281
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,742
[Kurapika] 
It's surprisingly challenging.

282
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,577
Wait. Gon, are you okay?

283
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,579
