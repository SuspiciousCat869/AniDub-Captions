gathered the top leaders

00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:08,109
of the hunter association,
a group known as the zodiacs,

00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,977
for the purpose of electing
the next chairman.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,981
The zodiacs are composed
of 12 hunters

whose abilities
the chairman recognized.

6
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:20,588
He trusted them to lead
the association in emergencies

7
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:25,192
and expected them to spar
with him in his free time.

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,394
Each member
was given a code name,

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,497
and most of the zodiacs,
out of loyalty to the chairman,

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,401
adopted their new name
legally and officially

11
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,403
and altered their appearances
to match the theme,

12
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,005

Pariston: Is that
a problem for you?

61
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,350
Piyon: You show up late,

62
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,385
and then you
start bossing us around?

63
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,288
Cluck: Pariston, leave!
You creep! So annoying!

64
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,790
Pariston: Yeah, I guess
that was a bit forward.

65
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,359
You’ll have to forgive me.

66
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,295
But the fact remains
that I am the vice chairman.

67
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:52,432
Not only do I outrank you,
but i’m an excellent mediator,

68
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,269
and we all want
to wrap this up quickly.

69
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,804
That’s all I was thinking.

70
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,807
Mister botobai is
the most senior,

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,410
and miss cheadle is best
at fostering progress.

72
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,746
Both are better suited
to the task than I am.

73
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,416
You want to lead?
We can switch.

Cheadle: I’ll refrain.

75
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,753

Saiyu: Forget it.
Just start the meeting.

79
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,231
We can all tell
that you want to, you creep.

80
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,732
Pariston: Well, in that case,

81
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,802
how many of you are opposed
to me moderating this meeting?

82
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,604
A show of hands should suffice.

83
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,140
Cluck: I object!
I object! I object!

84
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,442
Pariston:
That’s four objections,

85
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,278
but the majority rules,
so I will continue.

86
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,748
If you’re not satisfied
with my performance,

87
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,216
please let me know.

88
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,219
I’m happy to withdraw
at any time.

89
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,323
Now, then, I do have a proposal.

90
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,693
I nominate myself as chairman.

91
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,128
We’ll skip the election.

92
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:01,802
Ginta: Do you wanna die, brat?
Well, do ya?

93
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,771
Pariston: Hey, calm down.
You guys are scaring me.

94
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,242
Skipping the election would save
a lot of time and money,

95
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,410
and we all know
i’m the right choice.

96
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:15,215
Geru: Not a single one of us
would ever cast a vote for you.

97
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,419
- Pariston: That’s 11 votes.
- ( Geru groans )

98
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:22,623
Pariston: All together,
you only total 11 votes.

99
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,626
Know how many hunters
there are in the association?

100
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,463
The late chairman netero
was far too strong.

101
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,733
That’s why
he couldn’t relate to the weak.

102
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,103
The same can be said
for you guys,

103
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,772
while I, on the other hand,
can empathize.

104
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,175
That’s the kind of chairman
i’ll be!

105
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,445
Piyon: Then explain
why the weaker hunters

106
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,680
are all slaves
to your temp agency.

107
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,549
Exactly how much money
have you made off of them,

108
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,185
o prince of kickbacks?

109
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,420
Pariston: That was
a big misunderstanding.

110
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,323
My account was used,
but it was only held

111
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,125
as a reserve fund
to back the association.

112
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,196
Mizaistom: Pariston,
does the number 18

113
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,799
ring any bells for you?

114
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,603
In the three years since
you became the vice-chairman,

115
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,806
that is the number of hunters
who’ve gone missing.

116
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,644
We’re pros who risk our lives.
We’re obligated to keep track

117
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,213
of our colleagues
out in the field.

118
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,515
A hunter dying is one thing.

119
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,317
A missing hunter
is something else.

120
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,687
Before you became vice-chairman,

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,790
the average
was .6 hunters missing a year.

122
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,059
It’s increased tenfold.

123
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,396
Care to respond?

124
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,400
Pariston: That is unfortunate.

125
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,069
It breaks my heart,

126
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,371
but once I am chairman,

127
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,606
- i’m sure it’ll go down.
- ( Mizaistom grunts )

your son having some trouble?

133
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,566
Ging: Sounds like it.

134

to pay him a visit?

135

Ging: Sure.
I bet he’d love that.

136

Pariston: What? ( Laughs )

137
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,073
That seems unlikely.

138
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,242
I heard he’s still
in critical condition.

139

I guess maybe I shouldn’t go.

140
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,580
He could be dead
by the time I got there, right?

141
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,683
Ging: Nah, go.

142

That kid’s not gonna die.

Pariston: I’d like
to say something.

144
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,094
I feel like we should

145
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,596
probably reconsider
these self-nominations.

146
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,397
- Mizaistom: Hmm?
- Kanzai: But you’re the one

147

who started it, dumb-ass!

What in the hell
is wrong with you, huh?!

149
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,770
Pariston:
I just offered to serve

150
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,673
as a way of saving
valuable time and money.

151
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,274
Since we’re bound by procedure,

152
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,310
we should decide
on the process first.

153
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,112
( Kanzai growls ) Here we go.

154
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,782
Mizaistom: We’ve let him
run things before,

155
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,018
and everything
always gets complicated.

156
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:08,222
Cheadle: In that case,
let’s draw lots.

157

Saiyu: Huh? Hey, screw that!

158

That’s no way to pick a leader.

Cheadle: We’ll each
get a sheet of paper.

161
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,466
Saiyu: Hey, wait!

162
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,769
Cheadle: I want
each of you to write down

163
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,438
what you believe is
the optimal election process,

164
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,640
and I ask that you bear in mind

165
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,343
that our ultimate goal
is a 95% quorum.

166
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,380
Then all we have to do
is let a third party

167
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,081
pick a proposal at random.

168
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,717
Botobai: A third party?

169
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,419
Geru: Beans.
Who else could she mean, right?

170
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,657
Cheadle: Each one
has a 1-in-12 chance.

171
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,592
That way,
there are no hard feelings.

172
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,595
( Kanzai groans ) I guess so.

173
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,096
Saccho: Yeah, good idea.

174
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,698
Pariston: I concur,
since i’ll win anyway.

175
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,435
But I propose
that we write down our names

176
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,304
so that we know
whose idea is chosen.

1 in 12, but that isn’t true.

179
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,547
If all ten of us
write down something

180
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,550
that puts pariston
and ging at a disadvantage,

181
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,085
if that’s even possible,

182
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:15,422
our odds will actually
be five in six. Not bad.

183
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,291
Cheadle: If the voting is
anything less than anonymous,

184
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,295
that will
definitely favor pariston.

What if we make it anonymous

and nominate
multiple candidates?

187

Those indebted to him

188
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,670

It will determine the rules
we will use for the election.

this for, then?

this place will host
a meeting for the zodiacs.

Beans: Uh, but how
do you know that?

Ging: If we all
try to talk it out

271
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:59,073
or decide by a simple vote,
we’re not gonna get anywhere.

272
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,609
After all,
pariston’ll be there.

273
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:04,111
As far as he’s concerned,

274
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,047
1-in-12 odds
are perfectly acceptable.

275
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,150
All he cares about
is having the advantage.

Either way, it’s a win for him.

Beans: Oh.

everyone else will assume

that their odds are five in six,
which guarantees a drawing.

280

they’ll ask me to draw?

286

- Ging: Who else is there?

287
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:38,212
Everyone else in this building
is in pariston’s pocket.

288
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,247
If these rules
look acceptable to you,

289
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,849
fold it three times,
and keep it until the meeting.

290
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,051
Beans: Eh?

291
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,253
Ging: But if they
don’t ask for you

292
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,122
or you see that I folded
my paper differently,

293
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:51,058
i’ll look down at the floor.

294
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,594
If you see me do that, burn it.

295
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,664
Beans: Mister ging,
if you would be willing

296
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:59,066
to consider becoming chairman--

297
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,901
ging: That’s not gonna happen.

298
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,670
No chance. Sorry ’bout that.

299
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:06,674

so I can change the result.

300
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,842

- Ging: All i’m doing

301
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:10,845
is following
the old man’s wishes,

302
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:13,180
and i’m definitely
not looking for any trouble.

303

Beans: If so,
then what of rule five?

304
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:19,420

- Beans: Uh...

305
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,655
Ging: If I leave number five in,

306
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,290
it’ll make people
stop and think,

307
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,426
and if I agree
to concede number five,

308
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,996
they’ll be more willing
to accept the others.

309
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,965
This is how thugs
and frauds con people,

310
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,134
not all that special.

311
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:37,238
I’ll step down
if it passes. Deal?

312
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,241
Beans: Mister ging,
why would you do all of this

313
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,377
if not to change the result?

314
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,846
Ging: That’s
a pretty unusual question.

315
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,216
When I can make my quarry
move how I want,
