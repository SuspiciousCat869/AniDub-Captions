Not surprisingly,
they have less talent.

326
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,788
Morel: Damn it.

327
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,058
i should have just
gone to talk to likke myself.

328
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,527
Knov: Come on now.
Stop being so foolish.

329
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,096
Bear in mind that if we
go over the board’s head,

330
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,697
the chairman is the one

331
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,800
who’s going to get saddled
with all of the blame.

332
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,670
He had to argue with the board
just to get us here.

333
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:46,207
i can’t imagine
it would go well for him.

334
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,977
Morel: Yeah, but they don’t
understand the situation here.

335
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,648
it’s based on donations
and who did what way back when.

336
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,550
knov: Yes,
but that’s no surprise.

337
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,952
the board
has always been inflexible.

338
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:02,556
morel: How the hell
can you be so relaxed, huh?

339
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,492
If we underestimate
the squadron leaders,

340
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,961
we’ll pay dearly for it.

341
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:11,432
fact of the matter
is these things are tough,

342
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:13,500
and they know what they want.

343
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,102
And that’s not all.

344
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,703
They have the talent

345
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:20,007
to quickly master the abilities
they need the most.

346
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,443
it’ll be too late
if we leave it up to the board.

347
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,447
They’re too mindful
of their own interests.

348
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,917
Well, maybe failure is
exactly what they want here.

349
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,920
Knov: Are you referring
to the rumors going around

350
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:35,923
that the vice-chairman’s
faction is bribing the board?

351
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:38,692
and furthermore that
they’re only handing out work

352
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,660
to those hunters
who have agreed to vote for him

353
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:45,132
in the next election,
no matter what? Is that right?

354
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,135
There’s no evidence
of that happening.

355
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,937
Morel: Ha ha! You think they’re
stupid enough to get caught?

356
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:53,474
Look at the facts.

357
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,042
The squadron leaders,

358
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:59,580
every single one of them
they’ve faced has escaped alive.

359
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:03,517
if we don’t succeed,
the chairman will be blamed.

360
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,485
He’ll take the fall
for everything.

361
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,921
The vice-chairman’s supporters

362
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:10,090
will do anything
to guarantee that.

363
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,425
The more victims
the ants claim,

364
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,896
the louder the voices
screaming for his resignation.

365
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,866
Meanwhile, they’re just kicking
back in their office chairs.

366
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,101
Knov: Hmm.

367
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,069
morel:
If we can take out the king,

368
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,606
but five million people
are already dead,

369
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:27,708
then we’ve totally failed!

370
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:30,711
Knov: Yes. We already knew that.

371
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,913
The chairman is prepared.

372
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,781
When he devised this plan,

373
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:37,618
he was fully aware
of the consequences.

374
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:41,522
He knew exactly how much time
assuring victory would take

375
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:43,524
and how many casualties.

376
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:44,825
( Morel groans )

377
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,527
Five million’s on the low end.

378
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,030
That’s still too high.

379
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:54,134
( Cellphone rings )

380
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:56,537
Mr. Marcos?

381
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:58,939
What?

382
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,875
Marcos: The damn phones
have been ringing nonstop.

383
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,878
And that’s not all.

384
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:06,680
Rumors of a coup d’etat
are flying around!

385
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,715
It’s been discovered
that mass murders

386
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,985
are taking place
all over the country.

387
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:13,754
It’s no rumor. I mean,
it’s actually happening.

388
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,489
What is going on here?

389
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,491
Tell me, are you responsible?

390
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,593
Morel: We haven’t done anything.

391
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,996
Did the public find out
about the sorting?

392
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,866
- ( Alarm blaring )
- We’ll talk later on.

393
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,769
now go back
to your office immediately.

394
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:30,103
- Knov: Morel.
- Morel: Huh?

395
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:31,605
Announcer: Good evening.

396
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,040
The dearly beloved leader
of our land, Diego,

397
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,909
has an urgent announcement
to make.

398
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:38,446
to ensure
that our great leader’s message

399
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,647
will be heard clearly
throughout the nation,

400
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:43,517
we request that all
relay speakers in all regions

401
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,919
be turned to maximum volume.

402
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,622
All televisions and radios
should be on

403
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,924
and the volume raised
to its maximum setting.

404
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:55,129
Diego: Good evening,
my beloved citizens.

405
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:57,131
I’m Diego.

406
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:59,466
I have declared east gorteau

407
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,936
is now officially
under martial law.

408
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:05,806
this precaution
is to combat malcontents

409
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,941
that would foment rebellion.

410
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:11,712
i ask you not to leave
your residence for any reason.

411
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,580
Lock your doors.

412
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,950
Anyone outdoors
without permission

413
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:18,686
will be labeled a rebel
and severely punished.

414
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,955
I implore you, turn a deaf ear

415
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:23,157
to the false rumors
being circulated,

416
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,659
and follow my instructions.

417
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,161
the soldiers
of my special forces

418
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:30,564
will soon be visiting
your residences

419
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:33,967
to see if any rebels
are hiding inside.

420
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:37,972
No one else should be allowed
inside of your residences.

421
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:40,508
Knov: That happened too quickly.

422
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,209
Morel: Looks like gon and killua

423
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,544
took matters
into their own hands.

424
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,915
Knov: This must be part
of the chimera ants’ plan.

425
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:50,184
They were so well-prepared,
it makes sense.

426
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:54,555
Their plans took into account
people finding out about it.

427
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,857
it would give them
all the excuse they needed

428
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,526
to use overt military control.

429
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,562
And now east gorteau

430
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,531
has officially been placed
under martial law,

431
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:08,135
completely isolating them
from the rest of the world,

432
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:12,139
cutting them off entirely.
