1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,127
You by yourself?

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,296
That’s pretty impressive.

3
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,591
Where do you want to die?

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,220
I’ll let you decide the location.

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,558
I would prefer somewhere remote, 
so we won’t be a nuisance.

6
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,978
I wouldn’t want your screams 
to bother anyone.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,396
[growls]

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,905
[theme song playing]

00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:45,647
CONDITION x AND x CONDITION

10
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,697
[narrator] Uvogin seeks to unleash 
his rage upon Kurapika.

11
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,658
who seeks his own revenge 
against the Phantom Troupe

12
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,285
for his lost brethren.

13
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,787
Both are eager for the battle

14
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,539
which is about to begin.

15
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,919
[Uvogin] [chuckles] There we go!

16
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,839
Are these all leech eggs?

17
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,174
Ew, gross!

18
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,978
Sorry for the holdup.

19
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,107
[Uvogin gulping, refreshed exhale]

20
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,570
Got a question for you.

21
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,284
Who the hell are you?

22
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,666
You’re not normal.

23
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,087
I feel extraordinary determination 
in your Nen.

24
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,547
[Kurapika] Before I answer your question,

25
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,133
there’s something I need you to tell me.

26
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,139
Do you remember those you’ve killed?

27
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,557
Any of them?

28
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,519
Yeah, some of ‘em.

29
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,523
But mostly just the ones 
who made a lasting impression on me.

30
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,484
This is some kind of vendetta?

31
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,070
Who are you trying to avenge?

32
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,239
The Kurta Clan.

33
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,533
[pensive grunt] I never heard of ‘em.

34
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,327
The Lukso province.

35
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,538
A small clan with scarlet-colored eyes.

36
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,249
And five years ago, you attacked us.

37
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,086
[Uvogin] Scarlet Eyes? 
What's that?

38
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,088
Name of a jewel or somethin’?

39
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,341
Yeah, sorry, that doesn’t ring a bell.

40
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,844
But I was definitely a member 
five years ago;

41
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,011
I know that much.

42
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,975
[Kurapika] When you kill people…

43
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,936
people who have done no wrong in any way…

44
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,813
how do you feel?

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,190
What goes through your mind?

46
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,278
Nothing, really. Not a thing.

47
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,071
[Kurapika] You’re scum.

48
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,700
For your sins...

49
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,495
you’ll pay with your life.

50
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,170
Coming across people like you

51
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,047
is the reason killing never gets old!

52
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,343
You wanna know what gives me 
the most pleasure, though?

53
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,014
When someone like you comes for revenge

54
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,057
and I turn the tables on ‘em!

55
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,206
Those chains are trouble.

56
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,418
I’ve got no idea what kind of trickery 
he used on ‘em

57
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,088
but those things are infused 
with an unreal amount of Nen.

58
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,216
Which means...

59
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,346
That I’ve gotta land the first blow!

60
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,228
That got him.

61
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,862
Whaddya know?

62
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,073
Even after taking that punch,

63
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,158
he’s still had the energy to attack?

64
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,828
Least I busted his left arm.

65
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,459
Huh?

66
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,254
Not a scratch? How?

67
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,298
By how much Nen’s in those chains,

68
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,093
I’d say he’s a Manipulator 
who controls things,

69
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,012
or a Conjurer who can materialize aura.

70
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,599
If I had to guess, 
I’d say it’s the former.

71
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,853
But only an Enhancer 
should be able to block my attack.

72
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,899
What is he?

73
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,902
-[Kurapika] That punch… 
-[Uvogin] Huh?

74
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,613
...was it the best you’ve got?

75
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,657
[ticked-off rasp]

76
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,077
[Uvogin chuckles]

77
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,999
[Uvogin] Was that supposed to be funny?

78
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,377
That was only 20 per cent of my strength.

79
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,213
But don’t worry.

80
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,507
This time I’ll be sure to use half!

81
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,427

Why, you--!

Little punk keeps darting around.

88
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,710
Know what?

89
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,420
Let me guess.

90
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,548
“You’ll regret that you 
didn’t use the chain just now.”

91
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,550
-Right? 
-[Uvogin] Huh?

92
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,345
[Kurapika] Stop making excuses 
and fight me.

93
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,473
You’re wasting my time.

94
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,851
[Uvogin] You want it?

95
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,144
Fine.

96
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,356
[yells] Full throttle!

97
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,319
That’s some intense aura he has.

98
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,202
A smoke screen?

99
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,537
His presence vanished…

100
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,165
He’s using In!

101
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,004
[gasps]

102
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,134
[bones cracking]

103
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,306
I shattered your arm this time.

104
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,810
When I use my Big Bang Impact 
at full power,

105
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,479
no exposed flesh in the world can stop it!

106
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,982
But I’m still impressed.

107
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,943
You were quick to react, 
I’ll give you that.

108
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,947
I’m guessing you noticed 
the slight changes in the smoke and dust.

109
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,033
I am impressed as well.

110
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,786
I didn’t think you knew how to use In.

111
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,001
Striking the ground 
to raise a smoke screen

112
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,170
was intended to conceal 
not only your physical body

113
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,089
but your entire presence.

114
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,257
However...

115
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,802
you’re not the only one who can use In.

116
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,262
Huh?

117
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,973
N-- No way!

118
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,520
[Kurapika] See them?

119
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,982
So, you can use Gyo, too.

120
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,527
As you may have guessed,

121
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,030
these chains have been conjured 
out of Nen.

122
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,408
Meaning I can use In 
to render them invisible.

123
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,412
So that’s why you kept them 
out in the open all the time?

124
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,873
To trick us all into thinking 
they were real?

125
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,666
That’s exactly right.

126
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,629
I pretended I was a Manipulator 
utilizing Nen-controlled chains,

127
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,674
so my enemies would focus 
on what they saw.

128
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,761
And you just proved that it was effective.

129
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,849
You see, while you took your time 
making empty threats,

130
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,019
my chains were already 
wrapped around your body.

131
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,195
Capture phase is complete.

132
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,988
[Uvogin growls]

133
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,283
Dammit. But how?

134
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,328
He has an Enhancer’s defenses,

135
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,998
and the Nen in his conjured chains 
is incredibly strong.

136
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,334
Has he actually maximized

137
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,295
both Enhancement 
and Conjuration abilities?

138
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,506
But that’s impossible!

139
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,132
Isn’t it?

140
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,513
A Nen user is only capable 
of achieving a hundred percent mastery

141
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,224
in the type they were born with! 
That’s how it works!

[Kurapika] Seems you’re 
having trouble understanding.

144
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,437
Huh?

145
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,607
Let me explain it as a parting gift.

146
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,196
Huh?

147
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,202
[Uvogin] Those eyes…

148
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,204
Hey, now I remember!

149
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,916
A bunch of ‘em living out 
in the middle of nowhere.

150
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,544
The boss really liked those eyes.

151
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,548
And they were all pretty strong, too!

152
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,550
You’re a survivor?

I’m fired up now!

How about we see what’s stronger…

156

Filthy bastard…

00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,732
Is that seriously all you can think about?

159
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,944
You will never break these chains!

It’s Only when my eyes turn scarlet.

I use one hundred per cent 
of all types of Nen.

168
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,934
ENHANCER -TRANSMUTER - CONJURER 
EMITTER - MANIPULATOR

169
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,145
And the name of my power is:

170
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,063
Emperor Time!

171
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,567
[helpless rasp]

172
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,114
[Mizuken] Chains?

173
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,075
[Kurapika] Yes. When you said 
I was a Conjurer,

174
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,244
that was the first thing 
that came to mind.

175
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,038
[Mizuken] Interesting.

176
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,539
But why chains?

177
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,668
It’s because there are some people 
at large in the world right now

178
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,254
who need to be chained to hell.

179
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,257
Oh, is that so?

180
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,510
Because I can’t shake 
the nagging suspicion

181
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,013
that you’re the one 
who’ll be chained down.

182
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,224
[Kurapika] What the hell do you know?

183
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,643
Wait a sec! Where are you going?

184
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,436
I’m your teacher! Do as I say!

185
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,356
I’m not done talking to you! 
Hold on, dammit!

186
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,982
Like I told you,

187
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,901
ordinary chains are pointless!

188
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,236
They’re inferior!

189
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,113
Not only that conjuring 
an unbreakable chain...

190
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,615
is impossible!

191
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,035
Really?

192
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,828
Ah, man…

193
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,956
You really are stubborn, aren’t you?

194
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,501
Conjuring unbreakable chains 
is impossible.

195
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,086
That being said,

196
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,255
you can conjure something 
that’s very close.

197
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,131
Is that so?

198
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,593
[Mizuken] Wow… you only hear 
what you want, huh?

199
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,970
[Kurapika] Tell me how!

200
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,014
Make a contract with conditions.

201
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,725
A contract... with conditions?

202
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,144
[Mizuken] Yes. Decide on a condition,

203
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,021
‘a rule, in other words ‘

204
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,023
and swear to abide by it at any cost.

205
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,149
CONDITION 
CONTRACT

206
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,317
A contract.

207
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,860
The stricter the limitation,

208
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,030
the more power your ability 
will be able to gain from it.

209
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,784
Nen is an additive property, 
in most cases.

210
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,203
If Nen adds to your power,

211
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,497
a Nen Contract 
multiplies it exponentially.

212
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,541
(ATTACK + NEN) X CONDITION DIFFICULTY

213
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,752
You’ll need to come up 
with a condition for your chains,

214
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,005
one that you’re prepared to keep.

215
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,591
But it can be dangerous.

216
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,386
This technique can be incredibly volatile.

217
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,847
It’s a double-edged sword.

218
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,016
If you break the condition that you set,

219
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,435
you stand to lose your Nen abilities...

220
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,811
entirely.

221
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,606
My only objective

222
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,359
is to find my brethren’s scarlet eyes

223
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,069
and capture the Spiders.

224
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,948
So, I want chains that they, 
the Phantom Troupe,

225
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,034
will never be able to break.

226
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,745
They will be my only targets.

227
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,373
You’ll use these chains 
solely for that objective?

228
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,083
Seems rather weak to me.

229
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,668
Let me finish.

230
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,130
Using the chains 
exclusively on the Phantom Troupe

231
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,090
is nothing more than a prerequisite.

232
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,717
All right.

233
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,052
Then what is your rule?

234
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,558
I stake my life on it!

235
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,896
Hey… Kurapika…

236
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,983
When your eyes turn scarlet like that, 
it makes your aura look a lot bigger!

237
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,860
Hold on a minute!

238
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,279
Let’s try the Water Divination again!

239
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,742
[Uvogin] A Specialist?

240
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,164
Most people can only use one type of Nen, 
but you use all of them?

241
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,749
[Kurapika] That’s correct.

242
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,510
HOLY CHAIN: 
HEALING THUMB

243
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,351
I can recover 
using enhanced self-healing...

244
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,894
easily.

245
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,856
I completely shattered his left arm

246
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,567
but he healed it instantly!

247
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,906
[Kurapika] There were a number of reasons 
I chose you as my first target.

248
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,244
As you fought the Mafia 
and the Shadow Beasts,

249
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,665
the other Spiders stayed 
completely out of the battle altogether.

250
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,544
That told me 
that you preferred to fight alone.

251
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,256
It also made it clear 
that they trusted your abilities.

252
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,885
I also prefer to fight one-on-one.

253
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,264
That made you the ideal opponent.

254
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,642
You’re an Enhancer

255
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,852
and you’re proud

256
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,896
of your absolute physical attacks 
and defense strength.

257
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,815
In short,

258
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,026
you met every condition 
I required for my first target.

259
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,528
You’re a test.

260
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,947
If my Chain Jail works against you,

261
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,993
then it’s a safe bet that it would work 
against the rest of you Spiders.

262
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,206
The Chain Jail strips captured Spiders 
of their freedom

263
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,459
and, as you may have realized,

264
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,085
enforces Zetsu.

265
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,212
[gasps and grunts]

266
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,673
[Uvogin] I get it…

267
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,301
so that’s why I couldn’t produce any aura!

268
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,011
[straining]

269
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,974
Zetsu, as I’m sure you’re aware by now,

270
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,101
shuts off aura completely.

271
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,021
Meaning that you would need 
to use brute strength alone

272
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,522
to break these chains.

273
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,940
[Uvogin] Dammit!

274
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,444
[Kurapika] If the Troupe member 
with the most physical strength

275
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,820
can’t break them,

276
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,991
it stands to reason the others 
won’t be able to escape them, either.

277
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,495
His enforced Zetsu is bad…

278
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,787
Really bad!

279
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,541
Nen draws its energy from aura…

280
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,418
and if it’s shut off,

281
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,545
you can’t use your power.

282
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,759
A technique for sealing Nen abilities…

283

Well, that’s good to know.

00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,110
It would appear that my enhanced fist,

287
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,697
is slightly stronger 
than your normal flesh.

288
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,075
That’s valuable information.

[derisive snort]

Provided I’ve chained them,

00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,915
I can defeat every Troupe member

I am now going to set a rule.

that you have to answer

00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:52,942
It's me.

332
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,944
[Melody] Kurapika! What’s going on?

333
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,404
Why didn't you call?

334
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,614
-Are you okay? 
-Yeah.

335
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,865
[Melody] Oh, good…

336
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,742
How are things there?

337
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,121
[Melody] The boss is safe. 
She’s asleep in her room.

338
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,373
Unfortunately, due to the weather,

339
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,917
her father won’t be arriving 
until late tonight.

340
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,419
[Kurapika] Understood.

341
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,045
Thanks.

342
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,000
[Chrollo] A chain user...

343
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,253
Probably a Manipulator or a Conjurer.

344
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,423
Uvogin can hold his own in a fight…

345
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:02,219
but one-on-one, he’s most vulnerable 
to those two categories.

346
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,433
It’s not uncommon for a Conjurer 
to enhance the things he creates.

347
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,685
Many do.

348
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,398
And some of those abilities 
could easily render Uvo helpless.

349
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,778
And a Manipulator 
could manipulate Uvo himself.

350
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:22,490
I knew it! I just knew 
I should have gone with him! Damn it!

351
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,368
If he fails to return here by dawn…

352
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,788
then we’ll switch plans.

353
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,043
[narrator] Shalnark senses danger

354
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,545
as Uvogin fails to return.

355
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,382
And their leader, Chrollo 
begins formulating a plan

356
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,551
to terminate the chain user.

357
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,389
[theme song playing]

358
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,416
[Gon] Coming up:

359
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,834
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

360
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,294
[both] Hunterpedia!

361
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,087
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

362
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,630
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

363
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,090
Today, we're introducing Uvogin!

364
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,051
He’s really big and a member 
of the Phantom Troupe!

365
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,305
His ultimate attack 
is a Nen-infused straight right punch.

366
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,432
[both] So watch out 
for the Big Bang Impact!

367
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,815
[Gon] Next time: “Very x Sharp x Eye”.

368
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,693
It’s so sharp, 
it’s like a razor blade or something!

369
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,987
[Killua] Whoa! That sounds awesome!
