Evil haunts.

Uncharted frontiers.

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,980
The mysterious unknown.

9
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:26,193
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words…

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,445
are called…

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,825
Hunters.

LAST TEST X OF X RESOLVE

18
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,306
[narrator] 
The Exam’s Third Phase required applicants

19
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,976
to reach Trick Tower’s base 
within 72 hours.

20
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,729
But Gon and his friends incurred a penalty

21
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,940
and were forced to wait for 50 hours.

22
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,736
Meanwhile...

00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,702
[rumble]

24
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,418
[announcer] Geretta, applicant 384, 
is the fourth to pass.

25
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,963
Time elapsed, 12 hours and 27 minutes.

26
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,758
Well not bad, I guess.

[board click-clacks]

28
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,640
Be careful not to hesitate 
on the first step

29
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,016
or you’re gonna hurt yourself.

30

-Here. 
-I gotcha.

31
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,894
Hey, Kurapika.

32
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,814
Once we’ve finished 
spending our 50 hours here,

33
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,400
we’ll have 
less than ten hours left, right?

34
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,360
Yes. That’s correct.

35
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:17,072
Great! [laughs] That’s way more time 
than we’ll need, so no harm done!

36
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,032
-You’re a fool. 
-What’s that?

37
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,245
The Third Phase of the Hunter Exam 
is supposed to take 72 hours.

38
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,540
And each new phase weeds out 
more of the applicants

39
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,042
cutting the field roughly in half 
every time.

40
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,796
In other words, it’s meant 
to take 72 hours on average.

41
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,425
The fact you didn’t know that is proof 
that you’re an idiot.

42
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,634
[annoyed grumble]

43
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,471
Then, our chances 
of reaching the finish within ten hours

44
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,557
will depend on the remaining trials.

45
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,226
Yeah. I guess you’ve got a point.

46
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,520
Hm. It’s too bad you’re so unlucky

47
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,690
you can’t even win a game 
of rock paper scissors when it counts.

48
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,816
What’d you say?!

49
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,945
You deliberately lost a bet just 
so you could cop a feel.

50
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,906
Then you picked a game 
you didn’t stand a chance of winning.

51
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,366
Hey, shut up!

52
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,411
You surrendered 
before your fight even got started!

53
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,082
[Tonpa] I... give up!

54
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,544
Sure, I threw in the towel. 
I can admit that.

55
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,672
But, I only wasted a couple of seconds.

56
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,049
-[Leorio grumbles] 
-[Tonpa] You didn’t just lose.

57
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,595
You squandered 50 hours 
we could really use right now.

58
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,556
The least you could do 
is take responsibility.

59
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,726
And besides,

60
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,729
who ever heard of a Hunter 
who sucked at gambling?

61
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,897
Shut up!

62
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,191
You don’t even want to become a Hunter!

63
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,277
The only reason you’re here 
is to ruin our chances!

64
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,820
[chuckles]

65
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,448
And now you’ll have that guilt 
eating away at you

66
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,617
for the rest of this Phase.

Oops! Sorry.

for skateboarding, so knock it off!

00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,251
Not really.

76
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,754
Thing is, I can stay awake 
two or three days at a time.

77
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,882
[Kurapika] Ten hours down, huh?

78
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,802
[Killua] 
With no windows, it’s hard to tell, but…

79
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,679
it’s probably morning.

80
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,305
[Kurapika] Most likely.

81
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,310

-You bastard!

92

You’d better not just be pretending 
to be asleep.

93
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,148
Damn it! Well, I guess I’m awake now.

94
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,651
[grunts] And we’ve still got 40 more hours 
left to go.

[tapping]

97
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,341
[Killua] Hm. I thought fishing 
was just putting some bait on a hook

98
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,842
and throwing it in the water.

99
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,678
Uh-huh. 
But you’ve also gotta think like a fish.

100
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,472
And that’s supposed to work?

101
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,473
Yup!

102
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,726
How would a fish feel if it saw bait 
dangling in front of it?

103
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,936
Gimme!

104
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:23,902
Huh?

105
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,195
Oh, wow!

106
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,030
Let me give it a try!

[concentrating exhale]

108
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,661
So, like this?

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,996
[laughs] You missed.

110
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,748
Yeah, but watch this!

Hey! What the hell 
do you think you’re doing?!

113
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:42,963
Stop!

00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,965
-Right on target! 
-Nice!

Wait! You’re gonna tear my pants!

-Ya see? I landed a big one. 
-Yep.

117
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,100
Do I look like a fish to you?! 
Come on! Grow up!

118
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,185
Well, you don’t have to get so mad.

119
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,187
It‘s not like I’m gonna grill you 
and eat you.

120
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,314
Just leave me the hell alone!

121

[Tonpa] Oh, nothing.

You’re up to something again, aren’t you?

I don’t know what you mean.

00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,959
All I want

is to spend the rest of our time here 
in peace and quiet.

You liar.

[chatters quietly]

00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,876
[announcer] Sommy, applicant number 118 
is the thirteenth to pass.

-[chatters quietly] 
-Time elapsed 61 hours and 54 minutes.

170
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,759
We’ve still got ten hours left?

171
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,011
Man, I really should’ve taken more time.

172
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,142
[straining]

173
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,894
Okay!

174
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,437
I’m ready to go!

175
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,774
[Kurapika] One more minute…

176
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:14,692
[Leorio sighs]

177
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,403
This one minute’s taking forever, huh?

178
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,323
[buzzer goes off]

179
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,120
Wait for us, Gon!

180
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,205

[panting]

184
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,358
Thirty minutes of running 
and right we’re back where we started.

185
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,611
Didn’t I tell you 
we should’ve taken the stairs down?

186
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,613
[yells] This is the route 
we all agreed upon,

187
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,198
so why don’t you shut the hell up?!

[Killua] Man, I’m all covered in dust.

193
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,217
Damn. Only an hour left.

194
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,553
If we don’t hurry, we’ll never make it.

DOOR, O - OPEN, X - CLOSE

196
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,599
[Leorio] We’re supposed to vote 
on whether to open the door?

197
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,478
We need to move on, 
so the choice is pretty clear.

[grumbles]

200
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,152
I’ve had enough of your crap!

201
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,988
What are you talking about? 
I pressed ‘O’, too!

202
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,364
Don't lie to me!

203
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,617
Sabotaging our chances 
is your freakin’ specialty!

204
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,162
-Sorry, Leorio. 
-Huh?

205
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,539
I accidentally pressed the wrong button.

206
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,707
What?

207
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,542
[sighs]

208
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,253
-Fine, I see how it is. 
-[Tonpa] Hold on.

209
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,421
Hm?

210
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,090
I think you owe me an apology.

211
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,718
You think I’m just gonna let that slide?

212
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,180
Maybe if you weren’t 
always doing shady stuff,

213
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,265
this kinda thing wouldn’t happen.

214
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,601
I don’t owe you a thing.

215
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,686
Almost sounds like you’re trying to say

216
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,064
I’m the one to blame 
for everything that’s gone wrong.

217
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,482
What’s that?

218
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,609
Don’t tell me. Have you already forgotten

219
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,487
who it was who cost us those 50 hours?

220
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,573
If memory serves, 
I’m pretty sure that honor goes to you.

221
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,741
[Leorio grumbles]

222
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,702
-Leorio, calm down. 
-[Leorio] Shut up, Kurapika!

223
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,416
C’mon, guys! Knock it off!

224
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,461
I’m the one who pressed the wrong button, 
so it’s my fault!

225
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,630
This is stupid.

226
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,507
I’m going on ahead.

227
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,425
Killua, don’t go!

228
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,346
Hey, Gon! We must be getting real close 
to the end!

229
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,098
Whoa! Really?

230
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,104
[Killua] Let’s see.

231
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,440
“This will be the last decision 
made by majority rule.

232
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,109
Are you ready?

233
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,985
Choose ‘O’ or ‘X’.”

234
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,112
And that’s it.

235
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,531
[Leorio] Am I ready?

236
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,074
Of course, I am! Let’s do this!

237
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,494
-Bastard! 
-Let it go!

238
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,162
We don’t have time to argue.

239
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,539
[signal beeping]

240
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,332
[announcer] Please select a path.

241
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,377
There are two available options 
to choose from.

242
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,964
The long and difficult path 
which the entire group can take,

243
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,632
or the short and easy path

244
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,260
which will be limited 
to only three of you.

245
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,350
Incidentally, if you choose 
the long and difficult path,

246
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,603
it will require a minimum 
of 45 hours to complete.

247
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,189
while the short and easy path

248
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,609
will lead you directly to the goal 
in approximately three minutes.

249
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,488
Press ‘O’ to select 
the long and difficult path,

250
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,533
or press ‘X’ 
to choose the short and easy path.

251
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,077
If ‘X’ is selected

252
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,747
two applicants from your group 
must be chained to the wall with handcuffs

253
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,374
before the door will open.

254
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:03,129
Those applicants will be unable to move 
until the time limit has expired.

255
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,634
[Killua] 
The Examiners thought of everything.

256
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,511
Look around.

257
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,055
Every weapon I’ve ever heard of 
is down here.

258
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,766
So, two out of five, huh?

259
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,437
Then they must expect us to fight 
to decide which three pass.

260
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,063
[Leorio] All right.

261
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,940
I want to make this clear.

262
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,568
I’m pressing the ‘X’ button.

263
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,778
But I’m not staying behind.

264
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,281
I’m one of the three that’s moving on

265
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,074
and I’ll do whatever it takes.

266
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,036
[Tonpa] You’re one to talk.

267
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:39,457
We coulda taken the long path 
if you hadn’t wasted 50 hours.

268
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:43,169
Why don’t you do the right thing 
and make up for it by staying behind?

269
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,837
What’s that?!

270
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,839
I’m sure we all agree.

271
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,300
What about it, guys? Did I lie?

272
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,968
[Gon] Hold on a second!

273
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,471
I’m going to press ‘O’.

274
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,558
It’s just we all made it this far 
by working together.

275
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,851
We should finish together.

276
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,603
Gon…

277
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,688
[Gon] It’s a big risk. I know that.

278
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,565
But still, we’ve got to try!

279
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,569
Oh, come on! 
It’s not a question of being a risk.

280
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,321
We’ve got less than an hour.

281
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,739
[exhales defiantly]

282
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,034
Gon. There’s only one way to pass.

283
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,994
I mean, it’s obvious.

284
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,040
Well, there you have it, kid.

285
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,585
So, now we have to pick 
which three advance.

286
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,671
If it was up to me,

287
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,881
you and I are two of ‘em, Gon.

288
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,219
[smirks]

289
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,555
Well, I’ve made it this far.

290
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,474
No way I’m stopping now.

291
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,560
Whoever makes the first move wins.

292
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,232
Is this really what it’s come to?

293
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,317
We have to fight amongst ourselves?

294
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,070
[Tonpa yelling]

295
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,614
That was a cheap shot!

296
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,535
In a fight, there’s no such thing 
as a cheap shot!

297
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,829
[Leorio screaming]

298
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,498
Bastard!

299
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,584
Stop it! Both of you!

300
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,044
Yeah! Come on! Let’s all do this together!

301
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:11,549
We don’t have to start fighting 
until we choose ‘O’ or ‘X’, you idiot!

302
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,343
It’s too late for that!

303
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,598
Then I guess 
I’ll just have to choose for you!

304
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,142
Well, two can play at that game!

305
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,812
Looks like fighting is our only option.

306
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,066
[Kurapika] What do we do?

307
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,575
[announcer] Three minutes remain.

308
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,996
It’s finally over, huh?

309
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,540
Yeah. Feels like it took forever.

310
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,000
Huh?

311
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,379
[tired panting]

it.

[Imori] He's dead.

317
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,519
[Umori] Damn, what a moron.

318
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,813
It's better to survive 
and try again next year

00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,774
than to pass and die tryin’.

[announcer] One minute remains.

00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,028
That’s it, then.

322
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,739
Looks like it’s just the 19 of us 
that are already here.

[announcer] Kurapika, number 404, 
is the twentieth to pass.

327
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,974
Killua, number 99, 
is the twenty-first to pass.

328
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:48,145
Gon, number 405, 
is the twenty-second to pass.

329
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,608
Time elapsed 71 hours and 59 minutes.

330
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,403
Boy, my butt hurts!

331
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:59,532
I certainly wasn’t expecting 
the short and easy path to be a slide.

332
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,326
[Hisoka] Three of them, eh?

333
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,121
[announcer] Thirty seconds remain.

334
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,832
Even with that big slide, 
that was really close!

335
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,126
My hands are covered in blisters.

336
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,419
[Leorio] Same here.

337
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,586
[grunting]

338
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,132
[announcer] Leorio, number 403, 
is the twenty-third to pass.

339
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,886
Tonpa, number 16, 
is the twenty-fourth to pass.

340
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,223
Time elapsed 71 hours and 59 minutes.

341
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,935
[Leorio] My hands are wrecked

342
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,813
but all five of us 
cleared the tower together, didn’t we?

343
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,023
And it’s all thanks to Gon!

344
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,492
[grunting]

345
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,879
[Kurapika] 
We entered the long and difficult path,

346
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,589
broke down the wall

347
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,759
and from there, 
we snuck into the short and easy one.

348
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,260
I can’t believe it.

349
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,429
You came up with that plan on the spot!

350
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,015
I figured we could use those weapons

351
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,558
to break through the walls.

352
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,853
But it did take 
almost all the time we had left.

353
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,566
[Kurapika] Even under pressure, 
you were able to calmly assess our options

354
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,610
and think of a way to get around them.

355
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:21,071
And that is what makes you so special.

356
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,199
[buzzer rings]

357
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,786
[announcer] The Third Phase 
of the Hunter Exam is over!

358
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,205
Twenty-five applicants have passed,

359
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,998
including one deceased.

360
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,088
[narrator] 
Although they had their differences,

361
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,092
Gon found a way to bring them all together 
and complete the trial as a team.

362
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,180
But today’s friend may be tomorrow’s foe.

363
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,059
What Gon doesn’t know is that before long,

364
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:54,563
they will be forced to face each other 
in savage individual battles.

365
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,570
[theme song playing]

366
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,781
[Gon] Next time: "Letter x From x Gon!"

367
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,533
[Mito] Always gone!

368
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,868
[Gon] Who, me?
