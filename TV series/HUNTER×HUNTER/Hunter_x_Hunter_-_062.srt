Number two, book.

160
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,292
This copy is real,

161
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,762
and this one’s
a copy kortopi made.

162
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,063
Gain.

163
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,468
Kortopi’s didn’t transform.

164
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,436
I believe that might indicate

165
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,973
that the game’s program
didn’t recognize kortopi’s card.

166
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,542
And three, shizuku’s vacuum

167
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,844
seems to function normally
in this world,

168
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,880
but it won’t work on any items

169
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,782
that have special abilities
of any kind.

170
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,251
I think that’s because
the game was programmed

171
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,821
to prevent nen abilities from
being used to collect cards.

172
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,822
Kortopi: I see.

173
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:42,989
Shizuku: So?

174
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,425
Shalnark: However,
these three points

175
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,328
indicate
yet another possibility...

176
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,799
This game isn’t taking place
in a virtual world,

177
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,401
it’s based
somewhere in the real world.

178
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,002
Shizuku: But what do you mean?

179
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,305
Shalnark: You see,
if any of the players

180
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,307
were to actually enter
"greed island,"

181
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,109
then their souls would
fully detach from their bodies

182
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,213
and enter the console,
leaving their bodies behind.

183
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:10,016
Sending them in physically
wouldn’t be necessary.

184
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,819
And while separating body
and soul might be possible,

185
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,254
it would take a lot more

186
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,124
than standing in front
of a console and using hatsu.

187
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,493
It would make a lot more sense
if the players

188
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,295
were actually teleported
somewhere else entirely.

189
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,532
Therefore the software
operating the console

190
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,902
has nothing to do
with playing the game.

191
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,904
Its job is to teleport players

192
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,206
who trigger it with hatsu
to this island.

193
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,608
Shizuku: That stands to reason,

194
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,144
but I don’t think
I get what it means.

195
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,880
Shalnark: The big reward
for clearing the game,

196
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,148
you remember it?

197
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,550
Shizuku: Let’s see. What was it?

198
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:47,888
Kortopi: Of all the cards you’ve
found for your specified slots,

199
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,289
you can choose three

200
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:52,359
and take them all back
to the real world with you.

201
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,860
Shalnark: That’s right,

202
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,029
and that means
that every one of these items

203
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,232
are available to be used
outside of the island.

204
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,268
If this game does indeed
take place in the real world,

205
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,171
then it should be possible
to remove all of the treasure

206
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,339
without actually
having to clear the game.

207
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,574
Kortopi: Understood.

208
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,943
Shalnark: Book.

209
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,379
So, at the moment,

210
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,981
we only know a little bit
about a few select items.

211
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,985
It would be most beneficial
to learn about all the cards.

212
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:23,390
To start, we need the spell card
called eye of god.

213
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:27,394
And then we just need
to find phinks and feitan.

214
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:34,001
( Phinks scoffs )
Another cheap map, huh?

215
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,404
Feitan: Still, he was carrying
a lot of spell cards.

216
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,040
Phinks: Well,
wanna split up for now?

217
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,209
Let’s meet back in masadora
in a week.

218
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,979
We’ll see which one of us
can kill more players,

219
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,381
make it a race.

220
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:50,484
Feitan: Okay, but be sure
to take their cards first.

221

we should do about her?

00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,272
Killua: Just ignore her.

224
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:15,242
We’ll have a chance to ditch her
once the bandits show up.

It starts with a mild fever,

but then it gets
progressively worse and worse

until the afflicted
finally dies. ( Coughs )

do is use medicine

them the right amount of money,
