Hisoka: Wait. Am I wrong?

164
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:35,182
earlier, when you said
that "both" were going to die,

165
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:39,420
you didn’t mean killua and gon,
but killua and yourself.

166
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,022
Illumi: Yes. You are correct.

167
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,424
Hisoka: Hmm.

168
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,659
I’ll admit I have my issues,

169
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,028
but you are the worst.
Do you know that?

170
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:51,599
Illumi: The point being,
if things go horribly wrong,

171
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:55,235
it won’t just be
gon, killua, and me.

172
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:58,438
Every member of the zoldyck clan
will die.

173
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,475
i suspect
the casualties of this wish

174
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,745
will be
in the tens of thousands.

175
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,646
You’ll probably die, too.

176
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,450
that was why
I looked at you funny before.

177
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:15,589
( Hisoka groans )

178
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,458
This is not good.

179
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,436
Alluka: Big brother, die now!

180
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,010
Killua: Yeah. All right.

181
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,045
Alluka: Bang!

182
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,448
Illumi: I will speak to killua

183
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:44,651
and ask him to follow
the protocol for his wish.

184
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,654
I want you there with me,
but stay hidden.

185
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:51,158
Killua may refuse,
or he may agree.

186
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,760
But, either way,

187
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:56,263
if you get the sense
that he’s lying,

188
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,634
I want you to kill alluka.

189
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,705
Think of alluka
as an ordinary child,

190
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,240
one with no fighting ability.

191
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,577
( Alluka laughing )

192
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:15,249
Illumi: Truth is, we have
no idea where he came from.

193
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,692
Beans: There were 68 absentees.

194
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:28,295
The turnout was 89.7%

195
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:32,700
pariston: Now, that is an odd
turn of events, very odd indeed.

196
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,736
There were 33 absentees
in the second vote,

197
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,071
and now it’s 68.

198
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,407
The abstentions are increasing.

199
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,043
They couldn’t cast
invalid votes,

200
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,312
so they chose
not to show up at all?

201
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,182
I think the reason is clear.
They would rather

202
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,751
put their licenses on the line
than participate.

203
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,320
Kanzai: What’s going on here?!

204
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:55,823
why the hell
would anyone go that far?

205
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,692
pariston: I guess
this means we can confiscate

206
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,362
the violators’s licenses.
is that correct?

207
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:05,198
beans: Yes. We’ve
no other choice, i’m afraid.

208
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:11,571
Here, miss cluck,
the list of absentees.

209
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,574
Please send a letter
to each of them.

210
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,244
tell them to bring
their licenses to headquarters,

211
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:19,647
also that we will expect them

212
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:23,584
to explain the reasons
that led to their absences.

213
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,386
Pariston: Mm,
not sure about that.

214
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,589
Do you really think all that
will truly be enough?

215
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,424
Losing their licenses

216
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:34,362
will make the violators
exempt from the rules,

217
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,597
and that means
they’d no longer need to fear

218
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,099
the penalty
for not voting, would they?

219
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,468
kanzai:
Hey, taking their licenses away

220
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,303
was your idea, damn it!

221
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,538
Pariston: Correct.

222
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:48,109
but we all voted
on the proposal. Remember?

223
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:51,612
You were all against
revoking a hunter’s status,

224
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,514
even for just
the shortest amount of time.

225
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,317
If I had known you simply
wanted to meet quorum,

226
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,286
then I would have
pushed for that,

227
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,055
quite strongly, I assure you.

228
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:04,224
Cheadle: He’s hard to deal with,
because he readily accepts

229
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,760
suggestions that are
detrimental to him.

230
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,462
He’ll even propose ideas

231
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,032
that put him
at a severe disadvantage.

232
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,237
It’s almost like he enjoys
having obstacles to overcome.

233
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:23,143
He’s a lot like chairman netero
in that way,

234
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,012
and I hate it.

235
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,315
Pariston: I have a proposal.

236
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:32,286
I say the 12 zodiacs
should give a speech,

237
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,721
one that all of the hunters
get to witness.

238
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:38,525
We must impress upon them
the importance of this election

239
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,729
for the association,
for humanity, for the world!

240
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:46,333
We’d have a hard time conveying
that over the Internet,

241
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,369
so we must look them
in the eyes,

242
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,803
speak to their souls,

243
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,506
and let each one of them
hear our voices,

244
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:55,342
and all for the sake of netero!

245
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,411
Cheadle: Now this?

246
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,245
I hate you, pariston.

247
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,714
I hate you to death.

248
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,087
Alluka: Okay, big brother!

249
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,656
You can wake up now.

250
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,363
( Sighs )

251
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,199
Killua: Boo!

252
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,201
( Alluka laughs )

253
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,604
You are so good at doing that.

254
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,672
( Killua thinking )
Alluka’s power has rules

255
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,774
that the rest of the family
doesn’t know about.

256
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,610
( Music plays only )

257
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,380
Alluka: Big brother,
let’s play word games.

258
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,215
Killua: Sure. Good idea.

259
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,351
Alluka: How about...

260
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,685
Hmm.

261
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,388
Last "a" in alluka!

262
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:42,756
( Killua thinking )
The real alluka...

263
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,392
Is the one who calls me
"big brother."

264
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,028
The one who calls me "killua"

265
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:51,031
is the other one. That’s nanika.

266
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,234
( Wind blowing )

267
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,342
Alluka: Big brother,
give me a hug!

268
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,113
Killua: Sure.

269
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:10,084
( Alluka sighs )

270
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,085
( Giggling )

271
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,401
Mrs. Zoldyck: Sweet killua,

272
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,603
he’s being such
a good big brother.

273
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:34,074
Milluki: That’s three demands
cleared by my count.

274
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,410
Getting that PC was easy.

275
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,178
- ( Nen whooshing )
- ( Gasps )

276
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,685
( Gasps ) I’m s-sorry, papa!

277
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,587
I won’t do it again!

278
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,091
Silva: That means
alluka is ready.

279
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,626
Is that right?

280
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:57,231
Milluki: Uh-huh. All killua
needs to do now is make a wish.

281
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,467
silva: Milluki,
verify the rules once again.

282
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:01,969
Milluki: Yeah. Okay.

283
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,971
There are just five rules
that i’m aware of.

284
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,574
Number one, after a person

285
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:11,278
fails to meet alluka’s demands
and dies, alluka "resets,"

286
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:15,115
and the demand difficulty
reverts to the lowest level.

287
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,986
That’s the best time
to make a wish.

288
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:22,756
Number two, while alluka
is making demands of someone,

289
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:25,526
he won’t make demands
of someone else.

290
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,129
That’s the reason
why I used to have him

291
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,265
make a demand of a Butler,

292
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,267
then take him back
to you and mama afterwards.

293
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:38,405
Killua probably
did the same thing.

294
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:43,577
That’s why alluka never demanded
anything of you or mama.

295
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,548
Three, if the person

296
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,016
happens to die
during the demand process,

297
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,419
then the demands
will be deemed a failure,

298
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,622
and at least
one more person will die.

299
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,092
That was confirmed
by my experiment.

300
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,962
Four, alluka can
not make any demands

301
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,365
of anyone whose names
he doesn’t know.

302
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,100
And finally, number five,

303
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,071
the same person can’t make
a wish twice in a row.

304
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,073
That’s it.

305
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,209
I’m not hiding
anything from you.

306
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,044
I swear on the deal we made.

307
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,045
Silva: Hmm.

308
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,290
Why hasn’t killua
made his wish yet?

309
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,726
Milluki: Eh? I don’t know.

310
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:35,296
he’s probably
thinking something stupid.

311
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:38,131
if killua were
to make a wish right now,

312
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,067
he wouldn’t personally
pay the price,

313
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,701
but somebody else
certainly would.

314
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,771
Silva: That’s ridiculous.

315
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,274
can’t he worry
about all of that later,

316
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,710
after he finishes
saving his friend?

317
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,144
Milluki: Papa...

318
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,512
Silva: Hmm?

319
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,749
Milluki: "Will my friend
ever be happy if he knows

320
