The people who are captivated

00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,237
are called...

12

Hunters.

[theme song playing]

Take this to heart.

15
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,451
First,

16
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,453
a genuine Phantom Troupe tattoo

17
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,205
has the member's number inscribed 
on the spider's back.

18
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:03,957
Second,

19
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,877
they don't bother tallying 
the people they've killed

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,837
because it's irrelevant to them.

21
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,048
And third,

22
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,384
don't ever mention the Phantom Troupe 
to me again.

23
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,638
If you do...

24
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,224
I will kill you with my bare hands.

TRICK x TO x THE TRICK

[narrator] Leorio, has volunteered 
for the fourth round.

If he wins, 
the group's victory is assured.

28
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,951
But will he be able to do it?

29
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,873
Hm.

30
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,089
Okay, it's time to end this.

31
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,133
Drag him off and send in 
your next contender.

[Leroute giggles]

That's not possible.

Wait, what?

35
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,977
I said, I'm afraid we can't move him.

36
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,063
His match isn't over yet.

37
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,358
I don't get it, 
how is the match not over?

38
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,443
What are you talking about?

39
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,285
He's still alive, 
just unconscious.

40
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,834
Oh, don't you remember? 
This was a fight to the death.

41
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,504
One of them had to either die 
or admit defeat.

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,257
He's still alive

43
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,592
and he hasn't surrendered.

44
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,761

[huffs] 
Talk about splitting hairs.

46
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,393
Maybe, but you've gotta admit 
she's right.

47
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,478
-I'm with Killua. 
-[Leorio grumbles]

48

That's how it is?

49
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,690
All right, Kurapika!

50
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,526
Get over there and put that loser 
out of his misery.

51
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,653
I refuse.

52
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,155
[Leorio] What... huh?

53
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,198
[yelling] 
What do you mean, refuse?

54
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,618
The fight was already over.

55
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,165
It was clear to me 
that by the time I punched him,

56
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,792
he had already lost the will to fight.

57
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,840
I will not continue fighting a loser.

58
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,427
[yelling] Seriously? 
What are we supposed to do?

59
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,263
'Cause those guys are claiming 
the match hasn't even ended yet.

60
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,433
-I will leave that to him 
-[Leorio] Huh?

61
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,353
He can decide his own fate 
just as soon as he revives.

62
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,439
Come on!

63
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,816
We don't have that much time 
and it's running out fast.

64
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,235
We can't afford to just sit around here 
and wait.

65
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,404
My mind's made up, Leorio.

66
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,906
Oh, give me a break.

67
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,533
Hey, I can kill him

68
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,951
if you don't want to.

69
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,286
Killua?

70
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,997
Never killed anyone before, have you?

71
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,709
Are you scared?

72
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,214
Whether or not murder is frightening 
has never entered my mind.

73
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,801
Regardless, this is a one-on-one battle.

74
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,552
You can't interfere.

75
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,805
Fine, I won't argue.

76
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,558
Except, if you were a team-player

77
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,519
you wouldn't be acting so selfish.

78
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,938
Hey! You said something useful 
for once.

79
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,272
Do that more often!

80
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,983
Don't you know you're screwing up 
our chances?

81
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,028
That's true, 
but it doesn't change my position.

82
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,989
You stubborn little idiot. 
[grumbles]

83
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,243
[yelling] All right, 
time for majority rule.

84
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,495
Press O to kill the bastard

85
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,747
or X to let him live.

86

-[Leorio] Ready, and...

[watch beeps]

88
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,506
[screaming] Why in the hell 
isn't it working?

89
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,801
I bet it's because we're the ones 
asking the question.

90
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,135
[Leorio] 
Huh?

91
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,265
It looks like the timers only work 
for questions the Examiners ask.

92
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,851
I should have known. 
In that case...

93
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,312
Okay! We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

94
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,148
Raise your hand 
if you think we should finish him!

95
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,733
Me!

96
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,279
Hm. Oh!

97
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,200
Whose side are you on?

98
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,370
A minute ago you were trying to get him 
to do it, just like I was.

99
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,998
We're in this together. 
Where's your team spirit?

100
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,501
I just don't see the point. 
Not like he's going to change his mind.

101
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,504
Hey Gon, why don't you think 
we should kill the guy?

102
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,631
I'm with Kurapika on this one.

103
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,593
He was just about to surrender 
when he knocked him out.

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,305
We should wait for him to wake up.

105
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,474
But there's no telling 
how long that'll take.

106
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,935
I ought to just do it.

107
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,688
It's better if you don't force the issue.

108
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,816
You can't expect everybody 
to share the same opinion.

109
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,402
Yeah, well nobody asked for yours, okay?

110
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,862
[Tonpa] Hey, come on.

111
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,615
If you wanted to put it to a vote, 
you kind of did.

112
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:47,866
[Leorio] Huh?

113
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,912
Fine! If you want to wait, then wait. 
Just see if I care.

114
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,330
Leorio, wait.

115
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,918
[Leorio, seething] 
What is wrong with these people?

116
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,920
[Gon] He's sulking.

117
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,672
None of this matters 
if we get stuck here.

118
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,633
Am I the only one who gets it?

119
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,469
Let's just leave him alone.

120
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,472
[Tonpa] Fools.

121
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,307
He's totally falling for it.

122
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,184
The trap of majority rule.

123
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,270
When five people 
who barely know each other,

124
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,022
trying to decide on something,

125
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,901
you'd think voting would be the easiest 
and most efficient way to do it.

126
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,113
People tend to think that voting 
empowers the individual.

127
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:31,826
But the truth is, it can just as easily 
turn the majority against the minority.

128
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,788
When someone keeps finding himself 
in the minority,

129
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,415
his opinion is always rejected.

130
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,962
His anger, alienation, and frustration 
make him resent antagonize the group.

131
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,757
Eventually, it tears the team apart.

132
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,928
After all, it's everyone for himself 
in the Hunter Exam.

133
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,847
The feeling you get when 
you're forced to follow a path

134
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,350
that other people set 
can be a real pain.

135
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,353
It's annoying and makes you feel foolish.

136
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:02,315
But now he's all caught up in 
the whole majority rule scenario,

137
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,152
and he's starting to use it 
even when he doesn't have to.

138
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,656
And then, he made the mistake of 
discussing the options

139
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,324
before he called for the vote.

140
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,702
He even asked for a show of hands.

141
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,079
Majority rule in its worst form.

142
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,791
When people are just pressing buttons 
on their timers

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,418
they've got anonymity.

144
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,211
But when you raise your hand,

145
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,714
everybody knows exactly 
what side you're on

146
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,590
and who's straying from the crowd.

147
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,845
And if you're in the minority, 
there's no chance for a rebuttal.

148
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,848
When someone's opinions 
are constantly rejected,

149
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,142
they feel like 
their voice isn't being heard,

150
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,893
and the group breaks down.

151
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,856
And in our case it means 
all five of us will fail the Exam.

152
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,152
It's just a matter of time. 
[laughs]

153
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,908
[Sedokan] The atmosphere on the other side 
is pretty grim.

154
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,037
[Leroute chuckles]

155
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,105
I've been waiting for you.

156
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,275
Hisoka.

157
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,905
I'm not an Examiner this year. 
I'm here for revenge.

158
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,117
Ever since the last Exam, 
all I've thought about is killing you.

159
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,997
And today I get payback.

160
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,458
[yelling] 
For all the scars you gave me.

161
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,585
[laughs]

162
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,756
Those scars are but a symbol of 
your incompetence as an Examiner.

163
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,550
Don't blame me for your inadequacies.

164
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,386
Shut up. 
[chuckles]

165
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,388
Now prepare to die.

166
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,016
Two-blade style, huh?

167
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,439
All-direction four blade style!

168
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,858
[yelling] 
Take this!

169
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,781
[Togari cries out]

170
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,795
I'm not done! 
[huffs]

171
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,885
[Togari laughs] 
Up, down, left, right,

172
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,804
you've got nowhere to run.

173
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,808
You're going to be cut up from every angle 
by my endless barrage of blades.

174
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,102
You can't dodge my attacks forever.

175
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,939
I’m going to have you writhing in pain 
and I'll savor every second.

176
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,440
[Hisoka] Hm.

177
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,570
And then you'll die, Hisoka!

178
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,656
[yells]

179
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,164
Dodging your attacks 
would have been difficult, you're right.

180
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,751
Stopping your blades, however...

181
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,628
[Togari] Impossible!

182
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,672
It took me more than six months 
of training

183
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,507
to master catching those blades.

184
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,305
My, my.

185
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,975
That was easier than expected.

186
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,229
Nice try but... it wasn't good enough.

187
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,815
[Togari breathes uneasily]

188
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,276
[screaming] 
Damn it!

189
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:43,411
HUNTER GLOSSARY

190
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:47,832
HISOKA

191
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,431
[voice over PA] 
First to pass the Third Phase

192
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,308
Hisoka, number 44.

193
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,603
Time elapsed, six hours, 17 minutes.

194
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,009
What's up, Gon, is something wrong?

195
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,094
Yeah.

196
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,935
Oh, I see.

197
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,647
[Killua] Hey...

198
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,442
It's looking more and more 
like he's already dead.

199
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,154
What do you mean?

200
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,407
Well, he's been lying there for 
a long time now

201
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,033
and he hasn't moved or anything.

202
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,457
[Leorio] Damn it.

203
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,960
It's impossible to tell 
from this far away.

204
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,173
Hey you, we want to go over there 
and check his body.

205
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,718
What was that?

206
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,680
He might be dead already 
and we just want to see it for ourselves.

207
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,182
It's like I told you before,

208
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,059
he's only unconscious.

209
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,021
Yeah? Well how many hours do you think 
we've been here?

210
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,565
You think we're just going to take 
your word for it?

211
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,985
Care to make a wager, then?

212
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,739
Wager? 
A wager on what?

213
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,576
[Leroute] On whether he's dead or alive.

214
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,913
What are the stakes? 
What are you proposing?

215
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,168
[Leroute] Time.

216
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,669
[Leorio] Time?

217
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,091
[Leroute] We will settle our match 
through gambling,

218
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,302
betting time instead of chips.

219
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,931
Look at the monitor on the wall.

220
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,686
We'll each have 50 hours 
with which to wager.

221
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,689
And bets can only be placed 
in ten hour increments.

222
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,778
We bet until one of our clocks 
reaches zero.

223
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,281
Gambling with time, huh?

224
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,118
We'll take turns deciding 
what to bet on.

225
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,330
If your credit reaches zero,

226
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,375
you will have 50 fewer hours 
to escape the tower.

227
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,461
What if you hit zero first?

228
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,382
Fifty years will be added 
to our sentences.

229
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,383
[gasps]

230
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,426
If you accept these terms,

231
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,804
I'll confirm whether he's alive or dead.

232
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,434
[Lippo] Leroute...

233
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,937
Sentenced to 112 years

234
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,649
for trafficking endangered wildlife 
and breaking gambling laws.

235
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,194
This kind of match is right up her alley.

236
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,365
[Leorio] 
Man, that woman is crazy.

237
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,244
Betting with her own jail time like that?

238
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,830
Consider your answer carefully.

239
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,456
If you lose,

240
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,377
we'll all have 50 fewer hours 
to clear the tower.

241
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,629
Yeah, well nobody's asking you.

242
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,005
In case you forgot,

243
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,925
you're the one who got us into 
this stupid damn mess in the first place.

244
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,512
Very well. 
You won't hear another word from me.

245
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,596
[Leorio huffs]

246
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,307
Come on, we shouldn't be fighting 
each other.

247
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,729
[Tonpa chuckles] 
Keep it up, boys. Keep it up.

248
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,024
All right, 
I accept your damn challenge.

249
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,527
Okay.

250
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,405
I chose our first bet 
so you may set the ante.

251
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,451
Decide how many hours we'll wager on 
whether he's alive or dead.

252
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,373
I bet ten hours that he's alive!

253
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,668
[chuckles] 
What the hell?

254
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,546
He was just whining about Majitani 
being dead.

255
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,214
[Leroute laughs]

256
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,675
All right then, let's confirm.

257
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,470
Playing it safe, aren't you?

258
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,348
I thought you weren't going to say 
another word.

259
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,101
[Tonpa] Ten hours, huh?

260
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,147
[Leorio] It's the smart move.

261
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,232
Even if I'm wrong and he is dead,

262
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,651
then Kurapika will have won his round.

263
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,653
It's progress, at least.

264
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,282
If I bet that he's dead 
and he's just out cold,

265
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,993
it's adding insult to injury.

266
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:44,086
[heart beats]

267
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,756
See, he's only unconscious.

268
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,799
[Leorio] So it seems.

269
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,301
[clock dings]

270
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,302
[Gon] Yes!

271
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,763
Leorio's taken an early lead.

272
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,307
-This is bad. 
-[Gon] Huh?

273
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,186
Maybe he won't wake up 
no matter how long we wait.

274
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,687
I don't understand.

275
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,275
Don't you remember, 
when she walked by the guy on the floor?

276
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,568
What of it?

277
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,738
Well, I was pretty sure he was 
already dead by then.

278
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,491
But when I thought about it,

279
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,285
I realized he's more useful to his team 
alive.

280
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,538
As long as he stays unconscious.

281
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,375
See, if he doesn't wake up 
before the time runs out,

282
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,628
their sentences will be shortened 
by 72 years.

283
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,924
So, if he doesn't wake up at all, 
then that means we--

284
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,300
That's my point.

285
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,678
So, that's been their intention all along.

286
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,935
[Leroute] Okay, it's our turn.

287
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,770
What would you like to bet on next?

288
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,730
Let me see...

289
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,240
I say we bet on whether or not 
he's actually unconscious.

290
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,241
Huh?

291
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,243
[Gon] Oh, I get it.

292
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,661
Hm?

293
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,208
[Majitani] 
Wait, What? This wasn't on the note.

294
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,294
What am I supposed to do now?

295
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,176
When I woke up there was 
a note lying on the ground next to me.

296
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,972
It said, 
“Keep pretending you’re out cold.

297
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,932
Hide this note in your mouth.”

298
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,019
I knew what I was supposed to do.

299
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,481
All I had to do was stay down 
until the clock ran out

300
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,484
and we’d get seventy-two years off 
our sentences.

301
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,696
But, now what?

302
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,198
Do I stay down and keep pretending?

303
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,075
[Leroute] All right.

304
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,120
I’ll bet twenty hours 
that he really is out cold.

305
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,873
[Majitani] Okay, I got it!

306
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,585
That’s the play, then. I’ll just keep 
acting like I’m unconscious.

307
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,882
[Leroute] The question is, how do you 
propose we go about confirming this?

308
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,218
[Leorio] Oh...

309
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,805
It's simple, really.

310
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,934
Heavy bastard.

311
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:07,980
[Leorio grunts]

312
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,900
I figured I would just push him 
off the edge.

313
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,070
[Majitani] 
That’s the worst idea I’ve ever heard!

314
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,364
If he's really unconscious,

315
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,367
he’ll fall to his death 
and that’s the end of it.

316
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,828
Are you insane?

317
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,373
His match hasn’t been decided yet.

318
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,667
There’s no way I can accept those terms!

319
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,378
Don't worry.

320
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,588
If he falls and kicks the bucket,

321
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,465
we’ll forfeit the match

322
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,468
giving you a grand total of two wins.

323
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,054
That work for you?

324
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,768
It does. Very well, then.

325
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,897
What was that? 
Come on, don’t be ridiculous!

326
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,358
We’re talking about my life here!

327
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,611
[Leroute] 
In that case, I’m changing my bet

328
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,532
I bet 40 hours 
that he isn’t unconscious after all.

329
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,409
That’s everything I have left.

330
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,957
[chuckles] Little sneak. 
Finally showing your true colors.

331
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,460
[heart beats]

332
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:18,134
[rhythm of heart increases steadily]

333
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,807
Guess I'll let go, then.

334
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,770
[yelling] Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, 
don't let go. I'm awake!

335
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,105
I'm awake.

336
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,568
[screams] 
Wait! Wait!

337
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,821
I'm going to fall!

338
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,741
Good morning. 
[chuckles]

339
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,827
[Majitani groans]

340
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,996
You’re both complete lunatics!

341
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,123
I’ve had enough!

342
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,333
I lost plain and simple, okay?

343
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,461
Forget reducing my sentence.

344
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,797
I’m going back to prison where it’s safe!

345
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,048
Dammit!

346
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,889
[Leroute] 
You knew he was awake, didn't you?

347
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,309
Believe it or not, but I’m pre-med.

348
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,395
The way his eyes were moving 
was a dead giveaway.

349
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,023
[clock beeps]

350
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,527
Even so, 
you have only twenty hours remaining.

351
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,449
I know. But at least now we’re in 
a better position with a two-one lead.

352
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,576
[beeping]

353
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,373
Now, let's keep this ball rolling.

354
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,418
The choice is yours, 
so what’s it gonna be?

355
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,550
[narrator] 
Majitani throws in the towel,

356
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,553
giving Gon and his friends 
a two-to-one lead.

357
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,057
However, in the match 
where they gamble for time,

358
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,142
they’re down 80 to 20.

359
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,063
It’s Leroute’s turn to pick the next bet.

360
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,898
But what will she choose?

361
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,947
[theme song playing]

362
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,532
[Gon] Next time. 
"Trouble with the Gamble."

363
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,243
Bull... bull... bulldog!

364
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,411
[Gon barks]
