[narrator] In the Dentora region 
of the Republic of Padokea,

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,512
there is a dormant volcano 
surrounded by forests

3
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,723
measuring 3722 meters high

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,683
called Kukuroo Mountain.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,062
It is home to a family 
of famous assassins:

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,855
The Zoldyck family.

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:27,361
Visitors arrive every day in hopes 
of catching a glimpse of the mansion,

8
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,196
which has never been seen.

9
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:33,450
It’s one of this nation’s 
most popular tourist attractions.

[theme song playing]

12
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,117
Very well.

13
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,162
You’re free to go now.

14
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,955
But, Kil…

15
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,918
Promise me one thing…

16
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,422
That you will never betray your friends.

17
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,090
Got that?

18
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,137
I’ll never betray them.

19
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,140
I swear.

20
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:25,520
CAN'T SEE x IF x YOU'RE BLIND

21
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,653
[narrator] After speaking with his father, 
whom he greatly admires,

22
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,738
Killua leaves home once again,

23
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,948
despite his mother’s objections.

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,287
Canary leads Gon and his friends 
to the butler’s quarters,

25
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,706
in an attempt to meet with Killua.

26
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,336
[tired exhale] Are we there yet?

27
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,171
Still a bit farther.

28
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,422
[Leorio sighs]

29
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,633
But we’ve been walking forever…

30
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,681
[Kikyo] Oh, I am positively furious!

31
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,808
Kil finally came home to us

32
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,644
but my husband’s 
allowed him to leave again!

33
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,229
And Father is just as guilty,

34
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,815
releasing him 
without asking my permission!

35
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,693
Honestly! Every single time!

36
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,529
They all just act 
without consulting me first!

37
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,989
Understand, Gotoh?

38
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,491
[Gotoh] Yes, ma'am.

39
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,493
[Kikyo sobs]

40
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,833
This... This is 
a most critical time for Kil.

41
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,086
Why doesn’t anyone understand?

42
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,629
[sobs lightly]

43
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,968
He’s the one child I shall not give up!

44
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,887
[Kikyo sobbing]

45
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,639
[frogs croaking]

46
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,104
[Canary] There it is.

47
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,858
[Leorio] That’s it, huh?

48
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,194
It’s still a lot farther away 
than I’d like.

49
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,696
Hey, Canary.

50
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,365
Aren’t you gonna get 
in a lot of trouble with your bosses

51
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,616
for bringing us here?

52
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,745
They are perfectly aware 
of what I’m doing.

53
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,580
I am quite certain of that.

54
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,166
I’m prepared for the consequences.

55
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,960
If there’s any trouble, 
I’ll take responsibility.

56
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:18,091
No. I am merely serving as a guide 
for Master Killua’s friends.

57
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,899
Master Killua. 
We’ve been waiting for you.

58
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:34,983
Gotoh.

59
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,568
Where is Gon right now?

60
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,570
You know, don’t you?

61
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,616
Canary is bringing Master Gon 
along with his two friends,

62
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,201
even as we speak.

63
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,119
Seriously?

64
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,079
They’ll be arriving shortly,

65
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,873
so please wait inside.

66
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:50,999
Sure.

67
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,755
-Gotoh. 
-Sir.

68
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,840
The second he’s here, tell me.

69
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,843
[Gotoh] 
Of course. I shall notify you immediately.

70
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,396
Please forgive me Master Killua.

71
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,446
[Leorio] We finally made it!

72
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,957
Welcome, gentlemen.

73
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,296
[Gotoh] 
We apologize for our previous discourtesy.

74
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,008
We have been informed 
by the lady of the house

75
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,677
that from now on

76
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,096
you are to be treated as official guests.

77
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,140
There, does that feel better?

78
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,684
It does! Thank you!

79
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,525
Then this isn’t the main residence?

80
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,069
No. This is the butler’s quarters.

81
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,281
Now please make yourselves comfortable.

82
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,950
Look, thanks for the hospitality

83
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,202
but we only came here to see Killua.

84
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,705
So, can you take us to him?

85
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,123
Like, now?

86
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,584
That won’t be necessary, sir.

87
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,589
Master Killua is on his way 
this very moment.

88
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,965
-Wait, really? 
-[cups clatter]

89
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,593
[Gotoh] 
That’s right. So please be patient.

90
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,220
-Great news, huh, Gon? 
-Yep!

91
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,930
[Gotoh] Now then…

92
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,434
It would be so tedious 
to just sit and wait.

93
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,518
[smirks]

94
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,354
I propose we pass the time with a game.

95
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,523
Game, you say?

96
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,243
Which hand holds the coin?

97
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,454
[all three] The left hand.

98
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,498
That is correct.

99
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,835
Now I’ll move more quickly this time.

100
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,425
Now. Which hand?

101
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,178
It’s the left again.

102
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,971
How marvelous.

103
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,808
Well. I shall have to try harder 
this time.

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,816
So? Which hand?

105
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,861
I’m not sure, but...

106
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,404
I’d say right.

107
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,656
[Gotoh] You see…

108
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,034
I’ve known Master Killua his entire life

109
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,120
and I care for him as I would my own son.

110
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,623
In all honesty,

111
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,418
I despise you for attempting 
to take him away.

112
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,924
Well, which hand?

113
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,384
Answer.

114
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,469
The left hand.

115
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,603
The lady’s voice was a bare whisper.

116
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,982
Her son is leaving 
and it’s breaking her heart.

117
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,735
I can’t forgive you.

118
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,198
Before Master Killua arrives…

119
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,868
I shall test each of you 
by my own methods.

120
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,870
You have no choice.

121
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,419
Canary!

122
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,090
[Gotoh] This is her punishment 
for defying orders and bringing you here.

123
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,843
Allow me to explain the rules.

124
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,846
If you answer incorrectly you are out.

125
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,223
Should you all be disqualified

126
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,017
which is quite possible

127
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,811
then I shall tell Master Killua 
that you left.

128
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,106
And that he will never see 
any of you again.

129
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,941
-Killua is-- 
-[Gotoh] Silence!

130
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,987
Your very lives hang 
by a most delicate thread.

131
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,947
Answer my question.

132
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,699
I will not ask again.

133
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,499
Now, which hand?

134
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,254
I couldn’t see it.

135
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,631
And time is of the essence.

136
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,675
You only have three seconds.

137
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:11,843
You!

138
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,512
Once three seconds have passed, 
slit her throat.

139
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,513
Yes, sir.

140
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,474
Hold on! I pick the left hand!

141
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,517
-I pick the right hand! 
-Yes, me too!

142
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,518
[Leorio gasps]

143
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,271
[frustrated grunt]

144
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,733
One has been disqualified.

145
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,618
This is useless. I can’t see anything!

146
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,038
Which hand?

147
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,334
I choose the right hand.

148
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,752
And I pick the left.

149
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,339
It was in my left hand.

150
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,257
Now only one remains.

151
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,224
-Here we go. 
-Wait just a minute!

152
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,185
What is it?

153
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,063
If you’re trying to buy time, 
I will kill one of you.

154
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,066
-Leorio! Gimme your knife. 
-Huh?

155
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,651
Don’t worry, okay?

156
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,861
I’m not gonna use it for anything stupid.

157
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,747
He cut himself to reduce the swelling…

158
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,753
Dammit! How long do I have to wait?

159
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,214
Hey, Gotoh!

160
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,093
Is anybody out here?

161
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,931
What is going on?

162
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,602
There. Much better. I can see now.

163
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,854
Okay, I’m ready!

164
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,021
[derisive snort]

165
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,318
Which hand?

166
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:53,945
The left.

167
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,573
Very good. Now…

168
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,918
Now, which one of us has it?

169
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:17,260
HUNTER GLOSSARY

170
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,973
WAITING PERIOD

171
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,947
That guy. Right behind me.

172
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,411
[snorts]

173
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,914
-[butlers applaud] 
-[Gotoh] Splendid. Well done!

174
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,292
Gotoh! Is Gon here yet?

175
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,295
-Killua! 
-You were already here? Gon!

176
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,048
And this guy… um… Kurapika?

177
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,382
You remembered.

178
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,302
-Reolio! 
-[yells] It’s Leorio!

179
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,430
It’s been so long! But you made it!

180
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,807
Wow! Your face is a mess!

181
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,935
Back at you!

182
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,687
[Gon and Killua laughing]

183
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:14,025
Hey, Gotoh! What happened to telling me 
as soon as they got here, huh?

184
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,610
What were you doing?

185
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,403
Please forgive me.

186
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,448
I had them participate in a little game.

187
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,866
A game?

188
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,786
A joke, sir.

189
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,080
Though quite a poor one, admittedly.

190
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,332
I’m sorry for the trouble.

191
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,335
I do hope you enjoyed yourselves.

192
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,213
If that was a joke, 
then you sure fooled me.

193
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,839
Wait, did they try anything?

194
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,842
No. They were just 
keeping us all entertained.

195
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,345
Really? Well, okay.

196
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,682
Let’s go someplace else. 
Like anywhere at all.

197
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,393
If we stay here, 
my mom will chew all of us out.

198
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,352
Hm.

199
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,439
Hey, Gotoh. Listen.

200
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,234
No matter what Mom said, don’t follow me.

201
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,652
Understood, sir.

202
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,237
Please take care.

203
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,656
C’mon, Gon. Let’s go.

204
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,116
Bye.

205
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:10,832
Mister Gotoh...

206
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,460
You’re gonna miss Killua 
when he’s gone, aren’t you?

207
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,504
No, sir.

208
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,424
It is our duty to serve our employers

209
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,343
and not to become 
emotionally attached to them.

210
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,512
You liar.

211
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,473
[Gotoh] Gon.

212
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,232
Well? Which hand?

213
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,775
Your left one, right?

214
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,404
No way!

215
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,323
[Gotoh] Indeed. A deception.

216
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,368
The world is teeming 
with tricks and tricksters.

217
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,372
Please be careful.

218
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,626
And please, sir, look after Master Killua.

219
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:02,884
See ya later, Canary!

220
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,012
[Killua] Hurry up, Gon!

221
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,388
[Gon] Coming, sorry!

222
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,099
[Killua] Let’s get out of here 
before trouble finds us!

223
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,897
[Killua] Yeah. 
He pulled that same trick on me.

224
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,442
Once you know the secret, 
you’ll kick yourself for not seeing it.

225
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,152
Oh. Really?

226
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,864
I bet this is what he did.

227
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,410
-Which hand? 
-Your left, right?

228
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,288
What the--?!

229
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,873
But how’d ya do it?

230
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:37,085
Gotoh must have had two coins 
the entire time.

231
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,295
But it looked like he only had one.

232
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,215
Well he concealed a coin in his right hand

233
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,800
and then he flipped the other.

234
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,387
He let us see him grab the coin

235
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,263
using his left hand.

236
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,432
Now, this is where the skill comes in:

237
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,394
Before he asked us to choose 
which hand held the coin,

238
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,604
he raised both of his arms like so…

239
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,898
and slipped the first coin 
into his sleeve,

240
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,359
while keeping his hand 
balled up in a fist.

241
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,902
Oh!

242
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,655
Then he just showed us the coin 
in his right hand.

243
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,156
Yep, you got it.

244
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,117
[growls] That cheater!

245
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,452
Well, not the whole time, probably.

246
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,371
I’m sure just on the last turn.

247
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,165
Gotoh hates cheating, 
even if it’s just a game.

248
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,375
Feel better?

249
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,544
[growls] That's even worse!

250
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,380
[train whistles]

251
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,595
What? 
Wait. You came here on a tourist visa?

252
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,555
Mm-hm.

253
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,057
But you passed the Hunter Exam, 
didn’t you?

254
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,226
So why didn’t you use your license?

255
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,980
You can use it to get into other countries 
and stay for as long as you want!

256
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,648
We already told him that!

257
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,900
Not yet. No license.

258
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,111
Not until I finish what I have to do.

259
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,613
So, what is it? What do you gotta do?

260
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,658
Well… you remember…

261
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,245
When Hisoka game me his number badge!!

262
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,918
I will take it back

263
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,172
but only when you can 
punch me in the face like that.

264
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,049
In the meantime,

265
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,218
you just hold on to it for me.

266
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,180
I’ll return it

267
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,433
whenever I can punch Hisoka 
right in his stupid, ugly face!

268
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,270
Until I can do that, I’m not gonna 
use my Hunter’s License

269
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,022
or go back to Whale Island!

270
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,025
Hmm... So? Where is Hisoka?

271
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:24,984
Uh?

272
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,569
Uh, well…

273
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,987
That’s what I thought…

274
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,948
I know where he is, Gon.

275
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,325
Really?

276
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:33,951
But how?

277
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,828
I know because he told me.

278
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,206
That’s what he said…

279
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,707
[Kurapika gasps]

280
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,958
[Hisoka whispers inaudibly]

281
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,961
No. After the orientation.

282
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,130
[Leorio] Yeah, but it’s related, right?

283
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,465
Perhaps.

284
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,343
Okay, look, I’ve been dying to ask.

285
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,469
Hisoka…

286
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,845
What did he say to you?

287
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,265
All he said was…

288
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,311
I’ll tell you something interesting 
about spiders.

289
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,147
Did he mean the Phantom Troupe?

290
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,317
I don’t recall 
ever mentioning them to Hisoka.

291
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,904
He either overheard our conversation 
during the First Phase

292
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,656
or heard it from someone else.

293
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,617
The troupe’s symbol is the spider

294
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,495
which is what they are called 
by anyone familiar with them.

295
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,541
I was interested in 
whatever information he had.

296
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,125
I get it now.

297
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,379
Okay. That actually makes sense.

298
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,549
So that’s what made you swallow your pride 
and take the win.

299
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,927
I asked him about it 
after the orientation.

300
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,765
Meet me in Yorknew City 
on September first.

301
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,892
But why that date?

302
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,602
That’s half a year away.

303
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,187
You’ve got plenty of time.

304
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,023
So, what’s gonna happen in Yorknew City?

305
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,024
Ha!

306
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,193
They’re holding 
the world’s largest auction!

307
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,486
That’s right.

308
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,281
From September 1st 
through September 10th,

309
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,740
there will be an auction,

310
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,617
with rare and unusual items

311
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,036
and national treasures 
from around the world.

312
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,790
Of course, the event attracts 
all manner of tricksters

313
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,459
who come looking to satisfy their greed.

314
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,546
It’s the biggest gathering of wealth 
on the entire planet.

315
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,047
Oh…

316
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,425
Do you think that means 
the troupe’s gonna be there?

317
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,510
Well, they are a group of bandits.

318
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,555
It’s unlikely that they 
would let this opportunity slip by.

319
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,015
Regardless...

320
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,476
on that day, 
Hisoka will be somewhere in Yorknew City.

321
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,062
Okay, then. September the first.

322
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,106
I got it. Thanks a lot!

323
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,574
[Kurapika] All right. I’ll be leaving now.

324
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,575
[Gon] Huh?

325
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,785
We all got to see Killua again,

326
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,662
so my work here is finished.

327
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,416
I’ll be needing a lot of money 
if I’m going to attend the auction.

328
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,920
So, from here I shall search for a patron 
willing to employ me as a Hunter.

329
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,380
Really?

330
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,592
I guess I should head back home, then.

331
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,801
Wait, you too?

332
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,512
I haven’t given up on becoming a doctor.

333
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,431
If I’m accepted to med school,

334
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,726
then this will pay 
for the outrageous expenses.

335
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,771
I need to get back 
and start hitting the books.

336
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,564
Best of luck, Leorio!

337
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,322
-[Leorio] ‘Til next time… 
-[Kurapika] Yes. That will be…

338
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,909
[all] September first in Yorknew City!

339
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,661
See ya later!

340
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,500
[Gon] Bye-bye!

341
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,712
Guess it’s just you and me now, Killua.

342
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,339
So? What next?

343
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,467
You seriously have to ask me that? 
We’ve gotta start training.

344
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,135
Oh. For what?

345
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,428
Why not have fun?

346
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,680
[Killua grunts]

347
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,891
You remember what you told me 
about a second ago?

348
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,186
You think you can punch Hisoka in the face 
without training?

349
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,981
[yells] That’d take ten years! 
Forget about six months!

350
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,068
[Gon] Okay.

351
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,529
[Killua] Here. I’ll break it down for you.

352
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,073
This is Hisoka and this is Hanzo.

353
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,449
[Gon] Right, I’m with you,

354
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,494
[Killua] If this is the strength gap 
between Hisoka and Hanzo...

355
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,830
the gap between you and Hisoka is...

356
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,049
[Killua] This wide! 
And I’m being generous!

357
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,385
[Gon] That’s just mean!

358
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,430
Okay, then how far apart are you?

359
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:23,889
[Killua] Who, me?

360
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,852
Well, probably here…

361
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,312
Wow! I’m so humble!

362
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,522
Oh...

363
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,399
So Hanzo’s the stronger one?

364
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,608
Wait…

365
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,818
What is it?

366
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,487
[Gon] You really are awesome, Killua!

367
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,031
Knock it off, all right? 
It’s embarrassing.

368
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,951
It’s just I don’t know 
how to tell the difference in strength

369
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,536
between my opponent and me.

370
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,621
[Killua] It doesn’t really matter, dummy.

371
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,790
I’m only estimating, anyway.

372
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,752
Besides, you get the general idea, right?

373
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,797
And with experience, your estimates 
will become more accurate.

374
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,593
But the stronger someone is, 
the better they can hide that strength.

375
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,053
So, it’s not a method that I’d recommend.

376
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,305
Okay, I won’t.

377
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,141
[Killua] Point is... 
Hisoka’s really strong.

378
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,184
[Gon] Yeah.

379
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:12,563
With just six months, 
we’re gonna need to get real creative.

380
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:13,898
[grunts]

381
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,608
[Killua] Hey… got any money?

382
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,695
[sheepish exhale] 
I’m a little low, actually.

383
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,489
I don’t have much either.

384
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,742
But there’s a place 
where we can make ourselves some money

385
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,452
and train at the same time.

386
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,330
Make money while we’re training?

387
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,750
At the Heavens Arena.

388
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,211
Heavens Arena?

389
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,463
Yeah! I’ll explain later.

390
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,757
But we really ought to get going now!

391
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,133
[Gon] Right!

392
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,182
[narrator] After bidding farewell 
to Kurapika and Leorio,

393
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,644
as well as promising to meet again 
in Yorknew City,

394
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,647
Gon and Killua move on to a new stage:

395
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,440
the Heavens Arena.

396
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,860
[theme song playing]

397
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,111
[Gon] Next time: “Then x And x After”!

398
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,529
Sweet and spicy!

399
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,822
[Mito] Salty and spicy!

400
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,574
[Gon] Spicy is good for you!
