That’s not true.

There’s a reason
he took you along,

because he thought
you could handle the mission.

he told you to run away.

no one is allowed to leave
until the election is over.

I’m sure you have
somewhere else to be,

00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,472
but this will be the vote

who our next chairman will be.

if you tell us
your choice right now,

i’m quite certain
that everyone will agree

and Mr. Leorio,

00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,626
who do you believe
would best fit the position?

134
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,563
i should mention
that former chairman netero

135
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,966
is on extended leave
after defeating the ant king.

137
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:11,038
How can you say that?

138
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,074
if gon picks leorio
after his dramatic arrival,

139
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:17,244
everyone may get caught up
in the heat of the moment again.

140
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,047
you may have
just handed leorio the win.

141
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,416
Gon: The chairman?

142
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,517
Did leorio nominate himself?

143
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:27,588
leorio: No way!
See, some stuff happened--

144
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,989
pariston: Please, gon.

145
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,192
i want you
to trust your instincts.

146
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,194
Be true to yourself, all right?

147
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,497
Then make your selection.

148
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,669
Gon: Um, well...

149
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,705
Then I pick Mr. Pariston.

150
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,739
( Crowd murmuring )

151
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,741
( Cheadle gasps )

152
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:51,345
Pariston: But isn’t
Mr. Leorio your friend?

153
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,648
I’m confused. You’re voting
against your own friend?

( Gon grunts )

155
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,385
because I know that
leorio wants to be a doctor,

156
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,087
so he can’t be chairman.

00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,367
Pariston: I can appreciate that.

163

And, if there’s nothing else,
let’s begin the vote.

164
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,974
Leorio: Oh! By the way,
i’m siding with gon here.

165

following a wish for a computer

00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:49,810
should be more severe
than playing possum and hugs.

254

( Bodies slump )

255
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,650
the first moment
I realized something was off

256
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,153
was when I heard
milluki’s report

257
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,854
and when the binary choice wish

258
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,223
resulted in a simple kiss
on the cheek,

259
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,427
yet the price was a fingernail,
quite a heavy price, indeed.

260
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:13,467
Assuming that the fingernails
were the price for the computer,

261
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,404
that would match the balance
between wishes and demands

262
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,573
that we had observed previously.

263
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,111
If my theory is correct,
playing possum and the hug

264
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,180
weren’t requests from nanika,

265
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:30,250
and if that’s true, there’s only
one conclusion that makes sense.

266
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,420
The binary choice wish
didn’t require a payment.

267
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,724
Why was that the case?

268
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,159
There are two possibilities
I can think of.

269
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,862
One, because the wish
was simple enough

270
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,700
that nanika’s power
wasn’t required to carry it out.

271
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:51,272
Two, because it
wasn’t a wish at all.

272
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:56,309
However, there’s still
an unresolved question.

273
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,679
If playing dead and the hugs
weren’t demands from nanika...

274
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,651
They were demands from alluka,

275
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,220
not nanika, as we had thought.

276
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,323
Killua claims that nanika

277
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,524
always refers to him
by his proper name,

278
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:16,097
but the demand to play dead,
that was made to "big brother."

279
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,066
Thus it’s fair to say

280
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,235
that the one who calls killua
"big brother" is alluka.

281
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:26,206
If that request did,
in fact, come from alluka,

282
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,209
we can assume nanika
wasn’t awake at the time.

283
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,211
And if nanika was asleep,

284
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,481
killua shouldn’t have been able
to make the binary choice wish.

285
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:38,585
However, nanika responded
to killua’s wish.

286
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,321
The hint to resolving
this contradiction

287
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,856
lies in killua’s wording.

288
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,591
when making
the binary choice wish,

289
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,594
he wasn’t asking.
He was ordering.

290
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,497
It does make sense that an order

291
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,599
would work differently
than a wish and that,

292
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,570
upon completion, it might
not require a price to be paid.

293
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:01,041
Well, that’s my theory anyway.

294
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,109
Am I right?

295
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,249
I’ll get to the point.

296
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,052
The zoldyck family needs someone
