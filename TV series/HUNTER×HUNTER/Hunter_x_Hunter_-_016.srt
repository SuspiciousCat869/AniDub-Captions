[Hisoka] Don't lie to me.

16
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,718
He probably begged you to grant him 
a last request

17
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,055
and you relented. 
Am I right?

[Gitarrackur] 
Well, I may have felt sorry for the man.

19
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,644
He was going to die anyway.

You really need to stop pitying those

Why waste time on people

[grunts] 
Leorio, Kurapika.

36
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,089
I never thought he'd be going after 
Leorio and Kurapika.

37

What am I supposed to do now?

38
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,303
Don't lose focus. Stick to the plan!

39
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,097
And the moment Hisoka attacks, 
go for his badge.

40
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,267
That's the best chance 
I'm going to get to take it.

41

It's my only chance.

if they start fighting, 
I'll have to change my strategy.

45
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,709
[Leorio] All right, so, 
I finally figured out who my target is.

46
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,297
But how am I supposed to find her 
on an island this big?

47
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,218
Isn't wandering around like this 
a huge waste of energy?

48
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,597
No more a waste of energy 
than constantly whining, I would imagine.

49
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,975
Well you've already got your six points 
so you're all set.

50
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,853
But I'm plumb out of luck 
if I don't find my target pretty soon.

[both grunt]

Hisoka.

54
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,780
What a coincidence meeting you here.

55
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,657
How fortunate.

56
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,494
[laughs] Why do I run into people 
I don't want to see?

57
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,414
You see, all I'm lacking 
is just two more points.

58
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,543
I was hoping you might give me yours.

59
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,627
Give you what?

60
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,170
You're crazy. I'm not going to give--

61
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,171
Leorio.

62
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,550
You said you only need two points.

63
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,470
Meaning neither one of us 
is your primary target.

64
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,972
Am I right about that?

65
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,516
Leave the questions to me, all right?

66
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,936
Will you give me your badges? 
Answer carefully.

67
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,647
I suppose that depends...

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,862
Between the two of us 
we currently have four badges.

69
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,657
Mine, my target's, Leorio's,

70
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,952
and one that's worth only a single point 
to either him or me.

71
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,081
Of the four, two might possibly belong 
to your specific target,

72
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,708
and only two.

73
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,712
Mine or the badge 
that's worth a single point.

74
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,340
Leorio's number is 403.

75
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,468
He was targeted by number 16, 
Tonpa.

76
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,887
And he,

77
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,223
number 16, was assigned to me 
as my target.

78
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,310
Each of us was given a different target

79
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,604
so 16 and 403 are out.

80
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:36,855
[Hisoka] Indeed.

81
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,611
Neither of those is the target 
I was searching for.

82
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,987
What of it?

83
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,573
[Kurapika] 
That just leaves the other two badges.

84
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,410
If you're willing to take the badge 
that's worth one point and leave

85
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,412
you are more than welcome to have it.

86
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,374
But I will not allow you to take mine.

87
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,629
And the same goes for the other two.

88
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,634
If you insist on taking them by force

89
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,137
prepare to fight me for them.

Four hundred and four.

95
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,903
[Hisoka] Very well.

96
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,407
You have yourself a deal.

97
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,784
I'll take the badge worth a single point.

[gasps]

99
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,502
I'll leave it here.

100

Don't look so concerned.

101
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,216
I'll stay right here 
until you're out of sight.

102
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,441
[laughs]

103
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,279
In a few short days, 
they've both grown beyond recognition.

104
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,865
But, they have more to learn.

105
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,952
I wonder... 
why must unripe fruit be so...

106
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,912

107
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,915
Such a pity.

108
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,001
Not the badge I was hoping for.

That was a close one.

111
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,430
But now, 
I've only got one more chance left.

112
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,309
Whenever he finds his next prey, 
I'll be ready.

113
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,613
Hey.

114
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,032
Wait just a minute.

115
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,827
What if the next person he finds decides 
that they don't want to fight him either?

116
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,377
Oh man.

117
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,090
If the next person just surrenders 
and hands over their badge,

118
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,885
like what I just saw happen, 
I won't get another chance at all.

119
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,314
I'm so stupid!

and get me stirred up,

131
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,361
there's only one thing to do about it now.

I can do this.

His bloodlust is gone.

141
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,223
but that look in his eyes 
is nothing like before.

142
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,768
He's going to attack the next person 
he sees,

even if they try to surrender, 
I'm sure of it.

00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,734
I know, I've got to move ahead 
and find his next prey before he does.

145
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,698
Then, I need to find myself 
a good spot to hide

146
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,242

There!

[footsteps]

165
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,170
[footsteps audible]

166
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,923
[complete silence]

167
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,677
[footsteps audible]

168
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,971
[complete silence]

169
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,935
[Gon] I have to stay hidden. 
I can't let him sense me.

170
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,355
Focus.

171
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,989
Hmm?

172
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,701
[rumbling]

173
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,828
Here he comes.

174
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,579
[grunts]

175
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,707
[man] Hisoka!

176
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,085
Damn it. Bring it on!

177
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,878
[Gon] He's fighting back.

178
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,302
[whimpering]

179
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,020
[cries out]

180
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,028
[grunting]

181
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,055
[sighs]

182
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,892
[panting]

183
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,820
[Gon continues panting]

184
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,368
I did it. I took Hisoka's badge from him.

185
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,412
[groans]

186
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,175
[grunts]

187
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,141
[footsteps approaching]

188
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,104
[man] About 7,000.

189
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:06,275
Do you know what that number represents?

190
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,906
That is the number of chances I had 
to kill you.

191
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,203
But it's also

192
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:21,123
about the number of times you cast 
your fishing rod while you were training.

193
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,757
Every cast left you wide open,

194
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,928
but your focus and your accuracy 
were admirable, I'll give you that.

195
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,890
And just now, your swing was 
equally impressive.

196
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,894
But you didn't pay enough attention 
to your surroundings.

197
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,773
In the future, 
remember to watch your back.

198
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,775
So long.

199
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,118
[Gon] Damn it.

200
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,858
[strained breathing]

201
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:40,369
[rustling]

202
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,249
[Gon gasps]

203
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,337
You surprise me.

204
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:54,592
You hid your presence from me while you 
were waiting for your chance to strike.

205
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:59,305
Biding your time until the very moment 
that I attacked someone else?

206
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,643
Did you learn how to conceal yourself 
all on your own?

207
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:04,894
Marvelous.

208
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,937
You're like a wild animal.

209
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,358
And your timing was just impeccable.

210
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,027
You were able to conceal 
your bloodlust

211
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,448
by cleverly hiding it behind mine 
so that I wouldn't notice.

212
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,950
Masterfully done.

213
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,247
His blow dart delivered a fast-acting, 
powerful muscle relaxant.

214
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:29,085
In a normal person 
the effect lasts about ten days.

215
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,253
There are three days left.

216
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,674
I'm sure by then 
you'll make a full recovery.

217
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,927
[Gon straining] Wait.

218
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:46,143
If you're not taking your badge 
then why are you here?

219
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,105
To say, "Congratulations."

220
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,191
As it turns out, he was my target.

221
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,654
Which means I don't need mine anymore.

222
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,948
Well, neither do I.

223
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,991
[Hisoka] Don't be like that.

224
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,952
You owe me one now.

225
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,121
You can pay me back 
whenever you like.

226
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,747
So long.

227
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,795
[Gon straining]

228
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,634
I don't owe you or anybody.

229
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,803
Here, take it back.

230
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,807
[laughs]

231
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,559
I refuse.

232
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,438
I've decided to let you live, for now.

233
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,734
And I plan to let you continue living 
for as long as it suits me.

234
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:39,113
Until some day, 
you become truly worthy of killing.

235
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,956
I will take it back,

236
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,835
but only when you can punch me 
in the face like that.

237
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,631
In the meantime, 
you just hold onto it for me.

238
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,220
[Hisoka laughs]

239
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,221
[narrator] 
Gon was knocked out by Hisoka's punch

240
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,765
and realized he was utterly helpless

241
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,475
in the face of such power.

242
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,895
And now, alone in the darkness,

243
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,648
what must be going through his mind?

244
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,693
[theme song playing]

245
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,525
[Gon] Next time: 
"Trap x in x the Hole."

246
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,985
Holy moly.

247
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,697
-I want to be your friend. 
-Wow. Friend?

248
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,407
You're embarrassing.
