[roaring]

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,755
[narrator] Strange beasts

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,548
and monsters.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,551
Vast riches.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,386
Hidden treasures.

6
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,765
Evil haunts.

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,601
Uncharted frontiers.

8
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,438
The mysterious unknown.

9
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:25,901
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words…

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,903
are called…

11
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,492
Hunters.

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,916
[theme song playing]

13
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,490
Come on! You can’t be serious!

14
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,618
[laughing]

15
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,578
Oh, I am quite serious.

16
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,665
The winners will pass the Exam 
and earn the title of Hunter.

17
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:09,254
CAN'T WIN x BUT x CAN'T LOSE

18
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,217
[narrator] The nine remaining applicants,

19
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,302
Gon,

20
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,261
Killua,

21
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,512
Kurapika,

22
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,472
Leorio,

23
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,182
Pokkle, Bodoro,

24
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,516
Gittarackur,

25
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,559
Hanzo

26
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,685
and Hisoka,

27
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,812
having passed the Fourth Phase,

28
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,899
head to the site 
of the Final Phase of the Exam.

29
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,611
[Netero] Well, gentlemen.

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,655
Everyone rested up? 
Good.

31
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,784
Now then. The Hunter Exam Committee 
runs this hotel.

32
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,328
So, I want all of you 
to make yourselves at home

33
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,580
until the battles have concluded.

34
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,501
For the Final Phase of the Hunter Exam

35
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,587
you’ll be competing 
in a one-on-one tournament.

36
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,133
[Leorio] Hold on a second.

37
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,969
So only the last person standing passes?

38
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,513
[Netero] No.

39
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,558
You only need one win to pass this phase.

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,851
Just one?

41
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,229
Wait. So, in this tournament…

42
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,482
See, it’s the winners who will drop away

43
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,777
and the losers 
who will advance to the next round.

44
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,404
Which means

45
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,949
the person who finishes at the top 
will not pass.

46
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,576
Make sense to everyone?

47
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,913
You’re saying that only one person 
will fail the Exam.

48
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,707
Exactly.

49
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,757
Here is the bracket we’ve put together.

50
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,908
Impressive, yes?

51
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,869
You see under this format

52
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,706
every competitor has at least two chances 
to win a round.

53
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,460
Yeah but some people 
get five chances to win,

54
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,628
like Numbers 294 and 405.

55
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,674
Couldn’t you have used 
a more balanced bracket?

56
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,135
[thoughtful grunt] 
Now, that’s a fair question.

57
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,596
This bracket was carefully assembled

58
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,931
based on each 
of your individual performances

59
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,516
throughout the Hunter Exam.

60
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,018
To put it simply,

61
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,479
those whose performances 
were rated highly,

62
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,773
will have the most chances to win.

63
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,067
[Killua] I’m not convinced.

64
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,654
Could explain exactly 
how you scored our performances?

65
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,657
Hmm...

66
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,659
[yells] No!

67
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,702
[Killua] Why not?

68
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,787
[Netero laughs]

69
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,165
I can’t say because your scores 
are classified.

70
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,584
I can’t reveal your actual scores.

71
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,171
However, I can explain 
the criteria we used.

72
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,424
We start with the basics.

73
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,510
There are three categories.

74
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,053
There’s physical strength,

75
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,846
mental acuity

76
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,098
and lastly, overall impression.

77
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,311
When judging physical strength, we rely on

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,689
aggregate of agility, flexibility, 
endurance,

79
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,149
and perception.

80
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,194
For mental acuity the aggregate 
consists of

81
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,947
resilience, adaptability, judgment,

82
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,282
and of course, creativity.

83
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,410
But these are only reference points.

84
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,705
After all, every last one of you 
was strong enough in mind and body

85
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,624
to reach the Final Phase.

86
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,547
We’re most concerned 
with your overall impression.

87
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,299
This refers to any intangible factors

88
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,802
that defy basic categorization.

89
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,929
[chuckles]

90
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:50,225
Think of it as our way 
of assessing your potential as a Hunter.

91
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:55,272
We round out our assessment by 
incorporating the opinions of your peers.

92
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,606
There you have it.

93
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,277
Based on my performance, 
I should be ranked higher.

94
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,198
Do I have less potential than Gon?

95
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,703
The rules of the battle 
are really quite simple.

96
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,247
Weapons are allowed, 
cheating is forbidden,

97
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,916
and if your opponent admits defeat, 
you win.

98
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:15,917
However!

99
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,836
If you kill your opponent,

100
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,630
you will be disqualified 
without hesitation.

101
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,425
And if that happens, the Exam ends

102
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,093
and the remaining applicants pass.

103
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,094
Got it?

104
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,474
[Masta] 
Let the Final Phase of the Exam begin!

105
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,697
[Hanzo cracking his wrists]

106
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,534
The first match:

107
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,578
Hanzo versus Gon.

108
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,746
Enter!

109
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,291
[trumpets playing fanfare]

110
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,355
I’m Masta.

111
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,857
I’ll be serving as referee 
for the tournament.

112
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,817
Good luck. Both of you.

113
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,819
Hey. Good to see you again.

114
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,031
You were the one who was tailing me around 
during the Fourth Phase.

115
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,700
You noticed that, did you?

116
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,868
Naturally.

117
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:36,289
I assume that each of the Examiners 
was assigned an Examinee to follow.

118
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,918
Well, I’m sure I wasn’t the only one 
who noticed.

119
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,795
I had no idea!

120
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,255
Oh, I definitely noticed.

121
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,592
I noticed, but didn’t think 
it was worth mentioning.

122
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,010
Uh. Yeah…

123
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,513
How was I supposed to know?

124
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,306
I’m very grateful.

125
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,185
You recognized my talent 
and my rank improved as a result.

126
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,229
But no surprise there, really.

127
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,313
Sure, but...

128
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,982
[Hanzo] Now, moving on.

129
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,317
I have a question for you.

130
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,694
What is it?

131
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,363
[Hanzo] We can only win 
if our opponent surrenders.

132
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,447
Correct?

133
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,950
[Hanzo] 
Knocking them unconscious doesn’t count.

134
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,077
No TKOs either?

135
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,705
Right. Those are the rules.

136
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,581
Hmm...

137
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,375
I see.

138
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,713
Well. This one might prove difficult.

139
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,091
He looks tough.

140
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,844
but we should be pretty even 
in strength and speed.

141
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,389
I’ve just gotta keep him on the move 
‘til I see an opening.

142
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,725
Now, time to start.

143
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,690
All right, Gon. Get him!

144
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,484
I wonder how he’ll do against Hanzo.

145
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,952
Begin!

146
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,373
I’ll keep some distance.

147
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,752
[gasps]

148
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,880
You must think you’re 
pretty quick on your feet, don’t you?

149
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:07,964
I’ll give you that.

150
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,343
[choking sounds]

151
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,681
Not half bad for a little kid.

152
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,730
[scoffs]

153
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,608
I could have dodged that no problem.

154
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,568
[choking sounds]

155
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,239
Now if this were a regular match,

156
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,533
I’d already be declared the winner.

157
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,913
C’mon, pull yourself together.

158
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,831
-[bones crackling] 
-[Gon grunts]

159
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,501
You must feel awful.

160
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,962
I hit you hard enough 
to bounce your brain around your skull.

161
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,673
You get it? You don’t stand a chance.

162
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,134
Just give up 
and spare yourself the trouble.

163
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:54,844
[straining]

164
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,471
No way!

165
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,478
-[Gon coughing] 
-Think hard about it.

166
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,815
Surrender now 
and you’ll have another chance.

167
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,734
But being stubborn 
isn’t gonna get you anywhere.

168
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,945
So just give up.

169
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,907
That’s never gonna happen!

[Gon groans in pain]

174
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,059
Gon! Don’t push it!

175
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,394
You still have other fights!

176
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,854
-So just-- 
-[Kurapika] Leorio!

177
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,274
If you were in Gon’s position, 
would you give up?

178
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,775
Hell, no, I wouldn’t!

179
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,028
He thinks he’s so tough…

180
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,114
[Kurapika] Gon feels the same.

181
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,449
Come on! I know that!

182
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,536
But it doesn’t look like 
he has much of a choice!

183
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,872
My point exactly. 
But I understand.

184
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,394
-[Gon grunts] 
-[Kurapika and Leorio wince]

[grunts]

186
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,254
Surrender, Gon! This is suicide!

187
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,257
[Menchi] This is unbelievable.

188
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,219
The Chairman’s mean streak 
is really in a class by itself!

189
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,929
Wait, what do you mean?

190
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,432
No applicant who’s made it 
all the way to here,

191
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,767
is going to simply give up a fight 
that easily.

192
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,769
[Buhara] That’s true.

193
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,982
-[Gon groans] 
-This fight isn’t just peculiar.

194
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,276
A system like this is completely crazy.

195
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,445
The kid’s in real danger.

196
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,988

00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,655
Look. He can’t even vomit anymore.

205
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,074
Now get up.

206
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,744
[Leorio growls] Enough already!

207
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,871
I’m gonna kill you, hear me?

208
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,165
Pick on someone your own size!

209
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,543
If you can’t handle it, 
you’d better leave.

210
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,796
It’s only going to get worse.

211
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,547
What the hell did you say?

212
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,550
There’ll be no interference 
in a one-on-one match.

213
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,052
Stay back.

214
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,929
If you try to help him in any way,

215
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,181
Gon will be instantly disqualified!

216
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,643
[Gon] It’s okay.

217
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,271
Leorio…

218
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,690
This is...

219
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,567
this is nothing.

220
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,236
Really.

221
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,116
[growls quietly]

222
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,995
I can still fight him.

I’m not kidding.

228
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,552
Now say it.

229
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,305
Say you surrender.

230

-[yells] Never!

[groans in pain]

233
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,325
He actually broke it.

234
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,827
[Hanzo] There.

235
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,705
Now you won’t be able 
to use your left arm anymore.

236
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,498
[grinding teeth in frustration]

237
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,837
[Leorio] Don’t try to stop me, Kurapika.

238
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,760
If that bastard does anything else, 
Gon will fail the exam.

239
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,554
Cuz I won’t be able to stop myself.

240
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,639
[Kurapika] Me?

241
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,850
You think I’ll stop you?

242
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,353
Don’t worry.

243
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,355
There’s no chance of that.

244
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,400
[Hanzo] I’m sure you’re in too much pain 
to listen,

245
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,735
but hear this.

246
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,073
I’m a descendant of a clandestine group 
called the shinobi.

247
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,286
From the day I was born,

248
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,914
I’ve been subjected 
to intensive training

249
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,084
in order to master 
the special art of ninpo.

250
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,211
For the past 18 years

251
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,048
I’ve tirelessly trained my body 
and honed my technique.

252
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,802
By the time I was your age, 
I had already killed.

253
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,097
[scoffs] Not like it’s that big a deal.

254
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,974
[Hanzo] At this point in time

255
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,936
you have no hope 
of defeating me in combat.

256
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,480
I’m being nice.

257
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,358
So just admit defeat--

258
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,819
[grunts in pain]

259
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,698
[Gon groans in pain]

260
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,076
Dammit!

261
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,662
Between the pain and you blabbing

262
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,997
I don’t know what cleared my head up more!

263
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,333
Hell yeah!

264
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,293
Atta boy!

265
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,630
Now kick him while he’s down 
and he’s finished!

266
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,466
If you’re eighteen,

267
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,468
then you’re just six years older than me.

268
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,723
Besides this isn’t a battle 
to see who’s stronger.

269
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,935
It’s to see who’s willing 
to throw in the towel first.

270
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,525
I let you kick me because I wanted to.

271
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,444
You’re a liar!

272
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,237
[Hanzo] You must be confused.

273
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,823
That was not a warning.

274
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,033
It was a direct order.

275
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,162
Was it too hard for you to understand?

276
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,497
I’m quite happy to break it down for you.

277
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,210
I’ll cut off your legs,

278
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,546
so that they can’t be reattached.

279
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,050
A permanent injury

280
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,970
should open up your eyes 
to the current situation.

281
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,307
But before we must resort to such things,

282
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,143
I want to hear you surrender.

283
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,025
[Gon] Well, that’s a problem.

284
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,614
I don’t want to have my legs cut off

285
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,949
but I don’t want to surrender, either.

286
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,119
How ‘bout we find 
a different way to fight?

287
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,662
[yells] What the hell?

288
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,581
Have you not been paying attention?

289
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,376
-[Hisoka chuckling] 
-[Bodoro laughing]

290
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,586
Oh, pardon me.

291
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,131
Are you really making demands? 
You messin’ with me?

292
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,550
I’m seriously about to cut your legs off!

293
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,388
You do what you want but I won’t give up!

294
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,598
[growling in anger]

295
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,725
Besides if you cut my legs off,

296
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,227
I’ll probably just bleed to death.

297
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,269
[Hanzo] What?

298
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,731
Mister Masta? 
He’d be disqualified for that, right?

299
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,608
Uh... Yes.

300
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:06,984
See?

301
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,195
And that’d be bad for the both of us.

302
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,821
So, let’s think of a better way.

303
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,032
[angered growling]

304
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,536
[growling loudly]

305
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,163
[Kurapika chuckles] I think Gon is okay.

306
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,623
He’s in control now.

307
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,251
He’s just so damn stubborn!

308
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,796
But he’s also convincing 
to Hanzo and the rest of us.

309
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,673
Impressive.

310
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,133
[Killua] What the hell is this?

311
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,635
Nothing’s changed.

312
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,638
I mean, it’s not like 
Gon’s gotten any stronger.

313
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,266
His arm is still broken and everything!

314
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,144
But what happened to the mood in here?

315
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,938
It was so tense a second ago.

316
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,315
Why did it get so much lighter?

317
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,694
[angered growling]

318
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,038
[Hanzo] I see you’re not getting it, 
so I’ll try again.

319
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,458
Die and you’ll never get another chance.

320
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,796
If I kill you right here and now,

321
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,966
I only need to come back 
and take the Exam again next year.

322
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,969
We are not on equal footing!

323
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,014
[Killua] He’s right, Gon.

324
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,226
You might have the edge 
when it comes to brains

325
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,645
but you don’t have the combat skills 
he does.

326
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,441
That’s not something 
you can make up for right now.

327
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,903
In the end, it all comes down to ability.

328
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,157
[Leorio grunts]

329
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,372
[grunting]

330
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,128
What’s wrong?

331
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,005
It’s just a stupid sentence!

332
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,426
Think! Give up 
and you can still try again next year!

333
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,221
Is your pride truly 
all that you care about?

334
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,183
Even more than your life? 
Is it worth dying for?

335
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,646
[grunts]

336
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,735
I’m gonna go see my dad.

337
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,696
Your dad?

338
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,491
See, my dad is a Hunter.

339
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,869
So, I’m gonna become a Hunter 
exactly like he is

340
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,704
and then I’ll be able to meet him!

341
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,294
I know I’ll find him someday.

342
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,218
But... I feel like if I surrender now,

343
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,303
I’m never gonna find him!

344
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,558
So, I won’t give up.

345
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,773
Surrender...

346
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,733
or you will die.

347
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,783
So, logic had nothing to do with it.

348
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,373
Fine. You win.

349
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,666
I give up, okay?

350
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,713
I’m not allowed to kill you.

351
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,509
And I just can’t think of another way 
to force you to surrender.

352
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,637
So, I’ll take my chances 
in the next round.

353
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,850
Well, I can’t accept that.

354
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,435
No fair!

355
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,689
We both have to come up with some way 
that we can have a proper match!

356
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,566
[Hanzo sighs]

357
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,401
Why am I not surprised?

358
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,695
[yells] 
You just said you would never surrender,

359
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,114
so what the hell is the point of that, 
you idiot?

360
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,242
The point is that I don’t want 
to win like this, okay?

361
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,660
Then what do you suggest?

362
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,662
Let’s work together and figure it out!

363
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,582
So, in other words...

364
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,126
I’ve already given up the match

365
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,088
but you want me to continue fighting 
and try to beat you again right?

366
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,133
But first we have to work together 
to find a way you can win,

367
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,469
so you feel good about your victory.

368
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,720
Is that right?

369
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:03,846
Yeah!

370
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,598
[yells] Moron!

371
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,185
Hey, referee.

372
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,562
I lose, so move on to the next match.

373
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,063
Understood, sir.

374
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,733
But I’d like to say something first.

375
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,318
Whenever he wakes up,

376
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,737
he’ll probably decline his advancement.

377
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,990
And as we’ve all seen, 
he can be incredibly stubborn.

378
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,285
Only one person fails this round, right?

379
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,287
So, if Gon is disqualified,

380
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,915
wouldn’t that render 
the rest of our upcoming fights

381
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,500
completely meaningless?

382
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,594
[narrator] With Hanzo’s concession, 
Gon’s victory has been assured.

383
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,555
The Final Phase

384
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,184
that will determine 
the single failing applicant

385
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,852
has only just begun.

386
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,984
[theme song playing]

387
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,195
[Gon] Next time: 
"Baffling Turn x Of x Events!"

388
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,614
[Gon gibers]

389
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,699
[Killua] 
They stuck a needle in Gon, too?
