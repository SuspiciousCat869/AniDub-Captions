NEN

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:06,882
[narrator] Nen abilities fall into 
the following six distinct categories:

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,761
Enhancers are able 
to strengthen and reinforce

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,931
the natural properties 
of any object they encounter.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:19,394
Transmuters can manipulate and change 
the quality of aura at will.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,855
Similar to Transmuters,

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:26,527
Conjurers have the ability 
to materialize an object out of aura.

8
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,113
Emitters can propel their aura,

9
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,366
shooting or projecting it forward.

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:38,539
Manipulators can use their aura 
to control objects or living things.

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,750
Specialists possess rare abilities

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,836
which do not fit 
within the other five categories.

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,591
One must determine 
which category their aura falls into.

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,595
This is the first step 
to becoming a skilled Nen user.

15
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,979
[theme song playing]

16
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,719
The auction, as you all know,

17
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,262
will begin in one month.

18
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,974
Before that time, 
find one item from the list provided

19
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,602
and then bring it safely back here.

20
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,646
[surprised gasp]

21
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,190
THE EYEBALLS OF A KURTA.

22
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,108
[seething]

23
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,070
[man on the screen] If you’re successful, 
you’ll be hired

24
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:37,032
and begin your training 
in security and acquisitions.

25
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,867
[Kurapika] In all likelihood,

26
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,745
the man we saw was not the actual client,

27
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,707
thus, illustrating the distance 
between the client and myself.

28
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,878
It’s critical that I get 
as close to them as possible,

29
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,674
until they eventually let their guard down 
and share their secrets.

30
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,636
I will pass this test.

31
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,223
First, I must ingratiate myself 
and win their trust.

32
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:06,728
NEN x USERS x UNITE

33
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,064
[man at the door] Hey… It won’t open.

34
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,315
Huh?

35
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,401
[man on the screen] 
I forgot to mention one thing…

36
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:16,363
The minimum requirement 
for the position is strength.

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,491
Enough strength 
to get out of this mansion

38
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,618
with your lives.

39

DOWSING CHAIN: 
THE GUIDING RING FINGER CHAIN

00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,735
[groaning in pain]

42
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,377
[man] 
He used a chain to stop the bullets!

43
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,587
Impressive.

44
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,714
[clatter]

45
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,187
[Kurapika] Three with guns.

46
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,147
Six with swords.

47
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,945
Two more with swords above.

48
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,493
Good job concealing your presence, guys.

49
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,995
But unfortunately for you, 
you’re too weak!

50
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:53,335
As a matter of fact, 
I don’t even need to use my Nen!

51
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,673
So that’s what’s going on…

52
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,258
I get it now.

53
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,314
It’s him.

54
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,528
[all gasp]

55
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,737
[gasps]

56
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,073
Call them off, right now.

57
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,283
I’ll count to three.

58
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,327
One, two...

59
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,662
Okay, okay!

60
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,956
Whatever you say…

61
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,921
Wait… What’s going on?

62
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,965
They were made of Nen.

63
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,634
I knew as soon as I punched one of ‘em.

64
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,346
They’re just masses of aura 
are shaped like men. They’re week.

65
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,099
I didn’t realize it was his Nen.

66
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,643
Impressive, how'd you know?

67
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,146
You were careful to stand next to others 
for camouflage.

68
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,858
But when I watched you from above, 
it was clear.

69
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,028
Every one of us was under attack, 
except you.

70
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,321
Oh?

71
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,242
[Kurapika] I realized something was wrong

72
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,619
when two of them appeared 
on the second floor.

73
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,748
After I jumped over to the chandelier 
and out of their reach,

74
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,458
they just stood there,

75
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,210
continuing to swing their swords,

76
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,504
in a futile attempt to reach me.

77
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,300
I have to assume 
they received a basic order

78
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,219
to attack whichever enemy was nearest.

79
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,514
The instructions the assailants had 
were simple,

80
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,975
so their attacks were as well.

81
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,061
However, it would take 
an incredibly skilled Nen user

82
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,982
to control eleven 
human-sized aura simultaneously.

83
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,985
And it stands to reason

84
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,821
that this Nen user would 
most likely be an Emitter.

85
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,324
And given the size of the aura involved,

86
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,535
he would have to be 
within a few meters of the assailants.

87
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,954
Which meant that the Nen user…

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,583
was someone inside this very room.

89
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,668
[whistles]

90
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,087
Well… yeah, you nailed it.

91
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,466
My name is Shachmono Tocino.

92
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,260
As you might’ve guessed, I'm a Hunter.

93
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,721
Of course, I’m also an employee here,

94
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,223
which means I’m basically your senior.

95
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,602
Now that’s cleared up, 
think you could put away your knife?

96
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,859
[exhales]

97
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,945
Based on the chains,

98
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,490
I think it’s fairly safe to assume 
that you’re a Manipulator, aren’t you?

99
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,702
Well, I sure hope you won’t hold a grudge.

100
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,622
See, I was only following the orders 
the boss gave me.

101
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,375
“Test the applicants 
by attempting to kill them.”

102
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,128
But I honestly never expected 
to be exposed so quickly!

103
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,130
Well, I’m willing to bet

104
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,175
that the four of you together 
should be able to escape the mansion.

105
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,510
So best of luck.

106
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,970
‘Four of you”?

107
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,349
That makes it sound like 
there’s another one in the room…

108
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,101
[chuckles]

109
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,690
I imagine that was meant to be 
some sort of diversion,

110
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,149
but it was the wrong call.

111
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,778
Before we all succumb to paranoia,

112
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,782
I shall determine if there are 
any other infiltrators among us.

113
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,429
[incredulous snort]

114
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,643
[clenching teeth]

115
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,159
There you are.

116
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,122
You are the infiltrator.

117
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,878
[chain rattles]

118
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,175
That’s ridiculous!

119
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,052
What grounds are you basing that on?

120
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,804
Just ‘cause your chain started swinging?

121
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,681
[short person] It’s called dowsing.

122
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,350
Huh? And what’s that supposed to mean?

123
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,187
[short person] 
Dowsing was originally a technique

124
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,774
for locating water or other metals 
hidden beneath the ground.

125
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,027
But it was also used in divination.

126
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,237
I’ve even heard of the technique

127
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,531
being employed as a kind of lie detector.

128
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,784
Okay, maybe so,

129
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,452
but that still isn’t concrete proof

130
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,080
that I’m the infiltrator! 
It doesn’t prove anything!

131
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,749
Well, in any case, he’s probably right.

132
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,584
Your heart.

133
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,338
I noticed it began to pound 
as soon as he pointed his finger at you.

134
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,883
Of course, if you were innocent…

135
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,221
your heart rate would have increased 
much more gradually

136
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,766
due to the stress 
of being wrongly accused.

137
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,229
But your heartbeat 
sped up almost immediately

138
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,190
before gradually slowing 
back down again.

139
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,149
[light giggle]

140
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,320
The typical melody of a liar, 
no doubt about it.

141
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,573
-That’s true for both of you. 
-Hm?

142
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,950
[flexing knuckles]

143
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,827
Well, I’m convinced.

144
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,080
Both of them are saying it’s you.

145
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,041
That’s two accusations out of five.

146
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,793
Hold on! Wait a second!

147
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,087
That doesn’t necessarily make it true!

148
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,465
Maybe three out of five of us 
are the applicants

149
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,759
and those two are the infiltrators!

150
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:35,927
[Kurapika] Not so.

151
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,388
He is not one of the infiltrators.

152
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,889
Excuse me, but…

153
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,808
I think you mean ‘she’, not ‘he’.

154
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,602
I can vouch for you, too.

155
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,939
My point is that 
none of us can really trust either of you!

156
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,609
How do we know 
you’re not working together, huh?

157
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,569
[derisive snort]

158
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,864
[short person] Hmm...

159
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,034
Anyway… all we’re doing is wasting time.

160
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,078
We can stand around here all you like

161
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,872
but it isn’t going to get us anywhere.

162
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,039
[derisive snort]

163
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,583
That’s it, then.

164
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,544
I’ll have to settle this... myself.

165
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,098
“My hand makes a punch

166
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,893
and whatever I hit, 
will burst in flames...

167
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,144
-a bunch.” 
-Huh?

168
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,395
[all gasp]

169
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,524
This is my power.

170
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,651
The Wandering Haiku Poet!

171
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,166
Well, dammit.

172
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,960
It didn’t burn well. 
Guess it was a dud.

173
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,003
Huh?

174
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,129
Huh?

175
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,300
That was a haiku, if you couldn’t tell,

176
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,761
the prized literary art of my homeland.

177
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,763
Whatever I compose

178
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,014
becomes real.

179
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,849
[all] Huh?

180
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,393
So, there’s your explanation.

181
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,479
Back to the subject at hand.

182
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,027
“If you’re a liar

183
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,239
your painful death will be swift - 
in trial by fire.”

184
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,407
In other words...

185
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,577
anyone who lies to me will burn in hell.

186
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,912
[gulps]

187
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,582
My question is…

188
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,834
Are you an infiltrator?

189
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:32,877
No, I’m not.

190
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,463
What about you?

191
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,631
[short person] I am not.

192
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,634
And as for you?

193
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,386
Me neither.

194
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,182
And are you an infiltrator?

195
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,102
Yeah. I sure am.

196
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,981
[clenching teeth]

197
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,484
[poet] I’ll advise you to think carefully 
before you answer.

198
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,905
Are you one of the infiltrators?

199
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,908
Well? I’m waiting for an answer!

200
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,880
[heavy sigh]

201
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,091
My answer’s "Yes, I am."

202
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,682
That was impressive.

203
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,851
I’ll reward you with some information.

204
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,728
My name is Squala.

205
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,897
And while I may not have 
an official license,

206
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,235
I’m a Hunter whose skills 
fall into the Manipulator class.

207
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,113
I’ve used those abilities

208
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,033
to instruct something 
to follow a certain order.

209
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,577
It’s true you managed to unmask me,

210
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:51,122
but that doesn’t mean you’ll be able 
to escape this mansion alive.

211
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,167
[woman] What’s the ‘something’ 
and what was the order?

212
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,209
[derisive snort]

213
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,463
That wouldn’t be much of a test, 
if I just told you, now would it?

214
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,547
Imbecile.

215
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,800
[derisive snort] 
I’m not gonna talk even if you torture me.

216
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,344
Huh?

217
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,512
[grunts nervously]

218
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,223
[electricity buzzes]

219
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,101
[high-pitched voice] Wow!

220
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,943
This is my Nen ability…

221
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,487
Instant Lover.

222
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,114
I am also a Manipulator.

223
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,284
I can kiss absolutely anyone

224
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,119
and make them my slave.

225
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,829
[smitten panting]

226
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,749
M-- M-- Mistress!

227
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,002
[smitten panting]

228
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,798
[woman] Take that, and that, and that, 
and that, and that!

229
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,883
[Squala] [ecstatic cry] More!

230
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,053
Oh, please! Step on me more!

231
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,180
[woman] Now, answer my question!

232
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,934
What did you use your Nen on 
and what was your command?

233
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,061
Say it! C’mon!

234
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,522
If you don’t answer me, I’ll stop!

235
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,857
[Squala] [shocked cry] 
Don't stop! I’ll talk!

236
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,319
Yes! I’m just a lowly dog trainer!

237
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,862
[Kurapika] Such a…

238
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,823
[man] ...fearsome power…

239
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,617
[Squala] I’ll tell you everything!

240
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,121
I used my Nen on the dogs 
that run around this mansion!

241
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,414
For example…

242
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,666
the Maltese were told 
to nip at a target’s feet

243
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,418
to try and slow them down.

244
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,962
That’s when the Saint Bernard comes in!

245
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,507
It’s supposed to use its large body 
to smother them!

246
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,969
And at the exact same time, 
the Dobermans will rush in

247
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,929
and finish off the target for good!

248
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,557
If the target still escapes, 
the bulldogs will--

249
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,684
-[cries out in joyful pain] 
-[woman] That's enough!

250
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,727
Release the Nen you used on the dogs!

251
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,146
[Squala] Right away!

252
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,198
[growling]

253
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,701
So... the dog trainer

254
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,954
has been reduced down to a loyal pet, huh?

255
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,414
Oh, don’t say that.

256
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,916
The only reason I did it 
was to make him talk.

257
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,127
If I wanted a man as a pet,

258
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,087
I could do a whole lot better than him.

259
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,131
That reminds me,

260
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,133
I don’t think I ever caught your name.

261
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,342
Mine is Basho.

262
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,888
And as you saw just a few minutes ago, 
I’m a Conjurer.

263
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,556
My name is Baise.

264
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,932
I’m Melody.

265
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,602
It seems like you can hear heartbeats.

266
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,103
What category is that?

267
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,857
Oh, you’ll find out soon enough, I’m sure.

268
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,527
I see. Playing coy then, are we?

269
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,363
What about you?

270
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,369
I’d like to know your name 
if you don’t mind.

271
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,954
Would you please tell us?

272
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,539
I will not.

273
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,792
We don’t yet know 
if we will be working together.

274
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,795
Yes, he has a point.

275
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,340
We cleared the first stage 
by escaping the mansion,

276
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,592
but the real test has only just begun.

277
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,720
You're right, we need to locate 
one of the designated items

278
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,264
from the list we received, 
or we can’t get the job.

279
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,059
If we’re all after the same gig,

280
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,269
we’re bound to run into each other again.

281
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,237
[tall man] 
What’s your opinion of this group?

282
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,989
[Tocino] 
This one in particular looks promising.

283
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,908
At least…

284
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,409
more than him.

285
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,331
[smirks] It will be a while 
before I require him,

286
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,875
so just put him away for the time being.

287
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,254
I trust you can handle that, Squala.

288
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,005
Y-- Yes, sir.

289
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,564
[Kurapika] If I find one of the objects 
and earn the contract,

290
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,567
I will have passage 
to the Yorknew City auction.

291
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,695
Yes. I will attend!

292
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,738
After all,

293
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,242
the Phantom Troupe will undoubtedly 
be in attendance as well.

294
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,704
The band of thieves 
that slaughtered my fellow Kurta.

295
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,003
When we’re overcome with emotion,

296
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,297
our eyes burn a deep scarlet.

297
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,676
They were willing to kill 
in order to obtain those eyes,

298
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,221
considered one of the world’s 
seven most beautiful colors.

299
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,682
I will never forgive that act.

300
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,854
I will track them down…

301
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,064
and I will destroy them!

302
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,701
[bird screeching]

303
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,786
[typing]

304
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,263
[Milluki] Hm. So, this is Greed Island.

305
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,559
It’s starting to look like 
the memory card Kil found,

306
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,936
might actually be the real deal.

307
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,148
I figured that you could analyze the data

308
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,984
and reverse engineer the game itself, 
couldn’t you?

309
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,612
You bet I can.

310
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,782
I’ll strip down the code 
and clear the entire game.

311
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,825
I’ll put an end to the legend

312
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,037
and win 50 billion Jenny in the process.

313
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,538
Oh, right…

314
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,082
This was a trade.

315
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,252
I'm gonna have to tell Kil the URL 
for the Hunter-only website.

316
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,096
If I don’t hold up my end of the bargain,

317
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,558
that little brat might start talking 
about breaking my precious figures again.

318
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,075
[Gon] That’s it. Right over there, Killua!

319
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,120
Yeah. We’re almost there. Yorknew.

320
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,748
Can you believe we’re gonna 
get to see Kurapika and Leorio again?

321
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,375
I can hardly wait!

322
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,210
You’re kinda jumping the gun.

323
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,088
We’ve still got two weeks 
before we’re supposed to meet up.

324
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,631
Oh, right.

325
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,759
It’s been six months 
since we saw them last

326
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,094
and I’m getting excited!

327
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,223
And six months ago,

328
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,767
I never would have dreamed 
we’d come to Yorknew City.

329
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,102
Not for this, anyway.

330
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,104
[Leorio] Till next time…

331
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,981
[Kurapika] Yes. That will be…

332
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,735
[all] September 1st, in Yorknew City!

333
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,071
[Killua] The auction starts 
on September 1st,

334
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,490
so we need to gather as much info 
on Greed Island

335
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,242
as possible before then.

336
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,910
Mm-hmm. And if we’re lucky,

337
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,747
we might even find out 
some more information about Ging.

338
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,040
Well, he did leave you a memory card,

339
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,001
along with that recorded message.

340
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,794
There’s gotta be a connection.

341
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,671
But no matter what,

342
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,007
once my brother sends that URL to us,

343
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,508
we can check it out, right?

344
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,843
Mm-hmm.

345
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,223

346
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,148
[bird screeching]

347
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,326
This is it, Gon.

348
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,827
My brother sent the URL.

349
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,996
Wow, that's awesome! Let’s get started!

350
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,164
Yeah!

351
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,795
[narrator] Driven by their various goals,

352
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,048
Gon and Killua 
prepare for September 1st.

353
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,218
With the Yorknew City Auction 
mere weeks away,

354
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,720
there’s no telling what they’ll discover

355
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,430
when it begins.

356
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,184
[theme song playing]

357
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,210
[Gon] Coming up:

358
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,670
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

359
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,213
[both] Hunterpedia!

360
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,840
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

361
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,508
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

362
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,093
Today, we're introducing Melody!

363
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,303
She's a Music Hunter!

364
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,221
She reads your state of mind 
by your heartbeat.

365
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,307
So, her senses must be amazing!

366
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,058
Hey, Killua… You ate my chocolate?

367
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,643
-Nah. 
-Not convinced.

368
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,275
[Gon] Next time: 
"Gathering x Of x Heroes"!

369
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,611
Killua! Did you know I can tell fortunes?

370
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:24,820
[Killua] Really?

371
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,990
[Gon] Everybody who watched 
Hunter x Hunter today is really happy!
