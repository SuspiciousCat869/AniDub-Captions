[narrator] In the forest of the Dentora 
region of the Republic of Padokea

00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:14,431
lies a dormant volcano, 
measuring 3,722 meters high.

3
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,600
It is known as Kukuroo Mountain.

4
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:21,813
It is home to a family 
of famous assassins, The Zoldyck family.

5
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:27,319
Visitors arrive every day in hopes 
of catching a glimpse of the mansion,

6
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,112
which has never been seen.

7
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,659
It's one of this nation's 
most popular tourist attractions.

[theme song plays]

10
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:00,037
I have a message from Killua 
that he asked me to relay to you.

11
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,499
"Thank you for coming. 
I'm happy that you did.

12
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,753
But I can't see you right now.

00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,380
I'm sorry."

THE X ZOLDYCK X FAMILY

00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,143
[narrator] Gon, Kurapika and Leorio 
have advanced a little closer

16
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,229
to their destination, The Zoldyck Mansion.

17
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,899
Meanwhile...

18
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,908
[Killua] I'm home.

19
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,996
[scoffs] Not like anyone's around.

20
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,375
[Illumi] Welcome back.

21
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,087
So, how did work go today?

22
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,089
Just fine.

23
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,425
Does that mean 
you flawlessly dispatched your target?

24
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,347
Why ask? I'm sure you already know. 
You were spying, right?

25
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,640
[Illumi chuckles]

26
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,351
Mom is waiting to talk to you inside.

27
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,771
-Don't wanna see her. 
-I see.

28
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,612
[chuckles]

29
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,118
Huh?

30
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,600
[inhales, gasps]

31
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,398
Did you need something?

32
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,735
Oh, I wanted to say hello.

33
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,778
Are you new here?

34
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:02,409
I am. While you were away, I was hired on 
as an apprentice butler, Master Killua.

35
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,785
My name is Canary.

36
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,621
-Oh, hey. You can have this. 
-No, thanks.

37
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,291
But I do appreciate the gesture, 
Master Killua.

38
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,294
You don't have to be so formal. 
Just call me Killua.

39
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,881
I'm afraid I can't do that. 
You are my employer,

40
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,216
and I am just a humble employee.

41
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,762
Wow. That's pretty stupid.

42
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,351
[chuckles]

43
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,771
[Killua] You were using the Silent Gait, 
weren't you?

44
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,980
The Silent Gait?

45
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,777
The one where you move silently, 
so you're completely undetectable.

46
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,695
In the Zoldyck family,

47
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,490
it's one of the first techniques 
that we ever learn.

48
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,035
-Perfect for assassination. 
-I didn't realize.

49
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,205
I suppose it's one of the many techniques 
I learned

50
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,457
while I was growing up in Meteor City.

51
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,918
Meteor City?

52
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,379
Yes. That's where I was born.

53
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,509
A city that has been erased 
from this world.

54
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,720
Huh? Well, never heard of it.

55
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,349
Where I come from, 
you're allowed to dump anything there.

56
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,061
Which sort of explains 
why so many members of the Mafia

57
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,146
and the Phantom Troupe come from there.

58
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,690
I'd like to see it one of these days.

59
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,611
When you do, I'd be happy to serve 
as your guide. [chuckles]

60
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,155
[chuckles]

61
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,538
You know the Rhythm Echo?

62
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,709
-The Rhythm Echo? What is that? 
-A technique using the Silent Gait.

63
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,046
[gasps]

64
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,805
If you just keep moving 
at a particular rhythm,

65
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,056
it makes afterimages.

66
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,642
I see what you mean. Hm?

67
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,189
It seems we have intruders. 
Quite a few of them, in fact.

68
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,316
Don't worry. Mike can handle it.

69
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,320
Mike is restrained today. 
Those are the orders I was given.

70
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,074
They wish to test my abilities, 
so I must comply.

71
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,201
Hmm...

72
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,709
We'll split up here 
and keep searching the mountain

73
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,794
until we find their mansion. Huh?

74
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,884
Please leave, right now.

75
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,303
And just who the hell are you?

76
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:31,892
[Canary] Who I am is none of your concern. 
You're trespassing on private property.

77
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,186
I can't allow you to pass 
without permission.

78
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,399
Do you really think 
a brat like you can stop us?

79
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,028
Look, you obviously don't stand a chance.

80
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,657
Stand aside and we'll spare your life. 
How's that for a deal?

81
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,370
Take one step past this line, 
and I'll remove you by force.

82
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,914
What was that?

83
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,627
Leave this one to us, boss. 
No reason to get your hands dirty.

84
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,670
-Let's go! 
-Yeah!

85
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,756
You messed with the wrong crew!

without even breaking a sweat.

Are you a member of the Zoldyck family?

100
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,230
Certainly not. 
I am merely an apprentice butler.

101
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,401
With your limited abilities, 
you're not even a match for the butlers,

102

not to mention the Zoldyck family.

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,093
Should I ask Mama 
to have the three of them--

163
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,761
[crashing]

164
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,055
[Killua] Milluki...

165
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,935
[echoes] If you so much as touch them, 
I'll kill you.

166
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,026
I'm sorry. How rude of me.

167
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:01,406
I am Killua's mother, you see, 
and this is Kalluto.

168
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,329
Why can't Killua come to see us? 
Where is he?

169
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,957
In solitary confinement.

170
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,500
Wait, what?

171
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,422
Before he ran away from home, 
Killua stabbed his brother, and me.

172
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,632
Yes, that's what he told us.

173
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:24,012
And then, because he regretted 
what he had done,

174
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,888
our Killua returned to us,

175
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,892
and entered solitary confinement, 
voluntarily.

176
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,771
In any case, we don't know 
when he will choose to leave.

177
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,651
[gasps] What? What is happening? 
What are you doing, Father?

178
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,697
Please, don't do anything hasty! 
He's only just returned!

179
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,493
-[Milluki] Huh? 
-[Zeno] I'm coming in.

180
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:52,999
ONE KILL A DAY

181
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,002
I believe that'll do for now. Thank you.

182
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,673
But Grandpa Zeno, 
he isn't even sorry, not one bit!

183
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,508
[Zeno] Yes, I'm aware of that.

184
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,304
You may go now, Kil.

185
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,722
[Killua] Okay.

186
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,099
[grunts]

187
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,394
-[grunts] 
-Huh?

188
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:21,694
Man, that really hurt. 
Hey, Milluki, you're right. I'm not sorry,

189
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,654
but I do feel bad.

190
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,657
That's why I let you slap me around 
for a little while.

191
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,117
[Milluki] What was that?

192
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,372
Oh, Kil, Silva would like to see you now.

193
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,207
Dad said that?

194
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,793
Okay, then.

195
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,506
[Milluki grumbles]

196
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,716
Damn it, Grandpa!

197
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,386
Why do you have to go 
and spoil him all the time?

198
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,097
That's why he's become such a little punk!

199
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,348
[gasps]

200
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,102
Because Killua is special, Mil.

201
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,982
Tell me, in your opinion, 
what do you think of Kil's potential?

202
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,194
-It's incredible, sure. 
-Yes, go on.

203
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,113
I think it's safe to say

204
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,574
he's the most talented Zoldyck 
in the history of our family, right?

205
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,911
Even Mama thinks so, and I have to agree.

206
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,664
Very good assessments.

207
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:19,210
But there's just no way he'll ever be 
a good assassin. He's way too erratic.

208
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,420
[Zeno] Erratic?

209
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,382
A kid who wants to go and make friends 
could never lead the Zoldyck family.

210
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,970
In the end, he's too weak. 
Well, mentally, at least.

211
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,596
Hmm...

212
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,811
-[Zeno] Yes, that is true. 
-[Milluki] Right? Take me, for example.

213
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,064
I'll kill anyone you want me to, 
no questions asked.

214
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:44,861
Oh, I almost forgot! 
My newest bomb is a real winner, Grandpa!

215
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,905
It's tiny enough that I can attach it 
to a female mosquito,

216
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,451
and I rigged it to explode 
whenever it sucks on a target's blood.

217
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,205
But the problem is that mosquitos 
aren't great for precision targeting.

218
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,374
-Mil? 
-What?

219
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,421
You're a sharp boy, but that doesn't mean 
you're not an idiot, too.

220
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,925
Oh, why must Father be this way?

221
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,469
[sighs]

222
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,556
I'm afraid that something has come up. 
Farewell.

223
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,475
Wait! Hold on!

224
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,563
It's just that we'll be staying in town 
for a little while.

225
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,940
Please let Killua know.

226
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,111
Yes, very well. I'll be sure to tell him. 
Good day.

227
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,243
Who are all of you? Tell me.

228
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,662
We're all friends with Killua.

229
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,540
You're his friends?

230
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,461
[Kikyo] Kalluto! What are you doing? 
Come along this instant!

231
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,379
Coming! Sorry, Mother.

232
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,346
It goes without saying, 
but these people really creep me out.

233
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,849
And I bet they were lying about 
Killua not wanting to see us.

234
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:02,146
Gon, we can't go back there just yet. 
Maybe we should tail those two.

235
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,525
Yeah, but if we go follow them,

236
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,362
I'm worried that it would mean 
a whole lot of trouble for her later on.

237
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,072
Yeah. Good point.

238
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,368
I will take you to the butler's quarters.

239
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,872
There is a phone 
that connects directly to the mansion.

240
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,793
If Master Zeno answers it, he might... 
[grunts]

241
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,253
Who's Master Zeno?

242
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,964
He is Master Killua's grandfather.

243
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,762
[snorting]

244
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:37,807
So, Kil...

245
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,977
I hear you've made some friends.

246
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,104
[Killua] Yeah.

247
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,065
And what are they like?

248
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,025
"What are they like?"

249
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,653
They're a lot of fun to be with.

250
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,363
I see.

251
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,993
How was the Hunter Exam?

252
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,162
Um, it was easy.

253
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,294
-Sit over here by me, Kil. 
-[Killua gasps]

254
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,797
I want to hear all about it.

255
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,299
[gasps]

256
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:17,096
Your exam experiences, 
who you met, how you felt.

257
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,851
You can tell me anything, and everything.

258
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:23,769
'kay.

259
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,147
[rustling]

260
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,152
I can't believe this. 
Father didn't even ask me!

261
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,865
And now, Kil has gone off 
to lark about with Papa!

262
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,493
[panting] Unforgivable!

263
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,748
[Killua] 
And then, you know what Gon said to him?

264
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,961
He didn't want his legs cut off, 
but he didn't want to surrender either!

265
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,339
[both chuckling]

266
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,634
-He's so selfish. 
-He's interesting, all right!

267
00:18:55,718 --> 00:19:00,264
And then, Gon's opponent pointed a blade 
at his forehead, and that's when Gon--

268
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,307
Kil.

269
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,600
[gasps]

270
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,978
Do you want to see your friends?

271
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,525
No need to hold back. Be honest.

272
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,779
Thinking back... [sighs]

273
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:19,116
...you and I have never really had 
a father-son chat before.

274
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,954
I was raised by my parents 
to be an assassin.

275
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,667
And I raised you the same way.

276
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,797
But you and I are different,

277
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,676
and it took you leaving home 
for me to realize that.

278
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,886
Oh...

279
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:45,101
You are indeed my son, 
and still, a person all your own.

280
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,353
Live your life.

281
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,650
Remember, you can come home 
if you get tired, so...

282
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,153
I'll ask you again.

283
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,989
Do you want to see your friends?

284
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,908
Mm-hm.

285
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,910
Very well.

286
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,707
You're free to go now. But Kil...

287
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,878
Promise me one thing.

288
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,424
That you will never betray your friends.

289
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,217
Got that?

290
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,224
I'll never betray them. I swear.

291
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:36,235
[Kikyo] Kil? It's too late. 
Those three have already left.

292
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,903
Return to your cell.

293
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,323
No way. I'm leaving.

294
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,075
[screams] Kil!

295
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,494
Oh...

296
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,831
Step aside.

297
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,876
[gasps]

298
00:20:54,462 --> 00:21:01,051
[Kikyo chuckling] Oh, Kil. 
What a splendid icy glare you have!

299
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,521
[Kikyo] What in the hell were you 
thinking? Kil finally came home!

300
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,857
[Silva] 
Let the boy do what he wants for now.

301
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,359
You're mad! Listen to yourself!

302
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:21,822
If Kil is to be head of the family, 
this stage is absolutely critical!

303
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,741
So you know what's at stake.

304
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,787
Good. Then stop your griping 
and keep your mouth shut!

305
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:34,126
[cackling] Don't worry, 
he'll come back home one day.

306
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,547
After all, he is my son.

307
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,760
[narrator] Killua has been set free,

308
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:47,473
but Silva confidently declares 
that he will return as an assassin.

309
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,019
Meanwhile, Gon and company 
head to the butler's quarters.

310
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:56,190
Whether they will make contact with Killua 
remains to be seen.

311
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,655
[theme music plays]

312
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,112
[Gon] Next time. 
"Can't See if You're Blind."

313
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,490
Eye for an eye. Eye for a tooth?

314
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,242
[Killua] That's tooth for a tooth!
