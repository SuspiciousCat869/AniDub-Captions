Uncharted frontiers.

The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words…

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,195
are called…

Hunters.

12

[Gon] Now!

13
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,542
I did it!

14
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,669
I figured it out!

15
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,755
I’ve just gotta go for the target

Gon has mastered the technique

21
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,607
that will be instrumental 
in the capture of his target.

Well… I guess

25
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,539
I have been casting my fishing rod 
for two straight days.

26
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,462
Still all that practice 
has really paid off.

27
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,381
Now when a bird swoops down on a fish,

28
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,341
I can snag it every time.

29
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,094
If I use it the right way,

30
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,513
I’ll be able to steal Hisoka’s badge.

31
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,641
All that’s left now is to find him!

[grunts in pain]

33
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,192
But how am I supposed 
to find Hisoka, anyway?

34
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,529
I guess I’ll just have to walk around

35
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,781
and trust my instincts to guide me.

36
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,910
What the--?

37
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,538
Why are they all gathering around me 
like that?

38
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:30,877
Hm...

39
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,801
I think these butterflies

40
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,262
are attracted to the smell of blood.

41
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,022
[walkie-talkie beeping]

42
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,235
[Gitarrackur] Have you taken 
your target’s badge, Hisoka?

43
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,987
[Hisoka] No, not yet.

44
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,408
You don’t even know 
who your target is yet, do you?

45
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,784
[Hisoka] No.

46
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,078
[Gitarrackur] Want me to tell you?

47
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,414
[Hisoka] No. It doesn’t matter.

48
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,879
I’ll just hunt down three others.

49
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,311
[Gon] If I remember right, 
Hisoka was injured back at the tower.

50
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,480
If this works,

51
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,982
these butterflies 
might lead me right to him

52
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,672
It’s the guy who got shot with the arrow.

It’s been two days,

67
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,986

[Tonpa] Whoa, hold on!

71
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,161
It’s just me, okay?

72
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,329
[Leorio] Tonpa!

73
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,914
So, I’m your target.

74
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,249
[Tonpa] Hey, wait a minute! Just relax!

75
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,085
I promise you’re not my target, all right?

76
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,503
Then prove it.

77
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,422
Right. Uh...

78
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,132
See?

79
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,344
Hmm...

[relieved sigh]

81
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,683
I guess it’s a good thing 
I didn’t throw it away, huh?

82
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,144
There’s no point 
in going after just anyone.

83
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,647
That’s a huge waste of time and energy.

84
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait…

85
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,945
Don’t tell me. 
I’m not your target… am I?

86
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,113
Unfortunately, you’re not.

87
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,992
[Tonpa] Two-forty-six.

88
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,119
Ponzu, huh?

89
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,789
[gasps] 
Wait, are you saying you know who that is?

90
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,832
Are you saying you didn’t?

91
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,293
Oh, well, see, uh…

92
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,878
I wouldn’t put it like that.

93
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,589
I just didn’t have the chance 
to figure it out yet.

94

[smirks]

95
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,510
Do you want me to fill you in?

96
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,719
What?

97
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,680
[Tonpa] 
What they look like, their weapons,

98
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,349
their special abilities, 
and their weaknesses?

99
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,768
I will.

100
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,687
But I have one condition.

101
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,022
[rumbling]

102
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,273
Hm?

103
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,694
[Tonpa] I ate some nuts 
that aren’t really agreeing with me.

104
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,362
Nuts, you say?

105
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,240
To be honest, 
I can barely stand right now.

106
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,575
But you are pre-med, aren’t you?

107
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,869
Do you happen to have 
any medicine on hand?

108
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,204
[upset tummy groan]

109
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,289
[Leorio] Whoa! Don’t crap your pants.

110
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,005
Antidiarrheals and pretty much 
all the other basics.

111
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,507
That’s great! Thank you!

112
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,509
-Huh? 
-But first, the info.

113
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,470
Fine. If you insist.

114
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,226
[Tonpa] For starters, Ponzu’s a woman.

115
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,436
Go on…

116
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,524
[Tonpa] As far as I know, 
out of the 24 applicants who are left,

117
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:48,319
there are only five of them who use 
some sort of chemical weapons.

118
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,363
Ponzu is one of ‘em.

119
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,909
That’s her…

120
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,371
She happens to specialize 
in all sorts of toxins,

121
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,914
so you’ll want to be careful.

122
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,167
However, her strategy’s simple.

123
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,835
She just lies in wait.

124
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,836
[Leorio] She does?

125
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,965
She sets a trap and waits patiently 
for her target to wander into it.

126
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,050
I see…

127
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,719
And you don’t have to worry 
about anything else.

128
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,679
She’s not all that daunting herself,

129
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,266
so get her into an actual fight 
and you’re guaranteed to win.

130
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,477
-[stomach rumbling] 
-[Tonpa groans]

131
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,229
[Tonpa] 
Still, if you find her, watch your step.

132
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,398
And remember to stay downwind.

133
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,859
She knows someone’s targeting her,

134
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,237
so it’s not like you can rely 
on the element of surprise.

135
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,531
-[stomach rumbling] 
-[grunts]

136
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,366
And that’s pretty much it.

137
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,411
Now gimme that medicine!

138
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,412
[Leorio] Okay.

139
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,873
But I need you to take a step back.

140
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,417
[groans] Just hurry!

141
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,878
I-- I can’t hold it in!

142

-[rustling] 
-[gasps]

143
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,473
Dammit!

00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,937
[Sommy chuckles]

145
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,607
Looks like I got your badge. Heh.

146
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,860
I knew you were keeping it 
in your briefcase.

147
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,446
Tonpa! You’re working together?

148
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,531
[Tonpa] You bet.

149
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,324
And I didn’t need your medicine.

150
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,992
I’ve got my own.

151
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,702
As you might’ve guessed,

152
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,664
you really were my target this whole time.

153
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,209
But the card you just showed me...

154
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,336
Oh. That one’s my target.

155
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,505
And this one is Tonpa’s.

156
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,966
We traded for this little deception.

157
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,677
I just can’t believe you fell for it!

158
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,972
So, there you have it!

159
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,643
[yells] Damn you!

160
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,645
You're gonna pay for this!

161
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,063
[Tonpa] Whoops! [chuckles]

162
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,358
Tonpa! Let’s meet at the rendezvous point!

163
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,526
[Tonpa] Gotcha!

164
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,991
[Leorio] Stop right there!

165
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,743
You’re dead, ya hear me?

166
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,537
Why are you chasing me?

167
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,581
I’m not the one who’s got your badge!

168
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,999
Shut your trap!

169
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,292
You’re kidding me.

170
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,336
You still don’t get it, do ya, rookie? 
That’s a shame.

171
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,880
What did you say?

172
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,923
It’s not our fault you got duped, buddy!

173
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,466
[growling]

174
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,846
Besides, forming alliances 
is a great way to pass the Exam!

175
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,140
I can accept the latter

176
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,516
but never the former.

177
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,644

179
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,109
Deception is the fault of the deceiver!

180
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,652
Kurapika!

181
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,406
Leorio. Would you like to team up?

188
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,479
[Leorio] Hey!

189
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,981
Give me back my damn badge!

190
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,566
[laughing]

00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,152

[squealing]

195
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,796
[Leorio] Okay!

196
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,840
I got my badge back safe and sound!

197
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,262
We have the badges 
for numbers 16 and 118, as well.

198
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,099
So, hey. It was pretty lucky 
that Tonpa was your target.

199
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,892
You saved me back there.

200
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,978
[Kurapika] Please, no thanks necessary.

201
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,605
I didn’t want Tonpa to realize I was there

202
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,817
which is why I hid 
while you were ambushed from behind.

203
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,901
What?

204
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,278
[Kurapika] In my defense,

205
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,613
I had to be sure 
you could handle an attack like that.

206
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,825
Otherwise, what use 
would you be to me as a partner?

207
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,078
You qualified, though barely.

208
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,830
[Leorio] You are so full of it…

209
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,707
Either way,

210
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,751
I admit, it’s a lot easier 
when you join forces.

211
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,838
The next four days, let’s stick together.

212
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,464
All right.

213
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,093
Well, you got your target’s badge, 
so that’s a good start.

214
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,054
Add it to your own 
and that’s a total of six points.

215
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,348
That’s assuming he doesn’t take it back.

216
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:32,145
And number 118's badge is only worth 
one more point for either of us.

217
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,896
[Leorio] True.

218
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,606
But it might still come in handy.

219
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,943
All right. We need to find your target.

220
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,696
Number 246. Ponzu, right?

221
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,866
We need to stay alert.

222
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,784
[Kurapika] You’re telling me that?

223
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,870
[Leorio] Right, point taken.

224
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,987
[sighs]

225
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,366
You’ve been following me since we started.

226
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,701
It’s pretty damn obvious.

227
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,454
You wanna play?

228
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,414
Come on out.

229
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,388
[sighs]

230
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,703
Well? Show yourself.

231
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,205
Hm?

232
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,707
I know you’re there.

233
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,626
Did he notice me?

234
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,465
If you won’t come out, 
I suppose I’ll have to come to you.

235
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,515
[Gon] This is it.

236
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,269
It’s all or nothing.

237
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:44,944
Huh?

238
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,988
When did he--

239
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,787
[groans quietly]

240
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,958
I seek a bout with you.

241
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,502
You’ll die.

242
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,045
[grunts]

243
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,761
Now’s my chance!

244
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,521
Ha!

00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,607
[roars]

246
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,819
[Gon] It’s about to happen…

247
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,031
I’ve just got to wait 
‘til he goes for the kill!

248
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,949
[roaring]

249

[Goz grunting]

250
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,417
Why?

251
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,505
Why isn’t Hisoka fighting back?

252
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,800
[loud roar]

253
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,683
[Goz panting]

254
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,436
I don’t get it…

255
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,356
Why... won’t you fight?

256
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,400
I only need to evade

257
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,569
and you’ll die eventually, yes?

258
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,612
[gasps]

259
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,412
I can tell by 
the large swarm of Hemotropic butterflies

260
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,748
that your wounds are quite serious.

261
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,209
[groans]

262
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,129
[Hisoka] 
Someone has already wounded you. Correct?

263
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,759
I understand wanting to end your life 
fighting as a warrior.

264
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,721
[Goz] If that’s true… 
and you really do understand...

265
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,223
then why?

266
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,686
Why do you refuse to fight me 
and grant me the death I desire?

267
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,440
Because I have no interest in the dead.

268
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,817
[Goz] Wait, what?

269
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,653
But I’m-- I’m not--

270
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,947
[Hisoka] 
Do you know how I know you’re dead?

271
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,949
Your eyes.

272
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,701
[Goz groans]

273
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,665
Bye-bye.

274
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,294

[gasps]

278
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,442
[Gitarrackur] Sorry.

279
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,986
I was careless and he got away.

280
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,946
[Hisoka] Don’t lie to me.

281
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:38,326
He probably begged you to grant him 
a last request and you relented.

282
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,036
Am I right?

283
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,456
[Gitarrackur] 
Well, I may have felt sorry for the man.

284
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,916
He was going to die anyway.

285
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:50,129
You really need to stop pitying those 
who serve no purpose.

286
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,506
But you’re guilty of that yourself.

287
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,509
You’ve walked away from opponents 
before finishing them.

288
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,803
[Hisoka] I do have standards.

289
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,223
Why waste time on people 
who are utterly useless?

290
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,436
I only spare those 
whose premature deaths would be a waste.

291
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,730
Well? What about his badge?

292
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,690
Oh, I already took it.

293
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,692
I have six points now,

294
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,444
so I don’t really need this one.

295
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,779
Want it?

296
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,615
[Hisoka] Whose is this?

297
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,701
[Gitarrackur] It belonged to someone 
who tried to snipe me.

298
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,163
That pissed me off, and so...

299
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,290
well, I killed ‘em.

300
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,630
Well.

301
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,939
Hmm... That’s always so much fun to watch.

302
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,150
[Gitarrackur] 
It does take its toll on me, you know.

303
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,740
Ah. That’s much better.

304
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,336
Well, I’m gonna sleep until the deadline.

305
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,587
Best of luck.

306
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,450
It got dark really quick.

307
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,744
We shouldn’t let our guard down.

308
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,872
Nightfall is the best time for an ambush.

309
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,206
I know, I know.

310
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,421
[Hisoka] Only two points left to go.

311
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,300
I guess I’d better start hunting.

312
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,472
This is it!

313
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:29,747
Hmm...

314
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,341
Hm...

315
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,927
Look who it is.

316
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,348
[narrator] 
Hisoka targets Kurapika and Leorio,

317
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,601
unaware that Gon is after his badge.

318
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,648
Four days remain 
before the end of the Fourth Phase.

319
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,614
[Gon] Next time: 
"Defeat x and x Disgrace"!

320
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,075
-Let’s shake hands! 
-[Hisoka] With a nice, firm grip.
