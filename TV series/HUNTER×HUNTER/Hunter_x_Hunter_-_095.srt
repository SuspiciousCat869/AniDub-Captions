The test was only intended

and would not enter the ngl,

are full-grown tigers now,

and the best thing
about full-grown tigers

is they can take care

Do you think gon is, too?

I must admit I was impressed
by the way he moved back there,

show any fire since then.

He’s improved with training,

any real focus.

he’s consistently inconsistent.

too seriously unless he has to.

Announcer: The question
that’s on everyone’s mind

247
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:36,404
is what these sudden changes
in east gorteau

248
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,938
could possibly mean.

249
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,940
Diego has personally invited

250
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:43,944
all the citizens in the country
to the capital city of peijing

251
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,013
to celebrate the nation’s
founding in just ten days.

252
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,917
Commentator: Yes, that’s right.
There have been times

253
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,653
when all citizens
were invited to participate,

254
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,455
but I can honestly say
that we’ve never seen

255
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:59,460
anything on this scale,
where practically every citizen,

256
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,496
from infants to the infirm,
have all been summoned

257
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,466
for a celebration
spanning three whole days.

258
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,669
i believe
it’s rather safe to assume

259
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,672
that this time around,
the goal must be different.

believe the goal might be?

261
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,378

he announced his successor

262
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,048
and abdication simultaneously,

263
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,483
it would send
a very powerful message.

264
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:26,053
Still, I find it hard to imagine

265
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:30,090
that Diego would voluntarily
relinquish his power.

266
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,627
There may be another matter this
is meant to draw attention from,

267

that the celebration

will most certainly die,
