this time, are they?

160
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,190
Applicant #4: No, they are not.

161
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,958
It’s been over 10 years,

162
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,126
and not a single player
has cleared the game,

163
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,896
and as you know, new players
can’t start "greed island"

164
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,198
as long as the old ones
are still alive.

165
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,901
So of course
what that really means

166
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,969
is they have to save a few spots

167
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,439
just in case
any extraordinary players pop up

168
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,175
and want to join in
on the action.

169
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,410
And if I had to hazard a guess,

170
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,414
they’ll only add about 20 or so
in this round.

171
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,417
Personally i’d say
that the ones in line

172
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,988
or the ones standing nearby
have no shot whatsoever.

173
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,924
Anybody worthwhile
either stood up and got in line

174
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,927
just as soon as possible
or figured out the trick

175

what was going on?

but it was only a hunch.

180

it was only natural.

181

who’s here, don’t they?

182
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,146
And if that’s the case,

183
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,616
what does it matter
if we get in line or not?

Yeah, that’s pretty impressive.
Not many people

like you just did.

more dangerous the path,

Woman: Correct.

376
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,632
More specifically,
you must obtain 100 items

377
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,501
and, after transforming them,
put them in your binder.

If you obtain a sword,
for example

00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:29,109
it will instantly
transform into a card.

you must first use

you can never transform it
into a card again.

387
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,291
If you want
the card version of the item,

388
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,127
you must once again acquire it.

are two other cases

where an item
can’t become a card.

393
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:57,805
In the first of those two cases,

394
00:18:57,838 --> 00:19:01,141
you reach the item’s
maximum conversion limit.

Gon: Wait.
Card conversion limit?

Every item in this game

has a limit to the number
of times it can be converted.

398
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:14,287
For instance, if an item
has a conversion limit of three

399
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,123
and there are
three other players

400
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,558
who have converted
that item into a card already,

401
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,827
then that’s it.

402

The fourth player
who obtains said item

403
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,798
cannot change it into a card.
