And if you refuse to accept
my offer, take my head

Come closer,

and I will end you
with a single strike.

171

so move.

Now move.

Knov: At the moment,

190
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,619
we have the capital
completely surrounded.

191
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,589
The king’s well-being is
of the utmost priority to them,

192
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,724
so they wouldn’t go
too far from his side.

193

Morel: Then what’s going on?

194
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,295
Knov: My assumption would be

195
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,263
that some threat
much greater than us

196
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:07,301
has befallen the royal guard and
perhaps even the king himself.

197

Morel: Then that means
that this is it, huh,

199

to infiltrate the palace.

Morel: But it might be
a trap, right?

203
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,119
Knov: It shouldn’t be.

204
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:29,156
They wouldn’t use any tactic
that might endanger their king.

205
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,025
Morel: They would if the king
had ordered it, wouldn’t they?

206
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,128
Knov: I suppose so,

207
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,064
but regardless,
they’ve already retracted

radar detection.

While we can, we have to get
as close as possible.

If we want this plan to succeed,

00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,645
I must create an exit
near the palace.

212

We’ll have to take this risk
sooner or later.

Okay, i’ve found them.

we’re going to switch
to the man who carries the pipe.

seven-nine-one, shinobi.

Komugi: Soldier, two-three-one.

227
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,962
Shaiapouf: So how long
will the procedure take?

228
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,497
Neferpitou: Hmm.

229
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,167
I’d say about two or three hours
to fix it completely.

230
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,568
Neferpitou: And you can’t use

231
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:24,238
your puppets or en
during that time?

232
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:28,175
Neferpitou: Mm, this ability
takes an awful lot of nen, meow.

233
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,945
Neferpitou: Since it requires
quite a bit of your energy

234
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,347
and focus to accomplish,

235
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,184
I will serve as lookout
during the procedure,

236
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:40,921
though my en isn’t nearly
as effective as yours.

237
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,290
either way,
this is an important task

238
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,059
I cannot trust to anyone else.

239
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,605
Knov: There’s no evidence
they’re using en.

240
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:03,477
Luckily the rain
limits visibility.

241
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,914
The sun will set soon.

242
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,219
Once it’s dark, I will
become one with the night,

243
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,222
making it easier
to pick out enemy aura.

244
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,158
Be patient.

245
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,162
We need an exit near the palace,

246
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:24,131
but if i’m spotted,
it’s all over.

247
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,169
While I can freely
come and go as I please,

248
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,972
shoot and the others
can only use the exit to leave

249
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,573
once they enter the mansion.

250
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,578
If the enemy prepares
an ambush by the exit,

251
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,980
we’re done for.

252
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:55,629
I need to prepare three exits--
near, far, and in the middle.

253
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,465
We’ll need several options
spread throughout the palace

254
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:01,035
if this is going to work.

255
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:05,906
Then i’ll make several clusters
of entrances far away.

256
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:09,309
that will help us
to keep a close eye on things.

257
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,213
When the time comes,

258
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,116
we’ll decide which room
would make the best waypoint,

259
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,418
the one nearest the exit,
farthest away,

or the one in between.

261
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,924
Once that has been determined,
we’ll act.

262

From the enemy’s perspective,

263
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,530
we’ll seem to appear
before their very eyes.

264
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,232
We must use that opening

265
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,568
to separate the king
from his guards.

266

still has to be
on the palace grounds,

or it won’t be
of any use to us at all.

any approach
will be all but impossible.
