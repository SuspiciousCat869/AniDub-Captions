1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,754
[Uvogin] You tell the boss…

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,633
I’m not leaving.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:08,842
I can’t go back

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,803
until I settle the score 
with that damn chain user!

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,480
[theme song playing]

6
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:37,556
CHASING x AND x WAITING

7
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,645
[narrator] Hisoka, 
who joined the Phantom Troupe,

8
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,356
for a chance to fight the leader, Chrollo,

9
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,234
has proposed a partnership with Kurapika,

10
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,570
who is seeking revenge on the group.

11
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,281
[Hisoka] What are you going to do?

12
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,283
Will you work with me?

13
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,368
Or would you rather…

14
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,329
fight alone?

15
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,084
[phone ringing]

16
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,505
Go ahead.

17
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:14,718
Yes, it’s me.

18
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,303
[Melody] Terrible news.

19
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,513
The big man we captured has escaped.

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,641
Escaped? All on his own?

21
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,017
[Melody] No.

22
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,520
Some Phantom Troupe members 
disguised themselves as Mafia henchmen

23
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,772
and came for him.

24
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,565
[Kurapika] And our leader?

25
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,733
Not sure.

26
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,610
We haven’t been able to reach him.

27
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:32,861
[gasps]

28
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,613
[Melody] We’re moving to plan B.

29
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,782
Get back here as soon as possible.

30
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,033
Understood.

31
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,206
[Kurapika] Hisoka, 
I have a question for you.

32
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,376
Where can I find the Scarlet Eyes?

33
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:51,004
[Hisoka] Unfortunately, 
that happened before I joined.

34
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,926
The Boss sells every item 
after reveling in the spoils for a bit.

35
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,970
I assume the Scarlet Eyes 
were no exception.

36
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,556
And that’s all 
I can tell you on the matter.

37
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,726
But keep this in mind:

38
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,814
A spider will keep going 
until you crush its head.

39
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,567
I suggested we form an alliance,

40
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,986
but not that we fight side by side.

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,281
Merely the give and take 
of certain information.

42
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,035
And if it ceases to benefit us,

43
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,330
there is no further obligation 
to cooperate.

44
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,790
Simple enough?

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,211
What do you say?

46
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,464
[Kurapika] I’ll be back here 
at the same time tomorrow.

47
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,517
So? What do we do now?

48
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,311
Our leader’s probably dead already.

49
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,897
And we still 
haven’t completed the mission…

50
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,025
We should report this to the boss, 
don’t you think?

51
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,237
That little girl is our boss in name only.

52
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,115
[Squala] Yeah, it was somebody else 
who hired us.

53
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,451
Light Nostrade.

54
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,910
Her father.

55
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,663
Our orders come directly from him.

56
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,040
The leader just relayed them to us.

57
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,961
And he was the only one 
who knew how to contact him.

58
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,839
We have no choice.

59
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,924
We have to report this to the boss.

60
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,804
Boss... Boss.

61
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,351
[stirring groan]

62
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,687
[Neon] Hold on, what time is it?

63
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,355
[Kurapika] It’s two in the morning.

64
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,565
[gasps in shock]

65
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,317
Oh, no! What about the auction?!

66
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,860
[Kurapika] It's been called off.

67
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,111
Huh?

68
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,071
Completely? Why? What for?

69
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,325
There was a gang of thieves 
who attacked the auction hall.

70
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,534
Huh?

71
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:49,331
[Kurapika] Baise, Ivlenkov, and Tocino 
lost their lives in the incident.

72
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,415
Huh?

73
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,919
[Squala] We can’t reach the leader, 
so he might also be…

74
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,212
No way…

75
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,214
But what about the mummy?

76
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,758
Was it really stolen?

77
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,885
I wanted it so much…

78
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,512
-[Kurapika exhales] 
-[Squala grunts]

79
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,598
Seems the Mafia moved the merchandise 
to a safe location.

80
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,601
[light giggle] That's great! 
When’s the next one?

81
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,478
There’s another auction soon, right?

82
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,979
[Kurapika] We don't know yet.

83
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,648
You don’t? But why not?

84
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,107
In any case,

85
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,902
the leader handled all communication 
with your father.

86
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,196
So, I’m afraid we don’t know anything.

87
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,282
And we can’t act 
until we’ve received his orders.

88
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,993
[Neon] Don’t ask me. I have no idea.

89
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,205
But here, just ask daddy.

90
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,457
I’ve got his number 
saved here in my phone.

91
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,710
Squala. You make the call.

92
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,546
[gasps] Why do I have to?

93
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,674
You’re the most experienced 
and we need a new leader.

94
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,884
-So, it should be you 
-Oh no!

95
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,469
That’s completely out of the question!

96
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,179
I’m just not leader material.

97
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,724
Then perhaps we should put it 
to a vote to be fair.

98
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,727
We need to make the call 
as soon as possible.

99
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,814
And my vote’s for Kurapika.

100
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,817
He’s the one who captured the bandit,

101
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,111
and he’s shown excellent judgment.

102
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,447
I believe he would make 
the most effective leader.

103
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,907
Works for me.

104
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,784
I vote for Kurapika, too.

105
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,620
That’s that.

106
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,539
So, you make the call.

107
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,876
Very well.

108
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,963
Then as interim leader, 
I’ll call Mr. Nostrade.

109
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,172
But only...

110
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,551
until we can confirm 
what’s really become of Dalzollene.

111
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,263
Further choices will be made 
by Mr. Nostrade.

112
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,852
I didn’t expect this to happen so soon…

113
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,607
It would be inappropriate for me to call.

114
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,067
So, would you please 
provide an introduction?

115
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,527
Okay.

116
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,368
[Neon] Here. I’m putting him on now.

117
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,245
[Kurapika] Hello?

118
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,957
Is it true that Dalzollene 
has been killed?

119
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,208
[Kurapika] Yes, sir.

120
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,377
That’s quite hard to believe.

121
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,837
He is a Nen user.

122
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:06,092
He’s trained to withstand ten gunshots 
without sustaining any injuries.

123
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,220
He was killed by outlaws 
known as the Phantom Troupe.

124
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,932
Wait… The Spiders?

125
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,726
[Kurapika] I had the opportunity 
to see them in action.

126
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,646
One of them stopped a bazooka round 
with his bare hand.

127
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,899
My name is Kurapika 
and I’m the interim leader.

128
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,069
Can you please tell me 
how you would like us to proceed?

129
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,612
Of course.

130
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,073
But first I want to hear what you think.

131
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,533
[Kurapika] I believe your daughter

132
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,911
should leave 
Yorknew City immediately, sir.

133
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:38,041
I’m not confident that we can protect her 
in the event of unforeseen circumstances.

134
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,171
[Nostrade] I agree with your assessment, 
but my daughter has a say, as well.

135
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,341
I want to respect her wishes 
whenever possible.

136
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,427
Her safety’s my top priority.

137
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,096
Hmm...

138
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,847
Understood.

139
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,891
I’m on my way there right now,

140
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,143
so I should arrive 
sometime tomorrow evening.

141
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,230
I promise I’ll do my best 
to persuade Neon.

142
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,900
You will be the new leader, Kurapika.

143
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,028
Here is your first order:

144
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,698
Keep an eye on Neon until I get there.

145
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,616
Yes, sir. I will.

146
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,372
Your father wants you to know 
he’ll be here tomorrow evening.

147
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,332
Really? That’s perfect!

148
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,668
When he lands, 
I’ll get him to take me shopping!

149
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:26,006
Until then he made it quite clear 
that he’d like you to stay in your room.

150
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,590
Aw...

151
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,426
I wanted to see the casino…

152
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,553
You stay here with the boss.

153
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,555
What?! Yeah, I got it.

154
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,016
I’ll be downstairs.

155
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,400
[gulping]

156
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,319
[refreshed exhale]

157
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,371
This is it!

158
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,373
It says here

159
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,709
that a dummy corporation 
for the Nostrade family

160
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,461
owns that building you were in.

161
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,380
All right then, do you think 
you can track down a list

162
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,550
of all the buildings 
in this area the Nostrade family own?

163
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,718
Sure can!

164
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:12,927
I can also see,

165
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,473
if anyone has checked into a hotel 
using the Nostrade name lately.

166
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,183
[metal bang]

167
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,439
Okay. I brought some more beer.

168
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,608
Hey! Thanks a lot!

169
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,195
Here ya go.

170
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,906
Know what you need, Uvo? 
A Hunter’s License.

171
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,283
As long as you have the money,

172
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,827
you can dig up 
all kinds of information from their site.

173
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,915
Unlike you guys, 
I don’t like the idea of money.

174
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,084
If I want something, I take it.

175
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,293
[Shalnark] Well said!

176
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,295
-You’re an exemplary bandit. 
-[Uvogin gulping]

177
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,339
Here.

178
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,592
They own two other buildings 
in Yorknew City.

179
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,513
And there are three hotels 
where members are staying.

180
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,641
All right. 
This search shouldn’t take too long.

181
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,809
There.

182
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,852
Thanks, buddy.

183
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,771
I owe ya one.

184
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,272
[loud smooch]

185
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,732
Whoa! What are you doing?!

186
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,069
[chuckles] Well... I’m off.

187
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,487
[Franklin] What about the beer?

188
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,155
You guys can finish it.

189
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,741
Make sure you dispose of the body.

190
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,910
And try to make it quick.

191
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,286
Yeah.

192
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,539
-Later. 
-Hey, Uvo!

193
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,415
Huh?

194
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,001
Don’t get careless out there.

195
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,046
No prob.

196
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,099
Family members…

197
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,185
Sounds like a good place to start.

198
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,818
[Kurapika] Look at this.

199
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,319
What’s that?

200
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,489
A list of the buildings the Nostrades own?

201
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,616
And a list of family members.

202
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,743
I didn’t know this was out there.

203
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,581
This website can only be accessed 
by pro Hunters.

204
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,915
With this information,

205
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,544
they can find the location of this room 
without any trouble at all.

206
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,298
There’s a website just for pro Hunters?

207
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,676
That means if one of our enemies 
is a pro Hunter, too.

208
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,303
We’re in trouble.

209
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,723
We need to move the boss 
to a different room right away.

210
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,309
[Melody] We do? In the same hotel?

211
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,769
It’s faster and cleaner that way.

212
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,105
But do not use aliases!

213
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,691
We’ll have Melody or Basho book the room.

214
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,445
And don’t let anyone leave, 
especially the boss.

215
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,696
You got it.

216
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,157
[Kurapika] 
Don’t check out of this one, either.

217
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,743
Hold on. What about you?

218
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,245
[Kurapika] I'll stay here.

219
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,413
Oh?!

220
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,665
Kurapika… You’re not thinking of...?

221
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,095
[man] I-- I don’t think 
he’s a family member.

222
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,182
He’s a bodyguard for the boss’s daughter.

223
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,767
[Uvogin] His daughter?

224
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,101
Yeah.

225
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,563
She’s a freak who gets her kicks 
out of collecting body parts.

226
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,107
[grunts] Eyeballs, organs, guts…

227
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,152
Oh! And she’s a fortune teller!

228
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,946
She’s really accurate, too!

229
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,072
That so?

230
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:23,117
Yeah! She’s got a long list 
of clients in the Mafia.

231
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,246
Some of the community elders 
practically worship her!

232
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,455
[nervous chuckle]

233
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,915
[Uvogin] Oh?

234
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,668
I mean it makes sense.

235
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,505
Our boss used his daughter’s power 
to make his entire fortune.

236
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,924
Look, cut me some slack, all right?

237
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,468
I told you everything I know, 
so just let me--

238
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,226
[Uvogin] Someone who can see the future.

239
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,021
So, she knew this attack was gonna happen?

240
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,857
The boss was right.

241
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,152
There weren’t any traitors among us 
after all.

242
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,827
[Leorio] As it stands, we have a diamond 
worth three million jenny

243
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,121
and 2.4 million in leftover cash.

244
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,874
Not to mention the 2.75 
we made arm wrestling.

245
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,878
All told that’s 
a total of around eight million.

246
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,423
We need at least nine billion.

247
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,967
That’s the minimum opening bid 
for Greed Island,

248
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,511
so if we don’t have that, 
there’s really no point.

249
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,181
But I don’t see how we’re gonna get there. 
Not through legitimate channels anyway.

250
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,601
Yeah, I wouldn’t call 
that kind of arm wrestling "legitimate."

251
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,854
All of the challengers toward the end

252
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,565
were a bunch of desperate losers 
looking for revenge.

253
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,483
And that’s okay.

254
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,694
See, that was my goal 
from the very beginning.

255
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,070
[Gon and Killua] Huh?

256
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,906
[Leorio] The more exaggerated the rumors, 
the better.

257
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,616
What do you mean by that?

258
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,119
The arm wrestling was just bait.

259
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,370
[Gon] It was?

260
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,123
That is what’s gonna draw all the moles 
out of hiding!

261
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,541
Wait, moles?

262
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,668
I don’t think I get it. 
Why do we want moles?

263
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,503
[Leorio] Okay, take it easy.

264
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,088
Just let me explain…

265
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,840
[Gon and Killua] [uncertain grunt]

266
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,718
[Leorio] Step right up!

267
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,595
Conditional auction!

268
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,057
We’ve got a diamond sitting here 
that’s worth three million jenny!

269
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,642
Arm wrestling decides the winner!

270
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,605
The first person to beat this boy 
wins the diamond.

271
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,649
The entry fee’s 10,000 jenny.

272
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,401
What? He’s just a kid!

273
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,986
I just might try it…

274
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,279
Don't bother.

275
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,532
That kid beat 500 people yesterday, 
no problem.

276
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,700
[man] Really?

277
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,995
Yeah, really, and more than 20 of ‘em 
got their arms broken.

278
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,497
Seriously?

279
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,169
[Leorio] [chuckles] The rumors 
are starting to spread nicely.

280
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,171
Well, in that case…

281
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,173
Outta my way.

282
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,135
Oh! Do we have our first challenger?

283
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,345
[short man] Not quite.

284
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,554
[gasps]

285
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,808
[short man] 
I already know my man can’t beat your kid.

286
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,643
I was watching yesterday.

287
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,186
[Leorio] Then what do you want?

288
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,688
You interested in makin’ some real money?

289
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,232
What do you mean?

290
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,318
I know where you can make serious cash.

291
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,196
Not the measly pocket change 
you’re pulling here.

292
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,198
You can make hundreds...

293
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,701
no, thousands of times more, easy.

294
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,286
[chuckling]

295
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,420
So, are these two the moles?

296
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,673
Yeah. It looks like 
we just landed a big fish!

297
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,134
Fish? So... they’re not moles?

298
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,970
Will you please stop talking? 
It doesn’t matter!

299
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,307
[short man] Here we are.

300
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,611
[elevator dings]

301
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,406
[straining]

302
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,452
[grunting]

303
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,871
[cheering]

304
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,417
[Killua] Oh, wow.

305
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,127
I can feel the bloodlust.

306
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,630
This competition accepts all comers, 
and it really pays out.

307
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,841
The spectators bet on each match

308
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,094
and the winner gets ten percent 
of all bets placed.

309
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,306
We’re talking billions 
wagered on each match.

310
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,601
But that means every single win 
could make you millions!

311
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,561
More if you play your cards right.

312
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,104
I get a commission

313
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,857
but it’s only 50 percent 
of whatever you earn.

314
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,318
Fifty? Isn’t that a bit steep?

315
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,196
If I don’t enter your name, 
you can’t participate.

316
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,615
Besides you can bet your own money.

317
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,117
That kid’ll get great odds,

318
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,661
so you’ll make it back 
a hundred times over.

319
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,079
Okay, I’m sold!

320
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,123
We’re in! Gon! Do it!

321
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,249
Huh?

322
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,419
[referee] 
Well? Do we have any other challengers?

323
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,962
[short man] Right over here!

324
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,218
This kid thinks he’s got what it takes.

325
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,386
All right!

326
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,763
[gasping]

327
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,102
Sorry to disappoint you, folks!

328
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,022
But the arm wrestling 
has officially been canceled!

329
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,192
Instead, we’re gonna do 
a little bit of conditional auctioning!

330
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,985
[upset crowd]

331
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,904
What’s wrong? Why’s it canceled?

332
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,323
I, uh... I don’t actually know…

333
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,784
And all you have to do to win is...

334
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,744
play a game of hide-and-seek!

335
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,121
Hide-and-seek? Really?

336
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,707
[punk] We’ll start by passing out flyers!

337
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,046
Now take a good look 
at those pictures, folks!

338
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,382
Don’t forget ‘em,

339
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,802
because the seven guys and gals you see 
are your targets!

340
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,264
Hey… I’ve seen that girl with the glasses.

341
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,558
Me too. She arm-wrestled me.

342
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,518
[man] Wait…

343
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,604
You think they’re the ones responsible 
for what happened last night?

344
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,566
Yeah. You mean the attack 
on the auction, right?

345
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,192
[gasps]

346
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,403
[punk] In order to win the bid,

347
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,115
all you have to do is capture a target 
and deliver them to us.

348
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,908
For each, you’ll walk away

349
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,868
with the tidy sum of…

350
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,580
wait for it… two billion jenny!

351
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,039
[crowd gasping]

352
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,626
[punk] There is no time limit.

353
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,045
And it doesn’t matter 
if they’re dead or alive!

354
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,923
Interested? Then catch one and call us!

355
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,217
Two billion each is a lot!

356
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,928
And if we catch all seven, 
that’s 14 billion!

357
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,683
[punk] All it costs to participate 
is a mere five million jenny!

358
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,144
We’re participating, right?

359
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,270
[Gon] Sure…

360
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,404
[participant 1] That’s right.

361
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,072
I’ll fax you the information.

362
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,907
[participant 2] Check the website.

363
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,326
We’ll pay for anything concrete.

364
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,288
[Leorio] We’re gonna need to hurry.

365
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,456
[Killua] No rush.

366
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,625
They won’t be able to catch our targets.

367
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,792
[Leorio and Gon] Huh?

368
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,420
Even the Mafia’s having 
a hard time with them.

369
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,047
What do you mean?

370
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,674
The "conditional auction" 
they’re having?

371
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,760
It’s nothing more than a big bounty hunt.

372
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,886
It’s like...

373
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,639
the Mafia’s admitting 
they can’t catch these targets.

374
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,265
Or not alone, anyway.

375
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,351
You’ve got a point there.

376
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,811
They were willing to put 
everything else on hold

377
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,772
just so they could track them down...

378
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,276
I heard, last night, someone 
attacked the underground auction.

379
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,362
But who would do that?!

380
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,198
Unless… maybe it was them.

381
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,743
You think that’s the reason 
they’ve got a bounty on their heads?

382
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,370
Yup.

383
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,748
And if they stole from the Mafia, 
they’ve got a screw loose.

384
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,041
But think.

385
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,335
Who do we know 
that’s crazy enough to do that?

386
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,756
The Phantom Troupe!

387
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,638
Now that you mention it,

388
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,431
what’s Kurapika been up to?

389
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,267
Dunno. He should be here 
in the city by now

390
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,686
but he hasn’t called yet.

391
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,396
Then I’ll call him.

392
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,607
[phone rings]

393
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,580
[phone continues ringing]

394
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,922
He's not answering.

395
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,507
Maybe he’s working…

396
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,591
Working?

397
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,928
Yeah, I heard he picked up a job 
as a bodyguard a while back.

398
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,014
I bet it’s some big shot VIP.

399
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,018
He’s looking for the Scarlet Eyes, 
so probably someone in the underworld.

400
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,105
What if he was guarding them 
at the auction hall

401
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,232
and then got caught up in the attack?

402
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,152
He wouldn’t have let 
something like that happen.

403
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,611
If the Troupe attacked,

404
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,698
Kurapika would be tracking them down 
even as we speak.

405
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,160
I wouldn’t be surprised, 
if he’s captured a few of ‘em already.

406
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,412
I hope you're right.

407
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,248
[ringing tone]

408
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,916
[phone ringing]

409
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:55,796
[clatter]

410
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,187
You by yourself?

411
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,689
That’s pretty impressive.

412
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,650
Where do you want to die?

413
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,446
I’ll let you decide the location.

414
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,826
I’d prefer somewhere remote, 
so we won’t be a nuisance.

415
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,996
I don’t want your screams 
to bother anyone.

416
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,372
[angry grunt]

417
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,711
[narrator] Uvogin has come 
to get revenge for his capture

418
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,297
and restore his wounded pride.

419
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,175
And Kurapika has long awaited the chance

420
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,094
to exact revenge upon the Phantom Troupe.

421
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,847
Their battle is about to begin.

422
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,602
[theme song playing]

423
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,168
[Gon] Coming up:

424
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,587
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

425
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,130
[both] Hunterpedia!

426
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,882
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

427
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,329
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

428
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:07,219
Today, we're introducing Squala, 
one of Neon’s guards.

429
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,055
A Manipulator who controls dogs 
using his Nen.

430
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,892
And he’s actually dating Neon’s maid, 
Miss Eliza.

431
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,351
-Meow, meow! 
-Woof, woof!

432
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,816
[Gon] Next time: 
"Condition x and x Condition."

433
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,694
Explain the difference 
using 30 words or less!

434
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,613
[Killua] A condition is a rule,

435
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,823
and a condition’s a covenant 
with yourself!
