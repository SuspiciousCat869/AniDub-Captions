you’re wrong.

165
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,444
Pariston: Absolutely right!

166
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:53,581
The council’s decision
was 11 to 1.

167
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:57,451
i was the only one
in favor of revising the bylaws.

168
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:02,056
If instead miss cheadle or
Mr. Mizaistom were up here now,

169
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,590
i’d have stayed silent,

170
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:07,094
deferring to the wisdom
of the council for the duration,

171
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,663
but both of them
are out of the running,

172
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,800
and, as you all heard
Mr. Leorio clearly state,

173
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,502
he has no plans
for the association.

174
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,337
This is the only time

175
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,840
I can express my opinion
as vice chairman

176
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,510
and not just
as one of the zodiacs,

177
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,811
my one opportunity.

178
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,413
Understand, Mr. Kanzai?

179
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,183
Right here and right now,

180
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,418
it’s the only chance
that i’ll ever get!

( Kanzai sputters )

183
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,758
Pariston: Of course,
according to article eight,

184
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:41,261
I could ignore the council’s
decision and force the motion,

185
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,832
but, even though it’s my right,
I really don’t want to do that.

186
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:50,237
The zodiacs are a precious
legacy left by the chairman!

187
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:52,840
piyon: Hey,
if you say something stupid,

188
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,275
he’s gonna make this
ten times worse.

189
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,443
( Kanzai groans )

190
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,812
Pariston: Honestly,
part of me wishes

191
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,316
to let this matter die
without making any more waves.

192
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,485
However, the late Mr. Teradein
and Mr. Bushidora

193
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,388
made an excellent point
before they passed.

194
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:13,193
Both articles three and four
continue to suffer gravely

195
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,196
as a direct result
of the current exam process!

196
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,198
cheadle:
"He doesn’t want to win,

197
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,434
but he doesn’t want
to lose, either."

198
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,604
I have to say, ging,
looks like you’re right.

199
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,306
What a creep.

200
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:30,110
he doesn’t care
about winning or losing at all,

201
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,379
so, with nothing
of his own at risk,

202
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:34,848
he can always
stay dispassionate and calm

203
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:38,585
while he manipulates others
and plays the rules against us

204
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,156
in the worst way any of us
could possibly imagine.

205
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,328
May I say something?

206
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,397
Piyon: Yes? What is it?

207
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,170
Cheadle: If leorio
is elected chairman,

208
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,305
I volunteer to be his advisor.

209
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,774
at that point,
I promise that I will conduct

210
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:04,278
a comprehensive review
of the bylaws and hunter exam.

211
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:08,481
I will not let you grab
any of teradein’s votes.

212
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:12,386
i’ll destroy
every last argument you make.

for the potential leorio shows,

but who’s concerned about
how he will serve initially,

215
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:22,329
I will do everything I can
to quell those concerns,

216

to leave the zodiacs.

that gon wouldn’t die, right?

in that moment,

I could visualize the scene
that just transpired before us.

273
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:54,568
I anticipated Mr. Ging and I
would stand onstage

and that he
would ultimately win,

Pariston: First, since Mr. Ging

278
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:05,512
seemed confident that gon would
survive, I began to suspect

that there must be
some way he could be healed.

280
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:12,620
I also realized that if he
became part of the election,

281
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,255
I would never be able to win.

you see, that was
the exact moment I was defeated.

285
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,333
but Mr. Ging
withdrew from the election,

286
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,204
and, soon after, Mr. Leorio
showed up and punched him.

287
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,206

for what it was,

that I knew I had won,
