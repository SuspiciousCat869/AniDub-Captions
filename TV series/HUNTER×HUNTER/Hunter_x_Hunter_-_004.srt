[roars]

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,713
[narrator] 
Strange beasts

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,632
and monsters.

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:07,549
[squeaking]

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,593
Vast riches.

6
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,678
Hidden treasures.

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,015
Evil haunts.

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,809
Uncharted frontiers.

9
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,438
The mysterious unknown.

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,943
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words...

11
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,195
are called...

12
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,825
Hunters.

13
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:59,077
[Satotz] With no further ado, 
the Hunter Exam will now begin.

14
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,956
I am Satotz, your Examiner 
for the First Phase of the Exam.

15
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,752
It's my responsibility to lead you all 
to the Second Phase.

16
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,838
The First Phase is already underway.

17
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:16,345
HOPE x AND x AMBITION

18
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,976
[narrator] It's been two hours 
since the Exam began,

19
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,979
and the applicants have traveled 
more than 30 kilometers

20
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,230
from the starting line.

21
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,317
No one knows how far they'll have to go.

22
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,071
Nevertheless, 
they struggle to match the leader's pace.

23
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,199
It is a monotonous course 
with no end in sight

24
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,078
and applicants have already started 
to drop out.

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,794
[panting]

26
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,297
[Nicholas] 
Extrapolated from historical data,

27
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,883
it's safe to assume 
this will be a 40-kilometer course.

28
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,638
And if my calculations are correct, 
we should be nearing the end.

29
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,100
[pants loudly]

30
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,525
[Leorio] 
What the hell was I thinking?

31
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,361
You've got to be a monster 
to pass the Hunter Exam

32
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,530
and I'm surrounded by them.

33
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,284
-[yelling] Hey, wait up, kid. 
-[Killua] Hm?

34
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,912
How about you show 
a little respect for the Exam.

35
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,955
What do you mean?

36
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,083
I mean quit using a damn skateboard. 
That's cheating.

37
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,252
-How's that? 
-How?

38
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,671
This is an endurance test, 
that's how.

39
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,506
-[Gon] No, it's not! 
-Huh?

40
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,552
What are you babbling about now, Gon?

41
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,221
The examiner guy only said 
we had to follow him.

42
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,724
Hey, whose side are you on, anyway?

43
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,603
-[Killua] Hey, how old are you? 
-Twelve years old.

44
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,606
[Killua] Same as me.

45
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,447
I think I'll run for a little while.

46
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,990
Cool! 
[laughs]

47
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,285
-My name's Killua. 
-Hi, I'm Gon!

48
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,249
[Leorio] Damn kids! 
You're not going to make a fool out of me.

49
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,295
[labored breathing]

50
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,759
[Nicholas] 
Impossible. Simply impossible.

51
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,052
My calculations are never wrong.

52
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,221
What's happening?

53
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,184
Am I actually going to fail?

54
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,728
Me? Fail?

55
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,855
No, that's preposterous!

56
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,316
[yelling] I won't accept that. 
I won't!

57
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,237
[Nicolas, groaning, gasping for air]

58
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,289
[Amori] 
Hey, rookie!

59
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,416
[laughs]

60
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,418
Damn, you're a real mess.

61
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,671
I don't think I've ever seen anyone 
run out of steam this early.

62
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,008
[Amori] Yeah, he's right. 
You must really be pathetic.

63
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,387
[Umori] You think someone like you has got 
what it takes to pass the Hunter Exam?

64
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,890
[Imori] 
Don't ever come back, loser.

65
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,266
[crying out]

66
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,311
[screams]

67
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,731
[Tonpa] 
Here.

68
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,776
Thanks for your help. 
Great job, guys.

69
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,488
He won't be recovering from that 
anytime soon, I can promise you.

70
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,575
And I bet you he won't be applying 
for the Exam again, either.

71
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,285
I've really got to hand it to you

72
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,372
you sure do love crushing rookies, 
don't you, Tonpa.

73
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,665
[Tonpa snickers]

74
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,543
It's the only reason I get out of bed 
in the morning.

75
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,260
[music plays]

76
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,102
[Kurapika] It's been about four hours 
since the First Phase began

77
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,646
and we've run at least 60 kilometers.

78
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,983
How much farther do we need to go?

79
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,444
[panting heavily]

80
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,412
[Leorio] 
Rookies almost never pass a Hunter Exam.

81
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,664
Just one every three years or so.

82
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,376
I'm just a regular guy.

83
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,796
I don't stand a chance. 
What the hell was I thinking?

84
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,215
Damn it.

85
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,051
-[briefcase thuds] 
-[Gon grunts]

86
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,847
[panting]

87
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,577
Hey, forget about him. 
You've got to keep moving.

88
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,557
[yelling] 
Man, screw this!

89
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,646
I'm becoming a Hunter, 
no matter what!

90
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,775
Damn it all!

91
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:25,946
[snickers]

92
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,702
-[grunts] Got it. 
-[Killua gasps]

93
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,080
That was awesome! 
[laughs]

94
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,791
[Killua] 
Can I try that later?

95
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,085
[Gon] Sure, if I can try your skateboard.

96
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,264
[Satotz] 
We've reached the 80-kilometer mark.

97
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,768
Now, let's pick up the pace a bit, 
shall we?

98
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,898
[heavy panting]

99
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,818
-He can't be serious! 
-He's insane.

100
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,612
Look at him prance up those stairs, 
like it's no big deal.

101
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,239
He's not even out of breath.

102
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,782
[Geretta] If he doesn't ease up,

103
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,201
people are going to start dropping 
like flies.

104
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,747
Hey, I've got an idea. Let's race 
to the finish, see who's faster.

105
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,167
[Gon] Sure, okay. 
But the loser has to buy dinner.

106
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,877
[Killua] 
Yeah, you're on.

107
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,754
[both] Ready, go!

108
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,172
[grunting loudly]

109
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,096
[Kurapika] 
Are you okay, Leorio?

110
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,432
Great. I've never been better.

111
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:40,311
If I forget how stupid I look, 
it's a whole lot easier to keep going.

112
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,980
[yells]

113
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,775
[Kurapika laughs] 
I suppose I should probably follow suit.

114
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,575
Leorio, I have a question for you.

115
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,454
What's up? First Phase too easy for you, 
so you've got to make it harder?

116
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,540
Save your breath, Kurapika. 
You're going to need it.

117
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,502
Why do you want to be a Hunter? 
Is it really just about the money?

118
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,505
It can't be.

119
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,842
We haven't known each other very long, 
but that's not like you.

120
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,389
I mean, sure, your attitude is terrible 
and you aren't too bright, either.

121
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,016
[Leorio grumbles]

122
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,186
But I know, 
shallowness isn't among your downfalls.

123
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,148
I've known many people whose only passion 
in life was money.

124
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,358
And I can tell you're nothing like them.

125
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,028
[Leorio] 
You've got it all figured out, don't you?

126
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,577
-The Scarlet Eyes. 
-[Leorio] Huh?

127
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,997
That's why the Kurta Clan was targeted.

128
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,755
Scarlet Eyes are a special trait 
possessed only by the Kurta.

129
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,132
When our emotions are heightened,

130
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,053
the color of our eyes will change, 
taking on a shade of scarlet.

131
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,932
In that state, the color of our eyes

132
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,185
is considered one of the seven most 
beautiful colors in the world

133
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,146
and they command a hefty price 
on the black market.

134
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,858
[Leorio] So, that's why 
the Phantom Troupe attacked you?

135
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,026
Your eyes?

136
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,531
They plucked the eyes 
from each of my brethren's corpses.

137
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,158
Not a single one escaped desecration.

138
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,995
Even now I can hear them,

139
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,289
the anguished screams 
of their darkened eyes.

140
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,920
I swear on my life 
that I will capture the Phantom Troupe.

141
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:33,216
Once I do, I'll avenge my clan 
by taking back their eyes.

142
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,136
[Leorio] That's why you want to be 
a Hunter?

143
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,470
[Kurapika] That's right.

144
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,181
If I become a contract Hunter 
with wealthy clientele,

145
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,143
I'll have access 
to black market information.

146
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,937
But you'll have to be 
the kind of Hunter you hate.

147
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,232
You think you'll be able to swallow 
your pride when you need to?

148
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,404
The blow to my pride is nothing. 
Not when compared to my clan's suffering.

149
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,203
[Leorio] 
Well, sorry.

150
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,123
I don't have some big noble cause 
like you do.

151
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,585
The only thing I'm after 
is money.

152
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,044
That's not true.

153
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,130
-Of course it is. 
-It's not.

154
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,301
Be honest. Do you really believe that 
money can buy everything? Tell the truth.

155
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,552
Damn right, I do.

156
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,721
For the right price, 
you can buy treasures,

157
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,307
dreams, hearts, 
and even people's lives.

158
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,101
Take that back, Leorio.

159
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,896
I will not stand here 
and allow you to insult the Kurta.

160
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,607
Why? 
It's the truth, isn't it.

161
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,234
If I had money, 
my friend would still be alive today!

162
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,368
Was he ill?

163
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,788
Yeah. It was a curable disease.

164
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,353
The problem was that the operation 
cost a fortune.

165
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,355
I was naive.

166
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,273
I figured I could become a doctor

167
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,984
so I could cure kids 
with the same disease.

168
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,111
And tell their parents 
they owed me nothing.

169
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,989
It was free of charge.

170
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,033
That was my dream.

171
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,287
A pretty good joke, right?

172
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,998
Turns out, to become a doctor

173
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,584
you already have to have 
an obscene amount of money.

174
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,879
Get it now? 
The whole world runs on money.

175
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,090
So I'm going to get 
as much as I can.

176
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,845
See you at the finish line.

177
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,555
Catch you later, old man.

178
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,765
Hey, I'm not old.

179
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,351
Can't you tell I'm a teenager 
just like you?

180
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,146
[Gon] 
Huh? No way!

181
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:59,612
HUNTER GLOSSARY

182
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,866
KILLUA

183
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,578
[panting]

184
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,749
I can't go on.

185
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,919
This... this is it, 
I'm finished.

186
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,879
[panting]

187
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,509
I've got to tell you, Gon.

188
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,678
I'm pretty impressed 
that you can keep up with me.

189
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,138
You are? 
[laughs]

190
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,517
Or maybe they're all so slow, 
you just seem fast.

191
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,188
Man, I thought the Hunter Exam 
was going to be more of a challenge.

192
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,565
This is boring.

193
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,401
[Gon] Hey, why do you want to be 
a Hunter, anyway?

194
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,194
Who me?

195
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,697
-I never said I wanted to be a Hunter. 
-Huh?

196
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,575
I just heard that the Exam 
was supposed to be really hard.

197
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,869
It sounded kind of fun 
so here I am.

198
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,163
But it's not as fun as I thought.

199
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,832
[Killua] 
What about you?

200
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,710
[Gon] Well, the thing is, 
my dad's a Hunter.

201
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,714
So, I decided I was going to be 
a Hunter just like him, no matter what.

202
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,300
[Killua] 
Hm, so what kind of Hunter is he?

203
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,634
[Gon] No idea.

204
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,595
[laughs]

205
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,722
-It's the weirdest thing I've ever heard. 
-Huh?

206
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,974
You wanna be the same kind of Hunter 
as your dad

207
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,393
but you don't know anything 
about him? That's nuts.

208
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,270
Mito's the one who raised me.

209
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,563
and she told me a little,

210
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,816
but I've only ever seen him in pictures 
she showed me from a long time ago.

211
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,652
-Wait, so who's Mito? 
-She's my aunt.

212
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,991
She said that my dad took the Hunter Exam 
when he was only 12 years old, too.

213
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,786
He passed his first try 
and became a Hunter.

214
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,788
That's when he decided 
to leave the island.

215
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,249
So, I came here in order to find out 
why he chose being a Hunter

216
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,709
over staying at home with me.

217
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,548
[man] 
The exit! Oh, thank goodness.

218
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,884
[man two] We're finally getting out 
of this dark tunnel.

219
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,227
Now then. Let's see how many applicants 
have made it this far.

220
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,484
[both] Goal!

221
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,320
[laughing]

222
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,697
Yeah, I did it! 
I finished first.

223
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,325
What are you talking about? 
I totally won.

224
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,828
-[Gon] No, I won. 
-[Killua] I won.

225
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,705
[Gon] I was faster than you, 
so you have to buy me dinner.

226
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,042
[Killua] No way. 
I was faster so you're buying me dinner.

227
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,253
[Gon] 
Na-ah, I was faster.

228
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,172
Hey, which one of us was fastest?

229
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,967
You crossed the finish line 
simultaneously.

230
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,468
Okay.

231
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,929
Fine, I guess I'll have to buy 
your dinner.

232
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,972
[Killua] 
Huh?

233
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,641
But then you have to buy me 
my dinner, okay?

234
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,101
I don't get it.

235
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,522
Hey, Mr. Satotz, 
is this where the Second Phase begins?

236
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,775
No, it isn't. 
We have quite a way to go.

237
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,402
[Gon] Oh, man!

238
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,534
[heavy breathing]

239
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,959
[Leorio groans, laughs]

240
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,300
[Gon] Hey, Kurapika!

241
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,551
Hey.

242
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,219
Is this our destination?

243
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,679
Nope, not yet.

244
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,014
Hm, I see.

245
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,726
-Looks like the fog is lifting. 
-Ah, really?

246
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,937
Whoa!

247
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:39,874
[Satotz] The Milsy Wetlands, 
also known as Swindler's Swamp.

248
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,127
We must cross it to reach 
Phase Two of the Exam.

249
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,881
This place is home to 
a variety of truly bizarre animals,

250
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,010
many of which are 
crafty, voracious creatures

251
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,679
who deceive and feast 
on human prey.

252
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,600
So please, be very careful.

253
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,064
If you're deceived, 
you'll surely die.

254
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,359
[clamoring]

255
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,027
[creaking]

256
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,280
[grunting] 
[yells] Wait for me!

257
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,789
These wetland creatures 
are not to be underestimated,

258
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,959
for they will use every trick in the book 
to fool their prey.

259
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,126
[gasping]

260
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,628
This is an ecosystem

261
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,798
in which all creatures hunt 
by the art of deception.

262
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,468
And that is why it's also known 
as Swindler's Swamp.

263
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,099
Now then, please follow me closely 
so you won't be deceived.

264
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,604
[scoffs] 
Is he messing with us?

265
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:47,316
If we know they'll try to deceive us, 
who's gonna fall for it?

266
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,609
[man] 
Don't fall for it!

267
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,195
Listen, didn't I just say 
that we won't?

268
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,866
[groans] 
Don't let them fool you!

269
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,285
[surprised gasping]

270
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,705
He's lying. 
That man is lying to you.

271
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,128
He's an impostor! 
A total fraud.

272
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,963
I'm the real Examiner, 
you got it?

273
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,174
Impostor? What's going on here?

274
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,760
But then, who is he, really?

275
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,930
I'll prove it, look at this!

276
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,517
[clamoring]

277
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,145
Oh wow, he looks like Mr. Satotz!

278
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,440
This is a man-faced ape 
from the Milsy Wetlands.

279
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,150
A man-faced what?

280
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,612
The man-faced ape loves the taste 
of human flesh.

281
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,907
But their limbs are really long 
and thin, so they're actually quite weak.

282
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,952
That's why they disguise themselves 
as humans.

283
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,080
They trick us into following them 
into the wetlands,

284
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,042
where they work together with other 
creatures to kill and eat us.

285
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,879
That's what he wants. To deceive 
the entire Hunter applicant pool

286
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,714
and feast on every one of you.

287
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,925
Bastard.

288
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,260
Oh yeah?

289
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,264
Well, then that would certainly explain 
why he doesn't walk like a normal human.

290
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,144
What?

291
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,906
-[cards flutter] 
-[everyone gasps]

292
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,699
[laughs]

293
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,618
I see, I see.

294
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,162
That settles it, then.

295
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,289
So you are the real one.

296
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,583
[music plays]

297
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,131
[Hanzo] Hold on, he's the real Examiner?

298
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,010
[screeching]

299
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,846
The Examiners are Hunters.

300
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:45,810
Each is hand-picked by the Exam Committee 
to do this job without pay.

301
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,563
Anyone who holds the title 
we're vying for ourselves

302
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,984
could have deflected that attack. 
And quite easily, I might add.

303
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,862
I shall take that as a compliment. 
Thank you.

304
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,283
Still, should you choose to attack me 
again, for any reason,

305
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,870
I will have no choice but to report you 
for attacking an Examiner,

306
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,289
and have you immediately disqualified.

307
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,292
-Is that clear? 
-Of course.

308
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,627
[cawing]

309
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:19,510
Nature can be so brutal. 
It's hard to watch.

310
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,138
So he was a man-faced ape as well.

311
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:26,225
He was trying to confuse the applicants 
and lure some of you away.

312
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,019
These attempts are to be expected.

313
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,523
-We can't let our guard down. 
-Right.

314
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,651
Please be aware 
that you will encounter such deceptions

315
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,486
on a regular basis.

316
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,032
I must assume that 
a number of you were fooled

317
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,452
into suspecting my true identity

318
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,036
Oh, well, I uh...

319
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,080
[chuckles, embarrassed]

320
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,082
Understand,

321
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,211
I want to make it abundantly clear 
that if any of you are to lose sight of me

322
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,380
once we enter the fog 
of the Milsy Wetlands,

323
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,676
you have no hope whatsoever 
of reaching the Second Phase of the Exam.

324
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,886
You've been warned.

325
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,765
Now, let's begin. 
Please follow me.

326
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,039
Oh, great. 
It's another marathon.

327
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,124
Except this time 
we're in a swamp

328
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,753
and running on wet ground requires 
significantly more energy.

329
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,882
[narrator] The applicants have finally 
left the long, dark tunnel

330
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,258
and stepped into the light.

331
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,179
So far, 36 candidates have 
withdrawn from the Exam,

332
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,848
and 368 remain.

333
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,060
Their next challenge will be 
the Milsy Wetlands,

334
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,979
which is also known as 
Swindler's Swamp.

335
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,150
The excruciating Hunter Exam 
continues.

336
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,783
[Gon] Next time. 
"Hisoka x Is x Sneaky."

337
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,577
Okie-dokie!
