1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,169
NEN

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:06,590
[narrator] Nen abilities fall into 
the following six distinct categories:

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,761
Enhances are able to strengthen 
and reinforce

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,680
the natural properties 
of any object they encounter.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:19,311
Transmuters can manipulate 
and change the quality of aura at will.

6
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,355
CONJURER

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,857
Similar to Transmuters Conjurers 
have the ability

8
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,568
to materialize an object out of aura.

9
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:32,074
Emitters can propel their aura 
shooting or projecting it forward.

10
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:38,205
Manipulators can use their aura 
to control objects or living things.

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,667
Specialists possess rare abilities

12
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,545
which do not fit 
within the other five categories.

13
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,216
One must determine 
which category their aura falls into.

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,470
This is the first step 
to becoming a skilled Nen user.

15
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,271
[theme song paying]

16
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,386
[Gon] Aunt Mito!

17
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,929
So long!

18
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,057
I’m gonna go find Ging, I promise!

19
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,976
And after I meet him,

20
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,479
I’m gonna come back to the island, okay?

21
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,069
Bye! take care! I’ll miss you!

22
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,701
WISH x AND x PROMISE

23
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,916
[narrator] Meanwhile as Gon and Killua 
depart from Whale Island,

24
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,711
Kurapika is preparing 
to begin a journey of his own.

25
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,216
[Kurapika] So you remember me?

26
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,761
[Rei] Well, yeah. 
We don’t get many visitors here.

27
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,931
In fact, ever since you were here last,

28
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,058
there’s only been one other person.

29
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,438
This place is a whole lot harder to find 
than you think.

30
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,280
You found this agency on your own

31
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,491
and that tells me you’re pretty sharp.

32
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,868
Even so…

33
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,413
I can’t introduce you 
to our valued clients.

34
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,749
And it’s not because of your 
total lack of experience.

35
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,127
Some of our clients 
don’t seem to mind that.

36
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,420
The thing is

37
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,339
experience isn’t all you lack.

38
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,757
But what do you mean?

39
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,802
Like I told you, 
I already have a Hunter’s License.

40
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,761
[Rei] Maybe.

41
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,847
But your Exam isn’t over yet.

42
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,099
It’s obvious.

43
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,435
Excuse me?

44
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,316
You can’t see anything, can you?

45
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,403
[Kurapika] Huh?

46
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,989
You come back when you can...

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,168
[tense breath]

48
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,386
[electricity buzzes]

49
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,514
[Mizuken] You can’t see it,

50
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,183
but you can sense it, huh?

51
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,560
Why did you do that?

52
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,561
[Mizuken] This?

53
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,230
Oh. [chuckles] I was just playing around.

54
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,733
-[thunder] 
-This must be fate,

56
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,112
Try to think of this as...

57
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,531
a little bit of friendly advice 
from a senior.

58
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,828
You didn’t notice when I stole this,

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,372
or when I walked right past you, either.

60
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,874
You’re totally clueless.

61
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,584
Bastard!

62
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,544
Give me back my license right now!

63
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,298
Does a newbie who knows nothing of Nen

64
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,176
have a chance of beating me?

65
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,886
Nen, huh?

66
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,556
[smirks]

67
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,266
[thunder]

68
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,435
[Mizuken] Wanna give it a try?

69
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,028
[Kurapika panting]

70
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,949
Do you get it now?

71
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,785
There’s something important 
you still lack.

72
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,623
Come with me.

73
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,585
I’ll teach you.

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,508
The real Exam has just begun.

75
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,685
[birds chirping]

76
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,311
[Mizuken] Today...

77
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,523
we’re going to determine 
which category your aura falls under.

78
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,368
[focusing exhale]

79
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,215
There’s something forming in the water.

80
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,135
So, you’re a Conjurer. It’s clear.

81
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,388
A Conjurer…

82
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,391
A type whose specialty 
is manifesting their aura.

83
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,851
I see.

84
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,312
I was hoping I would be an Enhancer.

85
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,273
Unfortunately, you can’t change 
what you’re born with.

86
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,025
But it isn’t hopeless.

87
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,235
You can still learn 
Enhancement techniques.

88
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,031
And that would make an excellent topic 
for us to go over today.

89
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,995
Now let’s say you have the aptitude

90
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:56,041
to achieve 100 percent 
mastery of Conjuration abilities.

91
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,003
At the most this is how much 
you could master the others.

92
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,174
HATSU - Enhancement 60%, Transmutation 80% 
Conjuration 100%, Emission 40% ...

93
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,176
It doesn’t matter 
how fast of a learner you are,

94
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,386
you can never completely 
master a different category.

95
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,972
The further a category is from your own,

96
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,515
the less you acquire.

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,435
Why is Specialist at zero?

98
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,188
Specialist is a unique category.

99
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,316
And their abilities aren’t the kind 
you can simply teach yourself.

100
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,401
They’re very distinct abilities,

101
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,154
either inherited or acquired naturally,

102
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,989
a product of your environment.

103
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,450
So why this position?

104
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,412
Because the adjacent categories, 
Conjurer and Manipulator,

105
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,540
have the greatest chance 
of becoming Specialists later on.

106
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,835
In that respect, you still have a chance…

107
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,170
in a way.

108
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,632
Do you… 
remember what you said?

109
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,635
[tired panting]

110
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,096
[Kurapika] I...

111
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,390
I need...

112
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,143
I need enough power to fight on my own!

113
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,656
[Mizuken] You might assume 
that the fastest means to your goal

114
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,574
would be through Enhancement abilities…

115
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,076
and you’d be right.

116
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,413
Enhancers are able to reinforce offense,

117
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,207
defense and healing most efficiently.

118
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,335
But since you’re a Conjurer,

119
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,172
you can only learn Enhancer abilities 
up to half potency.

120
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,967
If you try to exceed your limits,

121
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,219
it will cause you incredible strain

122
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,179
and that can weaken you.

123
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,849
It could even be fatal.

124
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,519
Consistent power

125
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,730
is the only way to stay on top.

126
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,066
If I were consistent in my abilities 
as a Conjurer,

127
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,485
do you think that 
it would that help me in a battle,

128
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,863
if I were pitted 
against a Master Enhancer?

129
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,656
[Mizuken] Hmm...

130
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,367
In short, it would be difficult.

131
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,121
When closely compared to an Enhancer’s 
offense and defense,

132
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,539
far more often than not

133
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,250
Conjurers are simply 
not as evenly balanced.

134
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,169
But that said,

135
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,297
you could actually be quite formidable, 
if you find your groove.

136
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,467
Here’s a quiz…

137
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,053
Can you conjure a sword

138
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,305
that’s able to cut through anything?

139
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,223
You can’t.

140
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,308
[Mizuken] Why not?

141
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,644
Because it exceeds 
the bounds of human capacity.

142
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,481
That’s exactly right.

143
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,442
There are things you can never conjure,

144
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,986
even with 100 percent mastery.

145
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,447
Of course,

146
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,742
you could conjure a sword 
that’s very sharp and sturdy.

147
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,704
But it would make a lot more sense 
to just go out and buy one.

148
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,540
You wouldn’t need extra training.

149
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,169
You can make the sword 
appear and disappear using Nen.

150
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,089
But conjured weapons 
just aren’t as effective.

151
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,091
The physical versions are better.

152
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,550
Unfortunately,

153
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,178
you can’t conjure anything 
that’s supernatural.

154
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,680
So, consider it carefully

155
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,682
and choose what you wish to conjure.

156
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,392
No mistakes allowed.

157
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,063
Conjuring something at will 
takes a lot of concentration,

158
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,357
not to mention training and time.

159
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,650
And that’s just what it takes

160
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,151
for one thing.

161
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,446
[Rei] What a surprise…

162
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,614
[Kurapika] Huh?

163
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,118
I don’t know many people 
who learned Nen in only six months.

164
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,996
So. What kind of employer do you want?

165
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,043
I’ll tell you something interesting 
about spiders…

166
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,843
Meet me in Yorknew City on September 1st.

167
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,638
I would prefer to find an employer

168
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,849
with strong ties to the Yorknew Auction.

169
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,767
The job is irrelevant.

170
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,603
[Rei] The Yorknew City auction…

171
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,525
The employers who have a lot of influence,

172
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,111
generally post the difficult jobs.

173
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,614
I doubt they’re looking to hire a Hunter 
with zero experience.

174
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,368
I see three.

175
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,453
Three employers who’ll decide

176
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,998
based on the interview 
and not on your record.

177
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,376
And it looks like all three 
are looking for bodyguards.

178
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,045
I’ll read, you choose, ‘k?

179
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,882
The first is a handgun buff.

180
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:18,136
He’s after the Misette Limited Edition 
Bull Snake Model S55,

181
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,971
number 001.

182
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,349
The second is a collector of fine china.

183
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,186
This one is seeking Rodo Memorial Plates

184
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,689
from 1655 to 1657.

185
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,399
And the third…

186
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,401
is a flesh collector...

187
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,489
Seeking a hide with a full body tattoo 
of a rising dragon,

188
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,202
the head of a child with Jelly Syndrome 
and a few others.

189
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,329
That sure is quite a hobby.

190
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,206
All right. Take your pick.

191
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,207
Huh?

192
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,210
[Mizuken] Chains?

193
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,171
[Kurapika] 
Yes. When you said I was a Conjurer,

194
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,548
that was the first thing 
that came to mind.

195
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,217
Interesting.

196
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,801
But why chains?

197
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,181
It’s because there are some people 
at large in the world right now,

198
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,600
who need to be chained to hell.

199
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,645
Oh, is that so?

200
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,898
Because I can’t shake 
the nagging suspicion

201
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,442
that you’re the one 
who’ll be chained down.

202
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,694
[Kurapika] What the hell do you know?

203
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,905
Wait a second! Where are you going?

204
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,823
I’m your teacher! Do as I say!

205
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,742
I’m not done talking to you!

206
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,993
Hold on, dammit!

207
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,414
Like I told you ordinary chains 
are pointless!

208
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,707
They’re inferior!

209
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,502
And conjuring 
some kind of unbreakable chain

210
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,212
is completely impossible!

211
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,141
[Kurapika] On September 1st,

212
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,768
Yorknew City will host

213
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,645
the world’s greatest auction.

214
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,815
That’s where the spider…

215
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,234
the Phantom Troupe will appear.

216
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,027
[chains jangling]

217
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,279
Huh?

218
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,493
That heartbeat…

219
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,830
It plays a horrible melody of rage…

220
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,841
So, you want me to find you an employer

221
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,176
with connections to the Yorknew auction?

222
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,678
Did I get that right?

223
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,887
That’s right.

224
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,848
Like the last guy who walked in.

225
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,849
Huh?

226
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,351
Same request twice today.

227
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,103
Amusing, is all.

228
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,105
The boy I just passed?

229
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,066
[Rei] Do you know him?

230
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,110
No, I don’t.

231
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,614
He’s interested in the auction, too?

232
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:45,950
But then…

233
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,703
why is his heartbeat so full of rage?

234
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:56,127
RITZ-CARLTON HOTEL

235
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,271
[cringing]

236
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,734
[thug 1] Eating with a twerp like that’ll 
only make your food taste worse.

237
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,695
[thug 2] 
Why don’t you let us take you out instead?

238
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,741
We’ll show you 
the best night of your life, sweetheart.

239
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,535
This isn’t a date, unfortunately.

240
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,496
I’m in the middle of a job.

241
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,122
A job? Really?

242
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,625
-[man cringing] 
-This is actually my employer.

243
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,752
He’s hired me as his bodyguard.

244
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,545
[thug 1] Bodyguard?

245
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,297
[thug 2] You’ve gotta be joking.

246
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,758
A babe like you… a bodyguard?

247
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,885
[all thugs laughing]

248
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,721
I’d be happy to let you guard my body…

249
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,392
I don't guard ugly men.

250
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,768
But thanks anyway.

251
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,396
Who do you think you’re talkin’ to?

252
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,522
Shut your--

253
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,111
[pervy cackle]

254
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,278
[woman] Instant Lover.

255
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,738
180-MINUTE LOVE SLAVE 
INSTANT LOVER

256
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,409
Every single person that I kiss

257
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,494
becomes my willing slave.

258
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,579
[panting]

259
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,206
What’s your command, mistress?

260
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,833
I live to serve you!

261
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,128
Beat them up for me.

262
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,964
Yes, ma’am! My pleasure!

263
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,006
[all three thugs] Huh?

264
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,800
[gleeful laughter]

265
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,886
[punches and grunting]

00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,599
[screaming in terror]

268
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,018
[tires screeching]

269
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,229
[annoyed grunt] He ran away.

270
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,357
Ah, well. 
Guess I’ll need another employer.

271
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,984
What a pain…

272
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,993
A splendid moon…

273
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,536
[guard 1] There he is!

274
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,996
[guard 2] We’ve got you now!

275
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:58,291
[guard 3] Hand over the corpse samples 
you stole, nice and easy!

276
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,667
[derisive snort]

277
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,918
Don’t interrupt.

278
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,421
Not my work and not this splendid moon.

279
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,589
[annoyed growl]

280
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,507
That’s enough! Put your hands up!

281
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,219
[Basho] I was on the verge 
of another masterful poem.

282
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,848
But you spoiled the moment, you imbeciles!

283
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,863
“Splendid full moon

284
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,866
and pursuers as clumsy as a baboon…”

285
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,660
[grunts] That sucks.

286
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,250
[birds chirping]

287
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,504
[Squala] Yes, I know, Eliza.

288
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,048
Well, if this job works out…

289
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,218
Yeah. There’s nothing to worry about.

290
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,511
I’ll handle it.

291
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,222
Right. I’ll take care of you and the dogs.

292
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,556
Really won’t be a problem.

293
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,059
So, don’t worry, Eliza.

294
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,811
Bear with me a little while longer.

295
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,314
Yeah. It’ll be fine.

296
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,233
You can count on me.

297
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,831
[doorbell sounds]

298
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,251
[Kurapika] 
I was sent by the employment agency.

299
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,127
My name is Kurapika.

300
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,927
[dogs growling]

301
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,520
Welcome. 
We’re happy that you could join us.

302
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,613
If you’d be so kind as to wait here.

303
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,387
[butler] Thank you for your patience.

304
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,015
It seems everyone has arrived,

305
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,019
so we will now begin 
going over the details of the contract.

306
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,400
I’ll start by going over the requirements.

307
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,653
I won’t ask whether or not

308
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,113
you have a License.

309
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,906
My only concern

310
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,701
is whether you can obtain 
the items we seek.

311
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,912
The auction, as you all know,

312
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,706
will begin in one month.

313
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,335
Before that time, 
find one item from the list provided

314
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,962
and then bring it safely back here.

315
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,548
Here you go.

316
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,426
These are the data cards you’re assigned.

317
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,269

[gasps]

00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:21,327
THE EYEBALLS OF A KURTA.

[seething]

00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,666
What?

325
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,293
Something wrong? 
You look a little pale.

326
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,338
Ah. The eyeballs of a Kurta, huh?

327
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,548
“Difficulty Level: A.

Preserve the post-mortem scarlet hue 
after death.

329
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,345
Complete set with head preferred."

330
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,097
Yeah, I’ve heard about that.

331
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,808
Their eyes turn red 
whenever they’re excited.

332
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,351
-You see, the Kurta-- 
-Shut up.

333
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,437
That’s enough.

334
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,608
[derisive snort]

335
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,320
I'll say it again:

336
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,408
All that’s required is one item 
from the list you’ve been given.

337
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,326
If you are successful,

338
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,703
you’ll be hired

339
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,456
and begin your training 
in security and acquisitions.

340
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,292
Well, then. Best of luck to you.

341
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,963
[Kurapika] I will pass this test.

342
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,383
First, I must ingratiate myself 
and win their trust.

343
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,555
In all likelihood, the man we saw 
was not the actual client,

344
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,392
thus, illustrating the distance 
between the client and myself.

345
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,062
It’s critical that I get 
as close to them as possible

346
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,816
until they eventually let their guard down 
and share their secrets.

347
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,863
There are two things 
that collectors always desire.

348
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,158
The first is any item of extreme rarity.

349
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,328
The second is colleagues to whom 
they can brag about their collection.

350
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,750
He must have connections 
to other flesh collectors...

351
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,836
those who share 
their disgusting acquisitions,

352
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,588
a network of scum.

353
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,841
I will infiltrate their ranks

354
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,760
and eradicate them all.

355
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,264
[mustached man] Hey… It won’t open.

356
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,642
[man on screen] 
I forgot to mention one thing:

357
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,646
the minimum requirement for the position 
is strength.

358
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,733
Enough strength 
to get out of this mansion...

359
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,902
with your lives.

360
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,089
[narrator] Kurapika pursues his quest

361
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,635
to avenge his brethren 
and punish the Phantom Troupe.

362
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,928
And right now,

363
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,056
he is preparing 
to enter a new battlefield.

364
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,393
[theme song playing]

365
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:58,878
[Gon] Coming up:

366
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,337
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

367
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,797
[both] Hunterpedia!

368
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,173
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

369
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,675
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

370
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,720
Today we’re introducing Mizuken, 
Kurapika’s teacher!

371
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,054
And he’s an Emitter type.

372
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,557
I guess Nen users are fated 
to meet Nen teachers.

373
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,725
It happened to us.

374
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,019
[both] Maybe that’s why we met each other. 
It’s fate!

375
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,194
[Gon] Next Time: "Nen x Users x Unite"?

376
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,529
[Killua] Hey, Gon…

377
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,656
Let's go break 
some of Milluki's figurines!

378
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,408
[Gon] Count me in as your accomplice!
