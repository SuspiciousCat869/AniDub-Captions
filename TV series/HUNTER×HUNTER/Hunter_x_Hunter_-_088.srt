Who do you think’ll
show tomorrow?

00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,921
I’ll put down 100,000

If neither of us wins,

Knov: Sure. Then i’ll put...

One million on them.

they’re gonna be ready by then!

Heh. I happen to love gambling,

Damn, he’s strong.

could it be?

Knuckle: Come on.
Let me see that technique,

- that "show me rock" thing.

not like you can use it,

not with it being
as flawed as it is, anyway.

Knov: A small word of advice--

352
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,777
if you do try that attack,
then you’re going down.

Don’t go thinkin’ you can use it

we might not be able
