Environment’s one thing,

Gon: They do? How?

226
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,248

00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:49,884
known as phagogenesis.

228
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,619
Gon: Phagogenesis?

229
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:52,887
Killua: What does it mean?

230
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:57,625
Kite: When a chimera ant queen
eats other creatures,

231
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,627
she’s then able
to impart characteristics

232
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,564
of those creatures on
to the subsequent generation.

233
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:06,200
So you see, in other words,

234
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,936
ingesting multiple species
allows her to pass on

235
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:13,974
a mix of all kinds of different
genes to her offspring.

236
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:18,812
With each feeding, she lays
between one and five eggs.

237
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:22,016
The first generation of births
are completely infertile,

238
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,185
so they become
worker or soldier ants.

239
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:28,723
They live their lives
in service to the queen

240
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,758
as well
as her eventual successors.

241
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,827
Those successors

242
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,797
become the king and queen
of the next generation.

243
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,166
The queen is always
looking to consume

244
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,234
the genes of strong organisms.

245
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:44,972
This allows her to pass their
traits down to her offspring,

246
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,808
and she may even devour
her preferred fodder species

247
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,509
to its complete extinction.

248
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,512
Gon: Extinction? Really?

249
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,680
Spin: Yes,
her appetite is voracious,

250
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,116
and it can drive her
to consume her own body weight

251
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,518
many times over in a single day.
