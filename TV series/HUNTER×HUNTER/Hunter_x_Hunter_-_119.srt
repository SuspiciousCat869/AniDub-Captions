164
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,842
If I didn’t know better,

165
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,644
i’d think you were trying
to lure me in there.

166
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,114
- ( Ikalgo groans )
- ( Bloster chuckles )

167
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,649
Too bad for you.

168
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,951
If only one path remains,

169
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:27,855
it’s just too good to be true.
Anyone would be suspicious.

170
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:31,825
Well, now I know you exist,
so that’s something.

171
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,260
( Laughs )

172
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,163
And I bet you’re hiding
in the surveillance room

173
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,266
to observe me, you chicken!

174
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,035
Ikalgo: Damn it. I was so close

175
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,272
to having him completely trapped
in that corridor,

176
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,875
but there’s no way out
from where he is now.

177
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,145
He’s still trapped.

178
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:54,081
Sleeping gas
will fill the room eventually,

179
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,249
and when it does...

180
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:59,419
( Gasps ) No! He isn’t trapped!

181
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,088
There’s still a way out!

182
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,092
Bloster: I should
probably get out of here.

183
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,095
I’m willing to bet
that’s sleeping gas.

184
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:12,699
Ikalgo: I have to do something
before he figures it out.

185
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,704
Wait. The armored vehicles
in the garage.

186
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,407
With those,
I could at least lock him in,

187
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,710
but then i’ll have no way
to get back upstairs.

188
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:28,115
Think. Is there
anything here I can use?

189
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,718
I’ve gotta think
of a plan fast!

190
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,857
Bloster: Looks like
i’m gonna have to blow
through this bulkhead.

191
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,926
Man, this is really getting
to be a pain in the rear.

192
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,333
Ikalgo: I’ve gotta do it!

193
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:58,845
Bloster: Damn. All that, and I
barely scorched the surface?

194
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,981
I guess i’m
just gonna have to come up

195
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,716
with something else then.

196
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,251
I know!

197
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,654
The bulkhead controls
are in the monitor room,

198
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:10,658
so I can go over there
to open the bulkheads.

199
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:12,826
Now we’re talkin’.

200
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,230
Wait. I have to go
through a bulkhead

201
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,265
to reach the monitor room.

202
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,966
Damn it all.

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,135
Looks like i’m still
gonna have to destroy this one

204
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,339
if I want any chance
of getting back upstairs.

205
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,874
Hang on.

206
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,212
I wonder.
There might be a way to escape

207
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,748
without busting down a bulkhead.

208
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,884
Huh?

209
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,987
It’s opening?

210
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,329
Is that a tank? ( Scoffs )

211
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:50,998
That’s exactly
the kind of thing

212
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,299
a gutless chicken would use.

213
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,269
But the bulkhead behind it’s
still shut,

214
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:59,907
and the door to the monitor room
is just beyond it.

215
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,911
Okay, that can
only mean one thing.

216
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:07,181
First, he closed
the front bulkhead,

217
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,917
and then he parked
the vehicle there.

218
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,919
Then he returned
to the monitor room

219
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,054
and started raising
the front bulkhead

220
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,056
and lowering the back one.

221
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,726
Once he did,
he raced back to the vehicle.

222
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,731
Doesn’t that mean
that he’s trapped, too?

223
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:26,934
He blocked off
his only escape route

224
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,736
just to force a showdown?

225
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,939
Hah! You’re kidding.

226
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,774
Seriously? Come on.

( Laughs )

228
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:39,012
So I guess there must be
someone else around here,

229
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,749
and they must be sitting
up in the control room

230
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:44,084
watching me. How dare they?!

231

Well, watch this,
you peeping Tom,

232

your little buddy
