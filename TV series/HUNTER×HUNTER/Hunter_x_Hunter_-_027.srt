1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:02,461
Make money while we’re training?

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,839
At the Heavens Arena.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,175
Heavens Arena…?

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,677
Yeah! I’ll explain later.

5
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,804
But we really ought to get going now!

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:13,972
[Gon] Right!

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,067
[theme song playing]

8
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,482
Whoa! Look, it’s huge!

9
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,775
Yep.

10
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,235
That’s Heavens Arena.

11
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,571
It’s two 251 stories,

12
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,740
and 991 meters tall,

13
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,492
making it the world’s fourth 
tallest building.

14
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,996
So, this is where we’ll be training…

15
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,753
Well, the tickets 
we bought to get us here,

16
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,046
left us completely broke.

17
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,298
We’ve gotta make more while we’re here.

18
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,550
We’ll start fresh when we disembark.

19
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,302
Right! I got it.

20
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,888
All right. Well? Let’s go!

21
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,097
[Gon] Okay!

22
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:24,061
ARRIVAL x AT x THE ARENA

23
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,397
[narrator] Gon and Killua 
head to Heavens Arena

24
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,399
with only one goal in mind:

25
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,068
to get stronger.

26
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,569
[Killua] Gon.

27
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,990
[Gon] This is a really long line.

28
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,201
Is everyone going to Heavens Arena?

29
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,329
There aren’t any rules to worry about.

30
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,373
Not like there were for the Hunter Exam.

31
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,917
You just gotta knock your opponent out.

32
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,168
Oh…

33
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,630
The higher you go, 
the more prize money you make.

34
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,049
If you want to earn a living 
with your fists,

35
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,051
this is as good as it gets!

36
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:58,620
[receptionist] Welcome to Heavens Arena.

37
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,890
Now, if you wouldn’t mind 
filling out this form…

38
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,564
Killua Zoldyck, you’re number 2054.

39
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,234
Gon Freecss, you are 2055.

40
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,277
On the first arena floor,

41
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,071
they’ll be calling you by your number,

42
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,823
so try not to forget it.

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,574
Please go on ahead.

44
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,372
[cheering]

45
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,462
Wow…!

46
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,297
[grunting]

47
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,427
-Looking good! 
-Do it!

48
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,679
It's been a while,

49
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,347
but the place hasn't changed.

50
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,433
Wait… you mean you’ve been here before?

51
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,185
Yeah. When I was about six.

52
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,563
My dad left me here flat broke.

53
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,482
Told me to reach 200th floor.

54
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,484
Took me two whole years.

55
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,153
Two years?

56
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,363
I mean, sure, he was only six…

57
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,157
but it took him that long?

58
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,993
There are guys of Hisoka’s caliber

59
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,287
but only farther up, so don’t waste time.

60
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,164
-Ya got it? 
-Uh-huh.

61
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:12,461
[announcer] Numbers 1973 and 2055.

62
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,754
to ring E.

63
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,131
2055! That's me!

64
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,509
Oh, man, I’m getting pretty nervous 
right about now.

65
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,596
Gon. You made it 
through the Testing Gate, right?

66
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,555
Hm?

67
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,390
So, relax.

68
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,977
[man 1] Check it out! It’s just a kid!

69
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,481
[man 2] Hey! 
Ya better run while you still can, kid!

70
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,524
[man 3] This ain’t a game!

71
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,402
Give him a punch and send him flying!

72
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,281
This is a first-floor fight

73
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,575
so we will be appraising 
your skill levels.

74
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,494
You’re allowed three minutes 
to demonstrate

75
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,995
what you’re capable of.

76
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,208
Now then… Begin!

77
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,001
-I’m real sorry, kid. 
-[flexing knuckles]

78
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,504
But I’ll make it fast, 
so you don’t have to suffer!

79
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,758
You made it 
through the Testing Gate, right?

80
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,011
So, relax! Go out there and push hard!

81
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,971
Okay, so just…

82
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,807
push hard!

83
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,058
[screams]

84
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:12,854
No way!

85
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,939
Nice!

86
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,565
[impressed callouts]

87
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,692
[man 2] That kid’s incredible!

88
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,319
[man 1] What crazy power!

89
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,364
When did I get so strong?

90
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,079
2055, proceed directly to floor 50.

91
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,041
Okay!

92
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,836
[impressed callouts]

93
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,254
[man 2] Look at that!

94
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,131
That first kid’s not the only one 
who’s a beast!

95
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,425
[beeping]

96
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,468
Wait.

97
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,221
This says you’ve already been 
to the 200th floor?

98
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,598
And those were some powerful moves.

99
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,268
All right. Go to the 180th floor--

100
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,811
Nah. I’ll start at 50.

101
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,770
[referee] Huh?

102
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,313
I want to take it slow.

103
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,651
[impressed callouts]

104
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,655
[referee] Enough!

105
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,741
[man 1] 
Whoa! That kid’s pretty powerful, too!

106
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,038
You’re permitted to advance 
to the 50th floor.

107
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,958
Osu! Thank you!

108
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,256
[female guide] 
The first 200 floors of Heavens Arena

109
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,092
are divided into classes, ten floors each.

110
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,138
Which means that a fighter 
who wins on the 50th floor,

111
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,848
advances to the 60th.

112
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,394
Lose and they automatically drop down 
to the 40th floor.

113
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,937
[Gon] So that’s how it works…

114
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,314
[Killua] Also…

115
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,025
I’ve heard once you get all the way 
to the 100th floor,

116
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,484
they comp you your very own room!

117
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,947
Oh! I’m sorry, how impolite!

118
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,867
Osu! My name is Zushi!

119
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,201
And you?

120
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,578
I'm Killua.

121
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,871
My name’s Gon.

122
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:53,997
Nice to meet you.

123
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,249
-[elevator dings] 
-[guide] Here we are.

124
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,087
[Zushi] Oh, I watched your fights earlier.

125
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,505
You guys are amazing!

126
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,466
What are you talking about?

127
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,093
You made it up here 
with only one match, too.

128
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,261
He’s right!

129
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,512
No, no.

130
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,431
I still have a long way to go.

131
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,975
By the way, 
what discipline do you practice?

132
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,686
I study the Shingen-ryu technique.

133
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,064
A discipline? Don’t have one.

134
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,231
Nope.

135
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,566
You’re kidding!

136
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,611
You’re both that powerful 
with no formal training?

137
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,197
I’m humbled to be in your presence.

138
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,282
I’ve come a long way, 
but I’m not finished!

139
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,617
[someone clapping their hands.]

140
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,661
[man] Zushi!

141
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,412
You did well.

142
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,622
Thank you, Master!

143
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,667
I’m very happy to see 
that you stuck to my teachings.

144
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,753
Osu! I am honored.

145
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,589
But Master your shirt’s untucked.

146
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,883
Oh! Sorry about that.

147
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,301
[nervous giggle]

148
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,511
Who are they?

149
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,680
Oh. This is Killua and Gon.

150
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,349
Pleasure to meet you. 
My name is Wing.

151
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,142
[both] Osu!

152
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,603
I really wasn’t expecting 
to see any other kids here

153
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,813
besides Zushi.

154
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,107
So, what brings the two of you here?

155
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,441
Uh, we--

156
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,986
well, we want to become stronger.

157
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,654
But we’re also pretty broke,

158
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,198
so we’re making money 
at exactly the same time.

159
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,826
Yeah. Killua’s been here before, sir.

160
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,160
That right?

161
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,537
You must be quite talented

162
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,789
or else you wouldn’t have made it 
to this level.

163
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,749
Even so, pay close attention

164
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,419
to your opponent’s body and your own.

165
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,962
[both] Osu!

166
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,466
[female staffer] 
Killua, Gon, and Zushi. Ah, there we are.

167
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,427
Hand me your tickets, please.

168
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,142
Here. This is your prize money 
from the earlier fight.

169
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,939
152 jenny...

170
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,653
On this floor, you make just enough 
for a juice, win or lose.

171
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,488
But on all of the other floors here

172
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,073
a loss gets you nothing.

173
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,118
Winning on the 50th floor 
earns fifty thousand.

174
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,453
Fifty thousand?!

175
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,246
That’s a lot of money!

176
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,499
The 100th floor, 
I think you get a million.

177
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,962
Once you're past the 150th floor, 
you get ten million.

178
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,464
Ten million?

179
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,467
Didn’t you make it to 200th floor before?

180
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,343
Whoa! The 200th floor?

181
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,764
[Gon] How much do you get 
for winning on the 200th floor?

182
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,558
To tell the truth, 
I don’t actually know that.

183
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,519
because I quit pretty 
much as soon as I qualified for it.

184
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,189
But when I won on the 190th floor,

185
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,357
I had around 200 million in total.

186
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,359
Two hundred...

187
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,111
Where's that money now?

188
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,988
[Killua] That was four years ago,

189
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,573
so it’s long gone by now.

190
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,241
I spent all of it on snacks!

191
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,827
That much on snacks in four years?

192
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,496
What kind of snacks were they?

193
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,124
Hey. Let’s head up to the waiting room.

194
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,877
We got through our matches unscathed 
on the first floor.

195
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,171
They’ll probably give us 
another one today.

196
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,518
Well, if these guys are our opponents,

197
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,685
it’ll be a cinch.

198
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,020
Just take it easy.

199
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,021
Really?

200
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,190
-Killua! 
-[quiet grumble]

201
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,734
Quiet! They can hear you!

202
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,904
[announcer] 2054, Mister Killua.

203
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,030
Hey, I’m already up.

204
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,158
[announcer] And 1963, Mister Zushi.

205
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,159
Huh?!

206
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,788
[announcer] 
Please head to Arena A on the 57th floor.

207
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,040
Okay.

208
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,918
Osu! I am honored to face you!

209
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,045
I bet. Well, you can’t win ‘em all.

210
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,839
Better luck next time, right?

211
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,298
Catch ya later, Gon.

212
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,260
Yeah. Best of luck to both of you guys!

213
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,096
I’ll wait on the floor above. Bye.

214
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,347
[Gon] ‘kay!

215
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,103
He didn’t have to act 
like it was such a done deal.

216
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,898
[commentator] All right, everyone!

217
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,775
This is the event 
you’ve all been waiting for!

218
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,694
A unique match-up between two young boys

219
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,071
who’ve both got something to prove!

220
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,199
But don’t underestimate these fighters!

221
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,702
Both had strong showings 
in their first rounds

222
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,789
and now they’ve jumped all the way up here 
to the 50th floor!

223
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,166
ZUSHI - KILLUA

224
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,001
And now let’s take a look 
at the big screen

225
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,295
for the playback of those events!

226
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,673
Killua beat his opponent in a flash!

227
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,385
One chop was all it took to knock him out!

228
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,266
Zushi used martial arts 
to punish his opponent

229
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,893
scoring a flawless knockout

230
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,562
against a giant weighing 
over 200 kilograms!

231
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,775
Okay now, everyone!

232
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,944
Ready to press your wager buttons?

233
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,864
Go on! Make your picks right now!

234
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,701
[jingle]

235
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,872
[commentator] All the bets are in, 
and we have a clear favorite! Zushi!

236
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:46,956
[irked grumble]

237
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,043
[commentator] Maybe his knowledge 
of martial arts has given him the edge!

238
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,003
[Zushi] This isn’t good…

239
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,504
Killua is mad.

240
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,715
Three rounds!

241
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,801
Three minutes per round 
decided by points or K.O.!

242
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,886
Begin!

243
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,849
[Killua] I see.

244
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,352
His stance doesn’t leave many openings.

245
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,270
He’s trained hard to master it.

246
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,649
But he doesn’t stand a chance against me.

247
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,362
[commentator] Wow! Killua is walking 
boldly toward his opponent!

248
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,241
[strangled cry]

249
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,370
[Killua] Sorry, but I’m sticking 
to one chop per match

250
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,455
‘til I reach the 150th floor.

251
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,124
A clean hit!

252
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,255
[commentator] Killua has laid out 
another opponent with a single blow!

253
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,132
A clean hit and a knockout 
earn him two points!

254
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,594
As you know 
under the points and knockout system,

255
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,223
there are clean hits, 
critical hits, and knockdowns.

256
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,435
Great attacks count as ‘clean hits’, 
worth one point each.

257
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,813
Superb attacks are ‘critical hits’,

258
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,314
and are worth two points.

259
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,858
Knocking your opponent down is one point.

260
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,696
Collect ten points and you’re awarded 
a technical knockout.

261
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,907
Of course, if your opponent 
can’t continue the fight after one hit

262
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,826
you win by knockout!

263
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,829
[Killua] Pretty sure that chop ended it. 
Idiot.

264
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,914
Can you fight?

265
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,874
Yes! I’m all right!

266
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,961
[commentator] He got up!

267
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,046
Zushi will continue the match!

268
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,382
And begin!

269
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,427
[Killua] Did I hold back too much?

270
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,846
[Zushi grunting]

271
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,597
[Zushi roars]

272
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,057
[cries out]

273
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,518
[commentator] He’s taken another hit!

274
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,145
Zushi is down!

275
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,982
But he’s getting up 
before the referee reaches him,

276
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,401
meaning Killua won’t be awarded the point!

277
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,946
[grunts] He’s good.

278
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,157
I’ll have to change my tactics.

279
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,619
But something’s not right.

280
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,413
That attack was so strong

281
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,707
that even if I just grazed him, 
he’d be out cold.

282
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,586
[Zushi] Unbelievable!

283
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,838
Such awesome power and speed!

284
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,215
At this rate, I won’t stand a chance!

285
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,719
But I’ve gotta try.

286
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,220
I have to!

287
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,703
[commentator] Uh-oh! What’s happening?

288
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,747
It looks like Killua is on the run!

289
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,624
[yells] Zushi!

290
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,183
[commentator] So...

291
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,894
a very loud and overenthusiastic spectator

292
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,646
has temporarily interrupted the fight

293
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,315
but let’s see 
if we can get it going again!

294
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,567
Come on folks, whaddya say?

295
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,529
ELEVATOR

296
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,655
[elevator dings]

297
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,950
Oh, hey! Killua! 
Over here!

298
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,662
Check it out! I got 60000.

299
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,247
How about you?

300
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,999
It took you longer to get here 
than I expected.

301
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,335
Yeah, I ran into some trouble.

302
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,672
So, was Zushi pretty strong? 
Or what?

303
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,382
No way… No.

304
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,342
He has potential.

305
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,177
He’ll be strong one day.

306
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,720
For now, anyway,

307
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,722
he’s just target practice for me.

308
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,224
Punches that weak,

309
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,017
I could knock him around easy.

310
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,230
But I couldn’t beat him.

311
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,523
Huh?

312
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,108
I won the match.

313
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,734
TKO by points.

314
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,154
But still I just couldn’t knock him out.

315
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,739
Also…

316
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,409
When he changed his stance,

317
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,411
I got this real creepy feeling,

318
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,121
like when I face my brother.

319
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,042
I don't know what it was,

320
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,545
but it felt... dangerous.

321
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,131
It’s gotta be some kind of technique.

322
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,259
I heard his master

323
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,136
call it ‘Ren’.

324
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,141
[Zushi] Please! Forgive me, Master!

325
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,685
[Wing] I thought I made it clear to you

326
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,146
that you were not [supposed 
to use Ren yet, Zushi.

327
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,025
[Zushi] I’m sorry! 
It’s just... he-- he was so strong,

328
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,651
I couldn't help myself.

329
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,031
Yes. I understand the urge to win.

330
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,908
But you have another goal.

331
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,576
A goal that lies beyond this.

332
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,454
At the top floor of this tower.

333
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,500
Don’t focus too much 
on simply winning, Zushi.

334
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,169
Impatience will only erode your potential.

335
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:44,670
Osu!

336
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,633
You must be prepared to lose 
a thousand times while you’re here.

337
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,759
[Zushi] Osu!

338
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,346
So, he’s not supposed to use Ren?

339
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,349
Until he gets all the way up 
to the top floor, I mean?

340
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,186
That’s where 
the strongest fighters are, right?

341
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,729
At the top?

342
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,191
Gon. We need to change our plan.

343
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,400
Huh?

344
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,529
I say we shoot for the top floor.

345
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,030
Right!

346
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,537
Actually, that’s been my plan 
this whole time!

347
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,253
-[crowd cheering] 
-[fighter grunts]

348
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,338
[commentator] 
Killua defeats another opponent

349
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,715
with one chop for a knockout win!

350
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,718
Now there’s action over in the next arena.

351
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,347
Gon has knocked out another opponent 
with a single push!

352
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,101
Each of them has won 
six consecutive matches

353
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,519
over the past three days,

354
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,981
And they’ve reached the hundreds 
without even a scratch to show for it!

355
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,607
[jingle]

356
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,401
Killua's chop.

357
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,027
and Gon’s push.

358
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,988
They seem unstoppable.

359
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,489
But can they keep it up?

360
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,700
But the real question is

361
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,703
who if anyone can stop them?

362
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,210
Yay! Our own room!

363
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,087
[laughing]

364
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,132
We’re not gonna have to worry 
about money and lodging anymore!

365
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,634
I wouldn’t be so sure.

366
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,303
Try to remember,

367
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,722
drop below the 100th floor 
and you lose the room.

368
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,725
There’s a huge difference 
between getting here

369
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,602
and staying here on the 100th floor.

370
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,104
It’s a real threshold.

371
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,355
Threshold?

372
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,817
Beyond the 100th floor, 
you get special treatment.

373
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,571
And so, naturally, 
no one wants to lose their standing.

374
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,324
There are people here 
who’ll do anything it takes

375
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,950
to stay on the 100th floor.

376
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,412
You can waste a lot of time on ‘em.

377
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,497
Time we don’t have right now.

378
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,791
So be careful, Gon.

379
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,505
[crowd cheering]

380
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,134
[commentator] 
Gon wins another match with a single push!

381
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,429
[Killua] 
Guess I didn’t need to worry about him.

382
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,606
[crowd cheering]

383
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,068
Your prize money has been deposited 
into your account.

384
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,529
[Gon] You were right.

385
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,740
I've never seen so many zeros before.

386
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,661
Crazy that just last week, 
I was totally broke.

387
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,955
I’m a little bit annoyed.

388
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,082
Huh?

389
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,626
The first time I was here,

390
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,879
it took me two whole months 
to reach floor 150.

391
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,881
You, on the other hand...

392
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,384
Yeah, but back then, you were only six.

393
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,345
Well yeah, there’s that.

394
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,180
[Gon] Oh, by the way,

395
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,599
I saw Zushi on TV earlier.

396
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,059
[Killua] Yeah, so did I.

397
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,894
He’s still on the 50th floor.

398
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,942
I wonder what that ‘Ren’ thing was 
that creeped you out.

399
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,235
And why.

400
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,112
[Killua] It’s weird, huh?

401
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,115
Hmm...

402
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,618
Maybe we’ll meet 
some opponents higher up who use it.

403
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,994
Or maybe...

404
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,038
it’d be faster to just ask Zushi!

405
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,212
Ren is one of the Four Exercises.

406
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,800
The Four Exercises are fundamental 
to all martial arts.

407
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,428
They instill discipline 
and develop character.

408
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,349
“Learn Ten, know Zetsu, 
through Ren to attain Hatsu!”

409
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,227
And all of that is how you train for Nen!

410
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,646
-That’s it! 
-Start making sense!

411
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,398
[Wing] Zushi…

412
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,233
Are you certain

413
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,736
that you’re sufficiently qualified 
to be teaching others?

414
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,947
Now, Gon, Killua…

415
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,615
An old proverb warns:

416
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,118
that it’s possible 
a smattering of knowledge

417
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,911
may not reduce one’s ignorance,

418
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,413
but increase it.

419
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,958
So, you’re saying a little knowledge 
is a dangerous thing’?

420
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,003
Thanks for the tip, 
but I really want to learn this.

421
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,132
Because I’m convinced 
it’s behind my brother’s powers.

422
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,511
You say that your brother...

423
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,472
is able to use Nen?

424
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,225
I need to understand 
what Nen and Ren even mean!

425
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,644
And not just halfway.

426
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,146
I need to know it!

427
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,231
If you’re willing to teach me,

428
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,734
I won’t try to figure it out for myself.

429
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,701
Well, in that case…

430
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,705
Let’s adjourn to my room.

431
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,876
[narrator] Questions abound.

432
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,253
What is Nen? What is Ren?

433
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:41,675
Killua believes they’re related 
to his older brother Illumi’s abilities.

434
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,763
Gon wants to know 
what these words mean, as well.

435
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,683
[theme song playing]

436
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,209
[Gon] Coming up:

437
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,794
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

438
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,296
[Gon and Killua] Hunterpedia!

439
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,381
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

440
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,049
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

441
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,260
Today we’ll be introducing Zushi!

442
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,053
He’s really, really talented.

443
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,598
In fact, he’s considered 
one in a hundred thousand!

444
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,933
While Gon and I are 
one in a hundred million!

445
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,018
Osu!

446
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,234
[Gon] Next time:

447
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,736
"Nen x And x Nen."

448
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,029
That was a rough one!

449
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,572
[Killua] But you hung in there!

450
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,990
[both] Osu!
