It’s not at all worth eating,

Neferpitou: Might I offer you
some more advice?

173
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,411
there is a way that you
can easily identify rare humans.

174
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:32,746
All you have to do is--

175
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,352
king: Do you dare to mock me?

176
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:42,522
I am aware that one can see
the energy surrounding a body

177
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,425
by focusing the eyes,

178
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,761
so you judge
according to its quantity.

179

you can forgive my insolence.

before it’s clear
if the human is rare or not.

But I have alleviated my hunger.
