166
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,708
We’ll never
lose illumi like that!

167
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,945
We need at least six airships
going different ways!

168
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,781
You guys better split up
and go make the arrangements!

169
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,783
Canary: This airship
will take us

170
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,485
straight to our destination.

00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:52,787
Amane: Fine.

172
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,356
Canary: We’ll have to pay
for two tickets,

173
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,424
or else they’ll
figure out it’s unmanned.

174
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:00,294
Amane: I know that!
Do I look like an idiot?

175
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,464
Canary: Um, I don’t know
how to read this.

176
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,232
Amane: Just ask the clerk.

177
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,567
Canary: But what names
do you think

178
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,767
we should put
the tickets under?

179
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:08,803
Amane: Oh, come on!

180
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,738
Can’t you think for yourself?!

181
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,738
( Gasps )

182

00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,349
Oh, god damn it!

( Gasps ) Hold on!

185
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,619
You were pestering me
as a distraction

186
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,254
so they could escape,
weren’t you?

187
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,623
Canary: Whatever do you mean?

188
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,860
( Amane groans )
We have to go after them!

189
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,362
- Canary: That’s on you.
- Amane: Huh?!

190
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,765
Canary: As soon as i’ve
dispatched the other flights,

191
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,700
i’ll ride on one of them.

192
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,935
If you follow them
using ground transport,

193
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,872
- be sure you aren’t followed.
- Amane: Wait. What?

194
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,674
If you follow them by air,
it will be a lot more obvious!

195
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,543
Are you out
of your flipping mind?!

196
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,880
Canary: That wasn’t my plan.
I’ll just be a decoy.

197
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,415
And since i’m going
to meet up with gotoh,

198
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,685
it’ll be a whole lot easier
to move there by airship.

199
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:02,422
Hmm.

I can’t get in touch
with Mr. Gotoh.

Killua: Got it.
I’ll try giving him a call.

218
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,851
Morel: Wait. So he wants
to kill your brother?

219
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,287
Killua: Yeah.
If we’re gonna heal gon,

alluka’s the only one
who can do it.

Problem is,
illumi wants to kill alluka.

Thing is, if my wish is granted,

223

it may end up wiping out
my entire family.

I still don’t see why

we don’t wait for them
around the hospital.

our chance for failure
starts to increase.

229

All of killua’s friends
will be swarming the area.

And if we just
hang around waiting,

Wow. That’s a dangerous ability.

Imagine what would happen
if the wrong hands got to it.

248

Killua: Illumi will probably

follow the airships by ground.

250
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,858
My butlers
have dispatched seven decoys.

I know my brother doesn’t have
any allies for this,

so he’ll use the needle people.

Morel: What are those?

254
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,101
Killua: He uses
special nen needles

255
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,171
to create soldiers to do
his bidding until they die.

256

Illumi’s powerful aura enters
the victims through the needles.

they turn into puppets,

Grab the needle people.
Can you do that?

If we have proof
he’s harmed people,

all innocent civilians,
beyond recovery...

( Morel gasps )

268
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,483
Narrator: Killua sought
to confirm this theory

269
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,185
because of a statement made

270
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,921
in a particular section
of the hunter bylaws.

271
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:58,258
Article four of the hunter
bylaws states,

272
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,094
"hunters shall not
target other hunters.

273
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,798
"The one exception shall be that
if the hunter to be targeted

274
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:07,401
has committed heinous crimes."

275
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,307
Killua: I believe
that some of the candidates

276
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,708
had eyes on the bylaws.

277
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,410
They were talking
about revising them,

278
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,611
as well as the hunter exam.

279
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:22,516
If we catch illumi,
we both know how that will go.

280
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,319
It’ll just drum up
sympathy for their cause.

( Morel gasps ) Wait! You sure?

Killua: He’s trying
to hurt alluka,

and that’s something
I can’t forgive,

not my big brother, not anyone.

Teradein and bushidora
will probably agree to help.

291
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:58,251
There should be plenty of
hunters who’ll lend us a hand.

292
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,121
Since you’ve decided
to come to the city

293
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,458
where the hunter association
headquarters is located,

294
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,627
you’ll be right under our noses.

295
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:11,265
That said, i’ll make sure
that everyone knows

296
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,800
how dangerous our opponent is.

297
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,635
We won’t touch illumi.

298
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,371
We’ll just capture
all of the needle people.

Killua: Yeah. Sounds good.

300

Man: All right.

301
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,449
I’ve accessed
parasta airport’s flight logs.

302
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,518
There are six airships that
will be landing in this area

303
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,588
within 20 to 30 kilometers
of the hospital.

304
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,757
As for killua and his butlers,

305
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:39,193
we’re not sure
where they’ll land,

306
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,629
and illumi can’t pursue
what he can’t see.

307
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:45,265
He and the needle people
will try to stay

308
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,134
within visual range
of the airships

309
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:48,903
as they follow on the ground.

310
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:52,206
Man 2: They’ll be vulnerable
to attack at a number of points

311
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,841
before they reach swardani city,
where the hospital is,

312
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,377
so of course
we need to send hunters

313
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,446
to each of those checkpoints.

314
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,815
Man 1: We have
one main priority,

the capture
of the needle people.

316

Teradein:
We can confirm needles later!

317
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:08,556
Just capture anyone
approaching the airship!

318

00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,403
Hisoka: Okay.

323
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,206
This is gonna get busy.

324
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,145
Bushidora: Not surprised.

325
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:34,815
I always knew that article four
was fundamentally flawed.

326
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:38,786
We can’t just wait for a crisis
like this to appear,

327
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,754
not when the hunter
association’s honor

328
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:42,122
is at stake.

329
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,124
Teradein:
The problem is that the exam

330
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,526
needs to be more selective.

331
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,829
If good behavior was
a prerequisite for joining,

332
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,432
well, we wouldn’t
have this problem.

333
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,733
Loupe: The time has come

334
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,169
for we three members
of the anti-netero faction

335
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,705
to have more pull
in the association.

336
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,676
Teradein: Hello, everyone.

337
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:06,647
Today I, teradein,
joined forces with loupe,

338
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,482
as well as our associate,
bushidora.

339
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,219
Now, we three
are most commonly known

340
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,121
as the anti-netero faction,

341
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,490
but that’s not a name
of our choosing.

342
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:19,460
The hunter souls deep within us

343
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,495
were inherited
from the former chairman,

344
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:24,865
as so many of yours were.
Of that, I can assure you.

345
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:29,703
And so, in order
to carry out his will,

346
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,506
we seek to reinstate
the highly versatile team

347
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,542
to which
the former chairman belonged.

348
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:38,779
As many of you may recall,
this elite group was known as...

349
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:42,650
The legendary
pure paladin squad.

350
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:46,320
Bushidora:
Teradein, the leader,

351
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,722
loupe, his deputy,

352
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:52,226
and finally I,
bushidora ambitious, am honored

353
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,128
to serve as the captain
of the new pure paladins.

354
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:59,599
To express our solidarity during
this critical election process,

355
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,136
we have only one request,
and that is that all your votes

356
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,538
be cast for our leader.

357
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,607
If you agree with our message,

358
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:09,709
give your support
to our ally, teradein,

359
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:14,147
and together we’ll know
the sweet taste of victory.

360
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:18,151
Loupe: Also, as we continue to
address our faction’s message,

361
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,920
we would be remiss
not to mention

362
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,889
that we have recently
received information

363
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,424
from a very reliable
and trustworthy source

364
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,393
which states
that multiple parties

365
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,564
have found a certain hunter
guilty of many egregious crimes.

366
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,167
Teradein:
I would like to announce

367
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,535
that we are currently
pursuing this hunter.

368
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:41,308
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us come together

369
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,777
to start to rebuild
the hunter association

370
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:47,181
with wisdom and integrity
as our tools.
