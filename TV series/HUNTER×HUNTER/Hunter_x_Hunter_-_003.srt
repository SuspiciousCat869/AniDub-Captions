2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,796
[narrator] Strange beasts

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,840
and monsters.

4
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,676
Vast riches.

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,637
Hidden treasures.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,015
Evil haunts.

7
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,809
Uncharted frontiers.

8
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,396
“The mysterious unknown.”

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,151
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words…

10
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,153
are called…

11
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,867
Hunters.

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,917
[theme song playing]

13
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,578
[Kiriko] Alright! We’ll now take you 
straight to the site of the exam.

14
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,999
Oh, wow! Isn’t it incredible 
that we all passed?

15
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,043
[Kurapika] I wouldn’t celebrate just yet.

16
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,587
We’ve merely earned the right 
to take the Exam.

17
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,921
[Leorio] It’s progress!

18
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,132
I say that calls for a little celebration!

00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:17,262

00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,808
ZABAN CITY

21
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,353
[narrator] 
With the help of the Kiriko Navigators,

22
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,105
Gon and his new friends 
arrive in Zaban City

23
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,900
the location of this year’s Hunter Exam.

24
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:34,655
A Navigator’s main job is to identify 
worthy applicants for the Hunter Exam.

25
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,783
We’re also responsible 
for guiding them to the Exam site.

26
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,326
You see,

27
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,412
that’s because it’s almost impossible 
to find the location

28
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,623
without a Navigator.

29
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,500
[shopkeeper] Who wants a taste?

30
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,087
It’s Zaban’s world famous panda-frog 
on a stick!

31
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,755
A delicacy!

32
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,801
This brooch here was excavated 
from Zaban’s underground palace.

33
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,469
It’s a real find.

34
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,097
You know Zaban City

35
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,807
is one shady place.

36
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,726
[Kurapika] 
A city that’s as prosperous as this one

37
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,938
is bound to attract its share 
of unsavory characters.

38
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,065
Wow!

39
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,073
What do you think you’re doing, Gon? 
Let’s go!

40
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,491
Right!

41
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,793
[man] Here we are.

42
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,295
I’m pretty sure that’s the building.

43
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,633
Whoa...

44
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,511
[Gon] It’s so tall!

45
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,680
Wow, what a nice place!

46
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,599
[Leorio] So that’s the Exam site, huh?

47
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,813
And this is the crowd that it draws.

48
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,190
Hunter applicants 
from all across the world

49
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,400
congregate here.

50
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,779
My first shot at the Hunter Exam.

51
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,699
I wonder if this is how Dad felt!

52
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,576
[Kiriko son] Hey, guys!

53
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,036
-Over here. 
-[all three] Huh?

54
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,539
This is it.

55
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,585
GOHAN

56
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,795
[Leorio] 
Come on, you’re messing with us, right?

57
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,506
It just looks like a regular restaurant.

58
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,051
You’re tellin’ me that Hunter applicants 
from all over the globe

59
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,679
come to this old dive to take the Exam?

60
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,097
That’s exactly right.

61
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,056
[all three] Huh?

62
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,019
[man] The Hunter Exam attracts 
millions of applicants every year.

63
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,439
And no one would expect the Exam 
to be held here, right?

64
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,774
[Leorio] Good point.

65
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,571
Welcome! Take a seat!

66
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,323
[man] Is the back room available?

67
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,949
What are you having?

68
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,495
The steak combo, please. 
The one that’ll make us see the light.

69
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,121
Make it three.

70
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,207
Combo for three, eh?

71
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,000
How do you want ‘em cooked?

72
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,254
Grilled slowly over a low flame 
‘til done, please.

73
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,632
Got it. See yourselves to the back room.

74
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,260
[Gon] Mmm...

75
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,472
[man] Okay, wait here.

76
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,556
[Leorio] For what?

77
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,266
Where are all the other applicants

78
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,019
-[Gon] I can’t wait for that steak combo! 
-[Leorio chuckles]

79
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,272
Gon, that was just the password 
to get us inside.

80
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,565
There’s no steak combo.

81
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,817
Okay.

82
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,443
So, we don’t get to eat?

83
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:20,979
[Kiriko son] Only one in ten thousand.

84
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,657
You’re very lucky.

85
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,867
That’s how many ever make it this far.

86
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,702
Nice job.

87
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,412
You did great for first-timers.

88
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,498
Well. Good luck to you.

89
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,042
Thanks for your help!

90
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,510
I hope that next year, 
I can help you again.

91
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,264
[bang]

92
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,140
[Leorio] Whoa!

93
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,104
It seems this room 
is actually an elevator.

94
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,402
That explains it.

95
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,988
That bastard thinks 
he’ll see us again next year

96
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,865
because he expects us to fail!

97
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,117
[Kurapika] Once every three years.

98
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,076
What's that?

99
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,787
It’s how often a rookie passes the Exam.

100
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,081
[Gon] It’s that unusual?

101
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,041
It is.

102
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,459
Some can’t handle it.

103
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,962
It’s too mentally and physically taxing.

104
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,006
It’s also not too uncommon

105
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,968
for veterans to break the rookies so badly 
that they never retake the test.

106
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,679
So that’s why people 
who want to be Hunters

107
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,723
are willing to risk everything for it.

108
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,601
You’ve hit the nail right on the head, 
my little friend!

109
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,230
Being a Hunter means making 
more money than anyone in the world!

110
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,398
[Kurapika] Wrong!

111
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,527
People become Hunters 
to join the world’s most noble profession!

112
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,529
Shut up, goody-goody!

113
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,989
Selfish money grubber!

114
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,449
[Kurapika growls]

115
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,328
Hey, Gon! Listen up!

116
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,372
There’s a list of the hundred 
richest people every year

117
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,542
and every single year, there are 
over fifty Hunters who make the list.

118
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,752
That’s more than half!

119
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,717
There are some Hunters, sad to say, 
who seek treasure and wild game.

120
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,093
But they’re second rate.

121
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,347
True Hunters work tirelessly 
to maintain order

122
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,349
in society as well as in nature!

123
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,808
Oh, screw that!

124
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,519
Once you’re a Hunter, 
it’s free to enter most countries!

125
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,229
And facilities? No charge!

126
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,565
How’s that for benefits, huh?

127
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,779
Hunters have many difficult 
and important responsibilities

128
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,782
preserving artifacts and species, 
catching crooks

129
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,409
and even apprehending rogue Hunters.

130
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,036
It’s the fame and fortune!

131
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,955
That’s why people want to become Hunters!

132
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,708
No, it’s conviction, profound knowledge, 
and a sound mind and body!

133
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,752
Traits that are a true Hunter’s pride!

134
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,587
[both growling]

135
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,382
[both] Hey, Gon! Which of us 
do you agree with?

136
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,342
[both] What kind of Hunter will you be?

137
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,553
Well, when you put it that way, 
I guess I...

138
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,514
[elevator dings]

139
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,724
[Kurapika] I think we’ve arrived.

140
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,518
[Leorio] We’ll finish this later.

141
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,019
[sighs with relief]

142
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,911
Is it me or is the mood here pretty grim?

143
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,039
We saw plenty of other applicants 
in the city

144
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,582
but these guys’re different.

145
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,379
Each one of them 
is a master in their own right.

146
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,423
‘Scuse me!

147
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,554
Looks like everybody’s really on edge 
down here.

148
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,431
[Beans] Hello!

149
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,975
Please take your number badge. Thank you!

150
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:39,936
[Beans] Here you go!

151
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,689
Here.

152
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,984
Be sure to wear this on your chest 
at all times, please.

153
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,361
And be careful not to lose it, okay?

154
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,449
[Tonpa] 
Don’t think I’ve seen you boys before!

155
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,454
Yo!

156
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,540
You can tell it’s our first time here?

157
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,666
[Tonpa] More or less.

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,917
[grunts]

159
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,503
It’s getting easier.

160
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,548
It’s my thirty-fifth attempt, 
so it comes with the territory.

161
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,884
[all three] 
You’ve tried thirty-five times?

162
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,137
I guess you could say 
I’m a Hunter Exam veteran.

163
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,639
Not really something to brag about.

164
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,099
Indeed.

165
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,020
Anyway, if you have any more questions, 
I’d be happy to help.

166
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,104
Thanks a lot!

167
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,106
Oh, by the way, the name’s Tonpa.

168
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,191
Hi, I’m Gon.

169
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,235
This is Kurapika and this is Leorio.

170
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,781
You sure have taken the Exam a lot.

171
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,158
Are you the only one here 
who’s tried a bunch of times

172
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,201
or are there others?

173
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,287
I might hold the record, 
but yeah, there are others.

174
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,580
For instance…

175
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,540
That guy over there.

176
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,168
Number 255.

177
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,795
Todo, the wrestler.

178
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,924
Probably the strongest one here. 
And he’s smarter than he looks.

179
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,095
Over there is 103. 
Bourbon, the snake charmer.

180
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,807
He can really hold a grudge, 
so try not to get on his bad side.

181
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,975
-[snake hisses] 
-[Tonpa] Let’s see now...

182
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,479
Number 191, Bodoro, 
the kung fu master.

183
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,816
He’s getting old, but he’s still 
the best martial artist around.

184
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,195
Then there are the brothers, 
Amori, Imori, and Umori.

185
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,824
They work great as a team, 
so they almost always do really well.

186
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,284
And 384.

187
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,203
Geretta, the huntsman.

188
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,872
He specializes 
in killing all kinds of creatures

189
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,874
with his blow dart and club.

190
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,670
There are more, but they’ve taken the Exam 
the most times.

191
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,088
Oh, wow!

192
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,182
[screaming]

193
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,229
[strangled cries of pain]

194
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,156
My. How unusual.

195
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,742
Seems this poor man’s arms 
have turned into flower petals.

196
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,246
Now you see them, now you don’t.

197
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,497
[gasps]

198
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,792
You should be more careful.

199
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,171
And do apologize if you bump into someone.

200
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,756
[murmuring]

201
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,968
Just perfect. 
The psychopath is back again.

202
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,261
You know that guy?

203
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,264
So, does that mean he tried last year?

204
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,684
Number 44, Hisoka, the magician.

205
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,229
He was the number one pick 
to pass last year’s Exam

206
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,316
until he almost killed an Examiner 
he didn’t approve of.

207
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,610
Then what the hell is he doing here?!

208
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,487
They’re letting him 
retake the Exam after something like that?

209
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,281
Of course, they are.

210
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,326
They change the content and Examiners 
every year.

211
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,995
And the Examiners choose the new material.

212
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,124
The devil himself 
could pass the Hunter Exam

213
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,251
-if the Examiners say it’s okay. 
-[evil laughter]

214
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,420
It’s how the whole thing works.

215
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,924
Anyway, nobody likes the guy.

216
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,967
I’d keep my distance if I were you.

217
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,721
Well, he definitely looks dangerous.

218
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,390
Oh! I almost forgot!

219
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,935
Let’s have a toast to friendship.

220
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,228
Whaddya say?

221
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,022
Hey, thanks! Yeah, don’t mind if I do!

222
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,359
I was dying of thirst.

223
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,610
Thanks a lot, buddy!

224
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,070
Yeah, thanks a lot!

225
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,071
Thank you.

226
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,323
[examinee] 
[chuckles] Well, there he goes.

227
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,868
Playing the nice guy again, 
even though he’s the nastiest one here.

228
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,496
[examinee] Tonpa, the Rookie Crusher

229
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,457
[Tonpa] 
Here’s to new friends and good fortune.

230
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,667
Cheers!

231
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,715
[chuckles] Sorry, guys.

232
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,344
But the juice I gave you 
contains a powerful laxative.

233
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:47,225
One sip and your guts will be 
on non-stop roller coaster for three days.

234
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,854
If you want to take the Exam, 
I hope you brought plenty of diapers.

235
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,775
[chuckling]

236
00:12:55,984 --> 00:13:01,364
HUNTER GLOSSARY

237
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,035
LEORIO

238
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,914
[sinister chuckle]

239
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,667
Huh?

240
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,211
Huh?

241
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,673
I think this juice might’ve gone bad, 
Mr. Tonpa.

242
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,300
It tastes funny.

243
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,510
Seriously?

244
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,928
That was a close call!

245
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,680
Huh? That’s odd.

246
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,598
Real sorry ‘bout that, fellas!

247
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,184
Impossible.

248
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,562
That laxative is flavorless and odorless!

249
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,774
Please forgive me!

250
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,736
I had no idea the juice was bad!

251
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,904
[Gon] You don’t have to apologize.

252
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,449
What about you? Is your stomach okay?

253
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,160
I’m all right. I’m totally fine!

254
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,453
Oh, good!

255
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,622
I’ve tried all kinds of plants and grasses 
on the mountain back home.

256
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,751
So, I can usually taste 
when something’s bad.

257
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,795
That’s some talent you got there! 
[nervous chuckle]

258
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,255
Never seen anything like it!

259
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,509
Damn it! He just had to be 
some wild mountain kid.

260
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,720
Sorry again.

261
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,847
I’ll see you boys around!

262
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,516
Man, I thought he would never shut up.

263
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,772
[Tonpa] Something isn’t quite right 
about the crop of rookies this year.

264
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,275
Like 294. Hanzo.

265
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,946
The first time I talked to him, 
he actually seemed pretty gullible.

266
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,033
Keep this to yourself.

267
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,993
But I am a ninja!

268
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,287
Oh! Is that so?

269
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,748
I seek the legendary scroll. Shhh!

270
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,044
It is my secret mission 
to track down the Ultimate Ninja Scroll.

271
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,129
That’s why I’m becoming a Hunter.

272
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,842
Rumor has it that it’s hidden somewhere 
that’s inaccessible to ordinary people.

273
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,389
Anyway, this place is pretty boring, huh?

274
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,765
I guess so.

275
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:54,310
Hey, we should have a toast. 
To friendship and good fortune, eh?

276
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,689
I am a seasoned ninja.

277
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,735
I make it a point never to drink anything 
offered to me by another.

278
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,363
You understand?

279
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,032
Oh. Right! Gotcha.

280
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,118
[nervous laughter]

281
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,746
[Tonpa] I can tell he’s no idiot.

282
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,916
One wrong move and I could’ve been 
in some serious trouble.

283
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,918
-[rattle] 
-Huh?

284
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,381
[Tonpa] Speaking of trouble, there’s 301.

285
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,508
That guy just oozes danger.

286
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,843
I know one thing;

287
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,845
I’m not going anywhere near him.

288
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,140
Then there’s the one I really can’t stand.

289
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,434
187,

290
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,185
Nicholas.

291
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,232
Must’ve been tough 
to make it this far, huh?

292
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,192
Not really.

293
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,112
Everything’s gone 
exactly as my data predicted.

294
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,698
I used historical data 
from past Hunter Exams

295
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,950
to calculate this year’s location.

296
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,619
It was really quite simple.

297
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,830
And frankly, rather boring.

298
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,457
Oh. Well, good.

299
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,250
Impressive work, there, kid.

300
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,669
The name’s Tonpa. 
It’s real nice to meet you!

301
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,254
Tonpa, is it?

302
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,382
Ah! There you are.

303
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,384
This is your thirty-fifth attempt.

304
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,637
That’s the second highest number 
of attempts by anyone!

305
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,473
But it says here

306
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,266
that you do hold the current record

307
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,185
for the most consecutive attempts 
with 30.

308
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,686
That’s quite impressive!

309
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,563
Thank you! But it’s no big deal.

310
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,107
Whaddya say? Ya wanna toast to friendship?

311
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,943
But after thirty-five attempts

312
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,905
you have yet 
to successfully pass the Exam.

313
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:34,118
And so, I assume you’re too focused 
on your “other” objective.

314
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,872
Am I right, Tonpa the Rookie-Crusher?

315
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,373
Say what?!

316
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,214
Fear not. I won’t divulge my findings 
with anyone else.

317
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,717
Consider it a prize 
for your consecutive appearance record.

318
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,594
Farewell.

319
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,350
[growls]

320
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,187
[Tonpa] Just wait, you little bastard.

321
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,191
I’m the one who’s gonna break 
that snotty nose of yours.

322
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,902
[Killua] Hey! Mr. Tonpa!

323
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,030
That juice was great. Got any more?

324
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,909
I don’t know if I’m just nervous 
but I really am thirsty!

325
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,912
Oh! Of course!

326
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,039
What the hell?!

327
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,167
That laxative he drank 
should have taken effect by now!

328
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,128
What’s up with this kid?

329
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,763
It’s only a laxative, but still…

330
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,308
If the kid drinks that much, 
he could die of dehydration.

331
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,186
[Killua] Worried?

332
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,522
Well, don’t be. I’ll be fine.

333
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,399
I’ve trained for this.

334
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,734
Poisons don’t hurt me.

335
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,990
Impossible!

336
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:58,160
That kid was actually able to tell 
what was in the juice?

337
00:17:58,703 --> 00:17:59,662
But if he knew…

338
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,455
then why the hell did he drink it?

339
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,459
Number 99, Killua.

340
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,381
Damn. This year’s rookies 
are completely insane.

341
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,008
[smirks]

342
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,843
But so what?

343
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,847
It just means crushing them 
will be all the more satisfying.

344
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,103
[bell ringing]

345
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,863
[wall rumbles]

346
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,828
Huh?

347
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,546
I apologize for the delay.

348
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,298
Thank you for waiting.

349
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,844
The entry period for Hunter applicants 
is officially closed.

350
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,722
So, with no further ado,

351
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,350
the Hunter Exam will now begin!

352
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,143
-[smirks] 
-[grunts]

353
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,186
[smirks]

354
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,941
One final word of caution…

355
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,611
If you’re short on luck or ability,

356
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,113
keep in mind that 
there’s a very real chance

357
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,407
you could end up seriously injured.

358
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,910
Death is another distinct possibility.

359
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:21,952
[determined grunt]

360
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,665
If you’re willing 
to accept the risks involved,

361
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,708
I’ll ask you to follow me now.

362
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,669
But for the rest of you

363
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,964
kindly exit through the elevator 
located behind you.

364
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,926
[theme music playing]

365
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,393
Right, then. Very well.

366
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,730
All 404 applicants 
will now participate in Phase One.

367
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,419
Yeah, I didn’t think anybody 
was gonna leave.

368
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,713
But I’d hoped a few 
would duck out at least.

369
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,643
[Leorio] Whoa. What...?

370
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,062
[Gon] I think the people up front 
have started running.

371
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,648
[Kurapika] 
It’s because he’s picking up the pace.

372
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,985
How rude of me. 
I neglected to introduce myself.

373
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,655
I am Satotz, your Examiner 
for the First Phase of the Exam.

374
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:44,493
It’s my responsibility 
to lead all of you to the Second Phase.

375
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,870
Second?

376
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,663
Whatever happened to the First?

377
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,458
The First Phase is already underway.

378
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,628
[murmuring]

379
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,631
The First Phase is quite simple.

380
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,301
All you have to do is follow me 
to the Second Phase.

381
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,011
So, try to keep up.

382
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,097
Follow you? So that’s it? 
There’s nothing else?

383
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,807
[Satotz] That’s right.

384
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,977
I cannot tell you where 
or when you must arrive.

385
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,022
You need only to follow me.

386
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,860
I see how it is.

387
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,695
This Exam is weird.

388
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,615
Sounds a lot like 
a basic endurance test to me.

389
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,700
That’s right up my alley.

390
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,119
Keep running, pal! I’m right behind ya!

391
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,749
[Kurapika] Not knowing how far 
we’ll have to run is mentally stressful,

392
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,043
to say nothing of the physical strain.

393
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,130
This is a test of our mental fortitude 
as well.

394
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,301
[narrator] And so amidst a sea 
of warriors and villains,

395
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,721
the First Phase of the Exam begins.

396
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,019
One candidate is disqualified 
before the test even gets under way,

397
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,232
bringing the total number 
of Hunter applicants to 404.

398
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,318
[panting]

399
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,154
[theme song playing]

400
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,865
[Gon] Next time:

401
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,366
"Hope x and x Ambition."

402
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,410
-Time to go fishin’! 
-[Killua] Yeah.
