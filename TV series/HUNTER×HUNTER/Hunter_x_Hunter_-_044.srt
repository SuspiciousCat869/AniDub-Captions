00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,429
I am the Shadow Beast, Worm.

00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,307
Which family do you belong to?

4
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:17,893
[Dalzollene] We’re bodyguards.

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,687
We’ve been hired by the Nostrade family.

6
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,274
I understand.

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,860
It seems that you can use Nen a bit

8
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,445
but don’t bother.

9
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,949
These are no ordinary thugs

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,410
To them, killing’s a part 
of their daily routine.

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,122
You could say 
they’re professional killers.

12
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,168
And as pros ourselves, we’ll handle it.

13
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,381
My name’s Rabid Dog.

14
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,049
And mine is Leech.

15
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,677
You, uh... can call me Porcupine.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,765
Sit back and leave this job 
to the Shadow Beasts.

[narrator] After the Phantom Troupe’s raid 
on the Underground Auction,

20
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:39,534
Uvogin has single-handedly 
annihilated the Mafia pursuers.

21
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:44,456
But now they look on 
as the Mafia’s secret weapon arrives,

Not one of ‘em put up much of a fight.

[Shalnark] Uvo!

28
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,477
Yeah?

29

They’re here now!

[Uvogin] Hey, don’t interfere!

32
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,995
You got that?

33
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,250
I haven’t even had the chance 
to enjoy myself.

34
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,711
[Feitan] Oh, boy.

35
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,714
Oh, just let Uvo handle it.

36
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,465
Want in on a round, Feitan?

[Squala] Wait…

00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,812
is he planning to fight the Shadow Beasts 
all by himself?

39

[Uvogin] The Shadow Beasts, huh?

40
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,742
Where’d you hide the merchandise?

41
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,747
What happened to the guards and guests?

42
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,206
We killed them.

43
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,750
Where’s the merchandise?

What’ll it be? Hmm?

53
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,631
Have me kill you underground?

54
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,967
Or would you rather die 
at the hands of the other three

up on the surface?

[Squala] I-- I don’t believe it!

66
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,868
[Basho] I’ve never seen a Nen user 
of this caliber before.

67
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,138
Is that…?

68
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,682
It’s a spider tattoo.

69
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,642
Then, he's...

There’s not much left of him.

76
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:02,255
[Nobunaga] Uvo’s Big Bang Impact 
sure packs a powerful punch.

Yeah…

78
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,677
but to be fair, it’s just a regular punch 
with Nen added.

Eight.

Well, he seems pretty confident. Yup.

I can manipulate my body hair, y’see.

I can even turn it 
into these needles if I want to. Yup.

You throw a mean punch,

94
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,927
but it’s pointless 
if you can’t connect. Yup.

than body hair and teeth.

Since I manipulate it at will,

as necessary. Yup-yup yup.

The sensation that you’re feeling

[Rabid Dog] 
You won’t be affected from the neck up,

00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,392
Huh?

168
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,982
[roaring]

169
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,916
[Kurapika grunts]

170
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,432
You can’t deflect bullets of sound, 
can you?

171
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,685
What’s wrong, can’t you hear me?

172
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,567
[Basho] He used sound 
to kill a Shadow Beast...

173
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,029
They’re crazy… Completely crazy!

174
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,781
Damn…

175
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,909
Hey, what the hell, you idiot?!

176
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,911
How about a warning next time?

177
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,289
Do you wanna bust our eardrums, too?

178
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,040
[Uvogin] Sorry ‘bout that!

179
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,293
I didn’t want to give away my plan.

180
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,297
Besides, the sound took a while 
to reach you guys, didn’t it?

181
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,216
You had plenty of time to cover your ears.

182
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,592
[Machi] That's true.

183
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,141
[Dalzollene] Kurapika, wait!

184
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,350
What are you doing?

185
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,852
[Kurapika] Isn't it obvious?

186
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,563
-I'm going to capture him. 
-[Melody, Dalzollene, Squala, Basho] Huh?

187
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:34,981
That guy?!

188
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,191
No way! You saw what he did!

189
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,776
You’re gonna get yourself killed!

190
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,320
Stop, Kurapika!

191
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,906
It doesn’t matter.

192
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,043
I hear such violent rage and hatred.

193
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,588
He’s gone blind with it!

194
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,509
Kurapika!

195
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,347
[Melody] He’s walking 
right into his own funeral.

196
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,599
I have to stop him.

197
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,352
[Dalzollene] Wait just a minute!

198
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,485
[angered growl]

199
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,740
[plays peaceful tune]

200
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,033
[gasps]

201
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,919
[peaceful tune continues]

202
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,466
“Field in Spring”.

203
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,094
The perfect composition for relaxing.

204
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,471
Now, has everyone calmed down?

205
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,890
If so, let’s plan our strategy

206
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,350
with level heads.

207
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,812
Yeah…

208
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,357
What kind of Nen abilities 
do the other members possess?

209
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,194
[Squala] I’m willing to bet they’re all 
ridiculously strong.

210
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,864
[Kurapika] Melody...

211
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,199
Thanks a lot.

212
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,993
I’ve calmed down.

213
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,621
But I’m still going to capture them.

214
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,499
-Leader. 
-Hm?

215
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,585
I stand a good chance.

216
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,670
-[Melody, Squala, Basho, Linssen] Huh? 
-What’s that?

217
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,882
Let me do it.

218
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,886
[Dalzollene] You saw 
that incredible show of strength

219
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,804
and you still think you have a shot?

220
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,640
I do.

221
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,185
Understood.

222
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,856
We may need to leave quickly,

223
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,733
so please pull the car around.

224
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:24,859
[Squala] Right.

225
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,490
[Uvogin] Shizuku!

226
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,741
Do me a favor

227
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,368
and suck all the poison and leeches 
out of my body!

228
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,287
Your vacuum could do it, right?

229
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,539
Blinky can suck out the poison,

230
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,374
but nothing that’s still alive.

231
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,584
[Uvogin] Really?

232
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,377
Then what do I do?

233
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,173
Let me see.

234
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,053
This is known as a spotted leech.

235
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,181
It takes a nearly a full day for it 
to migrate to the bladder

236
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,933
before laying its eggs and dying.

237
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,643
Yeah, then what?

238
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,228
Well, after that,

239
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,897
the eggs will hatch and exit 
through your urinary tract.

240
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,483
You’ll most likely die from the pain.

241
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,485
Come on, don’t joke around like that.

242
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,074
However, they require a very specific 
concentration of ammonia to hatch.

243
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,408
If there isn't enough,

244
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,286
the eggs stay dormant 
and can be excreted harmlessly.

245
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,831
Which means that until this time tomorrow

246
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,376
it’s absolutely critical 
that you drink beer constantly

247
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,127
and pee as much as possible!

248
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,297
Is that all? You really had me worried!

249
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,259
Shizuku! Can you get the poison?

250
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,218
[Shizuku] Okay!

251
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,638
[Shalnark] Someone go into town 
and get lots of beer.

252
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,223
All right, I’ll go.

253
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,976
And make sure those suckers are ice cold!

254
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,103
[Franklin] You’ll get what I bring you!

255
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,606
[cackling]

256
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,944
Hurry and get this poison out of me!

257
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:51,862
[gasps]

258
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,659
Huh?

259
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,831
[Uvogin screaming]

260
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,009
-Did you see that? 
-Yeah.

261
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,470
Those chains came out of nowhere 
and wrapped around his body!

262
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,639
Is it a new Shadow Beast?

263
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,517
Uvo can’t move due to the neurotoxin

264
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,020
and those leeches 
are still inside of him, too.

265
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,064
There’s no choice. 
We gotta go and save him.

266
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,733
[Feitan] Oh, boy.

267
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,610
So much trouble.

268
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,570
[Machi] We can still find out 
where he’s going.

269
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,948
I used In to make my thread invisible.

270
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,034
I can follow them anywhere,

271
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,077
as long as they don’t spot the needle.

272
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,039
And they’d have to use Gyo to do that.

273
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,250
Well? Let’s find them 
before they figure it out.

274
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,460
[derisive snort]

275
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,588
Now’s our chance to finish off 
the other Shadow Beasts.

276
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,507
[Shalnark] Get as much beer 
as you can, Franklin.

277
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,969
[Franklin snorts derisively] 
Man, the chase sounds more fun.

278
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,263
[Shalnark laughs] 
Come on. Let’s go!

279
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,850
[Worm] Indeed.

280
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,311
The spiders...

281
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,939
[weakly, dying] Listen to me…

282
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,901
Gather up everyone who’s left,

283
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,027
or we...

284
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,237
don't stand a chan--

285
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,541
Understood.

286
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,924
Chains, is it?

287
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,975
[Uvogin] Hey. Driver.

288
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,354
You don’t really think these chains 
can hold me, do you?

289
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,108
Kill me now or you’ll regret it.

290
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,818
I promise you that.

291
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,695
Quiet.

292
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,488
Do you hear me?

293
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,157
This is the only chance 
you’re ever gonna get.

294
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,285
Stop wasting time and--

295
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,538
[surprised gasp of pain]

296
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,708
[groaning in pain]

297
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,544
I thought I told you to be quiet!

298
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,213
Kurapika! Be careful!

299
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,673
Watch the road!

300
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,010
[Uvogin] Damn… How can he be this strong?

301
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,389
Even if my body wasn’t paralyzed,

302
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,516
I’d still be having trouble.

303
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,476
I don’t know how

304
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,770
but he’s infused these puny chains

305
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,647
with enough Nen to keep me in check.

306
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,150
I’m a master Enhancer.

307
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,110
That shouldn’t even be possible!

308
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,033
Chain Jail…

309
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,910
CHAIN JAIL: 
THE RESTRAINING MIDDLE FINGER

310
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,871
...an ability I will use 
only on the Spiders.

311
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,959
A power to capture and restrain 
the Phantom Troupe.

312
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,755
I’ve sworn to use it for no other purpose.

313
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,300
If I break my vow…

314
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,262
if I should use this technique 
on anyone other than a Spider…

315
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,514
my life is forfeit.

316
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,516
I would die...

317
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,101
instantly.

318
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,276
A self-imposed condition 
and a contract with myself.

319
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,195
The proof of my resolve.

320
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,488
CONDITION 
CONTRACT

321
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,781
[Melody] Kurapika! Look out!

322
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,074
-[Kurapika] The risk is high... 
-[Melody] Please, watch the road!

323
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,494
[Kurapika] ...but the greater the strength 
of my conviction,

324
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,371
the stronger my Nen!

325
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,506
[narrator] Kurapika has captured 
a member of the Phantom Troupe.

326
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,927
Armed with resolve 
and the willingness to risk his life,

327
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,222
he prepares for the battle 
that will soon begin.

328
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,559

Killua! Don’t run in the hallway!

341
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,819
[Killua] The Silent Gait

00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,614
[Gon] Follow the rules! 
Promise me, okay?
