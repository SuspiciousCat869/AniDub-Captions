1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:02,085
TEN (ENVELOPE)

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,170
[narrator] Ten:

3
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:07,132
The ability to envelop your body 
in a shroud of Nen aura,

4
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:10,344
making it tougher 
and slowing the effects of aging.

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,553
ZETSU (SUPPRESS)

6
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:12,513
Zetsu:

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,307
A technique which shuts off 
your flow of Nen aura.

8
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:19,102
Effective for concealing your presence 
and recovering from fatigue.

9
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,395
REN (REFINE)

10
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,355
Ren:

11
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,733
A technique for creating 
an especially strong Nen aura.

12
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,361
It is crucial for increasing your power.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:28,946
HATSU (RELEASE)

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,947
Hatsu:

15
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:33,951
The release of your Nen aura, 
after using Ren to boost it.

16
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,956
These four elements 
are known as the Four Exercises

17
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,625
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

18
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,876
FOUR EXERCISES

19
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,301
[theme song playing]

20
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,541
Gon.

21
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,962
You and me, we’ve got to learn 
all that we can about Nen.

22
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:11,965
Yeah!

23
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:17,846
AN x EMPTY x THREAT

24
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:23,602
[narrator] After two months during which 
Gon was forbidden to practice Nen,

25
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,064
Wing summoned Gon and Killua 
to his room for a meeting.

26
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,109
[Wing] Gon, Killua.

27
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,613
Starting today, you will be 
training alongside Zushi.

28
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,574
And Gon, splendid work.

29
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,077
I’m happy to see 
that you kept your promise.

30
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,162
It’s because of your promise thread.

31
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,874
There were a couple of times 
I got really close to giving in.

32
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,210
But then I’d look at the thread,

33
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,462
and I could feel myself getting calmer.

34
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,173
Because I imbued it with Nen to help you.

35
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,675
Wait… Really?

36
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,052
No. I was kidding.

37
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,512
[Gon] Uh...

38
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,763
Hold on.

39
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,099
How can you tell 
Gon’s been keeping his promise?

40
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,475
As far as you know,

41
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,852
he was secretly cheating this whole time.

42
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,273
Because the promise thread 
is completely intact.

43
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,235
Gon. I know it’s been a while,

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,778
but would you show me your Ten?

45
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,947
-You sure? 
-Yes.

46
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,492
Oh, man… 
Do I even remember how?

47
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,328
It's been so long.

48
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,831
I wonder if I can still pull it off.

49
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,385
[Wing] What do you think, Zushi?

50
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,429
It-- It’s amazing!

51
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,390
His aura is flowing completely 
around him, sir!

52
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,809
It’s soft and tranquil…

53
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,729
but it’s-- it’s so powerful, too!

54
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,731
That’s it!

55
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,107
What a relief!

56
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,901
I was worried that 
I had forgotten how to do it.

57
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,904
Once you’ve learned the technique, 
it can’t be forgotten.

58
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,907
However, in order to become a true master,

59
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,243
you will have to practice diligently.

60
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,747
But it felt a lot easier 
than it did before

61
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,708
and I haven’t practiced Ten 
in a real long time.

62
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,168
I can explain.

63
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,045
That’s because you’ve been 
training your spirit every day.

64
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,673
Now please look at your left hand.

65
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,841
What?

66
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,594
It broke!

67
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,723
I tied the thread to your finger 
with my own Nen,

68
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,975
so if you had broken your promise,

69
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,269
the thread would’ve broken as well.

70
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,480
[Killua] You can do stuff like that?

71
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,815
Question, Mister Wing:

72
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,984
You saw Hisoka and Kastro’s match?

73
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,486
[Wing] Yes, I did.

74
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,529
So, what was Hisoka’s ability?

75
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,323
Do you think we could do that?

76
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,617
Send our limbs flying all over the place?

77
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,994
[Wing] Hmm...That's a difficult question.

78
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,164
Gon. Have you seen 
a recording of the fight?

79
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,750
No. Not yet, sir.

80
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,254
Then I’ll explain while we watch.

81
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,383
[audience cheering]

82
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,138
[Wing] There.

83
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,433
See the strands of aura extending out 
from his left hand?

84
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,018
[Gon] “Strands of aura”?

85
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,561
Yes.

86
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,396
Do you see them?

87
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,273
[Killua grunts, focusing]

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,234
No… I don’t think so…

89
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,902
I can’t see anything…

90
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,403
Me neither, sir.

91
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,948
[focusing grunt, focusing grumble]

92
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,369
[Gon] Are there really strands of aura 
coming out of his left hand?

93
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,620
Are you sure?

94
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,830
I am.

95
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,832
See, Hisoka is using a technique

96
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,709
that makes his aura exceedingly difficult 
to perceive.

97
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,002
SUPPRESS

98
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,255
It’s a high-level application of Zetsu, 
known as “In”.

99
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,422
CONCEAL

100
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,468
It renders even powerful aura 
invisible to your opponent.

101
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,595
And to counter this,

102
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,890
you must focus all of your Ren 
in both of your eyes,

103
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,517
utilizing a technique known as Gyo.

104
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,768
GYO (FOCUS)

105
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,105
The method Gon used 
in his fight with Gido

106
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,023
might also be useful.

107
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,151
But you can’t counterattack,

108
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,445
so you’d ultimately get yourself killed.

109
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,282
Right…

110
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,577
[Wing] My assignment for the two of you 
is to practice Ren,

111
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,329
until you can see through Hisoka’s In.

112
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,039
But Master…

113
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,332
What about me?

114
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,167
What kind of training should I do?

115
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,211
Zushi.

116
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,965
You should already be just strong enough 
to see past Hisoka’s In.

117
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,717
You think so?

118
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,636
[Wing] If you would, 
please show them your Ren.

119
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,514
[determined grunt]

120
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,725
O-- Osu!

121
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,148
[focusing exhale]

122
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,902
[shouts] Ren!

123
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,614
It's so strong.

124
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,782
It’s just as big as ours…

125
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,452
but the aura is so much more dense!

126
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,622
Now focus that aura into your eyes.

127
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,956
[Zushi] Osu!

128
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,544
[focusing effort]

129
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,258
And Gyo!

130
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,052
Good.

131
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,388
So, tell me, can you see the aura 
rushing from his body?

132
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,682
[straining]

133
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,187
Yes.

134
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,773
There are individual strands of aura.

135
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,316
How many of them do you see?

136
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,027
Twelve… Wait.

137
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,738
No. I think I count 13, sir.

138
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,281
Not quite.

139
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,200
But you are very close indeed.

140
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,078
[tired exhale, panting]

141
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,996
I really could see them!

142
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,415
You’re really making 
excellent progress, Zushi.

143
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,418
Osu! Thank you! I’m trying, Master.

144
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,713
By channeling every ounce 
of your power through Gyo,

145
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,133
you achieved a level where you could see 
through Hisoka’s In.

146
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,302
But with enough training,

147
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,180
you’ll be able to use Gyo 
even while you’re fighting.

148
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,517
Now do you understand?

149
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,310
First, practice using Ren

150
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,854
and master the application known as Gyo.

151
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,065
Then and only then

152
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,110
will you discover 
the true nature of Hisoka’s ability.

153
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,781
You asked if you would ever be able 
to use that same ability.

154
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,243
And my answer is yes, 
but at the same time, no.

155
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,327
[both] Huh?

156
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,454
Regardless of what his power is,

157
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,125
so long as it uses Nen, 
you’ll be able to learn it.

158
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,003
But it’s important to note 
that Nen abilities

159
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,587
depend on the individual.

160
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,758
Because of course, we each possess 
different specialties and preferences

161
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,886
which means that Nen differs 
for each person.

162
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,181
If you’re serious about mastering Nen,

163
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,934
you shouldn’t merely copy 
the abilities of others.

164
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,646
You need to first identify 
your own particular strengths.

165
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,064
Strengths, huh?

166
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,692
[Wing] You’re still growing,

167
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,986
so you haven’t settled on one form yet.

168
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,240
My advice is to enrich yourself 
as much as possible.

169
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,367
That is the purpose of your training.

170
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,661
Train with all of your might.

171
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,371
Play just as hard.

172
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,956
And enjoy life!

173
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,458
[Zushi, Gon and Killua] Osu!

174
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,796
I believe the last day of Killua’s window 
to compete is June ninth.

175
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,674
And Gon, yours is the tenth, correct?

176
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,470
Both of you should register to fight 
on your final day.

177
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,514
In the meantime, you'll train.

178
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,434
You must both learn Gyo 
before you enter battle.

179
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,269
[Gon, Killua and Zushi] Osu!

180
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,105
[Gon] Hey, Zushi!

181
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,732
Your Ren was impressive!

182
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,152
You got way ahead of us 
while I was stuck recuperating.

183
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,947
No. I’ve still got a long way to go.

184
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,283
Hey! Why don’t we practice a little.

185
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,576
It should be fun!

186
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,788
Okay. Then let’s go up to your room, Gon.

187
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:40,955
Mm hm.

188
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,466
Zushi. Killua.

189
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,675
I feel it.

190
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,552
We’ve got company, guys.

191
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,679
[elevator dings]

192
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,982
You don’t give up, do you?

193
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,568
That isn’t the way to make friends.

194
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,779
Now, that’ll be enough of that.

195
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,948
Just tell us when you’re going to fight,

196
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,118
because I’m dying to be your opponent. 
[light chuckle]

197
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,494
[Killua snorts]

198
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,872
I guess these guys 
specialize in hunting newbies.

199
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,290
This is what they do.

200
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,251
Get wins beating us up.

201
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,045
[Sadaso] We’re getting desperate here.

202
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,506
See, our deadline is approaching.

203
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,092
C’mon. We wanna fight. [light chuckle]

204
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,303
I’ll even demonstrate my power for you,

205
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,888
right here and now.

206
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,057
How about that?

207
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,813
Okay. I’m gonna be fighting 
on June the tenth.

208
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,022
Hey! Gon!

209
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,692
That won’t work for me.

210
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,654
I’m sorry to tell you, 
but my deadline is May 29th.

211
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,447
Fight on that day.

212
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,159
Who cares about your stupid deadline, 
you idiot?

213
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,660
Let’s get going.

214
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,247
Gon, my friend…

215
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,916
You and I will fight.

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,710
I guarantee it. [light chuckle]

217
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,505
It’s a promise.

218
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,550
[Killua] Come on. Ignore him.

219
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,428
What are you gonna do?

220
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,139
I’m going to force him to fight me.

221
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,142
[snickers]

222
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,107
[Killua] 
Visualize energy building up in your body.

223
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,570
Feel the power from each 
and every cell… gathering.

224
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,739
Growing and growing…

225
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,284
Then, all of a sudden, 
force that power out!

226
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,624
[tired exhale]

227
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,043
I’m getting the hang of it!

228
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,712
The timing to get Ten 
to contain that aura

229
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,214
was a little bit tricky.

230
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,798
Wait… a little?!

231
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,843
How are they picking it up so fast?

232
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,763
But Zushi’s aura is stronger.

233
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,140
We’re not even close to matching him yet.

234
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,725
Guess we ought to train more.

235
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,436
[Zushi] Uh… N-no! That’s enough.

236
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,897
Learning when to rest 
is a big part of training.

237
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,066
Why don’t we just call it a day.

238
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,318
Really? Cause I ca--

239
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,569
I told you no!

240
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,322
If they surpass me in half a day,

241
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,157
I’ll lose all my motivation!

242
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,909
What’s the deal?

243
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,160
Oh, it’s fine.

244
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,578
So more tomorrow?

245
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,205
Works for me.

246
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,792
I’ll see you again tomorrow.

247
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,210
Take it easy!

248
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,217
All right, then.

249
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,887
[elevator dings]

250
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,270

[straining]

254
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,750
[Zushi] I can’t--

255
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,461
I can’t…. move!

256
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,173
I can’t talk or breathe, either!

257
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,842
What’s going on?!

258
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,015
Oops.

259
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,689
It’s your turn.

260
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,441
All right.

261
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,611
[Gido's prosthetic leg 
tapping on the pavement]

262
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,488
[snickers]

263
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,324
[Killua] Knock it off.

264
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,537
I figured you might be up to something.

265
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,998
But forget the dirty tricks.

266
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,624
You want a fight, fine.

267
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,877
Which day do you want?

268
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,922
Oh, and don’t worry. 
I’ll let you win, ok?

269
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,593
Wait. How about I give all of you a win?

270
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,678
Good enough?

271
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,683
Once I get my win against you,

272
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,311
your friend Gon will be my next victim.

273
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,355
If you wanna fight Gon,

274
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,523
you’ll have to work around his schedule.

275
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,025
Something tells me

276
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,610
you’ll be happy to.

277
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,155
In fact, I can guarantee it.

278
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,240
[Sadaso chuckling]

279
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,408
[Sadaso] Okay.

280
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,535
If the two of you are willing to fight,

281
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,206
it’ll save us the trouble 
of using tactics like this one.

282
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,334
What do you say we all register together?

283
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,338
Once that’s done, 
we’ll return the boy unharmed.

284
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,757
Yeah, sure. Okay.

285
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,302
But this is absolutely the very last time. 
You got that?

286
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,724
There. May 29th.

287
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,143
Done. You happy now?

288
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,770
Yes.

289
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,772
We’ll return your friend here.

290
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,609
And up we go.

291
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,656
Oh. I’ll say it again -

292
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,199
It’s the last time.

293
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,118
And if you break your promise…

294
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,370
[Killua sighs]

295
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,830
Whatever.

296
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,081
Forget it.

297
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,666
[Riehlvelt] What? I’m curious…

298
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,669
What’s going to happen 
if we break our promise?

299
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,338
[Killua] 
There’s no point in telling you now.

300
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,465
Just keep your end of the deal, okay?

301
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,968

Hello? Is this Gon?

304
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,858
I don’t think I have to tell you 
what this means.

305
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,319
As long as you don’t tell anyone

306
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,864
and you follow my instructions 
to the letter,

307
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,908
the three of you will be able 
to train tomorrow,

308
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,618
just like you planned.

309

Zushi…

310
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,590
So how did it go with Gon?

311
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,924
[Gido] Perfectly.

312
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,968
He’s registered for the thirtieth.

313
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,804
[snickers] That makes two victories.

314
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,139
Too easy.

[Sadaso cackling]

316
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,191
Not killing people 
is harder than I thought it’d be.

317
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,276
Ah, man.

318
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,195
Honest living is tough.

319
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,496
[scalper] Step right up!

320
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,331
Get your tickets here!

321
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,292
These are hot off the presses, 
ladies and gents!

322
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,628
Gon versus Sadaso!

323
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,340
We’ve got Killua versus Sadaso, too!

324
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,301
Better buy ‘em now 
or you’re gonna regret it!

325
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,678
-[Killua] Hey pops. 
-‘Sup, kid?

326
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,890
That Sadaso guy has just one arm?

327
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,016
[scalper] That’s right!

328
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,852
The one-armed fighter 
with a face like a mask.

329
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,563
If he grabs you 
with his invisible left arm,

330
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,689
you’re done.

331
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,609
See… they call him 
the newbie hunter and--

332
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,279
That son of a…

333
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,201
[Gon] Killua? Hey…

334
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,787
Gon. This is where you’ve been?

335
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,872
Uh… yeah…

336
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,332
Killua.

337
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,960
I hear that you helped Zushi 
home last night.

338
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:24,961
Thank you.

339
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,754
Are you feeling all right?

340
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,381
Yeah. I’m fine.

341
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,424
I was probably just tired, that’s all.

342
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,260
I’m sorry to worry you!

343
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,720
Oh. Hey, Mister Wing.

344
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,223
Do you think that we can 
watch that video again?

345
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,768
Cause I figured out how to use Gyo.

346
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,689
Huh?! Really?

347
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,538
Fifteen threads, right?

348
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,125
Thirteen for the cards, 
one more for the scarf

349
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,211
and one well-hidden one 
for the arm he tossed.

350
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,421
And then…

351
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,131
Keep going.

352
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,301
Hisoka’s aura.

353
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,052
It almost looks like...

354
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,430
it’s expanding and contracting.

355
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,766
Or does it attract certain objects

356
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,226
like a magnet does?

357
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,812
How else would his arm reattach itself?

358
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:28,941
Not to mention flying off 
and targeting Kastro’s jaw?

359
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,861
My money is on the former.

360
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,155
I think his aura must be stretchy,

361
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,906
like rubber or something.

362
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,075
And if it is,

363
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,870
then that would explain 
most of his magic tricks.

364
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,334
He’s on a completely different level!

365
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,170
You pass. That’s very good.

366
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,048
Although, I am a little surprised.

367
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:56,135
I certainly never expected both of you 
to actually learn Gyo overnight.

368
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,137
Both of us?

369
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:02,642
Yep. But I still couldn’t figure out 
what Hisoka’s ability was.

370
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,727
-[Zushi sighs] 
-So, Killua,

371
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,772
I’m sure now 
that you’ve finished your assignment,

372
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,815
you’ll be wanting to fight soon, correct?

373
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,984
It’s okay.

374
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,944
I didn’t mean to beat you to the punch.

375
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,947
I guess I just got 
an itch to fight, that’s all.

376
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,950
Yeah. I understand.

377
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,078
They must ‘a threatened you.

378
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,204
Huh, Gon?

379
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,166
Actually, I’ve already chosen 
my day to fight.

380
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,377
I signed up for May 29th.

381
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,212
I’m fighting on May 30th.

382
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,005
All right, fine.

383
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,549
I guess I underestimated your progress.

384
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,842
It’s quite impressive.

385
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,345
Between now and your scheduled fights

386
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,263
practice both Ten and Ren.

387
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,058
And in addition to your training,

388
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,976
get plenty of rest and sleep.

389
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:47,812
[Gon and Killua] Osu!

390
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,232
-[Gon] Killua. 
-[Killua] Hm?

391
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,360
[Killua] Those guys threatened you, too, 
didn’t they?

392
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,570
That makes me so mad…

393
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,365
Yeah. But still…

394
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,493
my biggest concern 
was getting Wing’s permission.

395
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,162
[Gon] I guess my biggest concern is

396
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,415
that they’ll do 
the same thing to Zushi again.

397
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,792
[Killua] It’s okay.

398
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,962
You don't need to worry.

399
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,678
[Sadaso] 
Today, I'll beat Killua for my sixth win.

400
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,639
Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon 
for my seventh win.

401
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,725
After that,

402
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,602
all I’ll need to do 
is find three more suckers...

403
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,146
[chuckling]

404
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,273
...then I’ll be a Floor Master!

405
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,025
With the kind of fame and fortune 
that’ll get me,

406
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,319
I’ll be set for the rest of my life!

407
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,904
[gasps]

408
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,701
[Killua] You move, you die.

409
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,328
You use Nen and you die.

410
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,581
Make a sound and you die.

411
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,292
If you understand, close your eyes.

412
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,338
Do you see what happens 
when you break your promises?

413
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,800
If you do, open your eyes,

414
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,429
look at me in the mirror 
and listen carefully.

415
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,770
Don’t ever show your dirty face 
in front of us again.

416
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,397
You’ll keep this promise.

417
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,237
[referee] Sadaso’s time is up!

418
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,156
Killua wins by default!

419
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,784
[spectator] Are you kidding me? 
What is this?

420
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,911
[disgruntled spectators shouting]

421
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,247
[narrator] Killua opens the battle 
against the persistent trio

422
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,874
with a technical victory.

423
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,752
Thanks to their unique natural talents,

424
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:39,799
the real battle at Heavens Arena 
is only just beginning for Gon and Killua

425
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,927
who are learning Nen at incredible speed!

426
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,558
[theme song playing]

427
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,250
[Gon] Coming up:

428
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,710
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

429
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,003
[both] Hunterpedia!

430
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,671
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

431
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,089
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

432
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,341
Today, we’ll be introducing Sadaso!

433
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:08,304
He went through the traditional initiation 
with Gido and Riehlvelt. [giggles]

434
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,140
One arm’s invisible 
cause it’s made of Nen. [giggles]

435
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,474
That’s right!

436
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,315
[Gon] Next time: “Power x To x Avenge”!

437
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,941
Power… right?

438
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,485
[Killua] Avenge... right?

439
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,821
[Gon and Killua] Right? Right? Right?
