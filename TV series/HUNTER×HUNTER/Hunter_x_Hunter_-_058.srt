1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,050
[Kurapika] To verify, are you Pakunoda 
of the Phantom Troupe?

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,301
Yes, I am.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,553
She's telling the truth.

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,640
Let's begin.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,514
I will present each of you 
with two conditions.

6
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:20,896
If you choose to abide by them, 
I will release your leader.

7
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,237
[Chrollo] Figure it out, Pakunoda.

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,575
He's more concerned about his friends 
than killing me to satisfy his revenge.

9
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:37,371
That is the chain user's weakness!

10
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,457
[theme music playing]

11
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:01,894
SIGNAL x TO x RETREAT

12
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,917
[Kurapika] I’ll start with the conditions 
for the leader.

13
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,061
First, I hereby forbid 
all further use of Nen.

14
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:11,965
Second...

15
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,513
[breathing shakily]

16
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,224
Is this really the right move?

17
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,854
If I eliminate the boss, 
the Spider will fall apart.

18
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,065
That was the idea, but...

19
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,443
I have absolutely no value as a hostage.

20
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,529
Everything that he’s saying 
right now is true.

21
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,992
[Kurapika] But the Spider can live on, 
even without a head.

22
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,745
The leader isn't everything.

23
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,455
The group would be more than willing

24
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,791
to sacrifice him 
if they felt it necessary.

25
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,086
That is the nature of the Phantom Troupe.

26
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,965
I can cut off the head, 
but it’s no guarantee the spider will die.

27
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,887
The question is, 
is there any other alternative?

28
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,307
Is there some kind of miracle 
that can get me out of this bind?

29
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,647
[sighs] There isn't. 
None that I can think of.

30
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,983
Yes, this is right.

31
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,696
In this moment, this is what I have to do.

32
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,827
I must get those two back. 
That is my top priority!

33
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:26,790
I’ve lost too many people already.

34
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:29,301
I will not lose my friends!

35
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,381
Second, I forbid all contact 
with other Troupe members from now on.

36
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,967
Those are my conditions.

37
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,219
And to make certain you adhere to them,

38
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:41,972
I will stab your leader 
with my Judgment Chain:

39
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,640
Arbiter Little Finger.

40
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,979
It’s up to you now, Pakunoda. 
Are these conditions acceptable?

41
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,112
Yes, I accept.

42
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,294
[Kurapika] Pakunoda, you're next.

43
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:19,217
First off, release Gon and Killua, 
uninjured, before midnight,

44
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,886
and without any deceptions.

45
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:25,807
Second, you are also forbidden 
to reveal anything about me.

46
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,436
Accept and I’ll stab you 
with the chain as well.

47
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,812
Yes, go ahead.

48
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,813
-[chain rattling] 
-[grunts]

49
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:41,072
Hey, if Gon and Killua 
were being controlled by a Manipulator,

50
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,575
could you tell from their heartbeats?

51
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,076
[Melody] Maybe.

52
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,955
I've met Killua before, 
so I know his normal heartbeat.

53
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,083
I should be able to tell 
if anything has changed.

54
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,293
Good enough.

55
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,839
Before the exchange, 
I have something to say.

56
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,383
[heart beating]

57
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,593
[Melody] Kurapika.

58
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,722
In the back of your mind, 
you sense that something's amiss.

59
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,393
You’re curious as to why Pakunoda 
came alone.

60
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,190
If the Troupe were as merciless 
as we expected them to be,

61
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,901
this hostage exchange would be impossible.

62
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,238
[Chrollo] You are the one who is cornered.

63
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,199
[Melody] Their rules are ironclad

64
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,244
and their boss accepts them 
without question.

65
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,288
But what about the others?

66
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,666
This one appears to be different.

67
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,836
This woman whom you despise

68
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,065
with your whole being 
is driven, certainly.

69
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,190
But by the very same motive 
that drives you.

70
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,474
She wishes to save her boss... 
to save her friend.

71
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,479
You do realize this, don’t you?

72
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:01,528
Now, return to your companions 
and inform them of the exchange.

73
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,366
I want you to bring the hostages 
to Lingon Airport before midnight tonight.

74
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,661
Come alone and tell no one 
where you're going.

75
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,206
I understand. I will do what you ask.

76
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,042
Take me back to the airport.

77
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,505
You haven't asked any questions.

78
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:26,303
You know who I am. You must by now. 
Aren't you worried?

79
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,472
You don't find this deal unreasonable?

80
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,434
Do you actually believe 
I'll return your leader?

81
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,228
-I do. 
-[Kurapika gasps]

82
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,814
If you really wanted to deceive me,

83
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,609
you wouldn’t have asked me 
those questions.

84
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,199
[thunder crashing]

85
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,828
Does he really expect us 
to simply accept those conditions?

86
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,874
Tell us where he is, Paku.

87
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,294
We'll kill the kids and go deal 
with the chain user.

88
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,962
You’re insisting?

89
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,213
Damn right I am.

90
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,008
If you don’t tell us, 
then you’re not leaving.

91
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,260
I refuse to tell you anything,

92
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,888
and I’m taking the kids alone, 
end of story.

93
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,556
Don't interfere.

94
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,143
Screw that. If anyone is interfering, 
it’s you!

95
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,813
Go ahead, Pakunoda. 
We can stop them, so don't worry.

96
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,858
Stop us? How insulting.

97
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,613
[Phinks] You’re serious, aren’t you? 
I don’t get it.

98
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,199
Have you all lost your damn minds?

99
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,495
[Feitan] I think the chain user got 
to them before we arrived.

100
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,747
They're probably under his control.

101
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,250
We're wasting time. 
I'll make them talk.

102
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,419
[Gon] You really don't get it?

103
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,967
You don't understand why Pakunoda 
wants to leave

104
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,468
without telling you anything?

105
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,180
And you don’t understand 
why Machi would wanna stop you?

106
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,266
You think it’s because 
they’re being manipulated?

107
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,354
It’s ‘cause they wanna rescue your boss! 
What else would it be?

108
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,774
They wanna save their friend from danger. 
Don’t you understand that?

109
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,277
Shut up, pipsqueak! 
You're just desperate to leave!

110
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,404
[Gon grunting]

111
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,909
I’m not saying it to save myself. 
Take it back!

112
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,287
[Killua] Man...

113
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,539
[chains breaking]

114
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,709
Take it back? 
Come over here and make me.

115
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,712
I’ll rip your head off 
the second you take a step.

116
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,715
Then I won’t! You think I’m that stupid?

117
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,217
Kurapika isn't like you.

118
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,177
No matter how much he hates someone,

119
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,638
he would never lose control 
and kill them out of anger!

120
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,015
He’s not a murderer!

121
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,767
And you better believe 
if Kurapika makes a promise,

122
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,562
then he’s gonna keep his word, 
no matter what happens.

123
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,982
Doubt me? Ask Pakunoda. 
She’s met him. She knows!

124
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,527
If you just do what he says, 
he will return your boss!

125
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,738
[Phinks] All right kid, that's enough.

126
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,365
I’m starting to get real sick 
of your crap!

127
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,742
[Franklin] Knock it off!

128
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,578
Just let Pakunoda go.

129
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,080
[Phinks] 
What, you're siding with them now?

130
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:03,460
Hey, Shal, what do you think 
our worst-case scenario would be?

131
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:06,963
Hmm, that the Boss is already dead

132
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,674
and Paku and the rest 
are being controlled.

133
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,260
That we won’t be able 
to locate the chain user

134
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:15,163
and the two kids find a way to escape.

135
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,790
[Franklin] You've got it all wrong.

136
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:22,520
The worst-case scenario is that we all die 
and the Spider perishes.

137
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:26,066
What you’re talking about 
would be pretty pleasant by comparison.

138
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,859
Am I wrong?

139
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,445
No, you're right.

140
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,949
Whatever your reasoning, 
you’re relying way too much on the boss.

141
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,328
And if the Phantom Troupe falls apart 
as a result,

142
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,414
that’d be more of a betrayal 
than anything else.

143
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,959
Keep bickering like this 
and it might just happen.

144
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,088
So calm down and let them have their way.

145
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,007
Pakunoda can take the kids.

146
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,259
If the boss doesn't return,

147
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,845
we’ll kill the members 
who are being controlled

148
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,432
and start rebuilding the spider. 
It's really that simple.

149
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,435
[Machi] 
I'm fine with that if it'll satisfy you.

150
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,606
Though I’m not being controlled 
and killing me won’t be easy.

151
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,650

-Yeah, hello-- 
-[Kurapika] Put the hostages on the phone.

154

[Shalnark] Don't break it!

155
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,159
[Kurapika] Are you okay? 
Are they there?

156
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,994
Yeah, they're all right here.

157
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,663
[Shalnark] Hey!

158
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:26,041
Look, we're following your orders.

159
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,839
[Franklin] Aren't you going 
to go after them?

160
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:34,759
I mean, the chain user can’t monitor 
our location now.

161
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,220
[Phinks] Shut up.

162
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,306
If I tried to follow them, 
you would just stop me, right?

163
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,934
I’ll just wait here for the time being.

164
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,062
And if the Boss doesn’t come back 
for whatever reason,

165
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,856
I guess I’ll kill you, too.

166
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,399
[Franklin] As you wish.

167
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,405
[Kurapika] Board the airship. 
The pilot knows where to go.

168
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,075
[Melody] 
Just the three of them, as promised.

169
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,077
[Kurapika] We can't be sure yet.

170
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,121
So stay on high alert.

171
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,914
There's someone over there.

172
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,793
[phone ringing]

173
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,337
It's him! Hisoka!

174
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,839
[Hisoka] Hey.

175
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,718
What are you doing here? 
Did you sneak out?

176
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,722
No need for concern. 
I left a double behind.

177
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:26,277
[Illumi] Make it quick. Without needles, 
my face will revert in four to five hours.

178
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,646
[Kurapika] What are you up to?

179
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,441
[Hisoka] Allow me to board the airship 
with them.

180
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,944
If you refuse, I'll kill Gon and Killua.

181
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,070
[Kurapika] Bastard.

182
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:40,033
[Hisoka] I’m only kidding. 
I would never be so wasteful.

183
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:43,786
My target is Chrollo and Chrollo alone.

184
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,373
And I’ll gladly get off the airship 
as soon as he is released.

185
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,878
All I want is to fight him. 
Nothing more, I promise.

186
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,354
[phone ringing]

187
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,732
[Kurapika] Killua, place the phone 
next to your heart.

188
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,112
It’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with him.

189
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,782
Okay. Begin the exchange!

190
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,306
[Kurapika] If you make contact 
with a Troupe member, you die.

191
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,320
Now you'll know the pain...

192
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:51,337
of losing your home.

193
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,362
[Hisoka] I've waited a long time 
for this moment.

194
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,783
Come on. Let's fight.

195
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,333
I won’t be needing this anymore.

196
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:20,425
Now this won’t be considered infighting. 
So there’s no need to hold back.

197
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,350
[chuckles] We can talk 
because you aren't a Troupe member.

198
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,853
I can't fight you.

199
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,690
Or rather, I’m simply not worth 
the trouble.

200
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,775
Because, you see,

201
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,112
he stabbed his Judgment Chain 
directly into my heart.

202
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,698
I can't use Nen anymore.

203
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,827
[wind whistling]

204
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,248
It appears that we can leave now.

205
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,249
I see.

206
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,378
[Leorio] Hisoka returned to the airship 
without fighting at all.

207
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,840
[Kurapika] The leader probably told him 
about my chains

208
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,009
once he realized he wasn’t a member.

209
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,178
But I’m not surprised.

210
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:09,599
Fighting someone who can’t use Nen 
wouldn’t be of much interest to Hisoka.

211
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,809
So wait, he wasn't a Troupe member?

212
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,810
No.

213
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,021
[Pakunoda] How did you sneak out?

214
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,274
[Hisoka] 
I have a friend who's good with disguises.

215
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,151
There’s no need to worry.

216
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,363
I no longer have any reason 
to kill Chrollo.

217
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,784
I have no interest in broken toys.

218
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,912
“Slip out when it pleases you.”

219
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,663
One more thing.

220
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,166
My real fortune mentioned something.

221
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,086
That I would have a date 
with the boss on Tuesday.

222
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:43,424
It also said that by the time I left, 
the Troupe’s numbers would be cut in half.

223
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,638
Bit by bit, fate seems to be changing.

224
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,724
[Kurapika] 
I’m sorry for exposing you to danger.

225
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,228
You used your chains on the boss, 
didn’t you?

226
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,979
[Kurapika] Yes, but...

227
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,857
Something tells me 
that this isn’t the end.

228
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,867
[cat meows]

229
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:14,747
Meow.

230
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,543
[Phinks] Where's the boss?

231
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,294
[Pakunoda] He can’t come here.

232
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,506
Huh? You’re kidding. You’d better explain.

233
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,925
And if we don’t like it… 
[cracking knuckles]

234
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,887
Yes, I know. But don’t worry.

235
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:37,311
I can only shoot six bullets at once. 
Enough for the founding members.

236
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:45,778
Feitan, Phinks, Machi, Nobunaga, 
Shalnark, Franklin...

237
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,869
Will you trust me, 
and accept this completely?

238
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,291
[Machi] Paku, you're not...

239
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,793
Hey! Don’t tell me 
you’re being controlled--

240
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:01,794
Be quiet!

241
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,923
It's Paku. You can trust her.

242
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,635
[Pakunoda] All my memories...

243
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,805
My heart and soul...

244
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,560
I give you everything.

245
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,686
[bullets firing]

246
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,819
[gasping]

247
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,947
Please...

248
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,074
Let me be...

249
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,076
the last.

250
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,204
Paku... [grunts]

251
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,588
[Shizuku] She's dead.

252
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,216
What's going on here?

253
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,468
[Phinks] I’ll explain everything.

254
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,136
[thunder rumbling]

255
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,934
Now we know. She did this because…

256
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,652
[Gon] I sure hope Kurapika's fever 
doesn't go down.

257
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,120
[Killua] Yeah.

258
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,948
Hold on. What did you just say?

259
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,202
[Gon] I feel like Kurapika shouldn’t fight 
the Phantom Troupe anymore.

260
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,537
[Killua] Huh?

261
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,415
[Gon] When he told me about his abilities, 
I thought of something.

262
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,710
If all he had really wanted 
was to get revenge,

263
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,672
then he probably would have 
taken on different abilities.

264
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,131
[Killua] Think so?

265
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,635
I do. Because If he had only wanted 
to kill the Troupe,

266
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,597
he wouldn’t have gone through the trouble 
of chaining their hearts. I wouldn't have.

267
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,933
Maybe, if he only had one target.

268
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:44,730
Instead, he was dealing with all of them. 
He couldn’t catch and kill one right away.

269
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,651
He’d need to extract information 
about the others.

270
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,319
[Gon] Oh.

271
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,615
[Killua] I think his ability was created 
solely for revenge.

272
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,742
I see.

273
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,914
But that was his original objective. 
Kurapika's different now.

274
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,128
I'm blessed with good friends.

275
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,258
[Killua] But you've got a point.

276
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:14,943
He really should stay still 
for a little while.

277
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,179
If their boss doesn’t come back,

278
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,890
they’re gonna be even more determined 
to find him.

279
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,267
[Gon] Yeah.

280
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,686
[Killua] Either way, 
we’re gonna have to be careful

281
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:25,662
when we go to the auction house.

282
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,482
-So, do you really have a plan? 
-[gasps]

283
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,985
Something to help us get our hands 
on Greed Island?

284
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,987
'Cause that’s all we have to go on!

285
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,240
Uh, yeah, but it's only a 50-50 chance.

286
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,118
Wait, didn’t you say 70 percent earlier?

287
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,455
I get it. That's pretty clever.

288
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,541
And it might be our only shot.

289
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,169
It’s practical and sound, too.

290
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:52,048
Yeah! The way I see it, 
our odds are 80 percent!

291
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,050
-Really? 
-Really. Let's do it.

292
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,971
[Gon] The auction is in Hall B.

293
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,432
[Killua] That's it, over there.

294
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,852
[Gon] Wow!

295
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,856
[both startle]

296
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,193
[both grunting]

297
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,445
What the heck are those guys doing here?

298
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,696
How would I know?

299
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,451
[Phinks] You know, that was cold. 
No need for you to run away.

300
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,203
[Killua] Why wouldn't we run?

301
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,579
Yeah, don't worry.

302
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,040
We’re not here to kill you two 
or anything.

303
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:30,127
He’s right. It’s not like we can kill 
the chain user now anyway.

304
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,712
[Gon] What? What do you mean?

305
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,466
[Phinks] Well, he used his chains 
on the boss, didn’t he?

306
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,551
That means we can’t kill him.

307
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,012
I thought it was the opposite.

308
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,181
[Killua] It’s nice to have someone around

309
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,725
who never shies away 
from asking questions.

310
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,521
When you die, it doesn’t mean 
your Nen disappears.

311
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:53,943
Nen that's driven by hatred and regret 
can last a long time after death.

312
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,988
And it will direct itself 
toward the target of those emotions.

313
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,201
Since the boss can’t use Nen 
himself anymore,

314
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,663
he’s all the more vulnerable 
to that kind of assault.

315
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,499
Scary, that residual Nen.

316
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,335
That's why we can't kill the chain user.

317
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,423
Am I talking too much?

318
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,093
Fine, then. I won't say another word.

319
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:25,266
There are Nen users a few, anyway, 
who can remove Nen from other people.

320
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,602
[wind whistling]

321
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,147
[Chrollo] Hmm. East it is.

322
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,524
So, as you might’ve guessed,

323
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,568
we’re pretty much done 
with the two of you.

324
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,696
The only reason we’re even here 
is to enjoy the auction.

325
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,782
The other members decided 
to pack up and go home already.

326
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,702
Hold on. How's Miss Pakunoda?

327
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,747
She died, actually.

328
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,250
Oh, I see.

329
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,713
[Pakunoda] I don't get it. 
Why don't you run away?

330
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,590
What do you mean by that?

331
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,426
[Pakunoda] With my injuries, 
you could escape easily.

332
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,848
And if you did, I would lose my leverage, 
and the chain user could kill the boss.

333
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,267
So why not run away?

334
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,311
Aren't you on his side?

335
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,813
Well, we’re his friends!

336
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,690
And we all care about him.

337
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,067
And we don’t want him to turn 
into a murderer.

338
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,946
If an exchange will do the job, 
that’s what we’ll do.

339
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,370
-[Gon] What's wrong? 
-[Killua] Let's go.

340
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,248
[Phinks] Paku...

341
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,003
Paku was very thankful to both of you.

342
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,556
[narrator] Tune in next time, 
when the Greed Island arc begins!

343
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:52,520
[theme music playing]

344
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,045
-[Gon] Coming up, Gon... 
-[Killua] And Killua's...

345
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,297
[both] Hunterpedia!

346
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,840
-I'm Gon! 
-I'm Killua!

347
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,341
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

348
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,010
Today, we're introducing Chrollo!

349
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,387
He's a Specialist and the boss 
of the Phantom Troupe!

350
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,557
He can steal other people's powers 
for himself with his Skill Hunter!

351
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,767
As long as certain conditions are met.

352
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,144
Huh. East it is.

353
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,610
[Gon] Next time: "Bid x and x Haste."

354
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:26,530
[Gon] A bid in haste makes a whole lot 
of waste. Hey!

355
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,574
[Killua] And a bad aftertaste.
