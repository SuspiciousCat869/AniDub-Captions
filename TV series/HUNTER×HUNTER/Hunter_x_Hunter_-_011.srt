I know. But at least now we’re in 
a better position with a two-one lead.

let's keep this ball rolling.

Well? Let’s hear it. 
What’s the next wager gonna be, huh?

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,512

All right.

What do you say we place bets on

Huh?

What’s the matter? 
That isn’t a problem, is it?

42

[Leorio] 
Uh, no.

43
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,672
She is definitely a woman.

44
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,591
Or maybe she’s a cross-dresser?

45
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,512
No way. She’s gotta be a woman.

46
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,807
Fine, I accept.

47
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,851
But what if I bet you’re a man?

48
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,145
How exactly are you gonna prove 
you’re not?

49
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,563
Oh, right.

50
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,734
I promise to let you examine

Yeah....

[laughs excitedly in his head]

55
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,205
He’s already chosen. 
He’ll bet she’s a man.

56
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,958
-Yeah. 
-[Gon] Huh? Why?

57
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,877
[Leorio] 
I've made up my mind.

58
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,172
And I’ll wager ten hours 
that you’re actually a man!

[Leroute scoffs]

But... how did you know?

63
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,431
[Leorio] 
This way,

64
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,725
even if I’m wrong and she is a woman

65
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,019
still get to check out her body!

66
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,356
Either way, 
talk about a win-win situation!

67
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,984
Actually, I hope I’m wrong!

68
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,194
Do you get it now?

69
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,445
Yeah, I do.

70
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,699
Okay, reveal the answer!

71
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,039
That’s too bad. I’m really a woman.

72
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,000
[gulps] 
Oh, you are, huh?

73
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,337
Well, want to check for yourself?

74
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,382
Well, don’t mind if I do. 
I mean, just to be fair, of course.

00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,606
[Gon sighs]

79
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,150
It is physically painful to watch this.

80
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,027
[Tonpa] 
He's going to lose.

81
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,782
No question. She can already see 
right through his strategy.

82
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,325
He’s betting safe.

83
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,662
It’s obvious. 
Hedging his bets to minimize the damage.

84
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,622
He’s the kind of gambler

85
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,208
who tries to avoid losing 
instead of trying to win.

86
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,794
That kind of betting 
never takes home the prize.

87
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,003
[Leorio chuckling]

88
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,049
Sorry to say it, boys, but Leorio 
just doesn’t have what it takes.

89
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,719
[Leroute] I thought so.

90
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,098
His gambling style is 
nothing to worry about.

91
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,727
If he keeps playing that way, 
he doesn’t have a prayer.

92
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,354
[chuckles]

93
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,316
Well? 
Your turn to pick what we bet on next.

94
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,360
So what do you wanna wager?

95
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,531
[Leorio] 
This is no time to celebrate.

96
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,076
I've only got ten hours left to bet with.

97
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,413
Leorio has no room for error.

98
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,708
Losing the next bet would tie the score 
up at two-to-two.

99
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,794
And then we lose 50 hours,

100
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,213
leaving very little time 
to clear the tower.

101
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,258
[Gon] Leorio.

102
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,760
Okay, what to bet on…

103
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,306
I can’t afford to lose 
but I can’t think of a sure-fire win.

104
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,641
Hey, I got it!

105
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,811
We’ll bet on whether I’m a really man 
or just a woman in disguise

106
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,064
No, that’s never gonna work. 
Gotta think of something else.

107
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,525
Keep it to yourself, old man.

108
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,861
Thinking out loud 
isn’t how you plan a strategy!

109
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,279
I know.

110
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,281
-[Gon] Leorio! 
-Huh?

111
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,910
How ‘bout you bet on whether or not 
you’re a teenager?

112
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,745
Give me a break, Gon.

113
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,581
There’s no way I look that old 
and you all know it!

114
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,541
I’m clearly a teenager!

115
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,044
He's... a teenager?

116
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,298
Wow, he looks like an old man.

117
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,426
All right! I know what we’re betting on.

118
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,429
Let’s bet on who’ll win 
rock paper scissors!

119
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,015
[giggles] 
Why not.

120
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,975
Is he serious?

121
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,728
Why did he have to pick 
such a difficult wager?

122
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,856
Wait. 
What’s so hard about rock paper scissors?

123
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,734
[Leorio scoffs] 
Just so happens,

124
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,945
rock paper scissors is my specialty.

125
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,615
In fact, I just played a tournament 
in the shopping district

126
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,076
and I won a gourmet vacation.

127
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,911
Let's see.

128
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:37,082
So for my wager, I’ve got eighty hours 
that say I’ll win, okay?

129
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,960
Eh... Did you just say 80?

130
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,920
That’s not a problem, is it?

131
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,214
I'm free to bet however much I want.

132
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,256
Uh...

133
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,218
I guess there's no rule against it.

134
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,053
Perfect. And if you lose,

135
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,931
I can only take ten from you 
since that’s all you have left.

136
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,224
So don't worry.

137
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,519
[Leorio] 
She doesn't need to bet 80 hours.

138
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,229
Ten's plenty.

139
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,314
I mean, what if she loses?

140
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,442
Is she that confident 
in her rock paper scissors skills?

141
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:10,031
[Leroute] As expected, 
he's starting to stress out. [giggles]

142
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,742
I can read him like an open book.

143
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,787
While the rules 
of rock paper scissors are simple,

144
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,665
the game itself can be incredibly complex.

145
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,793
From the perspective of probability,

146
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,797
you only stand a one-in-three chance 
of losing any given round.

147
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,051
But if your opponent can predict 
your reasoning

148
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,803
and control your reactions,

149
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,097
your chance of losing 
increases dramatically.

150
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,766
In short, this is a game of wits

151
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,728
and Leorio is pretty lacking 
in that department.

152
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,229
I see.

153
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,897
[Leorio] 
Okay, I'm ready.

154
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,528
[chuckles]

155
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,988
Hey, what's so funny?

156
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,949
It’s just I can already tell 
what you’re going to use.

157
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,536
I’m something of a mind reader, you see.

158
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,538
That is a lie.

159
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,083
You can bluff all you want, but it’ll take 
a lot more than that to scare me!

160
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,793
You’ll believe it soon…

161
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:11,760
[Leroute giggles] Just like I planned. 
One blatant lie and he's losing it.

162
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,095
[Leorio] 
Can she really read minds?

163
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,432
No, she’s lying. She’s gotta be.

164
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,560
But what if she isn't?

165
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,854
Leorio will use rock.

166
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,481
You ready?

167
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,693
-And... rock, paper, scissors. 
-Scissors.

168
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,490
You were right.

169
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,033
Good guess, Kurapika.

170
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,493
Leorio was nervous,

171
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,829
leading him to avoid any actions 
that involved opening up.

172
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,706
She's good.

173
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,209
She’s doing everything she can 
to make him uncomfortable

174
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,294
and less likely to use paper.

175
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:51,674
So, she sticks to rock, 
ensuring either a win or a draw.

176
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,510
Like I said,

177
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,012
Rock-paper-scissors is 
actually a mind game.

178
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,764
Now I see.

179
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,725
Hang on.

180
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,020
We both used rocks, 
so that was a draw, wasn't it?

181
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,939
So what if it was?

182
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,482
Ha! I knew it!

183
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,401
You were lying about being able 
to read my mind!

184
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,447
If you really were a psychic, 
then you would have beaten me! Right?!

185
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,990
[giggles]

186
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,284
[Leorio] 
What are you laughing at?

187
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,037
I gave you that tie on purpose. 
You’re welcome.

188
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,413
Quit lying!

189
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,040
Have you forgotten already?

190
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,377
We’re trying to stall you here 
for as long as possible.

191
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,338
If I really wanted to,

192
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,633
I could force a series of draws 
that would last indefinitely.

193
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,469
But why?

194
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,472
I’m sure that wouldn’t be half as fun 
as toying with you.

195
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,225
But I’ll end it after this.

196
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,311
Well, what will you use next?

197
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,774
Come on, think hard. [laughs]

198
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,317
Damn it!

199
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,903
[Leroute] 
Yes, that's it. .

200
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,989
Worry. Fret.

201
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,659
[Kurapika] 
Worrying, fretting.

202
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,871
Whenever someone’s confidence 
is shattered,

203
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,873
they begin to crave reassurance.

204
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,418
See? That’s obviously 
what’s happening to Leorio.

205
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,836
He'll use the same play,

206
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,714
play or something stronger 
to regain his confidence.

207
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,257
I see what she's doing.

208
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,303
She's trying to get Leorio to choose 
either rock or paper.

209
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,346
Correct.

210
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,349
Using paper means 
she’s certain not to lose.

211
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,769
Then Leorio’s gotta stay one step ahead!

212
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,104
Indeed.

213
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,149
And if he were calmer, 
he might actually be able to.

214
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,277
-[Gon] Leorio! 
-Now what?

215
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,198
Listen! If you want to win, 
you’ve gotta play scissors!

216
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,616
Scissors, what?

217
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,161
[giggles] 
Go ahead, try.

218
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,790
[Leorio] But if I do, 
she's just going to use rock.

219
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,128
No. She’ll go a step further 
and choose paper.

220
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,548
Unless she goes even further 
and picks scissors.

221
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,801
Or she might jump ahead 
and go straight to rock…

222
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,721
[screams] 
What is happening!

223
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,056
Here we go.

224
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,893
Here comes the draw!

225
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,066
[beeping]

226
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,861

I win, yay!

227
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,741
[laughing]

228
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,494
Amazing. 
This game’s really hard.

229
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,412
And now the score’s two-two.

230
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,582
Even worse, we have far less time

231
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,252
now that we’ve lost the 50 hours 
he gambled with.

232
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,425
[Leorio] Sorry, I thought I was 
a rock paper scissors pro.

233
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,387
[Tonpa scoffs] 
Pretty pathetic showing.

234
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,721
What did you say?

235
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,725
Yeah, 
I guess I can't argue with you there.

236
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,986
Okay. So how much time do they have left? 
How did I do?

237
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,615
[chuckles] 
Fifty-nine hours, forty-five minutes.

238
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,119
Not bad. 
By my calculations, that means

239
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,455
they’ve now got fewer than ten hours 
to reach the bottom.

240
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,834
It doesn't matter how much time they have.

241
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,377
[gasping]

242
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:19,590
[man] It doesn't matter 
because my opponent is about to die.

ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

245
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,489
So the final round is upon us.

246
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,991
I guess that means I’m up.

247
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,076
Huh? Wait, Killua?

248
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,703
What does that mean?

249
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,621
Damn, this sucks!

250
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,042
I really needed to win my round. 
It’s all my fault!

251
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,586
Gon, your buddy, here, is pissing me off.

252
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,545
Take it easy.

253
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,630
Don’t throw in the towel.

254
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,133
We don’t even know 
what the next contest is yet.

255
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,719
But if it’s something 
like doing math in your head,

256
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,095
I’m totally surrendering.

257
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,138
Hey, you’re right

258
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,099
If the next opponent’s a weakling, 
we might still have a chance!

[Bendot] 
That kid's their last member.

260
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,481
I didn’t think he’d draw the short straw.

261
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,067
That poor thing. He’s still so young.

262
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,112
[Lippo] I did everything I could 
to avoid using him.

263
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,283
However, the Hunter Exam isn’t the time 
or the place

264
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,534
for showing mercy.

265
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,537
If he dies, well, that’s fate.

We should just take the loss.

The worst mass murderer 
in Zaban’s history.

He chose his victims at random.

It was all over the news. 
146 people.

Men, women, young, old, all slaughtered.

Each of the victims had 
one thing in common.

He murdered every single one of them 
with his bare hands.

286
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,554
His grip was infamous. 
The raw power in his fingers alone…

It was unreal.

It’s been ages

Wasn’t he listening to a word I just said?

00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,443
[beeping]

321
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,238
So, that's three wins for us.

322
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,406
We move on, right?

323
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,075
That's right. Yeah, you guys win.

324
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,869
By the way,

325
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,829
you must be itching for some action.

326
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,664
You didn't get to fight.

327
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,293
How about it? 
Want to take me on?

328
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,921
Thanks but no thanks.

329
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,923
Suit yourself.

330
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,013
Whoa, who is this kid, anyway?

331
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,307
That's right, you guys don't know?

332
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,558
Wait. Know what?

333
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,562
Killua's family. He says 
they're a bunch of elite assassins.

334
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:10,024
[surprised gasp] 
Did you say elite assassins?

335
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,192
[Killua] I'm back.

336
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,444
What?

337
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,323
Just... good work out there!

338
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,585
[Lippo] 
Please cross the bridge.

339
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,380
[over PA] On the other side, 
you'll find a small room.

340
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,966
That's where you'll be spending 
the 50 hours you gambled away.

341
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,511
Well, come on.

342
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,471
-[Gon] Mm-hmm. 
-All right, sure.

343
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,078
[voice over PA] Gittarackur, 
applicant 301, is the second to pass.

344
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,706
Time elapsed, 12 hours and two minutes.

345
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,043
Something told me 
you'd already passed the finish line.

346
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:15,712
[Hanzo] 
All right!!

347
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:18,142
-[over PA] Applicant 294, is the third... 
-I'm the first one to finish!

348
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:19,135
What the...?

349
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,095
-...twelve hours and three minutes. 
-Oh!

350
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,513
I don't believe it.

351
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,765
I came in third place.

352
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,435
[rumbling]

353
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,353
[beeping]

354
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,856
Oh, come on, give me a break.

355
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,109
Can't believe we've got to sit around here 
for 50 hours.

356
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,945
-Killua. 
-Huh?

357
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,030
Can you tell me how 
that technique works?

358
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,532
What do you mean "technique".

359
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,785
The one you used 
to instantly remove his heart.

360
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,456
Oh, that one. 
Well, it wasn't a technique, really.

361
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,957
I just ripped it out.

362
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,167
[Kurapika] That's all?

363
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:57,173
To be honest... I did manipulate 
my body some. Made it a lot easier.

364
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,425
Whoa! Your nails!

365
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,676
Oh, wow.

366
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,097
Mass murderers talk big, 
but they're still just amateurs.

367
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,516
I used to be a professional.

368
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,020
But my old man would have done 
a lot better.

369
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,607
When he takes a heart, 
there's not even a drop of blood.

370
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,735
[laughs nervousy] 
That's good to know. Thanks, kid.

371
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,447
[Kurapika] 
At least he's on our side.

372
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:26,035
All right then, 
we've got more than two days.

373
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,953
So what do you want to do?

374
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,288
We've got to do something.

375
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,291
First, let's search the room to see 
if there's anything to play with.

376
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,375
Okay.

377
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,755
Kids! Not a care in the world, huh?

378
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,090
Time to take a load off.

379
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,223
[narrator] Gon's team of five passed 
the trial

380
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,891
with three wins and two losses.

381
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,520
But now must spend their 
50-hour penalty here.

382
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,273
Unfortunately, 
they're running out of time.

383
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,983
[beeping]

384
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,983
[theme music plays]

385
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,365
[Gon] Next time. 
"Final Test of Resolve."

386
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,075
You have to think like a fish!

387
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,077
-[Killua] Seriously? 
-[Gon] Yep!
