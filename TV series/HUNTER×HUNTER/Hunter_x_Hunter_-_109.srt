00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,715
may somehow be spirited away
beyond our reach.

160
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,851
Let’s just say that one of them

161
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,654
has the ability
to teleport objects.

162
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,757
Let’s further assume
that they use that ability

163
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,761
to isolate and teleport
the king somewhere far away,

164
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:18,699
so at least one of us must stay
close by the king’s side

165
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,068
and guard him
throughout the entire sorting.

166
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,604
Menthuthuyoupi: He would
never allow us to do that.

167
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,539
The king’s been
irritated enough with us

168
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,675
because of how close we’ve
been covering him as it is.

169
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,078
Shaiapouf: Then we guard him
secretly without his knowledge.

170
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:35,048
The only problem with that
is that we need someone

171
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,618
close enough
to monitor his surroundings

172
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,087
while he carries out
his role in the sorting...

173
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,892
Someone whose size
won’t draw attention

174
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,295
and who won’t get distracted
by an amusing task.

175
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,697
Very well, then.

176
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,667
Clearly the best choice
we have is me.

177
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,304
It is a mantle which I
will be quite proud to bear.

178
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,706
Neferpitou: Hmm?

179
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,976
Shaiapouf: Is something wrong?

180
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,978
Neferpitou: Meow all
of the enemy presences

181
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,846
have completely disappeared...

182
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:08,582
And I can’t sense

183
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,084
any residual aura
from them whatsoever.

184
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:15,756
They must be using zetsu to hide
amongst the marching humans.

185

♪

186
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,497
Meleoron: Hey. What’s up?

187
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,899
Knuckle: There are
so many people.

188
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,236
Looks like they had
about a hundred per building.

189
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,605
They all must have
been packed inside.

190
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,141
Shoot: Then if we
all conceal our presences,

191
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,276
they’ll be forced
to assume that we’re hiding

192
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,912
somewhere among the citizens.

193
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,780
Do you think there’s any chance

194
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,782
they’ll decide
to cancel the march altogether?

195
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,016
Meleoron: No. No way.

196
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,753
That would mean delaying
or even canceling

197
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,789
the entire celebration,
which would imply

198
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,625
the king had accepted defeat
and compromised.

199
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:55,028
The royal guard’s
not gonna let that happen,

200
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:58,799
so the celebration
is gonna begin as scheduled

201
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,934
tomorrow at 3:00 P.M. sharp,

202
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:04,138
and there’s not a damn thing
we can do to stop it.

203
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,273
( Neferpitou sighs )

204
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,275
Once the humans started to move,

205
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:12,045
my puppets couldn’t
tell them apart anymore.

206
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,714
Well, what do you think?

207
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,582
Should I recall them right meow?

208
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,818
Shaiapouf: No.
Giving the enemy free rein

209
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,653
would be simply ridiculous.

210
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,221
A better strategy

211
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:23,290
would be to have the puppets
join the soldiers

212
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,193
that are guiding the citizens
as a deterrent.

213
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,762
( Neferpitou groans )

214
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,311
Knuckle: Hey.

215
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,313
Morel: It’s just
like we thought.

216
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,349
The nen puppets
have joined the march.

217
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:54,054
In another hour, those sectors
will be completely deserted.

218
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,360
There are six entrances
to the hole

219
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:02,062
that lead
straight to the palace.

220
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,698
We’ll have to avoid
the front entrances

221
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,266
due to heightened security

222
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,138
and wait by a, b, and c
behind the palace.

223
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,773
Shoot: Once we’re inside

224
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,841
and able to gain access
to the rooms,

225
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,744
the only available exit
will lead us

226
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,779
directly through
the inside of the palace.

227
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,881
Knuckle: So what?
Are you getting scared?

228
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,282
Shoot: That’s absurd.

229
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:24,285
I just don’t want
to be caught off guard, okay?

230
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:27,555
Waiting by the entrances
for the right moment

231
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:29,090
involves quite a lot of risk.

232
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,192
But if we were to enter
the rooms too early,

233
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:35,096
we wouldn’t be able to exit
until midnight.

234
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,097
Meleoron: If that’s the case,
we won’t be able

235
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,699
to get our hands
on any useful new information.

236
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,302
We’d just be flying blind
and hoping for the best.

237
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,005
Shoot: Oh, and we
can’t use our cell phones

238
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,573
anywhere near the palace,

239
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:48,976
since the ants
can pick up on the signal.

240
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,711
Sitting in that room for hours

241
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,714
is just about the most dangerous
thing that we could do.

242
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:57,017
If the situation changed,
we would have no way of knowing.

243
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,786
Knuckle: But you were the one
who said it would be too risky

244
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,088
for us to wait
outside the palace.

245

Still, be as careful
as possible.

Pitou doesn’t use

to want a real sense
of how strong his opponent is.

00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,038
Morel: Hypnosis? I see.

317
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,775
As long as they’re hypnotized,

318
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,877
the citizens won’t try to run,

319
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,945
but this works out for us.

320
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,048
- Meleoron: Huh?
- Morel: We won’t have to worry

321
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,016
about the whole crowd
flying into a total panic

322
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,885
if the battle
starts to get out of control.

323
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,553
Meleoron: Ah.

324
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:29,190
Morel: So there won’t be
a massive stampede of people

325
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:31,859
falling all over each other
to escape.

326
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,794
This is a really big deal.

327
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,863
Knuckle: And assuming
that over half of the people

328
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:38,298
will be in place at midnight

329
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,568
waiting for the sorting process
to get started,

330
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,771
I would have expected a stampede

331
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:46,573
to leave tens of thousands
of casualties.

332
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,276
Morel: That’s the biggest thing
we were worried about.

333
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,112
Now we can fight all we want.

334
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,082
Shoot: Six hours to go.

335
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,220
Morel: Everyone’s here.

336
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:03,124
Gon: Have you guys
heard from palm yet?

337
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,157
Morel: No.

338
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,761
Gon: I see.

339
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,997
Morel: We’ll wait ’til
half an hour before go time.

340
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,233
I just wish we knew
what was inside of there.

341
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:14,769
That could change things.

342
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,970
( Gon grunts )

343
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:20,241
( Shoot thinking )
They both look so calm,

344
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:22,610
killua in particular.

345
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:24,278
He shows
none of the vulnerability

346
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,979
he displayed when we fought.

347
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:29,016
It’s like he’s
overflowing with confidence.

348
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,985
But I can’t help but wonder,

349
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:36,290
why is it that,
now and then, he seems so sad?

350
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:41,695
No. I can’t worry
about others right now.

351
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,230
Out of everyone here,

352
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,700
i’m the one suffering
from the most anxiety.

353
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,971
The fate of humanity
rests on my shoulders.

354
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,108
Knuckle: Colt is a good guy.

355
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:58,712
Meleoron and ikalgo,
they both have good hearts.

356
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,148
It doesn’t matter
if they’re humans or ants.

357
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,984
Everyone has a heart.

358
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,152
That has to be true.

359
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,156
Let’s hope
the king has one, too.

360
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:14,161
Even so, some of them
are going to have to die.

361
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,964
It’s us or them.

362
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:20,534
Gon: It’s almost time, kite.

363
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,769
I promise,
no matter what it takes,

364
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:25,172
i’ll get you back
to the way you used to be...

365
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,610
By defeating that ant.

366
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,846
Killua: He’s fired up.

367
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,049
I’ll focus
on providing support

368
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:38,619
so that no one else
can interfere in his battle,

369
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:43,023
using my new move, godspeed.

370
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,725
Morel: I feel so tired.

371
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,528
All these battles
are taking their toll.

372
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,864
On a scale of one to 100,

373
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,099
i’m about a 40.

374
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,134
No, 35.

375
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,538
Can’t cry about it now.

376
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:01,141
With knov out,
i’m the only one left.

377
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:04,679
I’d hoped to fight
at full strength,

378
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:08,882
but it’s much easier
to accept my fate this way.

379
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,552
I’ll focus on playing the decoy

380
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:14,688
and drawing my target
away from the king.

381
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,727
Knov: I’m sorry,
morel, everyone,

382
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,896
( shudders ) But i--

383
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,965
I can’t face them again.

384
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,201
I’ll go check on the palace.

385
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,842
( Meleoron inhales )

386
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,878
So two minutes
is about the longest

387
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,079
I can hold my breath.

388
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,681
Given how tense i’ll be,

389
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,885
my limit will probably
be half that at best.

390
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,787
It’s fine.

391
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,689
A minute is
more than enough time.

392
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:54,094
Ikalgo: Tomorrow at midnight,

393
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,229
I will be reborn.

394
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:59,299
I couldn’t have dreamed
of this life a few days ago.

395
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,303
Thank you for that, killua.

396
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:07,942
I promise to carry out
my mission for you.

397
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:09,310
Tomorrow...

398
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,179
Will be my birthday.

399
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,932
King: I am king...

400
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:37,238
But who am I, really?

401
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,044
I wonder,
for what reason was I born?

402
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,050
Morel: Our time’s up.

403
