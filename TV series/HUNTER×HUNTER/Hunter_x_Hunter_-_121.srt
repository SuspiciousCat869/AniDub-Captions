’cause i--

324
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,798
I can’t see him

325
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:27,401
as just something
to exterminate now.

326
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:30,404
Morel: Knuckle.

327
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:32,907
Knuckle: You heard him.

328
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,375
He acknowledged
how serious we were.

329
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,045
He wasn’t a bad guy.

330
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,846
( Moans )

331
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:43,049
So why would we keep doing this?

332
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:46,152
I can’t think of a reason.

333
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,555
Knov: The king.

334
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,256
( Knuckle gasps )

335
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:50,825
Mr. Knov.

336
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,462
Knov: The soldiers
are of no consequence.

337
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,831
The king can just wave his hand

338
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:00,367
and turn all of them
into evil spawn.

339
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:01,468
( Shivering )

340
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:03,837
I’ll take care of morel.

341
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:06,106
Shoot is also safe.

342
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,577
Do you want
to come with me, too?

343
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:14,114
Morel: Wait. Let me hit
this little brat hard.

344
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,884
Knov: I just got word
from the chairman’s messenger.

345
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,585
( Shuddering )

346
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:22,089
He was able to take the king
to the agreed-upon spot.

347
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,356
( All gasp )

348
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,125
Knov: Even if they leave now,

349
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,294
the royal guard
won’t make it in time,

350
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,530
so consider them fired.

351
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:33,233
Same goes for you guys.
( Laughs )

352
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,535
Where’s palm?

353
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,136
Knuckle: No word yet.

354
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:37,604
Knov: I see.

355
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:40,407
Well? Now what?

356
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:43,911
I hope to come back here,
but I can’t guarantee it.

357
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,012
You can see i’m in bad shape.

358
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,414
( Both moan )

359
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:50,617
Knov: Are you going,
or are you staying?

360
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,019
Knuckle: We’re staying.

361
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,554
We’ve still got
a lot of work to do.

362
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,289
Knov: I see.

363
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:02,196
You’re tough.

364
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:09,369
Knuckle: Let’s go.

365
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,305
Meleoron: To look for palm?

366
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:14,207
Knuckle: No.
We can do that later.

367
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,043
There’s something else
we have to do first.

368
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:21,081
♪

369
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:25,085
Youpi’s not the only
royal guard, you know.
