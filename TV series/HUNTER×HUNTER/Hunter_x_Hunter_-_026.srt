Strange beasts

Vast riches.

00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,137
Hidden treasures.

Evil haunts.

00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,060
Uncharted frontiers.

8
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,230
The mysterious unknown.

9
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,984
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words...

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,195
are called...

11
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,282
Hunters.

12
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,335
FREECSS

13
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:11,381

[Mito Freecss] 
"Dear Aunt Mito and Grandma, how are you?

15
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,387
I'm doing great, as usual.

16
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:23,435
The Hunter Exam is finally over now 
and turns out, I actually passed!"

[Grandma heaves]

18
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,607
"But while I passed and everything,

19
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,653
I can't say 
that I'm all that happy about it,

20
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,784
[Gon Freecss] Because of what happened 
in the Final Phase."

21
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,539
[Hanzo] I see you're not getting it, 
so I'll try again.

22
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,834
Die and you'll never get 
another chance.

23
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,421
If I kill you right here and now,

24
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,467
I only need to come back 
and take the Exam again next year.

25
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,512
[raising his voice] 
We are not on equal footing!

26
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,812
[yelling] Is your pride 
truly all that you care about?

27
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,898
Even more than your life? 
Is it worth dying for?

28
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,484
I'm gonna go see my dad.

29
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,277
[surprised gasping]

30
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,279
See, my dad is a Hunter.

31
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,533
So I'm gonna become a Hunter 
exactly like he is

32
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,535
and then I'll be able to meet him.

33
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,371
I know I'll find him someday.

34
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,918
But I feel like if I surrender now

35
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm never gonna find him.

36
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,551
So, I won't give up.

37
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,803
Surrender...

38
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,596
or you will die.

39
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,312
[Hanzo] 
So logic had nothing to do with it.

40
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,821
Fine, you win. I give up, okay?

41
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,698
No fair!

42
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,827
We both have to come up with 
some way that we can have a proper match.

00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,662
[screaming]

"I kind of got knocked out.

45

So, I don't really remember anything 
after that.

46
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,630
but Mr. Satotz told me 
what happened next."

47
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,800
Begin!

48
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,428
It's been awhile, Kil.

49
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,193

[fearful gasping]

51
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,119
Big brother...

52
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,166
You're not cut out to be a Hunter.

53
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,878
You were born for one purpose...

54
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,422
to be an assassin.

55
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,179
What do you imagine that 
you would accomplish by becoming a Hunter?

56
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,516
[Killua Zoldyck] 
It's true.

57
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,726
I don't really want to be a Hunter.

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,479
But...

59
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,982
Everyone wants something... 
Even me.

60
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,318
-You don't. 
-Wrong!

61
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,529
There is something that I really want!

62
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,155
[Illumi Zoldyck] 
Hm.

63
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,367
Enlighten me. 
What is it that you want?

64
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,624
I... want to be...

65
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,876
friends with Gon.

66
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,843
I... I'm just so sick of killing people.

67
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,053
I want to be friends with Gon

68
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,473
and just have fun.

69
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:49,975
Impossible.

70
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,563
You are incapable of friendship,

71
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,402
because you are by nature 
a murderer.

72
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:07,659
Move one more inch, 
and I'll assume the fight has begun.

73
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:08,952
The same goes...

74
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,330
for if our bodies come in contact 
with each other.

75
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,082
The fight starts.

76
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,002
If you decide that you won't fight me,

77
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,171
your dear Gon will certainly die.

78
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,300
[Killua breathes uneasily]

79
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,180
You win, Illumi.

80
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,725
I admit defeat.

81
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,858
[Gon] "I think that's when 
Killua hit rock bottom."

82
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,072
[blasting sound]

83
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,971
Apologize to Killua!

84
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,223
Sorry.

85
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,558
But what for?

86
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,144
You don't know what you did wrong?

87
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,567
[gasping]

88
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,200
Don't even bother apologizing.

89
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,327
Just take me to see Killua.

90
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,412
And what will you do?

91
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:35,997
It's obvious.

92
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,625
I'll bring him back.

93
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,255
[Gon] 
"And after that, Kurapika, Leorio and I

94
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,634
made our way to Kukuroo Mountain. 
That's where Killua lives."

95
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,347
This gate is officially known as 
the Testing Gate.

96
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,767
Because anyone who's not strong enough 
to open it...

97
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,143
[huffs]

98
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,189
...is considered unworthy of entering 
the Zoldyck Estate.

99
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,984
[groans]

100
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,114
Listen to me, Gon.

101
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,450
You three can try 
to open the door together.

102
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,244
There's nothing wrong with teamwork.

103
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,540
And with a little bit of training, 
it should be possible.

104
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,750
[shouting]

105
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,005
[Leorio Paradinight] 
Let's do this, Kurapika!

106
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,674
Well, let's push!

107
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,217
Here goes!

108
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,218
Ready!

109
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,177
Get set!

110
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,429
Go!

111
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,515
[straining]

112
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,604
[Gon] Ow!

113
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,900
[panting]

114
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,610
It opened.

115
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,821
[Leorio] 
Hell yeah!

116
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,865
[Kurapika] 
We really did it, Gon!

117
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,074
[Gon] 
Uh-huh!

118
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,581
Please leave now.

119
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,250
You're trespassing on private property.

120
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,795
I can't allow you 
to pass without permission.

121
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,841
Take one step past it, 
and I'll remove you by force if necessary.

122
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,094
[booming]

123
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,807
[Gon] 
What's the big deal?

124
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,894
I just came here to see my friend.

125
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,772
[loudly] The only reason I'm here 
is to see Killua.

126
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,610
[yelling] So why are you making me 
go through all of this?

127
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,447
[cawing]

128
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,704
I can tell you're different from Mike.

129
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,624
You may be trying 
to cover up your feelings,

130
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,793
but you still have a heart.

131
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,045
When I mentioned Killua's name

132
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,923
your eyes softened... 
just for a moment.

133
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,634

Please...

00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,602
Help him...

136
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,355
Help Master Ki-- 
[bursting noise]

137
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,443
[gasping]

138
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,406
And you must be Gon.

139
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,575
Illumi told me all about you.

140
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,538
Killua is aware that you've been 
on the premises for some time now.

141
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,501
Why can't Killua come to see us? 
Where is he?

142
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,420
In solitary confinement.

143
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,713
Wait, what?

144
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,051
And then, 
because he regretted what he had done,

145
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,970
our Killua returned to us.

146
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,598
And entered 
solitary confinement voluntarily.

147
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,356
I will take you to the butler's quarters.

148
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,902
There is a phone 
that connects directly to the mansion.

149
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,656
If Master Zeno answers it, 
he might...

150
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,454
So, which hand?

151
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,500
I've known Master Killua 
his entire life.

152
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,004
And I care for him as I would my own son.

153
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,964
In all honesty,

154
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,843
I despise you 
for attempting to take him away.

155
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,604
If you answer incorrectly, you are out.

156
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,440
Should you all be disqualified,

157
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,819
which is quite possible, then I shall tell 
Master Killua that you left.

158
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,281
And that he will never see 
any of you again.

159
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,451
-Here we go. 
-Wait just a minute!

160
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,370
What is it?

161
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,290
If you're trying to buy time, 
I will kill one of you.

162
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,421
[grunts]

163
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,008
[Kurapika] 
He cut himself to reduce the swelling.

164
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,345
There, much better.

165
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,596
I can see now.

166
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,805
Okay, I'm ready.

167
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,521
[gasping]

168
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,275
Now, which one of us has it?

169
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,573
That guy, right behind me.

170
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,539
Splendid, well done.

171
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,168
Gotoh, is Gon here yet?

172
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,171
-Killua! 
-You're already here, Gon!

173
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,882
And this guy, uh... Kurapika?

174
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,300
You remembered.

175
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,551
Riolio!

176
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,178
[yelling] 
It's Leorio!

177
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,055
It's been so long.

178
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,932
But you made it! 
Ha.

179
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,684
Your face is a mess!

180
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,811
Back at ya!

181
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,438
[laughing]

182
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,857
[Gon] 
"And just like that,

183
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,235
we managed to rescue Killua.

184
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,365
I know that I should be happy right now,

185
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,119
but I still have some unfinished business 
that I need to take care of, Aunt Mito."

186
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:14,085

188
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,218
[Gon] 
"I need to take care of something

189
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,637
that happened 
in the Fourth Phase of the Exam."

190
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,772
To begin with, I will need each of you 
to draw lots, now.

191
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,691
-[all gasp] 
-Really?

192
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,193
Draw lots for what? 
What'll that decide?

193
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,032
Hm, who you hunt and who hunts you.

194
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,533
Listen carefully!

195
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,038
Collecting the ID badge of 
your specified target

196
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,040
will earn you three points, 
understand?

197
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,835
Your own badge is also worth 
three points.

198
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,547
And all the other badges 
are worth one point.

199
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,383
In order to move on to the Final Phase,

200
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,677
you'll have to collect six points.

201
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,805
So during your time there 
on Zevil Island,

202
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,684
gather enough badges to collect six points 
or fail the Exam.

203
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:17,690
Only those who do will clear 
the Fourth Phase of the Hunter Exam.

204
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,113
So, uh... who did you get?

205
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,452
You want to show our numbers 
at the same time?

206
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,661
Okay.

207
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,622
[both] 
Ready, and...!

208
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,416
[gasping]

209
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,335
[Killua] Number 44 is...

210
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,131
[Gon] Really?

211
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,343
If I had to fight with Hisoka one-on-one

212
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,637
I wouldn't stand a chance against him.

213
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,557
But if all I have to do 
is just steal his badge,

214
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,685
I don't know... 
I think I might actually have a real shot.

215
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,104
Yeah.

216
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:00,358
The way it is now, well, 
at least I've got a chance.

217
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,527
And to be honest,

218
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,570
it does scare me a little bit.

219
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,781
But I think it's worth it.

220
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,591
Now!

221
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,389
I did it!

222
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,474
I figured it out!

223
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,685
I've just got to go for the target

224
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,437
the moment it goes for its prey!

225
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:52,994
There!

226
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,041
I've only got about a minute or so 
before Hisoka spots him.

227
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,004
I need to figure out where 
their paths are going to cross.

228
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,426
Got it!

229
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,598
I’ve got to hurry.

230
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,894
Hisoka will attack 
the second he notices that guy.

231
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,481
If I want to steal his badge, 
this is it.

232
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,192
It's the last chance I'm going to get.

233
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:11,197
I have to stay hidden. 
I can't let him sense me.

234
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,617
Focus.

235
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,964
[booming]

236
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,090
[Gon] 
Here he comes.

237
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,260
[Agon] 
Hisoka!

238
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,595
Damn it, bring it on!

239
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,196
[screams]

240
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,521
[Gon] I did it. 
I took Hisoka's badge from him.

241
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,946
[groans]

242
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,533
[Geretta] 
About 7000.

243
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,787
Do you even know 
what that number represents?

244
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,376
That is the number of chances I had 
to kill you.

245
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,711
[whimpers]

246
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,255
It's also

247
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,175
about the number of times that you cast 
your fishing rod

248
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,635
while you were training.

249
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,389
In the future, 
remember to watch your back.

250
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,475
So long.

251
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,692
[Gon] 
Damn it.

252
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:16,781
[gasps]

253
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,493
You surprise me.

254
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,454
You hid your presence from me

255
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,831
while you were waiting 
for your chance to strike.

256
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,584
Biding your time until the very moment

257
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,503
that I attacked someone else.

258
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,799
Did you learn how to conceal yourself 
all on your own?

259
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,050
Marvelous.

260
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,386
You're like a wild animal.

261
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,639
And your timing was just impeccable.

262
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,350
You were able to conceal 
your blood lust

263
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,688
by cleverly hiding it behind mine 
so that I wouldn't notice.

264
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,065
Masterfully done.

265
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,194
[Gon] 
Wait.

266
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,991
[straining to speak] 
If you're not taking your badge,

267
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,786
then why are you here?

268
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,956
To say congratulations!

269
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,208
You owe me one now.

270
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,752
You can pay me back 
whenever you like.

271
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,421
So long.

272
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,057
I don't owe you or anybody.

273
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,685
Here, take it back.

274
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,021
[laughs]

275
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,023
I refuse.

276
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,861
I've decided to let you live, 
for now.

277
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:41,574
And I plan to let you continue living 
for as long as it suits me.

278
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,619
Until someday you become 
truly worthy of killing.

279
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,289
[booming]

280
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,296
I will take it back.

281
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,382
But only when you can punch me 
in the face like that.

282
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,721
In the meantime, 
you just hold onto it for me.

283
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,681
[Hisoka laughs]

284
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,686
[Gon] "It was the first time 
I've ever felt that frustrated.

285
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,691
That's why I need to find a way 
to pay Hisoka back.

286
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,988
I don't want to come back to Whale Island 
feeling like I do.

287
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,952
[Mito] That's why I'll be going to 
Heaven's Arena with Killua.

288
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,039
It's time for me to start my training 
as a Hunter.

289
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,249
So please take care of yourselves.

290
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,543
I can't wait to see you both 
when I get back.

291
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:35,711
Gon Freecss."

292
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:43,093
I didn't expect him home anytime soon.

293
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,932
He really is your son, isn't he? 
[laughs]

294
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,938
Wherever you are, 
I hope you're watching over him,

295
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,689
Ging.

296
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,655
[Gon] Next time, 
"Arrival x at x the Arena."

297
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,741
Off we go! 
Gon, Gon!

298
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,242
[Killua] 
What, again?
