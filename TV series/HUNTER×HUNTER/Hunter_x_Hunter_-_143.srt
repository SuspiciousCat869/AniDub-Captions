really were being tailed before.

If anyone sees alluka
when we go inside,

167
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,444
tsubone will say that
her power has been revealed,

168
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:33,413
and she’ll use that excuse
to take us home immediately,

and this’ll all be over.

But if I clear the area
so nobody sees us,

171

that’ll only make it easier
for illumi to act.

And taking this airship
directly to the hospital

would be pretty tough.

through the front door,
