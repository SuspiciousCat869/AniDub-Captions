I've decided to let you live, for now.

Until someday, you become 
truly worthy of killing.

You're wasting your time.

I'll never give you a chance to attack.

[Imori laughs] 
Be afraid, kid.

Be very afraid.

I'm a very cautious guy.

I'll do whatever it takes,

even when I'm up against a kid.

Why is he so relaxed?

43
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,439
He can't be that strong, can he?

44
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,316
Right, be cautious.

45
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,110
Because I'm a cautious guy.

46
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,531
Oh, I should escape. 
I mean, retreat and reassess.

Wait, what am I saying?

If I go back without his badge, 
they're definitely going to yell at me.

Hold on, you've got it all wrong,

I-- I didn't want to hurt 
a little kid, that's all.

I thought I'd just hold off 
and take it while he slept.

You're so full of it.

Fine, you got me.

00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,295
And you're right. 
I guess I should wrap this up.

66
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,963
Time for a beat-down.

67

[Imori] 
At least if I start to lose,

68
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,057
I've got my brothers here to step in 
and back me up.

69

All right, kid. 
How about you hand it over?

Do as I say, and you won't get hurt.

I'm betting...

that 199 must be one of you two,

Hm, number 197 was always with 199.

They were basically inseparable.

One thing's for sure, I never expected 
that little kid to deal with him for me.

We've been here for six days.

00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,231
Only one day left.

[Kurapika] It's been four days 
since we ran into Hisoka.

146
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,236
And we haven't found anyone else.

[Leorio Paradinight] Hmm.

148

Maybe we should 
go back to the landing.

149

[Kurapika] Huh?

150
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,580
[Leorio] It's possible there are 
a few people who've already finished.

-[Kurapika] No, impossible. 
-[Leorio] Huh?

152
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,879
This phase of the Exam is different 
from all the others.

153
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,925
If your badge is stolen, you still have 
the opportunity to recover it.

On the other hand,

155
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,555
just because you have six points worth 
of badges now

156
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,266
doesn't guarantee you'll have them 
when the phase ends.

157
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,102
This test can't be completed early.

00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,479
I see.

But it's worth a shot.

160
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,192
With just a day left,

161
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,445
there must be a few 
who've already gotten their six points.

162
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,949
And it's safe to assume they would 
then gravitate to the same place.

163
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,325
Near the goal.

164
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,661
At least, that's what I would do.

165
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:03,705
Oh.

166
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,333
Okay, let's get going.

167
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,896
[Leorio] 
Well? See anyone?

168
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,272
[Kurapika] 
No.

169
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,067
That is to say, 
no one who can be easily spotted.

170
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,736
[Leorio] 
Damn it.

171
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,488
[Kurapika] Perhaps we should split up 
and keep looking.

172
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,867
But first, we should choose 
a time and place for us to reconvene.

173
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,287
[Gon] And it will go way faster 
with three people.

174
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,747
[Kurapika and Leorio] 
Huh?

175
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,291
[both] 
Gon.

176
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,377
I guess we all must have had 
exactly the same idea.

177
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,087
I've been watching from above

178
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,423
and it looks like there are 
a lot of people nearby.

179
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,759
Really? From above?

180
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,594
Now why didn't we think of that?

181
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,929
It wouldn't have worked.

182
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,224
Without eyes as sharp as Gon's, 
we'd have never spotted anyone.

183
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,935
-[Kurapika] Gon. 
-Huh?

184
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,187
Were you able to get 
all the badges you need?

185
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,188
[sighs]

186
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,899
[Gon] 
Yeah, I guess.

187
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,693
-Oh, damn. You got yours, too? 
-[Kurapika gasps]

188
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,487
So I'm the only one left.

189
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,489
[Gon] 
Well, who's your target?

190
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,659
Number 246, a woman named Ponzu.

191
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,996
The only thing I really know about her 
is that she uses chemical weapons.

192
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,373
[Leorio] 
Gon.

193
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,542
You didn't happen to see any women 
when you were up there, did you?

194
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,835
I'm afraid not.

195
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,170
I see.

196
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,924
All right. There are four possibilities 
we should consider.

197
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,344
She's safe and still in possession 
of her badge.

198
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,347
-She's alive but no longer has her badge. 
-[crying]

199
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,809
She's out of the competition 
but has held onto her badge.

200
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,979
Or she's dead now, 
and doesn't have her badge.

201
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,563
[Leorio] 
Do you really think

202
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,775
it's likely that she's both out 
of the running and still has her badge?

203
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,444
She might have gotten 
in some kind of accident.

204
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,822
Or it's possible that she was defeated

205
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,366
after hiding her badge somewhere 
for safe keeping.

206
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,954
If that's the case and she was killed 
after concealing her badge,

207
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,082
her badge may never be found again.

208
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,211
The more you talk, 
the worse this scenario gets.

209
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,172
Hey, do you know anything else 
about Ponzu?

210
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,968
Like, does she wear some kind 
of special fragrance, like Leorio?

211
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,512
-[Leorio] Huh? 
-[Kurapika gasps] That's right.

212
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,931
Gon might be able to track her 
by her scent.

213
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:31,060
Okay, but she might not even wear perfume, 
you know, what do we do then?

214
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,146
-[Kurapika] He'll track her chemicals. 
-Huh...

215
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,357
She's well known for using chemicals, 
isn't she?

216
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,653
With a variety of chemicals, 
some are sure to have distinct odors.

217
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,363
-Well, Gon? 
-Right.

218
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,656
I'll give it a shot.

219
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,160
After all, it's why I'm here.

220
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,828
Huh?

221
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,877
[Leorio] 
Is she in there, Gon?

222
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,046
[Gon] 
Yep, no doubt about it.

223
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,757
What's your plan?

224
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,884
[Leorio] 
I'm going in.

225
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,971
I want you guys to wait here.

226
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,326
[rattling echoes]

227
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,379
[Leorio] 
Doesn't look like there are any traps.

228
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,133
I'll head inside.

229
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,218
Wait until I get the okay.

230
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,928
Then you two can come in.

231
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,722
-[Kurapika] Thirty minutes. 
-Hmm?

232
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,725
If after 30 minutes, 
we haven't heard from you,

233
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,435
-we're coming to find you. 
-Humph!

234
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,532
-[Leorio] No way. 
-[both gasp]

235
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,856
If you don't hear from me, 
you both go right back to the start.

236
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,483
-[Kurapika] That's not an option. 
-Huh?

237
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,485
We have formed an alliance

238
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,820
and I will not abandon you now.

239
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,530
[sighs]

240
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,991
Then this alliance is over.

241
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,495
I know it's selfish, 
considering how much you helped me.

242
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,538
But I've got to do this alone.

243
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,875
-No way. 
-[Leorio] Huh?

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,335
[yelling] 
What did you say?

245
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,378
We're both staying here 
because we want to.

246
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,713
[gasps]

247
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,382
It's our choice, so is that a problem?

248
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,512
[grumbles]

249
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,432
[sighs] Fine, suit yourself.

250
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,145
[gasps]

251
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,356
Hang onto that for me.

252
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,900
[sigh]

253
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,485
[both chuckle]

254
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,867
[exhales]

255
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,162
[footsteps approaching]

256
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,667
[grunts, chuckles]

257
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,419
[Leorio] 
I've just gotta go for it.

258
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,308
[footsteps echoing]

259
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,395
[breathes heavily]

260
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,740
Hey isn't that... It's Bourbon.

261
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,242
-[woman] Let me guess. 
-[gasps]

262
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,162
I must be your target, am I right?

263
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,455
Ponzu!

264
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,000
-[Ponzu] It's pointless. 
-Huh?

265
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,211
There's nothing for us to gain 
by fighting down here.

266
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,796
I have everything to gain.

267
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,131
It's just like you said,

268
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,217
you're my target, all right! 
This is happening, no matter what.

269
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,510
[sighs]

270
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,889
Let's assume that we do fight and 
by some miracle, you actually beat me.

271
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,310
There's still no way 
you're ever getting out of this cave.

272
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,811
Wait, what?

273
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,439
What are you talking about?

274
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,364
[chirping]

275
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,541
[Gon] 
He's taking too long.

276
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,502
So what do you think, 
is he okay?

277
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,087
Yes.

278
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,299
But his 30 minutes are almost up.

279
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,052
[Leorio, shouting] 
Kurapika, Gon!

280
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,928
-Don't come in! 
-[both gasp]

281
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,687
[Gon] 
Leorio!

282
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,898
[gasp]

283
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,151
[grunts]

284
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,321
Huh?

285
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:18,908
[Gon] 
Leorio!

286
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,786
You idiots.

287
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,206
I thought I told you 
not to come in.

288
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,250
[Kurapika] 
He's covered in bites.

289
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,877
If those snakes are venomous, then...

290
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,712
They're a kind of viper.

291
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,548
And they are poisonous, 
but it isn't that strong.

292
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,592
Still, with this many bites...

293
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,932
[Leorio groaning] 
Stop it, will you?

294
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:47,061
One cut in your mouth, 
or even a little cavity...

295
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,396
Don't worry about it.

296
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,149
[Kurapika] Leorio, 
do you have any anti-venom in here?

297
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,984
If I did...

298
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,945
maybe...

299
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,114
I would have been able...

300
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,449
to save you guys, at least.

301
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,118
[sighs]

302
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,577
Leorio!

303
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,121
Let's stop the bleeding.

304
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,542
[breathing heavily]

305
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,336
That should do it.

306
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,422
We still need to get him to a doctor.

307
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,679
-[Ponzu] I wouldn't advise that. 
-[Gon and Kurapika gasp]

308
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,348
You aren't getting out so easily.

309
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,434
What do you mean by that?

310
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,186
[Ponzu] 
What I mean is that we're trapped.

311
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,856
Whenever someone tries 
to leave this cave...

312
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,775
[hissing]

313
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,695
...the snakes will attack you en masse.

314
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,113
[gasp]

315
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,198
[loud hissing]

316
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,410
It's a trap set by Bourbon, 
the snake charmer.

317
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,370
If you're bitten,

318
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:50,040
you'll end up completely paralyzed, 
just like your friend here.

319
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,335
After that, you die.

[Kurapika] Bourbon, you're looking 
to collect more badges, right?

321
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,094
We'll give you every one we have.

322
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,930
Just please, let us out of here.

323
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,474
Don't bother.

324
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,936
[Ponzu] 
You see, he's already dead.

325
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,946
[Kurapika] 
What? You can't be serious.

326
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,794
[narrator] Gon and friends 
are caught in a trap set by Bourbon,

327
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,004
the snake charmer, 
and can't leave the cave.

328
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,301
Will they pass the Hunter Exam?

329
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,721
And will Leorio survive 
the venomous snake bites?

00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,726

[theme song playing]

333
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,030
[Gon] Next time, 
"Big x Time x Interview."

334
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,740
Thanks a lot, Kurapika.

335
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,117
[Kurapika] 
No, thank you, Gon.
