00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,048
Vast riches.

6
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,175
Hidden treasures.

7
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,262
Evil haunts.

8
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,098
Uncharted frontiers.

9
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,893
The mysterious unknown.

10
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,981
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words...

11
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,400
are called...

12
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,903
Hunters.

[cawing]

16
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,436
[man 1] Is Gon still angling for 
the Master of the Swamp?

17
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,522
Uh, yes.

18
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,776
He's been at it non-stop 
for a whole week now.

19
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,361
[man 2] So I gotta know...

20
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,530
Did you really promise he could take 
the Hunter Exam if he caught the thing?

21
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,615
[man 1] 
He's a fool.

22
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,910
Five adults working together 
couldn't real that monster in.

23
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,245
So what chance does 
a little kid have, huh?

24
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:46,041
Sounds to me like Mito doesn't really 
want him to take the Hunter Exam at all.

25
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,794
[man 1] Maybe so, 
but wasn't Gon's old man his age

26
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,712
when he caught the Master of the Swamp?

27
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,923
[man 2 laughs] 
He doesn't stand a chance.

28
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,350
[gasps]

29
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,529
Yeah!

30
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,157
Ah, yes! 
Here he comes.

31
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,118

[crying out]

36
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,027
[man 1] 
Look at the size of it!

37
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,863
That's the Master of the Swamp?

38
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,573
[man 2] 
Wow, it's been 20 years.

39
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,826
[man 1] Yeah, it was Gon's dad 
who caught him last time, right?

40
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,578
[man 2] 
Like father, like son.

41
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,123
Gon really did it. 
He actually caught the Master.

42
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,583
Mito, over here!

43
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,126
[groans]

44
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,717
Aunt Mito, look! 
I caught him just like I said I would.

45
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,553
That means I can finally take 
the Hunter Exam.

46
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,221
Right?

47
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,731
I'll do my best.

48
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,233
I'm going to be a Hunter, 
just you wait and see.

49
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,037
[great-grandmother] 
It must be in his blood.

50
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,707
Ging was only 12 years old 
when he caught the Master

51
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,502
and no one has been able 
to land him since.

52
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,256
And now his son has accomplished 
the very same feat at the same age.

53
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,222
I don't have to tell you that his eyes 
sparkle the same way as his father's.

54
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:11,436
It won't be long now 
before we have to let him go.

55
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,901
-[Mito] Are you sure about this? 
-[Gon] Yeah.

56
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,448
[Mito] When you were just a baby 
your father abandoned you to be a Hunter.

57
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,242
You know that, don't you?

58
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,244
I do.

59
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,080
He chose being a Hunter 
over his own son.

60
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,208
-[Gon] Yeah, isn't that amazing? 
-[Mito] Huh?

61
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,003
It must be an awesome job 
if it was worth leaving his kid.

62
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,255
Don't you think?

63
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,132
But being a Hunter is a dangerous job.

64
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,344
You could die at any time 
for any number of ridiculous reasons.

65
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,429
-[Mito] Don't you understand? 
-[Gon sighs]

66
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,849
No, I don't.

67
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,892
But I want to understand.

68
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,895
I want to find out why it was so important 
to my dad.

69
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,772
That's why I've got to do it.

70
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,111
[sighs]

71
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,368
Just as I thought. 
You're just like Ging.

72
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,756
I promise you. I'll pass the exam.

73
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,843
The next time you see me 
I will be a Hunter.

74
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,680
Instead, promise you'll come home safe.

75
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,057
Think you can do that for me?

76
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,268
Yep, I sure can.

77
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,732
[both] 
Pinky swear, so if I lie

78
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,986
stick a thousand needles 
in my eye.

79
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,363
And seal it with a...

80
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,783
-[Mito] kiss. 
-[Gon] kiss...

81
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:54,456
[Gon draws out the word]

82
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,749
[laughs]

83
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,126
Huh? 
[Gon cries out]

84
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,630
Gon.

85
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,884
Aunt Mito, thank you.

86
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,137
[seagull cawing]

87
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,985
[everyone] Goodbye!

88
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,448
[man] Good luck, Gon!

89
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,869
Get out there and knock 'em dead, 
do you hear me?

90
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,287
We believe in you, buddy.

91
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,339
Thanks, everybody. I'm going to be 
the best Hunter in the world.

92
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,218
And as soon as I make that happen, 
I'll be back.

93
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,054
I'll see you all again!

94
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,643
[man laughs]

95
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,937
The best Hunter in the world, huh?

96
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,773
The kid thinks this will be easy.

97
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,566
[man 2] 
Every single year,

98
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,152
millions of the world's 
most skilled applicants

99
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,029
apply for the Hunter Exam.

100
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,615
But only a handful make the cut.

101
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,619
Be careful about saying stuff 
you can't back up, kid.

102
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,622
[men laugh]

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,259
[man 2] 
With the way things are going for you,

105
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,094
you're never going to make it as a sailor.

106

[laughter]

108
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,477
What's wrong? 
Why are you bent over like that?

109
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,354
[captain] 
Hey, slackers.

110
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,815
Get back to work!

111
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,150
[men] 
Aye, aye, sir.

112
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,360
[Katzo groans]

113
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,029
You!

114
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,740
Got wax in your ears? 
Get moving!

115
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,408
Aye, aye, sir. Right away

116
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,409
[Gon] Wait!

117
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,288
[gasps]

118
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,497
Thanks a lot.

119
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,050
There's a storm coming.

120
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,259
[captain] Huh?

121
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,178
And how exactly do you know that?

122
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,555
Sea cranes. 
That's what all of them are saying.

123
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,723
What?

124
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,682
Also...

125
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,603
[inhales deeply]

126
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,200
There's a really big one 
heading right for us.

127
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,202
-[groans] 
-[Gon] It's true.

128
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,287
I can tell by the way it smells.

129
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,624
[captain] This boy...

130
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,506
Those eyes.

131
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,257
Could he be...

132
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,101
[thunder clapping]

133
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,936

[everyone screaming]

135
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:10,985
Captain!

136
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,404
The mast won't hold out for much longer.

137
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,989
We should lower the sails.

138
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:15,990
Don't be stupid.

139
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,786
We can't quit when the fun is 
just about to start.

140
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,621
[chuckles]

141
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,292
Here we go!

142
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,964
Now, take her hard to port.

143
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,595
[yelling] Let's fly!

Ahh! I've faced bigger waves than that 
and lived.

148
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,875
Hey, take over the helm.

149
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,084
Aye, aye, sir.

150
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,961
[gagging]

151
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,757
Damned if this ain't the most

[men groaning]

153
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,639
Not a one of them has got 
his sea legs. Pathetic.

154
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,517
And they think they can pass 
the Hunter Exam?

155
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,061
They're good for a laugh, 
that's for sure.

156
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,855
-[Gon] Here, try these herbs. 
-Hm?

157
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,774
Chew them up real good

00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,877
[groaning]

165
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,796
That's what I call a sour apple.

166
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,965
[captain] Huh, I see.

167
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,469
Seems there's a few 
with some iron in them, after all.

168
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,387
-Coming through. 
-[captain grumbles]

169
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,348
Here, I got you water.

170
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,390
Thank you.

171
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,768
[Gon] There, drink up.

172
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,647
[gulping water]

173
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,233
[Katzo sighs]

174
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,151
[grumbles]

175
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,319
[chuckles]

176
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,446
Hm.

177
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,240
Hm?

178
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,284
You're the best. 
Thanks for your help, Mr. Katzo.

179
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,829
[ocean rumbling loudly]

180
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,209
[captain] Right, then. Go down the line 
and tell me all your names.

181
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,669
My name's Gon.

182
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,629
I am called Kurapika.

183
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,297
The name is Leorio.

184
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,676
Good, good. Now why do you boys want 
to become Hunters?

185
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,596
Whoa! You're not an examiner, 
so what's with the third degree?

186
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,057
Just answer the question, dummy.

187
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,018
I will. Because my dad is a Hunter.

188
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,395
Hm?

189
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,565
[Gon] Being a hunter was the most 
important thing in the world to my dad.

190
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,317
And I want to know why.

191
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,944
That's why I left Whale Island.

192
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,655
Whale Island?

193
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,700
So it is him. 
This is Ging's son.

194
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,995
It looks like the day has come at last.

195
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,247
[Leorio] Hey, kid.

196
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,917
You don't have to tell 
that old guy nothin'.

197
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,253
But he asked why I'm here. 
It's not a secret.

198
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,755
Look, get with the program. 
It's us versus him.

199
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,841
And I'm not telling him 
why I'm here.

200
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,135
[Kurapika] I'm afraid I agree with Leorio.

201
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,094
Huh?

202
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,722
That's Mr. Leorio to you, you brat.

203
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,640
Show a little respect for your elders.

204
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,684
But why not dodge the question

205
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,478
by simply offering the man 
a plausible lie?

206
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,522
Hey! Are you even listening to me?

207
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,318
However, it is quite shameful 
to rely upon deceit.

208
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,360
As for me,

209
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,362
I cannot reveal my reasons here.

210
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,072
I have my share of secrets.

211
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,576
Deep secrets, which I do not intend 
to expose at this time.

212
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,746
That is why 
I will not answer your question.

213
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,914
Hey, I was talking to you, punk.

214
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,085
[captain] So, both of you flat out refuse 
to answer my question.

215
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,129
Hey, Katzo.

216
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,255
Yes, what is it, Captain?

217
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,883
Get a hold of the Exam Committee for me.

218
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,260
Let them know we've got two more dropouts.

219
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,428
[both gasp]

220
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,263
Wait, what do you mean?

221
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,515
Still haven't figured it out, huh?

222
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,769
You see, 
the Hunter Exam has already started.

223
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,228
[both] It has?

224
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,028
[captain] There are as many 
Hunter wannabes in this world

225
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,197
as there are stars in the sky.

226
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,449
And the examiners, well...

227
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,161
The fact is, they don't have the time 
nor the resources to go through them all.

228
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,581
That's where people like me come in 
to pick up the slack.

229
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,167
Screen all of the applicants 
and trim the fat.

230
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,128
I've already notified the committee

231
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,548
about the rest of the lot. 
Not a one of them made the cut.

232
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,841
-[Leorio] What? 
-[Kurapika] Huh?

233
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,677
[captain] That was just a little storm 
and look how they handled it.

234
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,806
They'd never survive 
the later stages of the exam.

235
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,474
In other words,

236
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,061
the only way you three are moving on 
to the next portion of the Exam

237
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,021
is if I give you the go-ahead.

238
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:02,693
So, I'll ask you again. 
And think carefully before you answer.

239
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,654
You catch all that?

240
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,905
Hm?

241
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,200
[Leorio] 
You could have told us that sooner.

242
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,330
I am the sole survivor 
of the Kurta Clan.

243
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,209
Four years ago,

244
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,754
my entire clan was annihilated 
by a band of criminals.

245
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,549
That is why I want to become a Hunter.

246
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,342
To capture the Phantom Troupe.

247
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,263
Sounds like you want to be 
a Black List Hunter.

248
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,850
And the Phantom Troupe is 
a Class-A bounty.

249
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,812
Even the most seasoned Hunters 
can't touch them.

250
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,107
You know it's a suicide mission, right?

251
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,193
Death is not among my fears.

252
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,239
But there is one thing I do fear, 
and one thing alone.

253
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,701
That time will quiet the rage in my heart.

254
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,997
So, in other words, 
you're out for revenge.

255
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,957
But you don't really need to become 
a Hunter

256
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,209
just so you can settle an old score, 
do you?

257
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,130
That is the stupidest question 
I have ever heard, Leorio.

258
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,007
That's "Mr. Leorio."

259
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,718
There are places only Hunters can go,

260
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,678
intel only they can access,

261
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,472
and actions only they can take.

262
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,890
There are more reasons

263
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,642
but those are the only three 
that you have a chance of comprehending.

264
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,519
-[screaming] 
-[Gon] Hey!

265
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,523
Why do you want to become a Hunter, 
Mr. Leorio?

266
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,650
Who, me?

267
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,986
Well, it's pretty simple, really.

268
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,572
-For the money. 
-Huh?

269
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,284
[loudly] Money can buy everything 
you've ever wanted.

270
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,161
A big mansion.

271
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,287
A cool car.

272
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,082
And top-shelf booze. 
[chuckles]

273
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,003
If only you could buy class as well, 
Leorio.

274
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,426
That was strike three.

275
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,678
Step outside.

276
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,974
Time to finish off the 
filthy Kurta bloodline once and for all.

277
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,185
Take that back, Leorio!

278
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,815
I said, take it back.

279
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,612
It's "Mr. Leorio."

280
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,409
[captain] 
Hey, where do you boys think you're going?

281
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,370
I'm not finished with you yet.

282
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,621
[Gon] Let them go.

283
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,376
They're fine. 
It's like Aunt Mito told me once,

284
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:29,257
You can never understand a person unless 
you can understand what makes them angry.

285
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,509
It's how you get to know someone.

286
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,348
So whatever they're feeling so upset about 
is really important to them.

287
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,394
It's up to them now. 
Nothing we can do but stay out of the way.

288
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,565
[crewman] Captain!

289
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,609
Look. Over there.

290
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,194
[grunts]

291
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,115
[thunder claps]

292
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,077
If we get caught up in that waterspout, 
the ship is going to sink for sure.

293
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,704
Get the sails lowered. Now!

294
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,956
-Right. 
-Anything I can do?

295
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,541
Yeah, follow me up on deck.

296
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,127
-Go with them. I'll take the helm. 
-Aye!

297
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,588
All right, then, hard to starboard.

298
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,091
[sailor] Move it!

299
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,678
If we get caught in the waterspout 
we're done for!

300
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,264
-[men clamoring] 
-[ship creaking]

301
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,518
[Gon straining]

302
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,159
Take back what you said about my clan.

303
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,203
I will forgive you if you repent, Leorio.

304
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,414
You owe me an apology.

305
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,291
And I'm not telling you again.

306
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,752
I'm not repenting for anything, 
hear me?

307
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,630
[softly] Very well.

308
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,477
[men crying out]

309
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,771
[Gon] Mr. Katzo!

310
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,772
[grunts]

311
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,232
[groaning]

312
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,738
[both] Damn!

313
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,462
Come on, let's get them back on deck!

314
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,381
[straining]

315
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,812
[Leorio] You idiot!

316
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,398
If it hadn't been for us, 
you'd be shark bait.

317
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,359
You owe me big time, kid. 
And don't you forget it.

318
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,612
Honestly, how reckless can you be?

319
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,906
But it's fine, you caught me.

320
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,241
-Huh? 
-Huh?

321
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,452
You both did. 
You both caught me together.

322
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,497
I guess you might have a point.

323
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,290
[Katzo] Gon!

324
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,003
[Gon] Hey, Mr. Katzo.

325
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,297
Thanks, Gon, you're incredible.

326
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,216
You saved my life back there.

327
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,010
Yeah, well, I didn't do it all alone.

328
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,638
Those two over there 
helped rescue you, too.

329
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,058
[Katzo] 
He's right. Thank you both.

330
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,770
Please. No thanks necessary.

331
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,690
Yeah, no prob.

332
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,775
We're just glad to see 
you made it okay.

333
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,110
Me too.

334
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,946
In fact, I ought to get back to my post 
right away.

335
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,574
[Leorio chuckles] 
Hm?

336
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:42,992
[Kurapika chuckles]

337
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,410
What's so funny?

338
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,329
I'm embarrassed at my behavior.

339
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,624
Pardon my rudeness, Mr. Leorio.

340
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,836
I wasn't expecting that.

341
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,129
Just forget it.

342
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,798
You can drop the Mister. 
Leorio is fine.

343
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,051
I'm sorry, too.

344
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,222
And I take back everything 
that I said to you before.

345
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,016
That was wrong of me.

346
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,560
[Kurapika] No, it's fine.

347
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,439
[captain laughs]

348
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,444
You three are growing on me. 
So...

349
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,781
I'll make sure all three of you 
get safely dropped off

350
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:26,035
at the port closest to the Exam site. 
How does that sound? [chuckles]

351
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,077
You will?

352
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,663
[Kurapika] 
But, what about your test?

353
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:35,169
It's like I said, I decide who goes on 
to take the Exam.

354
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,714
Congratulations! 
You're all moving on.

355
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,216
[chuckles]

356
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,717
[sighs]

357
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,555
[loudly] All right! [chuckles]

358
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,560
[narrator] 
And so, Gon finally began his journey

359
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,104
to do what his father did 
before him.

360
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,273
To become a Hunter.

361
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,820
[theme song playing]

362
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,907
[Gon] Next time: 
"Test x of x Tests."

363
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,325
Don't miss it!
