1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,753
[Kurapika] Chain Jail.

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,964
An ability I will use only on the Spiders.

3
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,716
CHAIN JAIL: THE RESTRAINING MIDDLE FINGER

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,470
A power to capture and restrain 
the Phantom Troupe.

5
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,807
I've sworn to use it 
for no other purpose.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,644
If I break my vow…

7
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,564
if I should use this technique 
on anyone other than a Spider…

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,983
my life is forfeit.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,818
I would die...

10
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,612
instantly.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,495
A self-imposed condition 
and a contract with myself.

12
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,039
The proof of my resolve.

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,624
CONDITION 
CONTRACT

00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,091
[theme song playing]

15
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,707
RESTRAINT x AND x VOW

16
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,547
[narrator] After using Chain Jail 
to capture Uvogin,

17
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,675
Kurapika and the others 
flee the scene by car.

18
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,516
There’s a car coming up behind us.

19
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,851
Can anyone confirm?

20
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,895
You’re right.

21
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,438
Think it’s them?

22
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,903
Looks like we’ve got a tail. 
Step on it!

23
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,571
A tail? But how?

24
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,074
Unless…

25
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,329
A thread! It’s made of Nen.

26
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,873
Something’s attached to his left calf.

27
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,500
Right there!

28
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:48,794
Damn!

29
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,089
They found it.

30
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,257
[Feitan] Faster than expected.

31
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,760
Don’t worry. Almost got ‘em!

32
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,011
[Nobunaga] Oh, whatever.

33
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,847
Look why are we all stuffed 
in this tiny car?

34
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,474
[Feitan] Just a bit longer.

35
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,441
MAGIC FUN CLOTH: 
CONVENIENT KERCHIEF

36
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,574
[tires screeching]

37
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,840
[Nobunaga] What the hell? Hey!

38
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,717
-Let me out of here! 
-[gasps]

39
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,725
You guys are no average Joes, are ya?

40
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,435
You’re fast, I’ll give you that.

41
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,604
Fast enough to open the door 
and escape in the nick of time.

42
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,565
I’d better stay on guard.

43
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,527
Nobunaga was in a bad position.

44
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,571
[Machi] That ability of yours 
is fascinating.

45
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,989
[Nobunaga] Let me out, dammit!

46
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,324
So, anything that you wrap up 
in that cloth,

47
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,367
gets shrunken.

48
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,703
That’s the perfect accessory for theft.

49
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,955
With it, all of the auction merch

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,707
would fit right in his pocket.

51
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,958
So, he’s the one

52
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,294
who took all the merchandise 
from the underground auction.

53
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,754
It makes perfect sense!

54
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,257
It also means he can turn them back 
to their original size.

55
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,342
If I remember correctly,

56
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,261
the Boss said his name is Owl.

57
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,097
Hm?

58
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,516
Seems his friends have come to help.

59
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,809
Yeah.

60
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,362
[sneering exhale]

61
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,823
There's more than I was expecting.

62
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,415
Who the hell are these guys?

63
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,335
They can’t actually be the Phantom Troupe, 
can they?

64
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,670
[Owl] Oh, yeah. There’s no doubt about it.

65
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,881
It’s just that they look so weak…

66
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,218
One, two, three...

67
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,302
Hold on…

68
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,678
What? Is something wrong?

69
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,473
There are ten Shadow Beasts in all, 
aren’t there?

70
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,100
And Uvo took care of four of them 
by himself,

71
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,853
so... this should be all of them, right?

72
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,064
How odd…

73
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,151
The chain user grabbed Uvo 
before escaping by car.

74
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:22,322
So, does that mean the chain user 
isn’t a Shadow Beast?

75
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,867
[Feitan] Well, we will find out 
once we ask them.

76
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,953
Do we need to keep them alive?

77
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,496
[Feitan] Not all of them.

78
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,665
We only need the Owl.

79
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,167
Fine. Then let me handle it.

80
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,046
Those damn brats talking smack 
like it’s no big deal.

81
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,715
Let’s show ‘em what the Shadow Beasts 
are made of.

82
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,551
Well, you heard the man.

83
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,803
[Feitan] You stay there and watch

84
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,848
I’ll take three and Shizuku...

85
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,099
Those two.

86
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,851
Let’s do this!

87
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,770
Take it easy! 
Don’t underestimate their power!

88
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,480
Oh, shut up!

89
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,276
[tires screeching]

90
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,862
[Basho] We lost them.

91
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,363
I think.

92
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,698
But for a split second,

93
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,284
I thought I saw someone 
landing on their car.

94
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,661
Probably the other Shadow Beasts.

95
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,663
Let’s get back to the city.

96
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,831
Now’s our chance.

97
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,165
Roger that.

98
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,710
[Melody] We’ll switch the location 
to pattern C.

99
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,087
And we don’t want this one 
putting up a fight,

100
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,756
so we’ll need muscle relaxants 
and sleeping gas

101
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,508
prepared just in case.

102
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,886
[Kurapika] I hope those will work.

103
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,768
One move and you’ll get cut.

104
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,107
[Owl gasping]

105
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,859
All done.

106
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,777
What about the bodies?

107
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,195
Leave them.

108
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,489
There’s no point in hiding them now.

109
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,034
Wow, very nice.

110
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,369
Well, I’m thinking 
maybe we should free Nobunaga

111
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,538
before we start torturing this guy.

112
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,040
-Wait a second… 
-Hm?

113
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,460
So, then what are we doing with the Owl? 
Are we gonna take the car?

114
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,505
Let’s leave Nobunaga as is 
so there’s enough room for the rest of us.

115
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,549
[Nobunaga] Screw that! Let me out!

116
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,968
I just don’t want to be 
all cramped in there.

117
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,553
-[Nobunaga] Come on, you guys... 
-Hey.

118
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,264
Is there any way you can just 
let the car out of the bag?

119
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,558
-[Nobunaga] You’re pissing me off! 
-No. That’s impossible!

120
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,851
-[Nobunaga] Let me out! 
-Too bad.

121
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,395
-I suppose it can’t be helped. 
-[Nobunaga] Hey! What's going on?

122
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,237
You goddamn jerks!

123
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,156
What the hell was that, huh?

124
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,700
[Feitan] Troupe members 
don’t snap at each other.

125
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,826
You shut up!

126
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:36,164
[Feitan] Anyway, this ability 
could come in handy for our job.

127
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,376
Who cares? 
I’m gonna cut this guy to shreds!

128
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,543
[Feitan] Not yet.

129
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,255
First, he’s going to tell us 
where the treasure is.

130
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,342
[Shalnark] So Feitan’s going to use 
his torture skills?

131
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,469
You’ve got terrible luck.

132
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,225
[yells] Damn it!

133
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,897
[Dalzollene] Hey. Wake up!

134
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,505
I’m sure you understand 
what’s happening here.

135
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,009
You’re going to tell us 
where you hid that stolen merchandise.

136
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,056
Does anybody know what time it is?

137
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,060
How long have I been asleep?

138
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,274
Sounds like you 
don’t understand the situation.

139
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,193
You see…

140
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,738
[yells] I ask the questions here!

141
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,118
[gasping]

142
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,874
What incredible willpower!

143
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,210
He knows he’s about to be tortured,

144
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,839
yet there’s not even 
the slightest hint of apprehension

145
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,549
in the aura surrounding him.

146
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,597
His unflinching spirit is what’s behind 
his seemingly invincible body,

147
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,224
as well as the source of his aura.

148
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,686
He’s the product of countless battles!

149
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,571
I ask the questions here!

150
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,870
[Kurapika] What incredible willpower!

151
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,998
He knows he’s about to be tortured,

152
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,543
yet there’s not even 
the slightest hint of apprehension

153
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,253
in the aura surrounding him.

154
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,343
His unflinching spirit is what’s behind 
his seemingly invincible body,

155
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,096
as well as the source of his aura.

156
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,557
He’s the product of countless battles!

157
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,230
[Uvogin] Can I move?

158
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,065
No…

159
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,569
That’s probably gonna take a while longer.

160
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,739
I ate dinner at about eight o’clock.

161
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,159
My stomach’s telling me 
it’s around midnight now.

162
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,412
[Squala gasps]

163
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,957
Let’s make a deal, shall we?

164
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,166
[startled gasp]

165
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,585
You release me right now

166
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,712
and I’ll spare all of your lives.

167
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,755
Huh?

168
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,882
Hey… What is he saying?

169
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,342
He crazy or what?

170
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,886
-He's serious. 
-[Squala] Huh?

171
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,221
Or he seems to be.

172
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,974
He is? But that’s insane!

173
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,145
He’s the one that should be 
begging for his life right now.

174
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,983
Now, let me make this crystal clear…

175
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,696
We’re after the auction merchandise 
that was stored underground.

176
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,282
If you guys don’t know where it is,

177
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,117
then I’ve got no business with you.

178
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,412
What?

179
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,788
[Melody] Just wait a moment.

180
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,624
So, you didn’t steal all the merchandise?

181
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,003
The vault was empty when we got there.

182
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,090
I guess the Shadow Beasts 
had already taken all of it.

183
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,426
It makes sense that 
they didn’t stop to think

184
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,261
about telling grunts like you.

185
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,558
I think that he’s telling us the truth.

186
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,684
[Squala whines]

187
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,478
[Squala] Wait, then he’s serious?

188
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,607
So, he wasn’t bluffing 
when he offered to make us a deal?

189
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,109
[terrified gasp]

190
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,527
[grunting]

191
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,072
[Uvogin] Everyone makes mistakes, right?

192
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,117
Now you know 
we haven’t stolen anything yet.

193
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,328
So just take these things off

194
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,080
and turn a blind eye 
to what we’re about to do.

195
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,208
If you do that…

196
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,211
then I’ll let you live.

197
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,051
[Kurapika] What about the guests?

198
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,177
What guests?

199
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,347
The guests who were present 
in the auction hall.

200
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,515
Our colleagues were among the crowd.

201
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,309
Answer me.

202
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,395
I see.

203
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,064
Really sorry to hear that.

204
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,235
They’re dead. 
That was the plan from the begin--

205
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,155
How many people did you murder?

206
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,449
How many died for your selfish plan?

207
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,909
Kurapika! Stop!

208
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,329
Hey, knock it off!

209
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,790
If the merchandise is in safe hands,

210
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,166
we have no use for him.

211
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,543
We’ll just hand him over to the community.

212
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,797
Sounds like you’re not accepting my offer.

213
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,570
[angry growling]

214
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,784
Hey. Did you learn 
where all the auction merchandise--

215
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,036
[yells] Shut up! Go ask Feitan!

216
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,041
[Owl inhaling deeply]

217
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,841
[Machi] Did he tell you where it is?

218
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,885
It was no fun at all.

219
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,347
I had barely gotten started 
when he gave it up.

220
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,808
Oh. So that’s it.

221
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,656
[Hisoka] Ah, right.

222
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,909
I’m supposed to meet someone today.

223
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,953
I’ll be leaving for a bit.

224
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,122
[Boss] Sure. Go ahead.

225
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,292
As long as you’re back 
by six p.m. tomorrow.

226
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,754
Up to no good, Hisoka?

227
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,423
Of course, I am.

228
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,974
Damn it.

229
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,740
[inhales, then exhales slowly]

230
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,954
[phone buzzes]

231
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,127
“Meet as promised 
at the agreed-upon place.”

232
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,820
[Feitan] Hey, where is Shalnark?

233
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,863
He called in a few minutes ago.

234
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,659
He said that he finally succeeded 
in locating a Mafia community room.

235
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,372
[Dalzollene] This is Dalzollene 
of the Nostrade family.

236
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,708
We’ve captured one of the thieves 
who attacked the auction

237
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,669
and would like to hand him over to you.

238
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:20,753
[mafia contact] Really?

239
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,380
How’d you manage that?

240
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,006
I’ll fill you in later.

241
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,300
[mafia contact] Very impressive.

242
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,469
Even the Shadow Beasts couldn’t do that.

243
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,055
The Shadow Beasts? Are you serious?

244
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,433
[mafia contact] 
Yeah. In fact, they’re all dead.

245
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,602
[Dalzollene] All of them?

246
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,230
[mafia contact] Well, 
where are you right now?

247
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,275
Okay, got it.

248
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,319
[Dalzollene] Please. You have to hurry.

249
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,864
[mafia contact] Right. We’ll be sure 
to bring our best people.

250
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,207
I gave him three canisters 
of muscle relaxant gas.

251
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,417
Understood.

252
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,378
Some men from the community 
will be here shortly.

253
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,255
I’ll watch over him ‘til they get here,

254
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,090
so everyone get some rest.

255
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,467
[Basho and Squala] Right.

256
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,842
Early, aren’t you?

257
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,267
[Kurapika] He’s not using In.

258
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,478
Don’t look so worried.

259
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,439
I’ve no interest in fighting you now.

260
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,526
Then let’s just get right to the point.

261
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,987
The Troupe. 
Tell me everything you know about them.

262
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,240
Oh, come now. Already?

263
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,076
I do just adore idle chit-chat.

264
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,080
[wry chuckle]

265
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,832
[Hisoka] There are 13 Spiders in all,

266
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,711
each identifiable 
by their numbered spider tattoos.

267
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,382
Members can be replaced 
at a moment’s notice.

268
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,345
An applicant need only defeat 
a current member in order to join.

269
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,014
If the Troupe loses one for other reasons,

270
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,809
it falls to the Boss to fill the vacancy.

271
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,729
Well, to be honest, 
they mainly steal and kill,

272
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,274
though they do dabble in philanthropy.

273
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,442
[Kurapika] That much I know already.

274
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,695
What you might not know already is

275
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,990
that I replaced number four 
a couple of years ago.

276
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,408
[Kurapika] For what purpose?

277
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,327
I wanted the chance to fight the boss.

278
00:17:58,661 --> 00:17:59,829
[Kurapika] The boss?

279
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,664
But... why would you want that?

280
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,166
Because he’s powerful.

281
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,838
You wanted to test your strength? 
That was your only reason?

282
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,423
[Hisoka] Who knows?

283
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,675
It… It… [moans lightly]

284
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,720
It just gets me so excited.

285
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,640
Even the mere thought of fighting the boss 
turns me on!

286
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,478
But unfortunately, 
I haven’t had the chance yet.

287
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,564
He never lowers his guard.

288
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,444
He’s with at least two others 
at all times.

289
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,531
And as soon as a job ends,

290
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,283
he vanishes...

291
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,702
instantly and without a trace.

292
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,875
So, I believe you and I 
can help each other.

293
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,044
Don’t you think our goals

294
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,838
are too difficult to achieve 
all by ourselves?

295
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,091
[Kurapika] What are you saying?

296
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,596
[Hisoka] I can tell you 
the Troupe members’ abilities.

297
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,016
There are seven whose powers 
I already know about.

298
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,478
What do you say...

299
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,396
we work together?

300
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,359
[buzzer]

301
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,488
[Dalzollene] Yes, we’re on floor B2.

302
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,702
[elevator dings]

303
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,960
Follow me.

304
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,796
You haven’t killed him yet, have you?

305
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,047
No.

306
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,298
This way.

307
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,885
We couldn’t get a needle into him,

308
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,513
which meant we had to paralyze him 
with gas instead.

309
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,558
Clothes really make the man.

310
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,143
[gasps, grunts in pain]

311
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,147
[Dalzollene rasping]

312
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,821
I didn’t believe it when I heard.

313
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,699
Never pegged you 
as the type to get yourself kidnapped.

314
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,665
It’s time for work, Blinky.

315
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,629
[chuckles]

316
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,591
Now get in there and suck out 
all the poison that’s paralyzing Uvo.

317
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,725
[Shizuku] Okay, all done.

318
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,819
[weary sigh]

319
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:47,163
[yells thunderously] Damn it!

320
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,083
I’m gonna find that chain user

321
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,586
and when I do, I’m gonna 
make him pay for this!

322
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,463
Everyone! Wake up!

323
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,302
Where is he?!

324
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,512
I think he just ran away.

325
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,848
It’s probably because you were 
so darn loud.

326
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,183
We’re heading back.

327
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,559
Our job here’s done.

328
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,227
We took care of the Shadow Beasts.

329
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,522
Oh, yeah! And we got the treasure, too!

330
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,274
-[Uvogin] No! 
-[Shizuku and Phinks] Huh?

331
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,948
[Uvogin] You tell the Boss…

332
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,577
I’m not leaving.

333
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:30,873
I can’t go back until I settle the score 
with that damn chain user!

334
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,837
[narrator] Uvogin has been freed 
from his bonds.

335
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:41,258
And Kurapika, having just been invited 
to team up with Hisoka

336
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,511
is completely unaware.

337
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,100
[theme song playing]

338
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,459
[Gon] Coming up:

339
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:58,878
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

340
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,546
[both] Hunterpedia!

341
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,214
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

342
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,632
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

343
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,634
Today, we're introducing Dalzollene!

344
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,344
Leader of Neon’s bodyguards.

345
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,014
Must be a real drag 
taking care of that selfish brat!

346
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,974
I know, taking care of you is a real drag!

347
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,726
What are you talking about, you little--

348
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,858
[Gon] Next time: 
"Chasing x and x Waiting."

349
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,903
Hey, Killua! Let’s play 
Drop the Handkerchief, okay?

350
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,571
I’ll drop it and you sit and wait!

351
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,364
[Killua] That’s not a two-player game, 
idiot!
