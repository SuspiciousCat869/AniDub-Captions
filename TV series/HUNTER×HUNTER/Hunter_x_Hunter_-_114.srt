i’d only be giving him proof

he needs to worry about.

Knuckle could only stand
on the sidelines and watch.

Staying still
was his own battle,

told himself to tough it out...

How much longer
do I have to endure this?

It feels like i’m suffocating

It’s taking all my willpower
not to run away.

Knuckle: He barely scratched me,

but even so, it was
more than enough to pay off

plus interest!

his life out there,

Narrator:
Youpi didn’t notice himself

nor did he notice

You’re gonna ruin everything.

This is where we want to be,

far enough away
to avoid capture,

222

but close enough
to rush back in.

223

For a second,

we need to worry about.

There’s no way
I didn’t notice it before.

It just suddenly
appeared out of nowhere.

Wait. I remember this.
