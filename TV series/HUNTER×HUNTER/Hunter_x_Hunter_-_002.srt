00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:11,637
vast riches, hidden treasures...

00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:17,434
evil haunts, uncharted frontiers...

00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,355
the mysterious unknown.

00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,276
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words...

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,153
are called...

8
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,157
Hunters.

[theme song plays]

So...

11
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,994
I'll make sure all three of you 
get safely dropped off

12
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,748
at the port closest to the exam site. 
How does that sound?

13
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,959
All right!

DOLLE HARBOR

00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,389
[narrator] 
After winning over the old captain,

17
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:23,268
Gon, Kurapika and Leorio 
arrived at Dolle Harbor,

18
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,729
where their adventures 
were just beginning.

19
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,066
Thanks a lot, Captain. 
That was really fun.

20
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:33,070
[laughs] I've got to admit, 
I had a pretty good time, myself.

21
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:38,617
Oh, yeah, let me give you a bit of advice 
as a small token of my appreciation.

22
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:39,951
Advice, sir?

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,207
Look. Do you see that big cedar tree? 
The one up on the top of that hill?

24
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,375
[Gon] Uh-huh.

25
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,752
[Captain] 
You'll wanna make your way there first.

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,088
It's a shortcut to the exam site.

27
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,800
[Gon] A shortcut? Great! 
So, just head for that tree, huh?

28
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,136
Thanks for the tip, Captain. 
You're the best.

29
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,596
Good luck to you.

30
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,850
Thanks! Have a safe trip! 
Take care of yourself!

31
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:10,607
[Captain] You can rest easy, Ging. 
Your boy's grown into a fine young man.

32
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,319
[snickers]

33
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,241
-[Leorio] Hmm, that's odd. 
-[Gon] What is?

34
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,452
[Leorio] Well, uh, according 
to this notice I received,

35
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,373
the exam is supposed to be held 
somewhere in Zaban City, you see?

36
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:32,879
Now, we're here, and that tree is there, 
which is the opposite direction of Zaban.

37
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,090
Could you have misheard the captain?

38
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,760
I don't think so. He told me I should go 
towards that cedar tree.

39
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,220
I see.

40
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,515
And this stupid notice isn't any help 
at all.

41
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,728
It says the exam's in Zaban City, 
but it doesn't say where, exactly!

42
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,606
Our task is to find the site 
using only limited information.

43
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,110
This is another test to determine 
if we're worthy of the Exam.

44
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,613
Yeah, I already knew that, 
smarty pants! So give it a rest!

45
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,866
[Gon] I think I’ll check it out for myself

46
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,076
Find out what the captain 
was talking about.

47
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,120
[Leorio] Whoa, whoa. Are you serious?

48
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,123
The bus to Zaban is gonna leave 
any second!

49
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,125
We need to be on it when it does.

50
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,210
Hey!

51
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,922
Geez. The kid’s too trusting 
for his own good.

52
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,258
You can’t just trust everyone 
all the time.

53
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,052
Kurapika, come back!

54
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,807
I’m intrigued by the captain’s advice, 
but even more so by Gon’s behavior.

55
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,435
I’m curious to see what he’ll do.

56
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:33,732
All right, whatever. See ya! 
It wasn’t long but it was nice knowing ya.

57
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,194
Another follower, 
just like the rest of ‘em.

58
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,988
Not me, though. I’m gonna take the bus.

59
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,406
[man 1] So, it was a trap?

60
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,203
[man 2] All I’m sayin’ is none 
of the buses made it to Zaban City.

61
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,039
[man 1 chuckles] 
Rookies always fail this part.

62
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,792
They believe whatever you tell ‘em! 
[chuckles]

63
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,836
[Leorio] Hey, hey, hey, wait for me!

64
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,885
[Leorio] It’s just I knew you guys 
would be lonely without me.

65
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,179
Plus, it’s no fun traveling alone!

66
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:10,101
That’s why I figured I’d stick with you 
two a little while longer. [laughs]

[Leorio] Man, this is one creepy place. 
There isn’t a single soul anywhere.

70
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,866
No. There’s a bunch of people here!

71
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,284
[gasps] What?

72
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,038
[all gasp]

73
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,509
[Leorio] What’s up with these guys?

74
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,428
Exciting.

75
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,305
"Exciting"?

76
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,850
Exciting.

77
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,309
"Exciting"?

78
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,898
Time for the exciting 
multiple-choice quiz!

79
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:03,655
[band playing instruments]

[crow caws]

81
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,411
Let me take a guess. You boys are headed 
for the cedar on the hill, aren’t you?

82
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,746
There’s only one way to get there.

83
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,749
You’ll have to pass 
through this town first.

84
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:15,959
[all] Huh?

85
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,462
[old lady] You must pass a quiz 
comprised of a single question.

86
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,215
Wait a second! What is going on here?

87
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,593
[old lady] 
You’ll have five seconds to answer.

88
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,220
If you’re correct, then you can move on.

89
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,640
If not, you’re disqualified 
from this year’s Exam.

90
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,017
Oh, I see.

91
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,604
It’s another trial we have to pass 
before taking the Exam.

92
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,940
So that’s it, huh? 
Lucky I’m an expert in quizzes.

93
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,442
Wait, one question?

94
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,403
Your answer must be 
either the number one or two.

95
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,824
Any answer that is not the number one 
or number two will be deemed incorrect.

96
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,661
Hold on! All three of us 
have to share the same question?

97
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,248
So if Kurapika here gets it wrong, 
it means I get disqualified, too?

98
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,460
Not very likely. 
Although, if the roles were reversed,

99
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,671
-it would be all but inevitable. 
-You wanna repeat that?

100
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,424
It's okay! Even if only one of us 
knows the answer,

101
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,720
all three of us get to move on. [chuckles] 
And I'm real bad at quizzes.

102
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,388
-True. 
-Fair point.

103
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,514
[man] Hey, hey.

104
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:16,353
Hurry it up, or I might answer it 
before the rest of you get a chance.

105
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,939
-[Leorio] So, who the heck are you? 
-[Gon] You don’t know?

106
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,317
He’s been following us pretty closely 
ever since we left the port.

107
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,401
[Leorio] Really?

108
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,986
Yeah, sorry, kid.

109
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,615
Didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but I couldn’t 
help but hear you guys talking.

110
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,367
[old lady] What will you do?

111
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,578
[Leorio] He seems pretty eager to me. 
Should we let him go first, guys?

112
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,664
See what kind of question 
we can expect from them?

113
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,458
-[Gon] Sure. I'm okay with that. 
-[Kurapika] No objections here.

114
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,335
[Matthew] Let's get to it, then.

115
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,172
Once I ace this quiz, 
I’m gonna leave a trail of traps

116
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,174
for anyone who tries to follow me.

117
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,968
Now, here is your question.

118
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,928
-[horn tooting] 
-[crow caws]

119
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,015
A group of evil villains have kidnapped 
your mother and your true love

120
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,101
and you can only save one of them.

121
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,479
Choose one for your mother 
or two for your true love.

122
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,107
Which do you save and which of them dies?

123
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,276
-[Gon, Leorio and Kurapika gasp] 
-Hey! What kind of quiz is this?

124
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,529
[snickers]

125
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,863
[bell rings]

126
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,532
The answer’s number one.

127
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,284
Oh? And what's your reason?

128
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,913
It’s your mom! 
It’s not like you can replace your mom.

129
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,374
But a lover, 
you can always find another one.

130
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,293
-What? 
-[crow caws]

131
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,048
-You may pass. 
-Seriously?

132
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,678
Looks like the trick is telling 
the old lady whatever she wants to hear.

133
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,096
Adios!

134
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,892
Hang on! What kind of crap is that? 
There's no way that was the right answer!

135
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,937
We’re just supposed to say 
what we think she wants to hear?

136
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,023
What's up with that?

137
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,735
-Say something. 
-[crow caws]

138
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,821
Ugh, okay. 
I’ve had just about enough of this.

139
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,408
-I’m gonna find my own way! 
-[old lady] It's too late for that.

140
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:58,455
Refuse to take the quiz if you wish. 
But know you’ll be disqualified.

141
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,957
Grr, that's nuts!

142
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,668
Different people would answer that 
in different ways!

143
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,213
There’s no right answer for that question 
and never has been.

144
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,383
[gasps] There is no right answer?

145
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,927
-I see. 
-Oh?

146
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,888
-Leorio! 
-That's enough!

147
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,018
[old lady] The boy with the cat eyes 
has figured it out.

148
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,438
I don’t want to hear another word 
out of you.

149
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,941
Say anything but your answer 
and you’re disqualified.

150
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,363
[Kurapika] You can do this, Leorio. 
This is just a simple trick.

151
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,450
Gon...

152
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,160
And now here is your question.

153
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,245
-[horn tooting] 
-[crow caws]

154
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,624
You learn both your son and your daughter 
have been kidnapped.

155
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,502
You will only be able 
to rescue one of them.

156
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,630
Choose one for your son, 
and two for your daughter.

157
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,299
Which of these two will you rescue?

158
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,010
[Leorio] Grr! She's messing with us!

159
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:59,307
[old lady] Five... four...

160
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,142
[Leorio] Go ahead and count down, 
you old hag.

161
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,144
...three...

162
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,147
two...

163
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,234
-[Leorio grunts] 
-...one!

164
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,405
[mimics buzzer] Time is up!

165
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,035
[yells]

166
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,001
Out of the way, Kurapika!

167
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,713
This old hag needs to be taught a lesson 
and I’m gonna make sure she gets it!

168
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,132
Would you please calm down?

169
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,717
How the hell do you expect me 
to calm down?

170
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,470
We got it right! 
Do you really want to jeopardize that?

171
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,931
We did?

172
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,767
We’ve already given the correct response

173
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,979
Silence. Any other answer 
would have been incorrect.

174
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,398
[Leorio] What do you mean, "silence"?

175
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,067
Just that. You said it yourself, remember?

176
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,068
[Leorio] Huh?

177
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,613
There’s no right answer for that question 
and never has been!

178
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,865
You were right.

179
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,075
There was no correct answer 
to our question.

180
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,370
However, we had to say "one" or "two" 
as a response.

181
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:06,541
And so, our only choice was to respond 
with silence.

182
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,626
What about that guy? He made it through!

183
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,338
She never told him he was correct. 
All she said was “you may pass.”

184
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,176
Which means that this is not the path 
to the Hunter Exam.

185
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,594
Right?

186
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,972
Hmm. That is correct.

187
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,185
The real path is right over here.

188
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:30,190
Follow this path for two hours 
and you will reach the lone cedar tree.

189
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,027
Okay. I was not expecting this.

190
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,322
There is a couple that live 
in a small cabin under that tree

191
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,033
who will serve as Navigators 
on your journey.

192
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,785
They will guide you to the Exam site,

193
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,914
if you live up to their expectations, 
that is.

194
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,586
I’m sorry. I hope you’ll forgive me 
for being rude.

195
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,963
Don't be. I don't mind.

196
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:58,551
Meeting people like you is the only reason 
I do this job in the first place.

197
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,933
Do your best. Become the best Hunter 
you can be.

198
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,937
[chuckles] Sure.

199
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,940
-[Gon groans] 
-[Leorio] Huh?

200
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,778
I'm stuck. 
I can't figure out the right answer.

201
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,074
[Leorio chuckles] 
You’ve really been thinking of an answer

202
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,660
this whole time? You can stop now.

203
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,078
[Gon] Huh? But why?

204
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,330
[Kurapika] 
Because the quiz is already over.

205
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,167
[Gon] I know that, 
but what if... you know?

206
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,379
Well, what if that really happens 
to me someday?

207
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,423
If two people are in trouble 
and I can only help one of them?

208
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,467
Then what?

209
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,388
It wouldn’t be right to pick one 
over the other.

210
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,557
But like it or not, 
that’s a choice I might have to make.

211
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,185
I just hope that I know what to do.

212
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,485
[old lady] The boy is right, of course.

213
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,363
That is indeed the true purpose 
of this test.

214
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,492
The abstract may come to pass 
and a Hunter must be ready.

215
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:09,247
Reality can be cruel, and it often strikes 
without warning.

216
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:13,418
One must always be prepared 
for these crossroads in life.

217
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:21,569
HUNTER GLOSSARY

218
00:13:21,924 --> 00:13:26,119
KURAPIKA

219
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,516
[Leorio] Man, I can’t see a thing

220
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,602
“You’ll reach the top in two hours,” 
she said.

221
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,647
Well, it was two hours, two hours ago! 
[tuts]

222
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,903
Another “Beware of Magical Beasts” sign?

223
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,532
I’m starting to think we’re never gonna 
find this stupid Exam site.

224
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,577
Guys, I'm so hungry! 
I need to take a dump!

225
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,330
-[Gon] Try to keep up, Leorio! 
-I need to pee too! Hey, guys?

226
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,123
-I think I see it. 
-[Gon] Huh?

227
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,671
[knocking on door]

228
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,798
[Leorio] Hey? Anybody home?

229
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,300
I guess not.

230
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,095
[Leorio] Coming in!

231
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,141
[all] Huh?

232
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,644
[beast cackling]

233
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,688
-[Leorio] Magical Beast. 
-[Gon] A what?

234
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,233
It appears to be a Kiriko. 
It can take on human form!

235
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,486
-They’re extremely intelligent. 
-[woman whimpering]

236
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,071
He’s got a woman.

237
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,406
And the guy on the floor looks 
like he needs a doctor, bad!

238
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:34,040
Please help. Save her! 
You have to save my wife.

239
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,334
Leorio, see to his injuries!

240
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,794
Right! I'm on it!

241
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,514
[Kurapika] Even in pitch darkness, 
he can still see and keep pace

242
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,182
with such a faint shadow.

243
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,060
[Gon grunting]

244
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,771
Impressive.

245
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,402
[Gon] Kiriko, let the lady go!

246
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,654
Why don’t you try to take her from me?

247
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,906
[yelps]

248
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,910
You hear that? It can talk. 
That’s amazing!

249
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,122
The Kiriko is a Magical Beast 
capable of human speech.

250
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,125
Really? Well, that ought to make this 
a lot easier.

251
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,922
-Hey, come here, you dumb Kiriko! 
-What?

252
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,134
[Kiriko] This kid's fast.

253
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:29,971
Kurapika!

254
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,060
[pants] Damn, that was reckless.

255
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,063
Stupid kid! You're gonna pay!

256
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,314
Hey, wait up!

257
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,907
Are you hurt, miss? 
Are you feeling pain anywhere at all?

258
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,911
I'm fine, but... what about my husband? 
Is he alright?

259
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,873
Not to worry. 
Our friend is taking good care of him.

260
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,917
Then please. You have to take me to him, 
I beg you!

261
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,628
[Leorio] Huh? Those tattoos...

262
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,843
-Wait, you're not-- 
-[Leorio] Kurapika.

263
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,803
-Huh? 
-You okay?

264
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,929
Leorio.

265
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,557
[Leorio] Guess you are. What a relief.

266
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,642
How is the man you were caring for?

267
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,811
Good! I think he’ll pull through fine.

268
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,647
Lucky for him, the wound wasn’t 
as deep as it looked,

269
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,234
I gave him some painkillers 
so he’s sleeping it off back at the cabin

270
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,861
I see.

271
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,113
[grunts]

272
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,163
[snickers] How'd you know?

273
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,752
How could you tell that I was an imposter?

274
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,049
[Kurapika] To be honest, 
I didn’t actually think you were.

275
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,887
You see, Leorio made a promise 
that he’d take care of that injured man.

276
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,058
When I saw him, 
I assumed he had left the man all alone.

277
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,727
And with the Magical Beast 
still on the loose,

278
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,271
I attacked him for abandoning 
his obligation.

279
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,940
Nothing more.

280
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,942
[Kiriko snickers]

281
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,571
[Kurapika] And you, tell me right now.

282
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,366
Who are you and what is it 
you want from us?

283
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,501
[Gon] Wait!

284
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:47,525
[Kiriko cackling] 
You're pretty fast for a kid, you know?

285
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,987
You really hit me. 
I didn't expect that from you.

286
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,329
That's quite an accomplishment. 
Unfortunately for you,

287
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,416
it comes with a higher price 
than you bargained for.

288
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,670
Kiri, kiri, kiri, kiri, kiri!

289
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,552
-So, who are you? 
-[Kiriko grunts]

290
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,142
You're not the one I was chasing, are you? 
The one that I hit?

291
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,644
Um... are you a friend of his?

292
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,108
[Kiriko] Hold on. How can you tell 
that I'm not the same one from before?

293
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,445
Huh? Oh, well, you look totally different.

294
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,490
Your voice is different, too. 
It's higher and kinda thinner.

295
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:42,747
[Kiriko chuckles then laughs hysterically]

296
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,750
What's up? Why are you laughing? 
Is it something I said?

297
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,964
[Kiriko] Hey! Hey, honey! Come here! 
You’re gonna get a kick out of this!

298
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,093
[Kiriko 1 chuckles] How many years 
has it been

299
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,804
since anyone was able 
to tell the two of us apart?

300
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,598
[Kiriko 2] I'm so happy.

301
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,434
Can you tell ‘em apart? Seriously.

302
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,186
No, not at all.

303
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,815
Don’t you see? The Kiriko that Kurapika 
and I hit is actually the husband.

304
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,193
[Leorio and Kurapika] 
And which one is that, exactly?

305
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,612
[Kiriko 1] 
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

306
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,989
We are the Navigators.

307
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,909
Our family provides support 
for the Hunter Exam.

308
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,203
-I'm their daughter. 
-I'm their son.

309
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,331
[Leorio] 
Man. Great job. You sure had us fooled

310
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,292
The Exam site moves around. 
Keeps it interesting.

311
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,213
But that’s exactly why they relocate it 
every year. Understand?

312
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,216
They hire Navigators like us to help 
by guiding worthy applicants

313
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,926
to the examination site.

314
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,512
Oh, so that how it works?

315
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,224
But don’t get the wrong idea. 
We don’t help every candidate.

316
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,144
[son] First, we test them to see if 
they’re even qualified to take the Exam.

317
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,480
Make sure they have what it takes.

318
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,608
-[daughter] Mr. Kurapika? 
-Yes?

319
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,986
We made certain that we only gave you 
the most vague of hints

320
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,738
but you were still able to pick up on them

321
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,533
and determine that we weren’t 
actually a married couple.

322
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,535
You only caught a glimpse of my tattoos.

323
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,830
But you knew that in this region, 
these tattoos are only worn

324
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,457
by women who’ve taken a vow of chastity

325
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,211
Mr. Kurapika demonstrated 
that he’s incredibly knowledgeable.

326
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,047
Therefore, he passes.

327
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,800
-[Kurapika sighs in relief] 
-Way to go, Kurapika.

328
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:18,926
Thanks.

329
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,220
-[son] Mr. Leorio? 
-Yes?

330
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:25,516
You, sir, unfortunately never realized 
that I wasn’t who I claimed to be.

331
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,684
[gulps]

332
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,437
[son] However, you dressed my wounds 
faster and more thoroughly

333
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,564
than any doctor. 
More importantly,

334
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,817
you demonstrated admirable empathy 
and kindness

335
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,070
by continuing to reassure me 
that my wife would be okay.

336
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,866
-[Gon and Kurapika chuckling] 
-Knock it off, okay? It's embarrassing.

337
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,119
[son] It’s clear to me 
that your compassion makes you worthy

338
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,746
of taking the Hunter Exam.

339
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,248
And so, you pass.

340
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:54,462
Wait, seriously? [sighs in relief]

341
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,755
You did it!

342
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,798
[both chuckle]

343
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,135
-[Kurapika 1] And finally, Mr. Gon. 
-Yes?

344
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:06,640
Your superhuman physical ability 
and your powers of observation defy logic.

345
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,060
You, too, are worthy 
to take the Hunter Exam.

346
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,688
So, you pass.

347
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,939
[gasps]

348
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,277
[chuckles]

349
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:24,116
[Kurapika 1] Alright! We’ll now take you 
straight to the site of the Exam!

350
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,954
Oh, wow! Isn’t it incredible 
that we all passed?

351
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,040
[Kurapika] I wouldn't celebrate just yet.

352
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,375
We’ve merely earned the right 
to take the Exam.

353
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,296
[Leorio] It's progress! 
I say that calls for a little celebration!

354
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,965
[Kurapika] Honestly, have some foresight.

355
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,760
Do you have to be such a smartass 
all the time-- [yells]

356
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,263
[Kurapika 2] Hey, stop squirming! 
If you fall, it's your own fault.

357
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,015
[laughing]

358
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:52,436
[narrator] And so, Gon and his friends 
enjoy a brief journey through the sky.

359
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:58,025
However, even after all this, 
they have yet to reach the starting line.

360
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,196
[theme song playing]

361
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,201
[Gon] Next time! "Rivals in Survival." 
I'm gonna do my best!
