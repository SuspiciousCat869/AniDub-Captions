I’m betting those things

324
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:57,017
must secrete some kind
of special anticoagulant.

325

i can’t afford
any more bleeding wounds,

You like that?!

330
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,802
now there’s
nowhere for you to hide,

331
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,805
so come on out!

I wanted to observe you
a little longer,

but I guess that won’t work.

on stamina, anyway.

Hello. My name is jail--

uh, I mean call me meleoron.

345
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:10,290
I was a squadron leader
when the queen was alive.

346
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:11,926
Nice to meet you.

347
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,761
And what’s your name?

348
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,964
Gon: Why were you following me?

349
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:20,067
Meleoron: Because I didn’t
want you getting away,

350
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,369
and I sure couldn’t
just let you die,

351
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:26,373
because you’ll make
a really valuable partner.

352
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,944
Do you have business
with the king?

353
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:32,046
Gon: I don’t.

354

with an ulterior motive.

357
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,087
I can’t tell him
anything else.

358
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,989
Meleoron: Really?

359
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:45,659
I thought that you guys
were here to defeat the king.

360

00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,608
thought i’d put up
less of a fight, didn’t you?

368
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:04,211
Meleoron: Huh? Wait!
You’ve got it all wrong!

Is that how it sounded?

370
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,082
Okay, that makes sense.

371

I mean, I know what I look like.

You think i’m an enemy.

Guess I should have been
more clear about that.

Listen, I swear i’m not lying!

375
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:21,661
I’m not looking to trick
or defeat you, okay? Promise.
