But if I may make one request,

324
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:11,932
will you keep holding my hand?

325
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,902
Komugi?

326
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:17,938
Komugi, are you there?

327
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:20,106
Komugi: I can hear you.

328
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,910
All right. Like this?

329
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:27,014
Meruem: I shall wake up shortly.

330
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:32,085
Will you stay
by my side until then?

331
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,455
Komugi: I’ve never
left your side.

332
00:22:34,488 --> 00:22:35,456
Don’t worry.

333
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:37,658
We’ll always be together.

334
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,193
Meruem: Komugi.

335
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:43,030
Komugi: Yes, yes? What is it?

336
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:47,267
Meruem: Thank you.

337
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:48,969
Komugi: You’re welcome.

338
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:52,039
Meruem: Will you...

339
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:54,808
Komugi: Yes?

340
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:59,680
Meruem: Will you say my name
one last time?

341
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:13,093
Komugi: Good night, meruem.

342
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:17,431
It’ll be all right.

343
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:20,133
I’ll be joining you soon.

344
