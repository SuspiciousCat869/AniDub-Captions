Narrator: Outing precaution
level four,

when in this classification,

75
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,435
the subject’s words and actions
are restricted,

76
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,869
and they must be supervised

77
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,172
by multiple butlers
and family members.

78
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:36,143
Any violation,
no matter how small,

79
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,879
will result in the subject’s
immediate capture.

80
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,783
They are then sent home
and upgraded to level five.

81
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:47,020
Level five, the target is
not allowed to leave the estate.

82
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:51,025
Any attempt at escape
will be put to a swift halt.

Gotoh: These precautionary
measures are recommended

85
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,965
due to removal
of family valuables,

86
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,102
as well as rebellion and
hostility toward your parents.

Killua: She isn’t property!

88

Gotoh: There are
three prohibited matters.

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,078
The first, outsider contact
is strictly forbidden.

90
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,747
This includes speaking
or passing objects

91
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,049
without the express permission
of the family.

92
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,987
To enforce this,
the target is forbidden

93
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,155
to carry
any communication devices.

94
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,891
Killua: Yeah,
you took everything already.

95
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,993
Gotoh: The second,
you must remain

96
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,897
within a one-meter radius
of master alluka.

97
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,066
There are absolutely
no exceptions at any time.

98
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,568
Killua: Fine. I don’t plan

on letting her
out of my sight anyway.

100
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,939
Gotoh: Thirdly,
to protect family secrets,

101
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,943
master alluka’s ability
must be kept confidential.

102
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,645
Sharing minor details
is forbidden.

it’s gonna have to be.

Pariston: And so
we zodiacs are unanimous

325
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:09,162
in our utmost respect for
the previous chairman’s wishes.

326
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,231
We promise to honor his memory

327
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:14,668
as we take great strides forward
for the association.

328
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,804
So it doesn’t make a difference
who you vote for,

329
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,475
and, no matter who gets
your support, your vote counts!

330
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,677
I say that
with absolute certainty!

331
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,112
I’m sure there are those of you

332
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,182
who are dissatisfied
with the current association

333
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,118
or who would like nothing more

334
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,286
than to see
a brand-new administration.

335
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,624
However, there are much better
ways to express those feelings

336
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:41,195
than choosing to abstain
from this critical vote!

337
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,464
We’re here so that you
can ask questions

or address the crowd yourselves!

339
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:49,837
The point is to make
your voice heard, so speak up!

340
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,339
Even if your opinions
aren’t popular ones,

341
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:55,108
you will not be ignored!

342
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,878
In fact, ging here
is a prime example.

343
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,580
He’s committed more violations
than I can count,

344
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:02,382
and yet look where he’s sitting.

He’s still here among us,
a proud member of the zodiacs!

346
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,755
If you’re thinking
about abstaining,

347
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,325
why not vote for him instead?

348
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:14,528
That was a joke, of course.

349
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,598
This election
is the very last mission

350

that the former chairman
decided to give to us,

351
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,837
and I believe
that the association

352
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,707
should work together
in order to complete it!
