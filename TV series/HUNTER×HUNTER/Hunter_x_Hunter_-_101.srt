once it’s affixed to the target.

196
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,720
That links the target’s body
to the brother’s nen dart game.

197
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,757
No one can deactivate the pin

There is no way
to avoid this attack.

hit the target’s body,

the nen needlefish do not exist,
