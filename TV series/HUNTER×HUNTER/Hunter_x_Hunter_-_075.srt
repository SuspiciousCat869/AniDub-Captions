so there’s a real good chance
that one of them is--

165
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:37,451
wait. Did I get your hopes up?
Did I?

166
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,720
Well? Or maybe
you were thinking

167
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,456
your dad ging
could be the ruler, huh?

168
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,091
Gon: I didn’t think that.

169
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,660
I never even thought that he
would be here on the island.

170
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,663
Man #2: Oh, is that so?
That’s good, then.

171
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,631
You know, ’cause he’s not.

172
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,000
- Man #1: Mr. Dwun...
- Dwun: Huh?

173
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,068
Man: Can we please move on now?

174
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,637
Dwun: Yeah, sure. That’s my bad.

175
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,640
( Gon sighs )

176
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,142
Dwun: Listen up.
So you’ve actually collected

177
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:04,979
all 100 cards that
"greed island" has to offer.

178
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,582
Well done! That milestone
triggers a new event.

179
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,050
Let me see.

180
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,052
- Ah, here it is!
- Gon: Huh?

181
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,653
( Dwun blows )

182
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:17,658
There. Now open it up.

183
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,493
This case has slots

184
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,695
where you can place
three specified-slot cards,

185
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,963
but that’s not all.

186
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,965
You can take all three of them
back with you

187
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,434
to use in the real world.

188
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,502
However, just so you know,

189
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:32,072
you can’t take multiple copies
of the same card.

190
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,974
You have to choose from one

191
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,042
of the specified-slot cards
there in your binder,

192
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,978
but you can pick
any three you like.

193
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:39,980
Gon: Hmm.

194
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,884
Dwun: Okay, you’ve reached
the end of the game,

195
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,786
so you get to make a choice.

196
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,854
You want
the normal, generic ending

197
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,190
or the one that’s just for you?

198
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:51,692
Gon: There’s one for me?

199
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:52,859
Dwun: Yep, that’s right.

200
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,028
What’ll it be? What’ll it be?

201
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,697
Gon: Hmm.

202
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,498
I’ll take the generic one.

203
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,701
Dwun: Oh, yeah? Why that one?

204
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,237
Gon: Well, I didn’t
clear the game all by myself,

205
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,473
and if it’s generic, my friends
can watch, too, right?

206
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:08,876
Dwun: Ah. Okay, I see. I see.

207
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,511
- Man: Mr. Dwun...
- Dwun: Huh?

208
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,247
Man: Would you please
stop teasing our guest already?

209
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,582
I’m sorry,
but there’s no such thing

210
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,518
as an ending
tailored just for you.

211
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,019
Gon: Uh, there isn’t?

212
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,588
Man: ’fraid not,
but we were given permission

213
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,125
to tell you a few things
after you’d beaten the game.

214
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,192
Gon: Huh?

215
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,928
Man: How rude of us.

216
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,930
We’ll introduce ourselves.

217
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,566
My name is list. This is dwun.

218
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,035
Dwun: And as you
probably know by now,

219
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,937
both of us are friends
with your old man.

220
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,773
List: This game
was created by ging

221
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,542
along with ten of his friends.

222
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,679
The name "greed island"
was only decided upon

223
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:46,880
because it incorporates

224
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,617
the first letter
of each of their names.

225
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,085
Your father was in charge,

226
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,721
so we wanted to select
a word that began with "g,"

227
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,824
and it wasn’t long
before we settled on "greed."

228
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,692
Have you met razor yet?

229
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,661
Well, he’s the "r,"
and i’m the "l."

230
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,864
The woman who explains
the game at the beginning

231
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,867
is the twin of the woman you see
when leaving the island--

232
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,235
eeta and Elena.

233
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,271
Both of their names
start with "e."

234
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:14,809
Dwun: See that? And then
we’ve got the letter "d."

235
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,545
You wanna hear it?
Wanna hear my story?

236
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:18,946
Well? Well? Well?

237
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,747
Gon: Uh, yeah, okay.

238
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,883
Dwun: Then pay attention.

239
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,551
Here’s the thing.

240
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,087
Your father ging is...

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,789
Dwun: Your dad...

243
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,958
Is a huge jerk, a huge jerk!

244
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,728
( Growls )

245
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,830
My name is dwun. You got that?

246
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,766
And what do you think
the first letter is?!

247
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,868
Gon: Uh, isn’t it "d"?

248
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,035
( Dwun wails )

249
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,871
I can’t believe it.
You, too, huh?

250
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,174
Makes sense, I guess.
I mean, you are ging’s son.

251
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,776
Gon: I thought we were
talking about the letter "d."

252
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,779
Dwun: It’s "w," okay? "W"!

253
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:57,084
W-d-w-u-n-e spells wdwune!

254
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,685
And that was my name!

255
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,621
But even my oldest friends
in the world

256
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,090
thought it started with a "d."
How do you like that?

257
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,926
So when we all decided
on the name of the game,

258
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,294
I was perfectly clear.

259
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,663
My name starts with a "w,"
and that’s final!

260
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,699
But what do you think ging said
when I told him that, huh?

261
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,970
Ging: Really?
Then just ditch the "w."

262
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:20,975
Starting now, your name
is d-w-u-n. Okay, dwun?

263
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:23,677
( Dwun growls )

264
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,612
Isn’t that unbelievable?!

265
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:26,947
He went and changed my name

266
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,782
without even asking me
about it first,

267
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,785
just so he didn’t have to change
the title of the stupid game!

268
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,754
List: What’s even more amazing
is that only a minute later,

269
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,291
ging already had
dwun’s name legally changed,

270
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,827
and all he needed
was a phone and a computer.

271
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,230
Dwun: Eh, worse than that,
he took the "e" off the end,

272
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,832
because--get this--he thought
it was too confusing.

273
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,835
List: But your luck
has gotten much better

274
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:48,969
as a result, hasn’t it?

275
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,670
Dwun: Well, I guess so.

276

about your father?

Did they tell you anything?

three specified-slot cards

329

from your binder,
any three that you desire.

330

You’ve chosen number two,

number 81, blue planet,

332

Bisky: Oh, now I get it.

380
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:23,644
So you just used transform

381
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:26,280
to turn accompany
into a specified-slot card,

382
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:29,917
and then you used the paladin’s
necklace to revert it.

383
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,186
That was some clever thinking,
you guys!

384
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,322
But I have to say
i’m surprised

385
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,457
you would go to all that trouble
for an accompany

386
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,460
instead of choosing
another specified-slot card.

Gon: Yeah.

388

It’s just if I hadn’t been
the first to enter the game,

389
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,434
then I wouldn’t have noticed,
so I guess it was

390
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,602
- a good thing that I was.
- Bisky: Huh?

391

Killua: Do you remember when
we played rock-paper-scissors?

Killua: Yeah.

Gon: See,
I was the first person

395
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,248
to enter the game,
and while I was standing there,

396
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:04,251
waiting for killua,
there was nobody else around.

397

That means the first person
I met in the game

398
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:10,357
should have been the second
to show up, Mr. Goreinu.
