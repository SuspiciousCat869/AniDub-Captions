1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:01,793
TEN (ENVELOPE)

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,003
[narrator] Ten:

3
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:06,632
The ability to envelop your body 
in a shroud of Nen aura,

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,135
making it tougher and slowing 
the effects of aging.

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,428
ZETSU (SUPPRESS)

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,973
Zetsu: A technique which 
shuts off your flow of Nen aura.

7
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,852
Effective for concealing your presence 
and recovering from fatigue.

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,479
REN (REFINE)

9
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:24,358
Ren: A technique for creating 
an especially strong Nen aura.

10
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,027
It is crucial for increasing your power.

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:28,820
HATSU (RELEASE)

12
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,909
Hatsu: The release of your Nen aura, 
after using Ren to boost it.

13
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,039
These four elements are known 
as the Four Exercises

14
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,291
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

15
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,584
FOUR EXERCISES

16
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,592
[theme song playing]

17
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,832
[cheering]

18
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,792
[Gon] I’m really sorry, Mr. Wing.

19
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,672
But I’m itching for a fight right now!

20
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:16,553
FIERCE x AND x FEROCIOUS

21
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,976
[narrator] Gon faces his first match 
on the 200th floor,

22
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,022
but is caught off guard 
by his opponent’s unconventional attack.

23
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,034
[cackling]

24
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,255
[cries out in pain]

25
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,175
And another top hits him from behind!

26
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,803
It looks like he’s in big trouble now

27
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,806
because he’s just been surrounded 
by the Dancing Tops!

28
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,474
[grunts]

29
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,603
[grunts]

30
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,021
[cries out in pain]

31
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,484
That’s a clean hit and knockdown!

32
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,735
For two points!

33
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,571
[commentator] 
Gido’s up to an early four-point lead!

34
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,240
-Can you fight? 
-You bet!

35
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,742
There are too many tops for me

36
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,286
to be able to keep track of all of them. 
Dammit!

37
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,205
What should I do?

38
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,792
[Zushi] M-- Master…

39
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,169
Is he using Nen right now?

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,172
[Wing] Yes. That’s a form of Hatsu.

41
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,758
He’s projecting his aura into the tops.

42
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,552
That is what allows the tops

43
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,263
to move around with significantly 
more strength and speed

44
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,181
than would normally be possible.

45
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,144
[Wing] Small objects require 
only a small amount of aura.

46
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,313
The larger the object, 
the more aura is necessary.

47
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,858
And I wouldn’t be surprised

48
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,986
if Gido gave the tops 
extra Nen for good measure.

49
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,239
That’s because 
letting the tops spin on their own

50
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,617
without the benefit of additional aura, 
wouldn’t pack much of a punch.

51
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,078
He can do this

52
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,248
because he feels great personal affinity 
with them.

53
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,461
Nothing has more of an impact 
on an object’s response

54
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,755
than strong emotional attachment.

55
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,757
[grunting]

56
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,301
I can’t follow them with my eyes.

57
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,928
The tops have been charged with Nen.

58
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,930
I have to sense their presence!

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,604
Yeah. I feel it!

60
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,064
My Ten is fading!

61
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,441
[groans]

62
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,026
[commentator] Another direct hit!

63
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,361
Gon is completely helpless!

64
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,322
He’s been knocked clear out of the ring!

65
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,573
[Gon grunts]

66
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,370
[commentator] The score is now six-zero!

67
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,164
He’s dug himself quite a hole!

68
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,582
[Gon] It’s no use.

69
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,293
If I focus on sensing the tops,

70
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,504
I neglect my Ten and it seeps away…

71
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,047
So, what should I--?

72
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,219
A top bounced outside the ring…

73
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,971
But... it’s not attacking me…

74
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,724
What's wrong? 
Can you continue on with the match?

75
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,975
Be quiet, okay?

76
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,685
I’m trying to think here!

77
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,563
If you’re not back in the ring 
by the count of ten, you lose!

78
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,564
One!

79
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,608
Now that I think about it,

80
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,402
the Nen in this top didn’t feel malicious.

81
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,696
What about all the others?

82
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,032
They’re just spinning 
around the ring randomly

83
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,951
and bumping into each other.

84
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,080
Maybe the tops aren’t really 
coming after me at all.

85
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,665
Four!

86
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,792
How come you’re standing 
outside of the ring?

87
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,962
Because if I stayed up there in the ring, 
I’d probably end up getting hurt, too!

88
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,129
-And Five! 
-That’s it!

89
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,092
It’s just like a game of ‘sumo tops’!

90
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:47,013
[Wing] It’s impossible to command 
regular tops to move with precision.

91
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,766
It’s much more likely 
that Gido commands them

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,269
to strike down anything in their way.

93
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,230
They spin around the ring,

94
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,692
striking anything unfortunate enough 
to cross their paths.

95
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,193
Seven!

96
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,904
If the tops aren’t aiming for me,

97
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,781
I don’t have to fear them so much!

98
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,993
I can ignore them 
and attack Gido directly!

99
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,746
[scoffs]

100
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,623
[Gido] You may have figured out my tops,

101
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,334
but you still can’t land an attack on me!

102
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,879
[commentator] There it is!

103
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,840
Gido’s special technique, 
combining offense and defense!

104
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,598
Tornado Top!

105
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,176
[screams]

106
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,805
[commentator] 
Whoa! Gon gets hit with a vicious counter!

107
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,311
Three points!

108
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,855
The judge has awarded 
a critical hit and knockdown!

109
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,732
Gido has nine points!

110
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,817
Gon is on the brink of defeat!

111
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,028
[straining]

112
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,529
[cackling]

113
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,364
[Gido] I turn into a top to protect myself

114
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,617
and let my Dancing Tops 
handle the offense!

115
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,703
It’s a conservative strategy

116
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,414
but it’s effective 
for racking up the points!

117
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,626
[Wing] 
There are a number of ways to defeat Gido.

118
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,421
You can attack him until he tires 
and his Ten begins to fade.

119
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,091
Or you can use Hatsu 
to overpower his defense.

120
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,763
Both of those methods would require 
an extremely large amount of aura.

121
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,098
But Gon doesn’t know Ren yet…

122
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,435
the technique 
for generating aura instantly.

123
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,356
Learning how to create 
large amounts of aura quickly

124
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,441
and how to channel it into attacks...

125
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,569
That requires endless training 
and combat experience

126
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,779
in order to learn.

127
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,364
Gon has neither.

128
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,450
He’d need five more years to fight Gido.

129
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,995
I’m sure that’s beginning to dawn on him.

130
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,707
What should I do?

131
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,337
How am I gonna prolong this match?

132
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,674
If he scores one more point,

133
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,925
it’s over.

134
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,552
But I want to keep fighting!

135
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,472
What can I do right now?

136
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,600
I got it.

137
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,726
[mumbles]

138
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,727
Gon!

139
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,489
[Wing] He released his Ten?!

140
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:11,992
That’s so reckless!

141
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,703
But he didn’t just release it…

142
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,079
That’s…

143
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,622
Zetsu!

144
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,208
The technique 
for concealing your presence!

145
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,712
All the nodes are closed 
and there is no aura!

146
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,090
Even the normal, 
faint leak of aura is closed off,

147
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,217
leaving him no defense against Nen!

148
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,302
I didn’t teach him Zetsu.

149
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,513
Did he learn it before we met?

150
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,390
If that’s the case,

151
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,392
he wouldn’t know that this is Zetsu.

152
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,895
He probably picked it up naturally 
on his own,

153
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,149
just like how beasts in nature 
learn it to hunt their prey!

154
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,237
He certainly has incredible potential.

155
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,575
But why would he use it now… here?

156
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,411
You idiot!

157
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,455
What if you get hit by another Nen attack?

158
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,749
Without protection, 
that’ll totally mess you up!

159
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,375
[Gon] I know that.

160
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,879
But… if I’m gonna track 
the tops’ complex movements

161
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,464
with only feelings to go on,

162
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,425
then I need to focus all of my senses.

163
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,679
Could it be that he never intended 
to win this match?

164
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,182
He’s risking everything…

165
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,559
He’s risking his own life…

166
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,394
to train?!

167
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,022
[cackling]

168
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,774
[Gido] Do you have a death wish, kid?

169
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,860
Then here! Let me give you what you want!

170
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,327
[Gido] What?

171
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,995
[cheering]

172
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,747
[commentator] Amazing!

173
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,084
That’s the first time Gon 
has managed to evade an attack!

174
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,836
[Gon] I can feel them.

175
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,547
I know where they’re heading!

176
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,511
This is all I can do right now.

177
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,807
Just concentrate 
on dodging my opponent’s attacks!

178
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,309
[mumbles]

179
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,238
At least this way I can still fight!

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,795
[Killua] Your right radius and your ulna 
were both broken.

181
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,464
A fractured humerus.

182
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,133
Three broken ribs.

183
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,885
Not to mention 
twelve other minor fractures.

184
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,930
It’ll take four months to heal.

185
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,936
You moron!

186
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,480
Sorry!

187
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,358
[yells] Well, an apology isn’t gonna help!

188
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,485
Don’t you have any brains in there 
at all?!

189
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,113
Didn’t you see what happened 
to all the guys who went through it?

190
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,406
The Nen initiation?

191
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,492
One wrong move and you would have 
ended up like them!

192
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,328
It coulda been a lot worse, 
so you’re lucky.

193
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,205
Man. How come you think

194
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,541
Four-Eyes was training us 
in the first place?

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,793
[Gon] [chuckles nervously] 
Still...

196
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,754
I had a feeling that it’d be okay.

197
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,007
I mean, sure, I took a few hits.

198
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,384
But he missed my vital spots, 
so no big deal.

199
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,385
[groans]

200
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,722
[rasping in pain]

201
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,765
[knocking]

202
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:23,725
Come in!

203
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,269
[Gon exhales in relief]

204
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,067
Oh! Four-Eyes!

205
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,409
[Gon] Uh, I’m sor--

206
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,167
Apologizing to me isn't going to help!

207
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,794
What on earth were you thinking?!

208
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,756
Didn’t you see the ones 
who went through the Nen initiation?

209
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,425
You could easily 
have ended up just like them!

210
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,511
[Killua] 
Yeah. I just told him the same thing.

211
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,431
[Wing sighs]

212
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,060
Honestly…

213
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,187
I’m glad it wasn’t any worse.

214
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,565
[Gon] I’m sorry, Mr. Wing.

215
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,942
I really am.

216
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,986
-I’m not letting this slide. 
-[Gon] Huh?

217
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:21,032
Killua. Do you know when Gon 
will be completely recovered?

218
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,202
The doctor said 
it’d take about two months.

219
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,663
[Wing] I see.

220
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,332
Thanks a lot, Killua.

221
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,167
In that case,

222
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,671
I won’t allow you to participate 
in any matches for two months.

223
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,800
Nor will I allow the study of or training 
in the use of Nen.

224
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,011
If you choose not to abide 
by these conditions,

225
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,806
then you will never 
receive instruction from me again.

226
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,724
Understand?

227
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,061
[Gon] Yes, sir. I’ll do as you say.

228
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,480
Your left hand.

229
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,610
This is a promise thread.

230
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,406
Its purpose is to remind you 
of the promise you made.

231
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,324
Okay.

232
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,493
Killua. A word.

233
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,000
[Wing] So tell me…

234
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,420
what is the true goal 
that you and Gon are pursuing here?

235
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,381
[Killua] 
Well, we don’t really have a goal.

236
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,758
Before we ran into you and Zushi,

237
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,885
I just wanted to earn some quick cash.

238
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,638
Gon wants to beat a guy named Hisoka,

239
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,181
so he’s here to train.

240
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,558
And that’s it.

241
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,978
Everyone on the 200th floor

242
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,896
just wants to reach the top floor.

243
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,566
The Battle Olympia. Right?

244
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,735
Yeah, I’m not too interested.

245
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,029
But Gon, though…

246
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,740
Well… I’m not so sure.

247
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,076
He says he doesn’t care what happens,

248
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,911
as long as he gets to fight Hisoka.

249
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,456
But after yesterday’s match…

250
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,041
I don't know.

251
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,461
I get the feeling 
he just enjoys the thrill.

252
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,963
[cheering]

253
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,429
[commentator] How long this back-and-forth 
is going to go on

254
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,889
is anybody’s guess!

255
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,559
There are nearly fifty tops 
literally flying around the ring!

256
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,813
It's a terrifying whirlwind 
of spinning tops!

257
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,899
But Gon is evading all of them!

258
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,984
With all of his tops already in play,

259
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,570
Gido can only watch with the rest of us!

260
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,117
[yells] No, not that way!

261
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,873
Oh, no! There’s nowhere to run!

262
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,876
[grunts]

263
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,384
[Wing] That situation could very well 
have cost him his life

264
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,178
and he was enjoying it?

265
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,806
[Killua] Yeah. And I would know.

266
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,266
I’ve felt the same way before myself.

267
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,269
But at least I pick and choose my battles.

268
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,397
Once he’s in the zone,

269
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,649
he loses sight of everything else.

270
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,361
Oh! But he’s not the type 
to break the same promise twice,

271
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,487
so don't worry.

272
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,781
[Wing] Oh, dear.

273
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,242
What have I done?

274
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,535
[Killua] It's too late.

275
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,581
We already know all the facts.

276
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,166
Gon and me both.

277
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,546
If you regret teaching us 
and want to back out,

278
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,297
we’ll find somebody else.

279
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,383
Or we’ll simply learn it ourselves.

280
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,469
You don't have to feel responsible.

281
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,013
My brother can use Nen.

282
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,765
Hisoka can, too.

283
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,144
So Gon and I were bound 
to find out about it eventually.

284
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,273
I understand.

285
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,483
I intend to finish what I started.

286
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,695
There are so many more things 
that I have yet to teach you.

287
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,614
Zushi is waiting in my room.

288
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,950
You can train with him, if you’d like.

289
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,789
[Killua] Nah. I’ll pass.

290
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,915
Hm?

291
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,376
I don't want to leave Gon behind.

292
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,379
If he can keep his promise,

293
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,755
we’ll train together.

294
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,926
Give him a message for me, then!

295
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,180
Tell him I will let him 
practice the other ‘Nen’, the flame!

296
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,725
And tell him to work on Ten daily!

297
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,245
Hey, Gon.

298
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,914
[Wing] Master...

299
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,376
It was never my intention, but…

300
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,711
have I…

301
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,298
Have I awoken a terrible monster?

302
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,731
[Zushi] Master?

303
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,159
[Kurapika] What’s going on?

304
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,787
[Rei] You found this agency on your own,

305
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,164
and that tells me you’re pretty sharp.

306
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,333
Even so…

307
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,128
I can’t introduce you 
to our valued clients.

308
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,256
And it’s not because 
of your total lack of experience.

309
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,717
Some of our clients 
don’t seem to mind that.

310
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,802
The thing is...

311
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,054
experience isn’t all you lack.

312
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,264
But what do you mean?

313
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,350
Like I told you, 
I already have a Hunter’s License.

314
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,395
[Rei] Maybe. But your Exam isn’t over yet.

315
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,689
It’s obvious.

316
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,025
Excuse me?

317
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,570
-[Rei] Can you see anything? 
-Huh?

318
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,156
Like next to me, I mean.

319
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,330
Can’t see a thing, can you?

320
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,169
You come back when you can...

321
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,962
and not before.

322
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,923
That’s the minimum requirement here.

323
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,679
What does she mean?

324
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,223
What is it that I can’t see?

325
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,445

[electricity buzzes]

327
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,028
[man] You can’t see it, 
but you can sense it, huh?

328
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,031
-[Killua] Why did you do that? 
-[man] This?

329
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,701
Oh. I was just playing around.

330
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,160
[thunder]

331
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,412
This must be fate,

332
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,872
us crossing paths. Y’think?

333
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,624
Try to think of this as...

334
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,085
a little bit of friendly advice 
from a senior.

335
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,424
You didn’t notice when I stole this,

336
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,051
or when I walked right past you, either.

337
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,594
You’re totally clueless.

338
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,140
Bastard! 
Give me back my license right now!

339
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,852
Does a newbie who knows nothing of Nen

340
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,896
have a chance of beating me?

341
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,481
Nen, eh?

342
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,068
[smirks]

343
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,653
[thunder]

344
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,114
Wanna give it a try?

345
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,365
[rain]

346
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,833
[Kurapika panting]

347
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,586
Do you get it now?

348
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,547
There’s something important 
you still lack.

349
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,343
[Kurapika] [grunts] I...

350
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,472
I need...

351
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,309
[shouts] 
I need enough power to fight on my own!

352
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,609
[man] Come with me.

353
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,821
I’ll teach you.

354
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,619
The real exam has just begun.

355
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,712
[narrator] Gon’s hidden potential 
is beginning to awaken.

356
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,299
And Kurapika 
has also encountered a new power.

357
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,552
One that he hopes 
will help propel him forward.

358
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,306
[theme song playing]

359
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,207
[Gon] Coming up:

360
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,584
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

361
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,252
[both] Hunterpedia!

362
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,503
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

363
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,046
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

364
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,507
Today, we're introducing 
the Hunter Agency!

365
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,634
This place helps pro Hunters find work,

366
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,596
but it was really hard for Kurapika 
to find the office that he visited.

367
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,557
Gotta find the agency 
before you qualify as a pro Hunter.

368
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,520
[Gon] Next time:

369
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,855
Destiny x and x Tenacity.

370
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,940
[Killua] 
I wonder who Four-Eyes is, anyway?

371
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,902
[Gon] Hmm... 
I wonder who the Floor Masters are.

372
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,069
[Killua gasps]

373
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,404
[Killua and Gon] Could it be?!
