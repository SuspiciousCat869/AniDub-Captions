knuckle: Looks like

71
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:41,308
180 aura is simply a numerical
expression of life energy.

72
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,411
Aura accumulates in the body,

73
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,948
and your maximum aura output
potential, or m.O.P.,

74
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,083
varies according
to your training.

75
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,053
Also there is a limit

76
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,323
to how much aura
you can release at one time,

77

which can be increased through
an intense training regimen.

78
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,294
So your p.O.P.,

79
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:04,298
the potential aura output power
inside you, doesn’t matter.

80
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,234
If you haven’t trained enough
to increase your a.O.P.,

81

the actual aura output power,

82
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,205

Get it, fool?

84
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:17,811
it seems to me
the Max aura output potential

85
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:22,283
you can use through Ken
is about 1,800 aura.

86
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,318
when you’re
preparing for battle,

87
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:29,289
you usually expend approximately
one aura for every second.

88
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:34,061
once in combat,
as you use gyo, ryu, Ken,

89
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:37,497
all highly advanced techniques
that use a lot of nen,

90
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:41,535
your rate of expended aura
increases by six to ten times.

91
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,906
The stronger your technique,
the more aura you use up.

92
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,841
Got that, fool?

93
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,144
But your aura control’s
still weak,

94
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,947
so you’re burning up
ten aura every second.

95
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:57,251
that’s 600 aura gone
for every minute of battle.

96
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:01,288
Think back to yesterday’s fight.
You ran out in 20 minutes.

97
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,124
That means in an ordinary
one-on-one fight,

98
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,459
you used up 12,000 aura.

four times!

101
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:15,335
your a.O.P.
Is around 1,800 aura,

102
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,071
but at the exact moment

103
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,273
that you yelled, "jan,"
to activate the attack

104
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:23,010
the aura focused
in your fist was over 2,000.

105
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,280
That’s due to its long windup,

106
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,148
as well
as your defensive sacrifice,

107
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:31,385
both of which are done
to focus aura in your fist.

108
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,086
A special provision
covers such risks

109
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,489
that are often attributed
to special attacks.

110
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,992
You spent around 5,500 aura

111
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,229
in your first three uses
of jajanken alone.

112
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:46,500
That puts your total
consumed aura at 17,500.

( Gon whimpers )

Knuckle: As for the fourth shot,

115
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:54,308
right before your "round 2" hit,
you ran out of energy.

116
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,013
Actually following through
with the technique

117
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,782
uses twice
the activation amount,

118
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,252
which means you used
about 4,000 aura.

119
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:09,156
the amount of aura used
is the same for rock and paper.

120
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,091
however,
paper falls into a category

121
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,859
that you haven’t practiced much,

122
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:17,197
so you used up 4,000 aura
on a weak attack,

123
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,366
one that probably
only had the strength

124

of a 500-aura attack.

125
