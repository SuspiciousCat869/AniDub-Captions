1
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,180
Guess I’ll play dumb.

2
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:14,848
That’s right.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,642
He seems to like Gon,

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,143
so he might help us.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,979
-[Gon] Hey! 
-[Killua] You idiot!

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,650
Oh, yeah! Oops…

7
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,109
What?

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,945
Do you know someone here?

9
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,447
Uh… no…

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,033
Hey!

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,785
It’s that girl we met!

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,287
[Phinks] Is that true, Shizuku? 
You know these guys?

13
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,581
No. I sure don’t.

14
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,582
[Killua] Huh?

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,210
[Feitan] Oh… I remember now.

16
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,337
The kid who arm wrestles.

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,130
Refresh my memory.

18
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,465
That kid.

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,218
You lost to him 
in an arm-wrestling contest two days ago.

20
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,220
I did? He beat me?

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,596
That’s a lie!

22
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,474
I’m not the strongest, 
but I wouldn’t lose to a kid…

23
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,725
Well...

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,186
It’s because you were using 
your right hand.

25
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,730
I did? But why? I’m left handed.

26
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,940
[Feitan] Don't bother.

27
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,735
Once she has forgotten something, 
it is gone for good.

28
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,780
Right. Never mind, guess I was mistaken.

29
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:12,823
Thought so.

30
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,950
Hold on. Is that right?

31
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,618
You really beat Shizuku?

32
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,619
Yeah.

33
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,622
I never would have imagined 
that she was a Phantom Troupe member.

34
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,001
Okay. Then show me what you’ve got.

35
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,051
[theme song playing]

36
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:49,670
ALLY x AND x SWORD

37
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,964
[Nobunaga] One more time.

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,928
Ready…

39
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,179
Go.

40
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,348
[straining]

41
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,985
All right, one more time.

42
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:18,824
Ready…

43
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,617
Go.

44
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,619
[straining]

45
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,748
So...

46
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,252
How do I stack up 
against all the other Spiders?

47
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,795
Be honest.

48
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,298
Probably seventh or eighth, I’d guess.

49
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,552
Well you aren’t the weakest 
but not the strongest, either.

50
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,011
Right.

51
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,765
The strongest member of the Troupe 
was this guy called Uvogin.

52
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,477
But it’s starting to look like 
the chain user killed him.

53
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,647
We told you! 
We have no clue who that is!

54
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,982
[Nobunaga] Hey, kid!

55
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,986
Speak without my permission again…

56
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,613
and I’ll kill you.

57
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,202
Now, one more time.

58
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,413
Ready…

59
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,331
Go.

60
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,754
Uvogin was an Enhancer.

61
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,175
He was simple-minded, straightforward, 
and he loved a good fight.

62
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,926
And punctual.

63
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,762
A real stickler about time.

64
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,805
Whenever Franklin or I were late,

65
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,599
he’d always start something.

66
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,853
He beat the crap out of me 
more than once, I can tell ya!

67
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,357
I’ve known him since 
before the Troupe was founded.

68
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,777
I know him better than anyone.

69
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,863
He would never...

70
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,656
I mean never

71
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,284
lose in a fair fight, do you hear me?

72
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,120
Not unless he was caught 
in some dirty trap!

73
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,458
I’ll make his killer pay.

74
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,004
I’ll find him, 
no matter who I have to kill.

75
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,008
The chain user holds 
some kind of grudge against us -

76
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,468
a strong one.

77
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,471
The Mafia’s Nostrade family 
hired him recently.

78
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,307
[Killua] A grudge against the Troupe…

79
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,684
A recent hire? [gasps]

80
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,812
You may not know him personally

81
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,814
but maybe you heard rumors…

82
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,690
So, think hard, all right?

83
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,860
You’d better not hold anything back!

84
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,612
I don’t know him.

85
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,489
But even if I did,

86
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,950
I would still never give him up to you!

87
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,703
I thought you were all 
a bunch of cold-blooded monsters

88
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,748
but I see you can shed tears 
for your friends.

89
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,211
So, you’re capable of empathy.

90
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,838
But you’ve killed...

91
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,923
you’ve killed so many people!

92
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,008
Why couldn’t you feel that for them?

93
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,802
[yells] What the hell is wrong with you?!

94
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,853
[seething]

95
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,898
Careful. You’re too cocky.

96
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,441
[grunt of pain]

97
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,651
Gon!

98
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,286
Move and I’ll cut you.

99
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,538
[Feitan] Answer the question.

100
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,332
Do you know who the chain user is?

101
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,959
I told you!

102
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,545
I’m not telling you anything, 
so get off me!

103
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,088
[Feitan smirks]

104
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,299
[Nobunaga] Feitan.

105
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,676
Stop it.

106
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,469
[Feitan] Stop what?

107
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,431
Stop doing what you’re just about to do.

108
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,226
[Feitan] Oh? You think you know 
what I’m about to do?

109
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,478
You’re going to break his arm, aren’t you?

110
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,772
I’d start with a finger…

111
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,524
peel off a nail.

112
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,359
Doesn’t matter.

113
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,486
I told you to stop it!

114
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,196
You’re giving me orders?

115
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,073
I don’t have to obey.

116
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,586
Hey, quit it, Nobunaga.

117
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,297
What, have you 
already forgotten the rules?

118
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,300
There’s no physical fighting 
between the Troupe members.

119
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,052
I know, I know.

120
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,888
Disputes are decided by a coin toss.

121
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,018
[Feitan] Tails.

122
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,436
[Nobunaga] Then I’m heads.

123
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,192
It’s heads.

124
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,485
So, let him go.

125
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,950
[Shizuku] Well, what do we do with them?

126
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,411
They haven’t told us 
anything about the chain user.

127
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,623
If they don’t know anything, 
then just let ‘em go.

128
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,541
Am I right, Pakunoda?

129
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,877
[Pakunoda] I checked on the trip here.

130
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,837
It’s true.

131
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,131
They really don’t know anything.

132
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,968
-[Machi] You sure? 
-I am.

133
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,221
They have no memories 
of the chain user whatsoever.

134
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,141
Looks like your hunch 
was a little off this time, huh?

135
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,685
That’s bizarre…

136
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,313
Oh well. If Pakunoda says so, 
it must be true.

137
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,242
Hey, Gon.

138
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,703
Did they do anything to you 
on the way here?

139
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,455
Not really. Just asked me some questions.

140
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,790
Thought so.

141
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,751
[Killua] So she examined us 
without us knowing.

142
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,253
What was it?

143
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,629
And how?

144
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,465
It sounds like 
they all have a lot of faith

145
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,592
in that Pakunoda woman’s 
judgment.

146
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,722
Her skill must be 
more accurate than instinct.

147
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,184
[Pakunoda] They have no memories 
of the chain user whatsoever.

148
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,519
[Killua] Memories?

149
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,771
How about you?

150
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,773
Have any guesses?

151
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,900
[Killua] The power 
to scan someone’s memory!

152
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,819
By what, touching them?

153
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,572
That would explain everything.

154
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,490
We’re in big trouble.

155
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,076
When she scanned us before,

156
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,579
I had no idea who the chain user was.

157
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,164
But now…

158
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,915
I have an image in my head.

159
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,085
If she checks again...

160
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,380
[Franklin] They don’t know the chain user.

161
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,549
so can’t we just let them go now?

162
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,969
[Shalnark] Yeah. I really don’t see 
the point in keeping them here.

163
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,681
[Phinks] No. We can’t be sure 
they’re completely unrelated.

164
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,892
It’s possible they’re being used.

165
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,394
The chain user is discreet.

166
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,396
He usually keeps his chains hidden.

167
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,106
If that’s the case,

168
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,901
maybe they don’t realize he’s 
who we’re talking about.

169
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,903
We shouldn’t release them.

170
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,363
Not until they tell us 
who they’re working for.

171
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,449
If they are working for someone,

172
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,367
then it isn’t the chain user.

173
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,912
Because he prefers 
to operate all by himself.

174
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,664
[Machi] So, you’re saying 
you agree with Nobunaga?

175
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,376
We can get whatever information we need 
from the Nostrade family.

176
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,545
We don’t really need these kids for that.

177
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,589
After all…

178
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,925
we know the chain user is a member.

179
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,885
That’s right, we do.

180
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,805
Our only target right now 
is the chain user,

181
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,974
so we can pretty much ignore 
everybody else.

182
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,476
[Feitan] There you go.

183
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,685
You are lucky.

184
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,939
[Nobunaga] Not just yet.

185
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,443
I’m not letting the kid go.

186
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,655
You wanna join the Spiders?

187
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,533
Team up with me.

188
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,326
No.

189
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,662
I would rather die 
than team up with you guys!

190
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,455
So, it’s never gonna happen!

191
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,165
[laughing]

192
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,000
He really hates us, doesn’t he?

193
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,461
What are you? 
You’re an Enhancer, right?

194
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,713
Yeah, and what if I am?

195
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,632
I thought you’d say that.

196
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,925
[chuckling]

197
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,010
[laughter]

198
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,557
[Nobunaga] Hey!

199
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,226
We’re keeping them here 
until the Boss gets back.

200
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,895
I’m nominating him.

201
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,480
Are you serious?

202
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,024
[Feitan] The Boss will never agree 
to that.

203
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,944
[Machi] Fine, whatever.

204
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,696
But you’ve gotta babysit ‘em.

205
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,949
It’s on you if they escape.

206
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,956
[Shizuku] Really? He reminds you of Uvo?

207
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,209
Yeah. He wears all his emotions 
right on his sleeve.

208
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,837
And when he’s mad, 
he forgets about the consequences.

209
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,006
But what’s the most like Uvo,

210
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,342
is he’s at his absolute strongest 
when he’s fighting for someone else.

211
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,053
He liked to fight alone

212
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,264
but Uvo was never more powerful

213
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,808
than when he would go off 
and team up with Nobunaga

214
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,393
to fight an entire horde.

215
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,854
He never admitted it,

216
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,691
but I think Uvo preferred 
having someone there to protect.

217
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,652
[Shizuku] He was stronger 
when someone was holding him back?

218
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,905
[Franklin] I guess you could say that…

219
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,657
[Feitan] She does not mince words, 
does she?

220
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,867
On the other hand,

221
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,453
Nobunaga’s skills 
are excellent for dueling.

222
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,623
You might even say 
that they’re only effective one-on-one.

223
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,085
Whenever those two had to fight together, 
they would always complain.

224
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,796
But I’m pretty sure they both enjoyed it.

225
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,924
[Shalnark] Okay. Enough reminiscing.

226
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,592
Let’s get down to business.

227
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,762
Here’s a full list 
of the Nostrade family members.

228
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,431
I got it straight 
from the official Hunter website.

229
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,934
These five are especially important.

230
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,270
They serve as full time bodyguards 
for the Boss’s daughter.

231
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,440
Not to mention the fact 
that they’re the ones who captured Uvo.

232
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,778
But Uvo was certain 
that the chain user wasn’t on this list.

233
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,322
And since we have no idea 
what he looks like,

234
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,658
we’re going to need 
to find someone who does.

235
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,118
Hey. That’s the guy I killed.

236
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,663
The one on the top left. 
You can cross him off.

237
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,915
[Shalnark] All right pair up 
and search the area.

238
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,541
And keep a sharp eye out

239
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,585
for any of the people 
that are on this list.

240
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,046
We’ll all meet back here at ten p.m.

241
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,881
Got it? Let’s move.

242
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,467
[Machi] Hey, hold on!

243
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,803
Nobunaga’s staying here, right?

244
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,845
What about me?

245
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,807
You can just team up with whoever is left.

246
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,602
[light chuckle]

247
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,356
[resigned sigh]

248
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,862
Ow…

249
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,198
[Killua] That was stupid of me…

250
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,783
If I’d made a move,

251
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,327
Hisoka would’ve killed me 
without a second thought.

252
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,080
That murderous aura…

253
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,873
I was paralyzed.

254
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,084
If they’d threatened to kill Gon,

255
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,961
would I have been able to stop them?

256
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,880
Would I have even been able to move?

257
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,382
[Illumi] You can’t do it, can you?

258
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,510
Because deep down inside,

259
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,970
you’re more worried about

260
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,014
whether you can defeat me 
than anything else.

261
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,348
[Killua] You’re wrong!!

262
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,018
Remember the lesson I drilled into you?

263
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,479
Never go up against a superior opponent.

264
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,148
No, you’re wrong!

265
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,697
[scoffs] Pretty scary.

266
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,950
If looks could kill, huh?

267
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,995
I should warn you…

268
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,081
Step into range and I’ll cut you down.

269
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,877
Killua!

270
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,559
[Killua - shallow breathing]

271
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,705
[Killua] I don’t stand a chance 
against him.

272
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,124
I’ve gotta think of a way to escape…

273
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,710
No windows…

274
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,129
and only one exit.

275
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,509
How are we supposed to get him 
to move away from the door?

276
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,057
Hey, I wonder if Leorio is okay.

277
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,727
I really hope he was able 
to get a hold of Mister Zepile…

278
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,730
Killua? You okay?

279
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,732
Yeah.

280
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,781
Let’s see……

281
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:11,202
Mister Zepile taught us cauterization, 
autopsy and something else.

282
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,829
Remember what it was?

283
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,247
I forgot.

284
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,457
Was it osmosis, maybe?

285
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,293
I don’t think it was, 
but I just don’t know…

286
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,628
[Killua] Gon.

287
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,381
I’ll be the decoy.

288
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,924
Wait for it

289
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,509
and then try to escape.

290
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,011
What are you talking about?

291
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,721
[Nobunaga] Look, seriously…

292
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,140
forget all about it.

293
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,227
You’re good enough to recognize 
the difference in our abilities.

294
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,646
You won’t catch me off guard.

295
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,690
I know that already!

296
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,777
This room has one exit 
and nowhere to hide.

297
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,238
He can see everything we’re doing.

298
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,616
He can even keep an eye on us 
without ever creating an opening.

299
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,078
He’s probably an Iaido master,

300
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,621
and with his shodachi,

301
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,373
his range is twice mine.

302
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,625
One step too close

303
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,127
and I’m dead meat.

304
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,629
But that’s what gives it meaning!

305
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,007
[Illumi] You can’t do it, can you?

306
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,426
Shut up, all right?!

307
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,637
The only way I’ll find out is if I try!

308
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,101
Killua, what are you thinking about doing?

309
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,146
[Killua] I’ll stop his shodachi, 
even if it kills me.

310
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,606
When I do,

311
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,940
you run away!

312
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,359
[Gon angered grunt]

313
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,402
Huh?

314
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,446
[yells] What the hell was that for, huh?!

315
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,907
-Stop being so selfish! 
-Huh?

316
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,826
Don’t talk about dying 
like it’s no big deal?!

317
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,163
Why not? You did! 
You said the same thing earlier!

318
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,748
I’m allowed to!

319
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,249
But you’re not, do you hear me?!

320
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,584
Huh?

321
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,753
[Nobunaga laughing]

322
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,963
Reason never works on an Enhancer.

323
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,673
I thought you knew that, kid!

324
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,134
We can’t escape 
unless we’re prepared to die,

325
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,552
you stupid little jerk!

326
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,513
You don’t know what I was thinking!

327
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,640
So, tell me, who’s the selfish one now?!

328
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,267
No! I don’t know! 
‘Cause I’m stupid!

329
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,478
[hearty laughter]

330
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,980
You two kids are hilarious, you know that?

331
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,274
Listen I’m not gonna hurt you.

332
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,859
Just behave yourselves.

333
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,070
I know you guys mean business, all right?

334
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,447
Don’t throw your lives away.

335
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,909
Sit tight and wait 
until the Boss gets back.

336
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,744
And if you don’t strike his fancy,

337
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,579
you get to leave, free and clear.

338
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,041
But try to escape and I’ll kill you.

339
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,044
Make me draw my sword from its scabbard

340
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,463
and you won’t survive to talk about it.

341
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,341
[Gon] Oh!

342
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,134
I remember now!

343
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,761
The other one is ostomy!

344
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,972
Cauterization, autopsy…

345
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,474
and the last one’s ostomy!

346
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,020
Do you remember now?

347
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,356
Yeah! I just wish 
I’d thought of it sooner!

348
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,482
Right?

349
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,318
I can’t believe we both 
forgot something so simple!

350
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,653
What?

351
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,739
Now that we’ve figured that out…

352
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,366
Let's go!

353
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,118
Are you serious?

354
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,078
You know you’re going to die.

355
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,039
I’m not nearly skilled or merciful enough

356
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,208
to temper my strength to face you.

357
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,629
You fools!

358
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,469
[Gon] If the exit is blocked…

359
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,014
[Killua] ...you’ve just gotta 
make your own!

360
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,474
[Nobunaga] The wall…

361
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,394
Which one do I chase?

362
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,146
We’re on the fifth floor.

363
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,607
The cat-eyed kid’s already by the stairs.

364
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,775
So, the black-haired kid!

365
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,405
There. Now he doesn’t have 
anywhere to run.

366
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,617
What am I thinking?

367
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,244
They can keep 
breaking through walls to escape!

368
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,874
The cat-eyed kid is below.

369
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,043
I’ll stay on the black-haired one.

370
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,881
Where is he?

371
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,799
The walls are intact.

372
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,051
So’s the door.

373
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,094
Killua! Are you there?

374
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,431
[Killua] Yeah! I’m here!

375
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,642
That’s it!

376
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,977
Then that must mean the last hole…

377
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,354
was a decoy!

378
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,230
He busted the wall,

379
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,609
then doubled back and hid 
in the next room, so I’d pass him!

380
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,529
We can beat him. The two of us!

381
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,535
His presence disappeared.

382
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,828
Zetsu?

383
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,123
Does this idiot really want to fight me?

384
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,670
An advanced application of Ten and Ren…

385
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,506
En!

386
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,925
Aura envelops the body

387
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,261
in a layer a few millimeters 
to a couple centimeters thick.

388
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,556
But with En, you can extend it 
as far as necessary.

389
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,976
You can sense anyone who enters your En.

390
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,563
Inside it you can even count the leaves 
as they fall.

391
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,527
You can conceal your presence 
before your approach,

392
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,070
never making a sound.

393
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,116
But enter my En and my sword flies.

394
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,993
Come. I’m ready.

395
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,038
[Killua] That idiot.

396
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,208
Man. I really wanted to beat that guy up.

397
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,918
Yeah, fat chance of that.

398
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,045
He’d kill you twice before you tried.

399
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,964
[Gon] You sure about that?

400
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,383
[Killua] We only know the basics of Nen.

401
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,135
We wouldn’t stand a chance.

402
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,761
[chuckles]

403
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,138
What’s so funny?

404
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,348
You’re back to being your old self again!

405
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,517
It’s my job to be reckless…

406
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,311
and it’s your job to stay cool 
and keep me in line!

407
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,521
[light derisive snort]

408
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,189
Glad I can count on ya, pal!

409
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,566
You’re being selfish!

410
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,235
[Gon] Well? What do we do next?

411
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,071
[Killua] Depends on what 
we wanna do, I guess.

412
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,741
Okay. I wanna kick their butts!

413
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,783
Figured.

414
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,453
Well, that’s not too different 
from the original plan.

415
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,414
But both of us’ll need to improve our Nen,

416
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,458
if that’s what we decide we’re gonna do.

417
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,753
There’s only one way we might get 
as strong as we’ll need to

418
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,337
and that’s Nen.

419
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,966
And the fastest way

420
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,384
is through Kurapika.

421
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,969
We need to go ask him.

422
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,512
[Gon] Huh? Why?

423
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,515
[Killua] Because he’s the “chain user” 
who defeated their friend

424
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,058
and got us into this mess.

425
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,226
[Gon] What?

426
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,145
[Killua] Wait, you hadn’t figured 
that out yet?

427
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,980
[Gon] You really think it’s Kurapika?

428
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:14,857
I’m pretty sure it is.

429
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,317
And if I’m right,

430
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,735
we still have a chance.

431
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,906
You and I both started learning Nen 
at around the same time Kurapika did.

432
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,491
What we need to do now

433
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,868
is learn the unique abilities 
that fit our talents.

434
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,162
But what’s even more important…

435
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,457
we’ve got to gain the strength 
we’ll need to face the Phantom Troupe.

436
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,586
And you really think Kurapika’s the key 
to finding the answers we’re looking for?

437
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:36,879
Yeah.

438
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,554
[narrator] Meanwhile, deep in 
the troubled heart of Yorknew City

439
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,557
a fearsome storm has begun to brew.

440
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,102
[theme song playing]

441
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,169
[Gon] Coming up:

442
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,671
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

443
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,172
[both] Hunterpedia!

444
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,841
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

445
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,676
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

446
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,094
Today, we’ll introduce Franklin.

447
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,722
He’s an Emitter 
and a Phantom Troupe member!

448
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,308
His Double Machine Gun attack 
shoots Nen bullets.

449
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,935
Use your fingers as guns 
for an extra punch!

450
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,145
Pew, pew, pew!

451
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,945
[Gon] Next time: 
"A x Brutal x Battlefield."

452
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,405
-Out. 
-[Killua] Out?

453
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:27,740
[Gon] Outfield!

454
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,116
[Gon and Killua] Infield!
