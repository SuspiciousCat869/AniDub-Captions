1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:02,628
[Kurapika] 
This country's open to tourists.

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,421
That's where Killua is?

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,132
It'll take three days to reach by airship.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,301
When do you think we should leave?

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,095
-Today! Right now! 
-Alright! I'm with Gon.

6
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,640
Got it. I'll order the tickets then.

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,561
[theme music playing]

8
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:51,028
[Killua] 
I'm from a family of assassins, so yeah,

9
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,988
they're all in the business of murder.

10
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:58,118
And my entire family, 
they've got real high hopes for me.

11
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,204
But y'know, I can't stand it.

12
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,583
Who wants their whole life mapped out 
for them?

13
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,297
Killua...

14
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,344
So, what's the deal 
with the long face, Gon?

15
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,679
By tomorrow, we'll be in Padokea.

16
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,931
You'll see Killua soon.

17
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,183
Yup!

18
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,523
[Gon] We'll definitely bring Killua 
back with us!

19
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:33,695
A x DANGEROUS x WATCHDOG

20
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:42,663
[narrator] Gon, Leorio, and Kurapika 
have arrived in the Dentora region

21
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,375
of the Republic of Padokea, 
which Killua calls home.

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,345
[Leorio] I can almost see it. 
So that's where the assassins' base is?

23
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,766
-It looks kind of creepy, doesn't it? 
-[Kurapika] It does.

24
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,769
Once we arrive, 
we should gather information.

25
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,770
[Leorio] Okay.

26
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,357
[Shopkeeper] Kukuroo Mountain...

27
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,777
You'll want to take 
the scenic mountain bus tour over there.

28
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,864
It only runs once a day, but you'll have 
a guide to show you around.

29
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,246
[tour guide] I'd like to thank all of you 
for choosing Lamentation Tours.

30
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,623
It's an honor to have you here.

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,545
Now, get ready, because we'll be making 
our way up to Kukuroo Mountain,

32
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,090
home to the Zoldyck family of assassins.

33
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,092
Check it out.

34
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,598
No way those guys are tourists.

35
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,935
-True. 
-[tour guide] Okay, everyone!

36
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,479
If you'll all look out the window 
to your right...

37
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,480
[Gon gasps]

38
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,985
...you'll see Kukuroo Mountain 
where the Zoldyck family lives.

39
00:03:55,777 --> 00:04:00,490
It's 3,722-meter high, 
and it's surrounded by forest.

40
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,244
The Zoldyck estate is rumored to be 
somewhere on the mountain.

41
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,913
although no one has ever actually seen it.

42
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,792
The Zoldyck family consists 
of ten members:

43
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:16,590
Mother and Father, five siblings, 
grandparents and great-grandfather,

44
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,050
all of whom are assassins!

45
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:24,639
Alright, now hold on, while we get 
a little closer to the mountain.

46
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,481
Would you look at that...

47
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,151
This is the front gate 
of the Zoldyck estate.

48
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,488
No one who's entered 
has ever returned alive,

49
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,325
which has earned this gate the nickname 
"the Door to Hades."

50
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,121
To enter, you have to go through the door 
by the security checkpoint.

51
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:52,334
But beyond that is private property, 
so this is as far as we can go.

52
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,755
[Leorio] Hold on! This is the front gate? 
The mountain is all the way over there!

53
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:02,302
That's right. The Zoldyck family 
own Kukuroo Mountain, every inch of it,

54
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,096
not to mention all the surrounding land.

55
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,767
So, what you're telling me 
is this is their front yard?

56
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,977
-Miss Tour Guide? 
-Yes?

57
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,022
What are we gonna have to do 
to get inside?

58
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,527
Hmm. Oh, dear. 
You were paying attention, right?

59
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,612
Yeah, but you didn't say--

60
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,615
If you go inside, 
you'll never come out again!

61
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,617
It's an assassins' hideout.

62
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,578
-It's a sham. 
-Huh?

63
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,748
A family of assassins 
no one's ever seen?

64
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,125
If we can just snap a picture of them,

65
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,962
we're gonna get a hundred million 
in reward money.

66
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:41,174
Are you kidding me? Damn it! 
I should have taken a picture of Killua!

67
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,175
[both groan]

68
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,346
They probably rely on the mystique 
to protect them.

69
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,224
I bet the truth is a whole lot 
less interesting.

70
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,186
Huh?

71
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,396
[yells]

72
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,817
-Open up the gate! 
-I'm afraid I can't.

73
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,736
The master of the house would not approve 
of such a thing.

74
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,572
Don't worry about that.

75
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,908
We kinda figured 
we'd kill your master anyway.

76
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,328
[sighs]

77
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,250
[guard grunts]

78
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,295
-[moans] 
-Are you okay?

79
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,300
-Yes, I'll be alright. 
-[gate creaking open]

80
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:28,763
Oh, darn! The master hates it 
when Mike snacks between meals.

81
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,851
-What? 
-[men yelling]

82
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,196
[all gasp]

83
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,282
[all yelp]

84
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,496
[screams]

85
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,999
[everyone clamoring]

86
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,211
[guard] Well, damn it.

87
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,049
Mike's only supposed to eat 
at designated times.

88
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,467
Mike!

89
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,511
Don't blame those extra pounds on me!

90
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,847
What was that thing?

91
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:23,526
Hey, you guys! What are you doing? 
Time to get back on the bus!

92
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,239
Go ahead without us 
'cause we're all staying here.

93
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,491
What?

94
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,419
[guard] I see.

95
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,798
So, you're young Master Killua's friends, 
are you?

96
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,466
Happy to hear it.

97
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:51,388
I've worked here for the past 20 years, 
and to the best of my recollection,

98
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,683
you three are the first friends 
who've ever come to visit.

99
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,648
Now, I probably shouldn't be telling you 
this, seeing as how I work here,

100
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,902
but this place is pretty lonely. 
No one ever really visits.

101
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,991
Well, except those types. 
We get our fair share of those. [chuckles]

102
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,453
But a family of assassins 
is bound to be unusual.

103
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,789
I guess that's the price 
they have to pay.

104
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,084
Oh, well. Anyways, 
I'm so glad you're here.

105
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,586
-Thank you for coming. 
-Don't mention it.

106
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,005
However...

107
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,801
That doesn't mean I'm going to be able 
to let any of you inside.

108
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,765
You saw it earlier, didn't you? 
How huge the beast's arm was?

109
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,062
That arm belongs to Mike. 
It's the Zoldycks' watchdog.

110
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,816
It only obeys the family 
and attacks everyone else.

111
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:50,697
As a matter of fact, it's still following 
the order its master gave ten years ago...

112
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,119
To kill every single intruder 
who tries to get inside.

113
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,374
I guess he isn't following it technically 
because he keeps eating them.

114
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,626
[laughs]

115
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,463
But, like I was saying, 
I can't let you in.

116
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,923
I wouldn't want friends 
of young Master Killua

117
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:13,511
being stripped down to their skeletons. 
[laughs]

118
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,473
Question. How is it that you're safe here?

119
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,393
-Hmm? 
-It's just, you can go inside.

120
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,896
and if you were never allowed to go in,

121
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,273
it's unlikely 
that you would be given a key.

122
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,276
Hmm, that's very perceptive,

123
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,863
but the fact is, 
you're only about half right.

124
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,492
See, I don't need a key to get inside.

125
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,204
This key was specially made 
for intruders only.

126
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,372
There's a key for intruders?

127
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,417
Almost all of them 
go right for the front gate.

128
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,755
About 90 percent. 
I couldn't begin to tell you why, though.

129
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,092
If I don't open the gate for them,

130
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,012
every time without fail, 
they try to break it down.

131
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,389
They're real troublemakers, these types.

132
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,852
That's why we added a locked door 
to one side. It works pretty well.

133
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,899
They just take the key from the poor, 
helpless security guard,

134
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,652
and then Mike eats them. 
It's as simple as that.

135
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,654
[Kurapika] A locked door?

136
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,905
That's it!

137
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,285
As you just realized, 
I'm not a security guard.

138
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,372
I'm just the janitor 
who cleans up after Mike,

139
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,416
So, the front gate isn't actually locked 
after all.

140
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,961
-Exactly. 
-What?

141
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:35,260

143
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,083
I've pushed and pulled 
but it won't budge!

144
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,085
Are you sure the gate isn't locked?

145
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,796
[guard] 
I'm afraid you're just not strong enough.

146
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,716
Shut up! I was giving it 
everything I've got!

147
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,804
Step back and watch.

148
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,187
This gate is officially known 
as the Testing Gate,

149

00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,337
[door thuds shut]

155
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,548
So, you can see that the door 
closes automatically,

156
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,384
so you'll want to slip inside 
as soon as it opens.

157
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,346
And you won't need to worry about Mike.

158
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,934
He has strict orders not to attack anyone 
who enters through the Testing Gate.

159
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:10,813
Whew. The older I get, 
the tougher this seems to become.

160
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,399
But they'll fire me 
if I can't open the gate,

161
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,734
so, I need to stay fit.

162
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,572
And I should mention, 
the first doors weigh two tons each.

163
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,243
What? You're really not supposed 
to be able to...

164
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,161
Wait, what did you say?

165
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,249
-Did you say the first doors? 
-Yeah, take a look.

166
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,710
There are seven doors in all.

167
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:37,674
And keep in mind that each set is twice 
as heavy as the set of doors before it.

168
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,841
[Leorio] Twice?

169
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,220
The more force you put into it, 
the more doors you open.

170
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,847
Gotta be pretty strong 
to get through all of them.

171
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,602
Incidentally, when young Master Killua 
returned to the estate,

172
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,522
he opened three of them, just like that.

173
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,109
Three? That's like...12 tons!

174
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,988
-It's 16 tons, Gon. 
-[laughs]

175
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,948
[guard] Starting to get it now?

176
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,701
This is what it takes 
just to get through the door.

177
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,328
They live in a completely different world.

178
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,958
[Gon] I don't like that. 
May I borrow the key?

179
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:17,088
I didn't come all this way to be tested. 
I came so I could see my friend.

180
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,382
Think of me as an intruder.

181
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,010
So please, let me borrow the key.

182
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,512
and I'll go in there 
through the intruder's door.

183
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,681
-Gon! 
-Hey.

184
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,726
Lend it to me, or don't, 
but I'm getting in.

185
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,811
I'll climb the wall if I have to.

186
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,606
[Leorio] Don't be stupid, Gon! 
Didn't you see that terrifying monster?

187
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,360
Its forearm was bigger than 
your whole body times two!

188
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,945
I told you, I don't like this!

189
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,782
Why test your friends? It's crazy!

190
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,702
There's no way 
I'm ever going through that door.

191
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,123
You're right, but if you think 
you can force your way in, think again.

192
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:56,210
It's absolutely impossible. 
Mike will definitely kill you.

193
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,129
I have to agree with you.

194
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,924
We have the time, 
so let's find a way to use the first door.

195
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,097
No use.

196
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,558
He won't change his mind 
when he's like this.

197
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,934
Yes, you're right.

198
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,189
[sighs] I'm sorry to say this, 
but I can't let you have the key.

199
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,485
I won't feed young Master Killua's friends 
to Mike. I can't do it.

200
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,736
Guess I don't have it in me.

201
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,906
But would you wait here 
for a minute, please?

202
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,828
[dial tone]

203
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,289
[guard] Hello, this is Zebro.

204
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:38,836
Sorry to call. It's just that three 
of young Master Killua's friends are here

205
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,922
and they would very much like to see him.

206
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,384
Yes. Yes, I'm sorry. Of course.

207
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:49,764
Yes, I understand. Yes. Yes. 
I'm so very sorry to disturb you.

208
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:55,561
-Yeah, I figured I would get yelled at. 
-You called up to the house for us?

209
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,440
No, I was speaking 
with the Zoldyck family's butler.

210
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:03,319
All communication with the mansion 
has to go through the butler first.

211
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,489
It's not easy 
to reach the family members directly.

212
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,285
Could you get him on the phone again? 
I'd like to talk to him this time.

213
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:16,249
Well, I suppose I can, but I guarantee 
that you're not going to enjoy it.

214
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,876
[pressing buttons]

215
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,964
[butler] 
You've reached the butler's quarters.

216
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,259
My name is Gon, and I'm one 
of Killua's friends that came to visit.

217
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,761
Is Killua there? Can I speak to him?

218
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,182
Master Killua does not have friends.

219
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,017
[puts down phone]

220
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,112
[dial tone]

221
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,322
[butler] 
You've reached the butler's quarters.

222
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,245
How could you possibly know that, huh? 
Put Killua on the phone!

223
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,126
-I believe you said your name is Gon? 
-[Gon] Yeah.

224
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,714
[butler] Let us pretend that Master Killua 
does have a friend named Gon.

225
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,175
There is no proof that you are him.

226
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,552
Put him on the phone, he'll recognize me!

227
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,847
[butler] By your voice? 
That is no guarantee.

228
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,349
[Gon] Put him on the phone, 
he'll recognize me!

229
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,728
[butler] That was a simple recording.

230
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,064
but there are many other ways 
to mimic someone's voice.

231
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,277
Next, you'll say 
that he'd recognize you by sight.

232
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,238
There aren't as many methods

233
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,116
by which you could perfectly replicate 
someone's appearance,

234
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,160
but it isn't impossible.

235
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,998
Or perhaps you are Gon, 
but someone has coerced you

236
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,418
to approach Master Killua 
for some sinister motive.

237
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,964
As long as that threat exists, 
I cannot let you meet with him.

238
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,096
The Zoldyck family 
are in the assassination business.

239
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,140
They have their enemies, of course.

240
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:01,604
And it is a butler's responsibility 
to guard them from those enemies.

241
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,148
Apologies, you will have to leave.

242
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,239
Hey! Wait!

243
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,990
Gon!

244
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,079
He's really pissed, isn't he?

245
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,915
I think he's going to climb over the wall.

246
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,958
He what?

247
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,712
[Leorio] Hey, Gon! Knock it off!

248
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,048
It's okay. You two can wait here.

249
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,676
-I'm going in alone. 
-I can't let you do that!

250
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,011
-[Gon] I'll be fine! 
-[Leorio] No, you won't!

251
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,430
[Kurapika] 
Look, both of you need to calm down!

252
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,433
[Leorio] I'm perfectly calm! 
Now, come on, get down!

253
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,394
[Kurapika] He's right. Don't be stupid.

254
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,399
Here, Gon, I'll give you the key. 
You can go through the door, alright?

255
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,194
Just wait a second, Pops! 
We can convince him to stop this.

256
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,906
Oh, really? Because he strikes me 
as the stubborn type.

257
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,869
To make amends, I've decided 
to accompany you through the door.

258
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,246
What?

259
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,041
Mike knows me well enough 
to recognize me.

260
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,545
and it's possible he might not attack 
if he sees I'm with you.

261
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,674
Though I'm almost 100 percent certain 
that he'll just kill us all.

262
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,387
I can't let you do that. 
I don't want to cause any trouble for you.

263
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,641
Too late. I'm coming. 
There'd be trouble even if I stayed.

264
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,312
If I send young Master Killua's friends 
to their deaths,

265
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,023
I'd never be able 
to look him in the eye again.

266
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,360
If you die, well, 
then I'll die alongside you.

267
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,410
I understand, sir.

268
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,580
I guess I didn't stop 
to think about your situation.

269
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,998
Sorry.

270
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,003
[guard] He's a good kid.

271
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:53,132
ready and willing to put aside 
his own anger for the sake of another.

272
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,677
He believes in his own strength.

273
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,597
and he believes in his friends 
just as much.

274
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,308
He has such a strong heart.

275
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,187
In fact, it's likely that 
Mike won't frighten him at all.

276
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,689
You like animals, don't you, Gon?

277
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,941
Huh? Yes.

278
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,860
I thought you might.

279
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,988
And did you grow up 
playing in the countryside?

280
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,032
Yes! How did you know all that?

281
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,411
Alright, in just a moment, I'm going 
to open the Testing Gate again.

282
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,998
I want you to see Mike with your own eyes.

283
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,512
Hey, are you sure that it's okay 
for us to come in?

284
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,932
Of course. You entered through 
the Testing Gate, so you'll be fine.

285
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,477
Mike! Come here!

286
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,110
[Mike growling in distance]

287
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,129
[Gon gasps]

288
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,147
[guard] So, Gon, do you understand?

289
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:35,151
This is a hunting beast, 
and a highly trained one at that!

290
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,947
It's like no animal 
you've ever encountered in the wild

291
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,949
No, not by a long shot.

292
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,785
You believed you could 
communicate with him

293
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,163
until you looked in his eyes, right?

294
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,082
As we speak,

295
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:54,378
Mike is memorizing the appearances 
and scents of these new humans.

296
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,548
There isn't anything else on his mind 
at the moment.

297
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,592
He's just like a machine.

298
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,013
So, Gon, do you think you could fight him?

299
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,476
I'd be too scared. 
I don't ever want to fight him!

300
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,189
[guard chuckles] 
He's an honest lad, too.

301
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,401
Well, how long will you be staying here?

302
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,445
Until we see Killua!

303
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,198
We're not leaving a second before!

304
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,117
[chuckles]

305
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,870
Alright then, follow me.

306
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,504
[narrator] 
First, The Testing Gate, and now Mike.

307
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,590
Between the two of them, 
Gon has seen for himself

308
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,886
that the Zoldyck family truly live 
in a completely different world.

309
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,098
However, Gon had made a promise 
to himself

310
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,644
that no matter what difficulties lay 
on the path ahead of him

311
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,563
in the end, he would see Killua.

312
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,611
[theme music plays]

313
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:24,028
[Gon] Next time, "The Guard's Duty." 
Five times five is 25.

314
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,405
[Kurapika] So, you know how to do math?

315
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,575
[Kurapika, Gon and Leorio] 
Five times five is 25!
