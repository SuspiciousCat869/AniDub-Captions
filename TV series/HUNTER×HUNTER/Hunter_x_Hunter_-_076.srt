’til he caved.

168
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,819
A while after that,
I started to develop my nen,

169
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,455
and he started
teaching me to hunt.

170
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,423
As a result,

171
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:06,760
I passed the hunter exam
without much trouble.

172
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,963
But master ging
still wasn’t satisfied.

173
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,500
There was another hurdle
I had to clear.

174
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:15,302
Can you guess
what that hurdle was?

175
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,708
Gon: I think I might know.

176
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:22,910
Kite: Yeah?

177
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,512
Gon: No. I definitely know.

178
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:29,350
If I know ging,
he probably told you

179
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:32,319
that he wants you
to try and catch him.

180
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,920
( Kite chuckles )

181
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:37,257
Right. That’s it exactly.

182
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,627
Gon: I knew it!
I thought that was it.

183
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,729
Kite: But as far as I knew,

184
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,932
ging was the absolute greatest
hunter in the whole world.

185
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,734
It would be
the most difficult hunt ever.

186
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,871
There were no clues
or leads to start with.

187
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,940
Not only that, there were
no rumors of his whereabouts

188
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,876
or sightings of him either.

189
00:12:55,909 --> 00:13:00,247
It seemed like he’d managed to
completely erase his existence.

190
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,684
Killua: Like a superpowered
form of zetsu?

191
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,688
Gon: And then?
What happened next?

192
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,289
Kite: I was struggling,

193
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:12,393
grasping for anything
that might help me find him,

194
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:16,597
so I went to his hometown,
to whale island.

195
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,801
And that was when
I first met you, gon.

196
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,403
( Gon gasps )

197
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:26,874
Kite: But back then, I didn’t
realize you were ging’s son.

198
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,276
I had no idea.

199
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,412
I didn’t learn that
until I had finally found ging

200
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:35,616
and told him about what had
happened on whale island.

201
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,651
( Wind blowing )

202
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,892
Ging: That was my kid.
His name’s gon.

203
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,429
( Kite gasps )

204
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,841
Ging: Thanks for clobbering him.

205
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,643
Some things
are just common sense,

206
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,712
like avoiding foxbear territory

207
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:07,781
while they’re raising
their young. Heh.

208
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,786
( Gon gasps )

209
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,288
Kite: The fact
that I went to whale island

210
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,824
or that I met you there,

211
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,892
none of that
seemed to surprise him.

212
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:22,897
It was almost as if
he’d expected it.

213
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,300
Looking back now, I think
everything that’s happened

214
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,702
has gone
according to ging’s plan.

215
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,271
Killua: You’re saying
he set all this up?

216
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,907
Kite: Well, I can’t prove it.

217
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:37,344
Gon: You may be right.

218
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,511
Killua: Huh?

219
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:42,216
Gon: Razor was there
waiting for me,

220
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,651
dwun and list, too.

221
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,221
Kite: Razor and dwun?

222
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:50,858
Killua: Yeah. It was in a game
called "greed island,"

223
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,526
but it’s kind of a long story.

224
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,894
Gon: We got inside the game,

225
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,229
and razor told me
he was waiting for me.

226
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,265
Ging told him to.

227
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,567
Ging: One day,
my son’s going to come here.

228
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,270
When he does, don’t hold back.

229
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,173
Razor: Heh. Fine. Does that mean
that I can kill him?

230
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:10,577
Ging: Don’t underestimate him.
He is my kid.

231
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:15,582
I’m counting on you.
Thanks, razor.

232
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,184
Gon: Ging created "greed island"

233
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,820
with the help
of ten of his close friends.

234
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,389
Dwun and list were two of ’em.

235
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,493
Oh! And razor.
He’s also one of ging’s friends.

236
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:29,530
Well, anyway,
those three were all there

237
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:30,798
just waiting for me.

238
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:33,500
When I learned that,
I realized something.

239
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:36,203
If that was
ging’s big plan all along,

240
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,271
for me to go there
and meet his friends,

241
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,440
then I wonder
if meeting all the others,

242
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,977
people like bisky
and everybody else,

243
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,947
well, that might have been
part of his plan, too, right?

244
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,815
Killua: And if that’s
really the case,

245
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:51,518
then it’s also possible
that ging wanted you

246
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:53,754
to meet kite here,
so he helped to make it happen.

247
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,422
Gon: Think so?

248
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,957
Hey, that’s right!

249
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,425
Kite: Hmm?

250
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,593
Gon: You must have
spent time on greed island

251
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,162
at some point, haven’t you?

252
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:03,164
Kite: Me?

253
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:04,799
Gon: Yeah. And when you went,

254
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,535
did you register
under the name of nigg?

255
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:12,173
Kite: Nigg? No, I don’t
recall that name. Wait.

256
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:16,510
I do remember ging taking me
inside a game a while back,

257
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:17,778
now that you mention it.

258
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,379
Gon: I knew it!

259
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,382
Kite: "Greed island."

260
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:24,218
Yes, I believe
that’s what it was called.

261
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,487
But I can’t remember
if I used an alias.

262
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,955
Gon: That’s gotta be it!

263
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,225
Ging must have had you register
the name nigg back then!

264
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,894
Damn it! He got me good! Ohh!

265
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:36,496
Killua: And you were
convinced you’d meet him.

266
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,500
( Gon groaning )

267
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:47,708
Elena: Are you sure that was
the right decision, ging?

268
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,943
Ging: So can you make it

269
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:52,746
so that using magnetic force
will send gon to me

270
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,915
while using accompany
will send him to kite?

271
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,717
Elena: Yes, I suppose so,

272
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,953
but why do you
want me to do that?

273
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:02,790
Ging: If he uses magnetic force
to see me on his own,

274
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,525
I guess i’m willing to meet him,

275
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,394
but if he’s a wimp who needs
to bring his friends along,

276
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,762
forget it.

277
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,364
Elena: Why is he a wimp
if he brings his friends?

278
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:12,666
I don’t understand that.

279
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,868
( Ging gasps )
Never mind that! Just do it!

280
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:17,438
Elena: More people would just
make you self-conscious, right?

281
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,240
Please, just shut up,
and do what I asked.

282
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,379
Elena: Honestly,
ging is so weird.

283
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,247
He’s both shy and stubborn.

284
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:29,450
I feel sorry for gon.

285
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:32,886
( Fire crackling )

286
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,455
Kite: I see.

287
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,424
So the real reason
that "greed island" was created

288
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,725
was to provide you boys

289
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,594
with the type of training
you needed.

290
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,629
Killua: No, it was
only for gon, really.

291
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:45,466
I’ve pretty much been along
for the ride the whole time.

292
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,935
Gon: But that might have been
part of ging’s plan, too,

293
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:48,936
don’t you think?

294
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:50,704
Killua: Even me? Not likely.

295
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,239
More like impossible.

296
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:55,475
Kite: But it appears
that all of us meeting here

297
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,211
was no mere coincidence.

298
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,779
Killua: Yeah. I agree.

299
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,782
There’s gotta be some
deeper meaning to all this.

300
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,150
Gon: Like what?

301
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,751
Killua: Like razor
waited inside the game

302
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:06,654
so he could help
make you stronger,

303
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,156
and if that’s the case,
then it would make sense

304
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,425
that ging has some role
for kite to play, too.

305
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,427
Kite: A role, huh?

306
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,830
Killua: You said that your
final test was to find ging.

307
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,566
- Is that right?
- Kite: Yeah.

308
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,235
Killua: That sounds like
a pretty daunting task.

309
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,772
The best hunters in the world
are masters of hunting, sure,

310
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:27,708
but they’re also masters
of concealing themselves,

311
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:30,277
yet you still found him.

312
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,346
Gon: Uh-huh. I think so, too.

313
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,849
Killua: Once your final test
was completed, kite,

314
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:37,685
ging must have made his choice.

315
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:39,320
You were worthy
of handling this.

316
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,822
Gon: "Handling this"?
Wait. What?

317
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,824
Killua: Oh, come on.

318
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,660
Gotta walk you through it?
Basically...

319
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,662
♪

320
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,669
Ging: Thanks for clobbering him.

321
00:18:58,705 --> 00:18:59,673
Kite: Hey, gon.

322
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,274
Gon: Hmm?

323

Kite: Want me to tell you
