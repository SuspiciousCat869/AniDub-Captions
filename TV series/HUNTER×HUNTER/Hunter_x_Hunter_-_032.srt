1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,127
TEN (ENVELOPE)

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,253
[narrator] Ten:

3
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:07,007
The ability to envelop your body 
in a shroud of Nen aura,

4
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:10,344
making it tougher and slowing 
the effects of aging.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,553
ZETSU (SUPPRESS)

6
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:12,513
Zetsu:

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,307
A technique which shuts off 
your flow of Nen-aura.

8
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,918
Effective for concealing your presence 
and recovering from fatigue.

9
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:20,585
REN (REFINE)

10
00:00:20,694 --> 00:00:24,650
Ren: A technique for creating 
an especially strong Nen aura.

11
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,152
It is crucial for increasing your power.

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:28,987
HATSU (RELEASE)

13
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:29,988
Hatsu:

14
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,909
The release of your Nen aura, 
after using Ren to boost it.

15
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,039
These four elements 
are known as the Four Exercises

16
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,667
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,834
FOUR EXERCISES

18
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,801
[theme song playing]

19
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,920
You see my double is no mere illusion.

20
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:09,921
It’s real.

21
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,382
Just as real as I am 
until I make it vanish.

22
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,760
You must know this.

23
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,762
You felt it strike against you.

24
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,056
To put it simply

25
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,642
you are going to have to 
face two of me at once!

26
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,856
Now behold the culmination 
of my mastery of Nen.

27
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,692
The True Tiger Bite Fist!

28
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:35,864
A x SURPRISING x WIN

29
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,870
[narrator] Kastro used Nen 
to create a double of himself.

30
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,499
And his special attack - 
the True Tiger Bite Fist

31
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,751
has severed Hisoka’s right arm.

32
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,672
Which of these contenders 
will emerge victorious?

33
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,301
[smirks]

34
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:02,766
[grunts]

35
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,147
[Cocco] Now what?!

36
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,067
Hisoka has covered his right arm 
with a scarf?

37
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,238
Shall I demonstrate 
my powers of clairvoyance?

38
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,323
[grumbles]

39
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,912
[Cocco] Wow!

40
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,414
Wow! His right arm disappeared

41
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,582
and now cards are raining down!

42
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,459
What is he doing?!

43
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,595
[Hisoka] 
The cards you see go from one to thirteen.

44
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,265
I want you to pick a number

45
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,309
and visualize that card in your head.

46
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,438
He’s doing a ‘pick a number’ trick?

47
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,482
[Hisoka] Ready?

48
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,568
Once you’ve selected your number,

49
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,278
I want you to add four to it,

50
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,405
and then double the resulting sum.

51
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,367
After that subtract six and divide by two.

52
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,078
Lastly, subtract your original number.

53
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,289
Now, what do you get?

54
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,416
Gimme a sec…

55
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,334
Did… he say subtract six?

56
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,128
Ahh! I forgot already!

57
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,674
I knew your answer 
even before you arrived at it yourself.

58
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,970
[audience gasping in shock]

59
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,686
The number you chose…

60
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,062
was one.

61
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,981
He’s totally right; it was!

62
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,232
How did he know?

63
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,400
Really?!

64
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,195
[Cocco] What?! He’s insane!

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,071
This is the devil’s magic!

66
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,825
And he’s incorporated his own injury 
into the trick!

67
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,204
I don’t get it.

68
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,164
Why is he so calm?

69
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,999
There are no points for tricks.

70
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,126
It doesn’t have anything to do 
with the match.

71
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,837
But still, he’s performing magic!

72
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,298
That’s the bizarre behavior 
we expect from Hisoka!

73
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,509
Would you like a souvenir?

74
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,220
You fool!

75
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,805
I will sever your left arm,

76
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,516
so that you’ll never be able 
to mock anyone again!

77
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,312
You must not have heard me.

78
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,772
You can take it.

79
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,900
I’ll be more than happy to oblige!

80
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,903
[Cocco] Whoa! One of the Kastros 
is charging forward!

81
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,029
[Kastro roaring]

82
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,615
[Cocco] This is unbelievable!

83
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,993
Hisoka has actually sacrificed 
his remaining arm!

84
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,831
What in the world is this guy thinking?!

85
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,499
Wait, what?!

86
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,381
So, you did attack with your double. 
How interesting.

87
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,633
If you had come at me yourself,

88
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,219
I was fully prepared to counterattack…

89
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,973
by using this.

90
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,182
[audience murmurs]

91
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,019
[Cocco] What? His severed right arm 
is back together again!

92
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,229
But how?

93
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,357
[chuckling]

94
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,442
It’s another magic trick.

95
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,028
Can you guess the secret behind this one?

96
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,030
He’s lying.

97
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,284
It’s obvious he’s using Nen 
to accomplish this feat.

98
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,954
But... what kind of ability is this?

99
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,749
[Hisoka chuckles]

100
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,251
[Hisoka] What's wrong?

101
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,711
Are you scared?

102
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,131
You’re surprised 
because you don’t know the trick.

103
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,717
But that’s magic.

104
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,846
See your power to create a double 
is magnificent.

105
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,098
But now I understand how it’s done.

106
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,224
[grumbles]

107
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,352
[Hisoka] I can anticipate 
how you’ll attack with your double.

108
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,687
Not to mention,

109
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,148
I know how I should respond.

110
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,650
It’s too bad, really.

111
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,655
You had the potential 
to become a skilled opponent...

112
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,993
and that’s why I decided to let you live.

113
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,913
I predict...

114
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,041
you’re going to dance yourself to death.

115
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,627
[growling]

116
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,087
[shouts] Shut up!

117
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,719
No! How did he pick me out?

118
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,554
Doubles are made

119
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,599
from the image the original has in mind,

120
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,101
which is why they tend to be pristine.

121
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,898
But you can’t reproduce the grime 
that builds up during combat.

122
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:22,943
Oh…

123
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,654
Had you not realized that yet?

124
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,163
[roaring]

125
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,292
[groans]

126
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,961
[Cocco] What is going on here?

127
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,090
I’m seeing it, 
but I can’t even begin to understand it!

128
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,009
Is this another one 
of Hisoka’s magic tricks?

129
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,053
Don't bother.

130
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,639
I hit you square in the lower jaw,

131
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,766
so you’ll be stunned for a minute or two.

132
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,101
[dazzled groaning]

133
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:59,479
And that means you’ll be helpless 
to avoid my next attack.

134
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,858
What?!

135
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,986
Where did this attack come from?

136
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,321
I don’t have time for this.

137
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,824
I have to produce my double 
to block the cards!

138
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,076
You can’t make another double.

139
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,831
Creating a new double using Nen

140
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,250
requires intense focus.

141
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,338
The only reason you were able 
to produce and release them freely

142
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,881
was that up until now...

143
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,343
you were in a normal state of mind.

144
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,976
Using Nen to replicate 
and manipulate something

145
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,104
that’s as complex as the human body,

146
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,190
is extremely difficult.

147
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,569
How difficult, you ask?

148
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,196
By the time you’ve learned 
to use a double,

149
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,700
you’ve forgotten how to use Nen 
for anything else.

150
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,702
Sad, really.

151
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,789
It’s a little something 
I like to call “memory overload”.

152
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,334
You only lost because...

153
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,879
you squandered your memory capacity.

154
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,675
[cheering]

155
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,888
[Cocco] 
Kastro’s down and he’s not getting up!

156
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,348
Hisoka wins by knockout!

157
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,938
Hisoka…

158
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,776
[cheering]

159
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,537
[Machi] Nice job.

160
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,709
Well? Hurry up and show me your injuries.

161
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,592
I was never quite sure before

162
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,803
but today’s match proved it to me.

163
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,346
Hm?

164
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,847
[Machi] You are an idiot.

165
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,683
That’s quite possible.

166
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,354
Why did you decide 
to put yourself in danger this way?

167
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:05,980
What was that?

168
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,732
Performance art or something?

169
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,025
Well…

170
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,365
Okay. You’re paying me, 
so I guess I can’t complain.

171
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,334
First, I’ll need to stop the bleeding.

172
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,757
[Hisoka] Hey…

173
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,051
Be gentle, if you don’t mind.

174
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,302
Yeah, whatever.

175
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,762
Turn off your aura.

176
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,146
[smirks]

177
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,357
[Machi] I’ll start with your left arm.

178
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,613
Here we go.

179
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,740
Starting Nen Stitches.

180
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:58,783
NEN STITCHES

181
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,793
There. All done.

182
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,130
Bones and blood vessels, 
nerves, and muscles.

183
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,174
They’re basically all connected, now.

184
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,097
Ahh! That’s brilliant.

185
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,724
[Machi] Next…

186
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,434
I’ll do your right arm.

187
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,561
You can hold it yourself this time.

188
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,942
[Hisoka impressed] Mm.

189
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,071
This is always so fascinating to watch.

190
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,579
I so enjoy getting to see 
your Nen stitches in action

191
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,248
that maybe I injured myself on purpose.

192
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,917
Fine, whatever.

193
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,711
Twenty mil for the left one, 
fifty for the right one.

194
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,670
All right?

195
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,505
Now. Fork it over.

196
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,133
I’ll transfer it 
directly into your account.

197
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,259
All right.

198
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,512
And you can treat 
the rest of the injuries yourself.

199
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,015
[Hisoka] 
Your bedside manner could be better.

200
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,018
You should be able to manage 
with your Bungee Gum...

201
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,437
and your Texture Surprise.

202
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,022
Ah.

203
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,066
I guess I should conceal them.

204
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,442
If I do...

205
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,738
they’ll think my arms 
were healed magically during the match.

206
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,953
This is nothing more 
than an ordinary scarf.

207
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,538
I use Bungee Gum

208
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,915
to attach it to my arm,

209
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,002
then Texture Surprise 
to create a layer of skin.

210
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,632
[Machi] He’s so fast.

211
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,301
Fast enough to fool a Nen master

212
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,428
into believing 
the arm had actually healed

213
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,931
before he thought to take a second look.

214
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,226
Next, I’ll do the left.

215
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,728
Bungee Gum.

216
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,771
ELASTIC LOVE 
BUNGEE GUM

217
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,273
He modifies his aura,

218
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,109
making it both elastic and sticky.

219
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,778
It stretches extremely well,

220
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,488
contracts swiftly when needed,

221
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,240
adheres to most substances

222
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,492
and it can be removed at any time.

223
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,329
Oh, by the way 
I call this trick ‘Bungee Gum’

224
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,873
because that was the name 
of my favorite chewing gum

225
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,500
when I was a child.

226
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,420
Yeah, you really didn’t need 
to tell me all that.

227
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,589
Texture Surprise.

228
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,676
He combines his aura with imagery

229
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,053
in order to reproduce 
the appearance of skin.

230
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,346
FLIMSY LIES 
TEXTURE SURPRISE

231
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,098
It’s essentially a high-quality copy,

232
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,059
so you can tell it’s fake 
if you actually touch it.

233
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,396
But Hisoka probably finds 
that drawback exciting.

234
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,607
I call this one Texture Surprise

235
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,526
which comes from the gag stickers

236
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,654
that were included with a popular snack 
not too long ago.

237
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,366
Like I said, 
I really didn’t need to know all that.

238
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,993
Weren’t you impressed

239
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,996
by my application of these abilities 
during the match?

240
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,415
I was almost certain you were.

241
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,499
[Machi] Huh?!

242
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,210
Well, you did see everything, didn’t you?

243
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,963
Yeah… I think I did…

244
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,051
You started with a misdirection,

245
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,386
tossing 13 cards into the air.

246
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,889
At the same time you threw your arm,

247
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,516
attaching it to the roof with Bungee Gum

248
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,019
and the scarf to the ground the same way.

249
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,272
But you didn’t let go.

250
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,609
The aura from each was connected 
to the stump of your right arm.

251
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,445
And that’s not all.

252
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,074
The cards you threw as a distraction 
were also secured to the ground

253
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,161
with the ends of the 13 strands of aura 
connected to your left hand.

254
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,622
And then,

255
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,999
when you threw the ace of spades 
at Kastro…

256
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,794
Would you like a souvenir?

257
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,089
Cocco] 
… the aura in your left hand was released.

258
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,508
They connected.

259
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,011
All 13 of the aura strands 
you had been holding,

260
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,971
stuck to Kastro’s body.

261
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,264
Correct.

262
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,184
You’re much more observant 
than Kastro was.

263
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,019
[Machi] I also noticed

264
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,106
that you employed one 
of the basic techniques of Nen Zetsu -

265
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,566
to help make your aura almost invisible.

266
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,945
Yes. However, there was one weakness.

267
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,571
[Machi] Yeah.

268
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,949
Pretty much anybody who’s learned Ren,

269
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,826
another basic Nen technique,

270
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,828
could have detected it easily…

271
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,872
by focusing the aura in their eyes 
and watching.

272
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,253
That’s why you used 
that crazy magic trick of yours

273
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,797
to throw him off guard 
while you just stood there,

274
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,049
smiling and pretending to be nonchalant.

275
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,052
It even worked as a kind of camouflage.

276
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,054
You had him convinced 
that your lack of aura

277
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,140
was a sign of confidence.

278
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,934
Once you were satisfied

279
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,853
that everything 
was going according to plan,

280
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,523
you surreptitiously extended a thread 
of aura from your left hand,

281
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,191
the one holding the cards

282
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,027
and connected it directly 
to Kastro’s chin.

283
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,989
Everything was ready.

284
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,159
You’d already used Texture Surprise

285
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,036
to alter the scarf on the floor 
to resemble human skin.

286
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,581
And so,

287
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,208
when Kastro attacked your left arm,

288
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,127
you activated the Bungee Gum

289
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,671
between your right arm 
and the scarf on the floor.

290
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,466
Your arm was restored

291
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,509
and the scarf concealed the wound,

292
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,553
leaving everyone convinced 
your right arm

293
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,971
was magically back.

294
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,392
However, this performance 
had the unfortunate effect

295
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,728
of bringing Kastro back to his senses.

296
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,190
It made no sense for a severed arm 
to simply reappear,

297
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,233
especially in pristine condition.

298
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,652
It was then that Kastro realized

299
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,655
I was actually using Nen 
to accomplish these feats

300
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,366
and not magic, 
as he was led to believe.

301
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:33,951
That’s true.

302
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,204
But you didn’t miss 
the ever-so-subtle change

303
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,914
in his psychological condition.

304
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,460
See your power to create a double 
is magnificent.

305
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,545
But now I understand how it’s done.

306
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,838
[grumbles]

307
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,841
[Hisoka] I can anticipate 
how you’ll attack with your double.

308
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,218
Not to mention,

309
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,595
I know how I should respond.

310
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,389
It’s too bad, really.

311
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,894
You had the potential 
to become a skilled opponent...

312
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,607
and that’s why I decided to let you live.

313
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,608
[grumbles]

314
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,237
[Machi] 
You saw that Kastro was about to recover.

315
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,280
I predict...

316
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,367
you’re going to dance yourself to death.

317
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,828
[Machi] 
But then you pushed him over the edge.

318
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,124
[shouts] Shut up!

319
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,962
No! How did he pick me out?

320
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,005
You can’t reproduce the grime

321
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,924
that builds up during combat.

322
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,763
[Machi] And just like that,

323
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,349
you were able to expose 
the weakness of his doubles.

324
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,977
But if he had just stayed 
calm and composed,

325
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,437
then he actually 
would have had a fighting chance.

326
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:44,814
However...

327
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,900
Kastro couldn't bear the mental strain.

328
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,614
[roaring]

329
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,164
And so... he lost.

330
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,375
You do realize

331
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,753
just how perfect both of those abilities 
are for someone like you, don’t you?

332
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,171
They’re practically tailor-made.

333
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,174
As opposed to Kastro’s double ability,

334
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,385
my techniques are so adaptable

335
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,847
that they don’t lose their effectiveness, 
if my opponent knows about them.

336
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,184
[Machi] Well...

337
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,769
I’m heading back now.

338
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,854
Already?

339
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,773
Yeah, why stick around 
after the job is done?

340
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,985
There’s only so much 
that Nen Stitches can do,

341
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,363
so try not to overdo it 
until your arm is firmly attached.

342
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:36,907
Oh, right...

343
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,076
I came here for a reason.

344
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,620
Hm?

345
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,538
[Machi] The message has been changed.

346
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,540
All Troupe members 
are to be in York New City

347
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,584
by noon, August 30th,

348
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,462
not just those 
who don’t have anything better to do.

349
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,340
[Hisoka] Will the boss be coming?

350
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,258
[Machi] Probably.

351
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,637
This could turn out 
to be our biggest mission yet.

352
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,930
So, know if you blow it off,

353
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,099
the boss might hunt you down himself.

354
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,685
Now that is scary.

355
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,062
Oh, by the way…

356
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,105
-Care to join me for dinner tonight? 
-[door closes]

357
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,234
What a pity.

358
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,451
-[gasps] 
-[door opens]

359
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,704
Killua! So how was Hisoka’s fight? 
Tell me!

360
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,999
Boring. Don’t worry, 
you didn’t miss much.

361
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,125
Boring?

362
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,548
And Hisoka? Did he win?

363
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,595
Okay, I was lying.

364
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,763
Huh?

365
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,099
[Killua] It was an incredible fight.

366
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,267
Hate to say it

367
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,646
but I watched Hisoka win 
and I still don’t know how.

368
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,316
You seriously couldn’t tell how he did it?

369
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,235
Gon.

370
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,444
You and me…

371
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,030
we’ve got to learn all that we can 
about Nen.

372
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:00,991
Yeah!

373
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,969
[Machi] He’s such a mystery.

374
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,142
He never talks about his past.

375
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,477
It doesn’t interest him.

376
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,024
He’ll probably forget 
what Kastro looks like by tomorrow.

377
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,780
He doesn’t belong to anything or anyone.

378
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,577
He’s his own man, 
no doubt about it.

379
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:49,290
Because he’s absolutely convinced 
that he’s the most powerful.

380
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,963
[tap squeaks]

381
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,594
[wet feet slapping on the floor]

382
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,636
Hmm...

383
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,765
Oh, I forgot to take... this off.

384
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,771
A spider?

385
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,734
I found some new toys to play with.

386
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,571
Time to start the hunt.

387
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:34,210
[narrator] Hisoka has been masquerading 
as a member of the Phantom Troupe.

388
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,461
But to him,

389
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,006
the Phantom Troupe 
is nothing more than another target.

390
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,013
[theme song playing]

391
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,622
[Gon] Coming up:

392
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,124
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

393
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,500
[both] ...Hunterpedia!

394
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,002
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

395
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,545
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

396
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,923
Today we meet Kastro, 
who uses the Tiger Bite Fist.

397
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,758
He makes a double of himself with Nen.

398
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,260
Those aren’t easy to deal with!

399
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,013
With this double, 
I can use the True Tiger Bite Fist!

400
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,055
[both] Scary, isn’t it?

401
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,644
Next time:

402
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,021
An x Empty x Threat.

403
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,731
Achoo!

404
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:19,940
Do I have a cold?

405
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,526
[Killua] I bet someone's talking about you 
behind your back.

406
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:23,792
[Gon] Aunt Mito?
