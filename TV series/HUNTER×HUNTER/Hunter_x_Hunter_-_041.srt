That’s awesome! Let’s get started!

00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,306
Yeah!

[Gon] Is this the Hunter website?

13
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:12,382
Yeah. I’ve heard that Hunters worldwide 
post lots of information here.

14
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,842
Worldwide? Really?

15
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,302
That’s pretty amazing.

[bartender] 
What kind of information do you want?

23
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,539
Wow! That’s a lot of info!

24
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,083
Click ‘game category’.

25
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,339
There it is. Greed Island.

26
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,634
Price is 20 million Jenny.

27
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,135
Twenty million?

28
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,888
I guess they won’t give out information 
for free.

29
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,265
All right. I guess we gotta.

30
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,185
Okay then, I’m depositing 20 million.

31
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,524
I can feel aura coming from the monitor!

32
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,487
Then to enter the site...

33
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,365
it looks like you actually 
have to be a Nen user.

34
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,827
Okay. Now listen very carefully.

35
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,745
Y’see, Greed Island

36
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,748
is a game created by Nen users.

37
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,378
It appears that there are 
multiple creators

38
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,338
whose motives are unclear.

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,050
They infused Nen into 
all hundred copies of the game.

40
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,302
Nen activates on startup,

41
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,097
pulling the player inside the game itself.

42
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,808
Wait. Inside the game?

43
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,437
[bartender] 
Only Nen users can actually play it.

44
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,398
As long as the player stays alive 
within the game,

45
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,400
the console will continue to run,

46
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,193
even if the game is unplugged.

47
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,988
It will stop if the player dies.

48
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,990
There was one owner...

49
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,034
who hired fifty Hunters to give it a shot.

50
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,202
And of the 50...

51
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,913
not a single one ever came back.

52
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,002
I heard you can return 
if you can find a save point.

53
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,172
Is that true?

54
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,174
It’s from the Hunter website.

55
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,967
It’s gotta be accurate.

56
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,720
At the Yorknew City auction,

57
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,723
there are going to be 
seven units of Greed Island

58
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,726
and every one of them 
will be available for purchase.

59
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,105
Of course, the lowest starting bid 
is 8.9 billion Jenny.

60
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,399
8.9 billion?

61
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,401
The price has skyrocketed!

62
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,737
That’s three billion more 
than we’d pay for retail!

63
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,615
Getting one’s ranked level G.

64
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,699
[both] Huh?

65
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,451
The game is considered a legend

66
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,078
but there are still 
plenty of units around.

67
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,872
If you have enough money,

68
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,374
it should be relatively easy 
to procure one.

69
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,377
Hmm... A G-rank, huh?

70
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,129
That’s lower than I thought.

71
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,383
You’re telling me, if I can’t even 
get my hands on a simple game,

72
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,135
I’ll never be able to find you.

73
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,345
Right, Ging?

74
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,145
[Kurapika] 
Still, the money’s a big problem.

75
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,357
Hey. This auction…

76
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,442
Do you think 
that we can participate in it?

77
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,277
At 8.9 billion?

78
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,696
C’mon, that’s way out of our league!

79
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,367
Uh-uh. Not to go buy stuff but to sell.

80
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,160
Selling, huh? That’s it!

81
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,829
We can go look for treasure

82
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,872
and then auction off 
whatever we manage to find.

83
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,082
Yes!

84
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,460
We can start with the 800 million 
that we earned fighting at Heavens Arena

85
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,545
and then go from there.

86
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,796
Hmm.

87
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,464
First off,

88
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,425
we’ll try the online flea markets 
and auction websites.

89
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,347
Now… let’s see what we can dig up.

90
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,560
We’ll increase our funds and then 
get a copy of Greed Island!

91
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,519
Yeah!

92
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,162
-Yeah! 
-All right!

93
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,497
[both laughing]

94
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,425
How much... is left?

95
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,137
Between the two of us, 
we’re at 10.84 million.

96
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,140
[both sigh]

97
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,017
What the hell?

98
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,853
When we first started, 
were making a decent amount.

99
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,522
I knew this would happen.

100
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,150
That’s why I told you 
we should stick to the reputable sites.

101
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,568
I couldn’t help myself!

102
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,321
The risky sites are the only real way 
to make a profit!

103
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,406
[both sigh]

104
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,367
This isn’t working out so good.

105
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,537
[man] Now then…

106
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,581
show me what you’ve brought.

107
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,627
Hair from the famous actress, Sara.

108
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,670
DNA authenticated.

109
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,089
Taken from an Egypersian pyramid.

110
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,633
It’s a mummy’s right arm.

111
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,802
The Scaly skin of a Dracoderma patient.

112
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,764
The skull of a unicorn tribesman.

113
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,392
Okay, then.

114
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,770
Congratulations, 
all four of you are hired.

115
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,273
My name is Dalzollene, 
the head bodyguard.

116
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,816
You start now.

117
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,402
I look forward 
to working with each of you.

118
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,738
Your mission

119
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,492
is to safely escort the boss 
to a Yorknew City hotel room.

120
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,287
A private airship 
will take you all to Lingon,

121
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,289
an airport outside of Yorknew.

122
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,291
From the airport it’s ninety minutes

123
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,043
to get to the hotel.

124
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,920
A car will be waiting.

125
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:46,174
The four of you will be assigned 
to provide the outer ring of security.

126
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,468
Any questions?

127
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,221
Do you know 
who might be targeting the boss?

128
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,140
That question’s not deserving 
of an answer.

129
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,767
[Kurapika] What do you mean?

130
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,436
The boss is a VIP in the underworld.

131
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,606
There are plenty who hold a grudge.

132
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,442
Since you didn’t understand, 
I’ll rephrase.

133
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,736
Grudges aside,

134
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,739
can you think of anyone 
who might actually commit to an attack?

135
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:10,949
Anyone at all?

136
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,994
If we can identify the candidates,

137
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,662
their styles and motives,

138
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,997
we can prepare…

139
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,541
helping us to ensure 
the boss’s protection.

140
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,044
[Dalzollene] Kurapika, is it?

141
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,839
You are the one who doesn’t understand.

142
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,383
Our job is to protect the boss,

143
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,512
no matter who, when, 
where or how they attack.

144
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,640
That's all you need to know! Got it?

145
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,852
So, don’t bother 
building a mental profile.

146
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,896
Everyone who approaches is an enemy.

147
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,111
It’s time to meet the boss.

148
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,362
Come on.

149
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,752
[Baise] Excuse me. What’s that?

150
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,173
[Basho] It’s a little too realistic.

151
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,634
[Dalzollene] 
That is an actual human being.

152
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,721
He used to be a fellow bodyguard.

153
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,140
But he ignored my advice

154
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,267
and was fooled by false information,

155
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,354
putting the other bodyguards 
and the boss at risk.

156
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,107
And so, he was punished accordingly.

157
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,069
You were all brought in 
to be his replacements.

158
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,237
Let's go.

159
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,831
Boss. I’ve brought the new bodyguards.

160
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,460
Come in.

161
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,600
[Dalzollene] The boss, Miss Neon.

162
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,018
[all four gasp]

163
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,897
[giggles] New hires! 
It’s a pleasure to meet you!

164
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:13,988
[Basho] Well, anyway,

165
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,658
I was pretty surprised 
when we met the boss.

166
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,451
[Baise] No kidding.

167
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,162
They called her an important figure 
in the underworld,

168
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,123
so I thought it’d be someone intimidating

169
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,875
but she turned out to be 
a cute little girl.

170
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,195
[footsteps]

171
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,244
Pakunoda! Hey, how’ve you been?

172
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,080
[Pakunoda] Long time no see, Shalnark.

173
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,790
You too, Phinks.

174
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,459
[derisive snort] 
You sure took your time getting here.

175
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,880
Oh? Right on time by my watch.

176
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,799
You were supposed to arrive here 
ten minutes early.

177
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,134
Same for you guys.

178
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,888
[Shalnark] Bonolenov! Kortopi!

179
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,016
So, you’re going with us, too?

180
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,894
[man] Hey!

181
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,688
Haven’t seen you in quite a while.

182
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,025
I’m reporting for duty, boss.

183
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,985
What’s our target this time?

184
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,029
I’m itchin’ for our new orders!

185
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,947
[Shalnark chuckles] Easy now, Uvo.

186
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,408
Feitan’s group won’t be arriving 
until evening.

187
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,327
We’ll wait until everyone’s here.

188
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,330
[Pakunoda] Impatient as usual.

189
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,583
Damn. That’s an entire 
half day of waiting.

190
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,003
Hey! If it isn’t Shizuku.

191
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,713
Hello.

192
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,467
Has the other new addition arrived yet?

193
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,760
Dunno.

194
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,136
You should ask Machi.

195
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,417
[Dalzollene] This is for September.

196
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,504
What’s this? Seems like there’s a lot.

197
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,672
It is.

198
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,676
Both Mister Trink and Mister Rottfelli 
would like their fortunes told.

199
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,428
Aw… That sucks.

200
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,515
I told you I was gonna quit 
if you added any more.

201
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,642
And I do apologize.

202
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,646
Your father counts them both 
among his closest associates.

203
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,315
Well? Where is Papa, anyway?

204
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,568
He had a very pressing meeting 
to attend to.

205
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,530
He’s probably off hunting or playing golf.

206
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,659
Papa? This is Neon.

207
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,080
What? No way! 
You can’t fool me that easily!

208
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,833
No. No!

209
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,584
Huh?

210
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,086
Hmm...

211
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,297
Fine, if you keep your word.

212
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,882
But break one more promise 
and I’ll quit for real!

213
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,846
Hooray! I’m getting 
another piece of treasure!

214
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,598
[chuckles] Sweet deal, huh?

215
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,475
Well, congratulations.

216
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,103
‘Kay… now that that’s settled,

217
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,229
I’ll get this over with.

218
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,154
LOVELY GHOSTWRITER: 
ANGELIC AUTO WRITING

219
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,136
[Basho] I heard somewhere 
that she’s an incredible fortune teller.

220
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,389
Thanks to her father’s connections

221
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,351
she’s got some VIP clients 
in the underworld.

222
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,020
You have it backwards.

223
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,396
That so?

224
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,231
I’d say that the father

225
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,776
has used his daughter 
to increase his standing

226
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,611
and move up in the underworld.

227
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,989
And that’s why the prospect of losing her

228
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,949
is so frightening to him.

229
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,162
He’s afraid his enemies might retaliate 
by targeting his daughter.

230
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,083
Okay, all done.

231
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,626
Here.

232
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,877
Excellent work.

233
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,464
Tomorrow’s auction starts at night, 
doesn’t it?

234
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,508
I want to go shopping beforehand.

235
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,594
If that’s what you want, 
I shall accompany you.

236
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,610
How many years has it been, I wonder…

237
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,530
since all 13 of the Troupe members 
got together?

238
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,864
Feitan?

239
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,784
Three years, two months.

240
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,703
But two have changed since then.

241
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,040
Numbers four and eight 
are different.

242
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,918
Machi. Do you...

243
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,088
think number four, Hisoka, 
will actually show up?

244
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,756
No idea…

245
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,258
Don't ask me.

246
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,468
[giant] Wasn't he your responsibility?

247
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,345
I just told him to be here.

248
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,181
[Feitan] I don't like Hisoka.

249
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,643
Why does the boss let him do 
as he pleases?

250
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,437
For his skills, probably.

251
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,355
[derisive snort] Skills?

252
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,817
Well, his Bungee Gum 
is certainly very impressive.

253
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,361
It would be difficult 
for anyone to counter.

254
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,321
[Feitan] Are you saying

255
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,158
that the boss is afraid of Hisoka?

256
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,326
Watch yourself.

257
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,995
[man] That’s not what I meant.

258
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,663
Quit being generous.

259
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,249
You’re giving the guy way too much credit.

260
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,459
[wry snort]

261
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,669
Talk is as cheap as it ever was.

262
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,805
Shut up...

263
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,516
or this is what happens, Nobunaga.

264
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,270
You were talking just 
as much as I was, Franklin.

265
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,482
-Here we go again. 
-[Feitan] Ignore them.

266
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,817
They’re just playing around.

267
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,489
[Machi] So, why is the chief 
calling everyone together, anyway?

268
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,948
[Feitan] We’re thieves,

269
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,452
I assume he wants us to steal something.

270
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,329
[Machi] Well, that much I know.

271
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,586
[Dalzollene] Yes. 
We’ve arrived safely at the hotel.

272
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,006
But one of the young mistress’s fortunes 
concerns me…

273
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,635
“In the basement where prices rise…

274
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,304
Your bed shall be made with your brothers.

275
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,349
Do not descend stairs 
you have never climbed.

276
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,852
In numbers do not compete with others.”

277
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,856
And there are three other poems 
that begin with the same verse,

278
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,942
meaning that all four of the clients

279
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,319
received fortunes 
that are nearly identical.

280
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,030
It seems the only thing 
that connects them,

281
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,366
is that at this year’s 
Underground Auction,

282
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,535
each one of them will be attending.

283
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,497
[Nostrade] So the fortune says 
their lives are at risk,

284
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,457
should they choose to participate?

285
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,251
I think...

286
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,753
the ‘sleep’ imagery is a metaphor

287
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,381
for illness or for death.

288
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,549
[Nostrade] Understood.

289
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,718
I will pass the fortunes 
along to the clients.

290
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,971
There’s one more thing, sir…

291
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,473
The young mistress is never able

292
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,725
to remember the fortunes she’s told

293
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,561
and she cannot tell her own.

294
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,314
Does it make sense 
to let her take part in the auction?

295
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,651
[Nostrade] No! Bring her back immediately!

296
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,654
However, without a proper explanation,

297
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,614
she won’t listen to a word I say.

298
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,408
And if she throws a tantrum,

299
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,118
we won’t be able to stop her.

300
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,119
[laughing]

301
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,330
In any case, 
do not take her to the auction.

302
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,333
Send some bodyguards 
to place the bids instead.

303
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,127
[Dalzollene] Understood.

304
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,630
[heavy exhale]

305
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,010
[Nostrade] Neon...

306
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,851
[Phinks clicking tongue] 
He isn’t coming.

307
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,228
[Feitan] The sun is almost up.

308
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,521
[Uvogin] Dammit, Hisoka.

309
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,649
Next time I see him, 
I’ll tear him apart.

310
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,488
[Hisoka] Oh, dear…

311
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,700
That sounds quite gruesome indeed.

312
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,453
I’m simply terrified.

313
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,496
[Uvogin] Hisoka, you bastard!

314
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,123
Guess you’re running a bit late.

315
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,792
[Machi] 
I was starting to think you wouldn’t show.

316
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,880
Why wouldn’t I? 
You asked me to come, didn’t you?

317
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,674
Had I broken my promise,

318
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,386
I would never have the pleasure 
of seeing your Nen Stitches again.

319
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,223
-[Machi snorts derisively] 
-Okay, boss. Everyone’s here!

320
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,692
Well, boss? 
What are we stealing this time?

321
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,697
We will take the treasures 
of the Underground Auction.

322
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,824
Which treasures do you want?

323
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,743
Ancient texts, maybe?

324
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,703
The boss does like books.

325
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,623
[Feitan] No. But perhaps games.

326
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,002
There will be many copies 
of the most expensive game ever.

327
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,756
Wouldn’t it be more logical 
to take precious metals and gemstones?

328
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,591
[boss] All of it.

329
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,720
We'll be taking everything 
that's up for auction.

330
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,642
Hold on, boss. 
Are you serious?

331
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,438
The Underground Auction is operated 
by gangs from all over the world!

332
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,856
Just think about it!

333
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:55,236
If we do that, we’re gonna make enemies 
out of every last one of ‘em!

334
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,823
Are you scared, Uvogin?

335
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,159
No way! I’m ecstatic!

336
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,120
I can’t stop shaking!

337
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,373
Come on! Give us the order, boss!

338
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,542
I want it now!

339
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,799
I give you permission to kill them all.

340
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,345
Anyone who dares to get in our way.

341
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:28,144
[Uvogin roaring in excitement]

342
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,020
[Dalzollene] Good work.

343
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,273
I have your next assignment.

344
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,776
You must win the three items on this list 
at the Underground Auction.

345
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,528
Money is no object.

346
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,369
The intact mummy of Princess Corco.

347
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,621
A tissue used by the actor,

348
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,125
Sonne Limarch, 
with a certificate of DNA authenticity.

349
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,170
And...

350
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,132
the eyes of a Kurta, 
known as the Scarlet Eyes.

351
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,675
[seething breaths]

352
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,889
Also, we’ve received information

353
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,057
that there might be an attack 
on the auction.

354
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,935
So be prepared for any contingency,

355
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,438
but keep your focus 
on the primary objective

356
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,315
of obtaining these items.

357
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,157
They're coming.

358
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,868
They’re definitely coming!

359
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:32,541
[narrator] Kurapika eagerly awaits 
his revenge against the Phantom Troupe,

360
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,585
a band of murdering thieves.

361
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,797
The sun has risen 
on the first day of the auction,

362
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,424
where all sides will soon collide.

363
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,139
[theme song playing]

364
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,247
[Gon] Coming up:

365
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,707
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

366
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,208
[both] Hunterpedia!

367
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,877
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

368
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,378
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

369
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,963
Today, we’re introducing Neon,

370
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,923
the daughter of the head 
of the Nostrade family.

371
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,049
She’s a Flesh Collector!

372
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,051
Her Nen ability’s 
the ‘Lovely Ghostwriter.’

373
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,970
I think I’d try to tell my own fortune.

374
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,680
[Gon] Turns out you can’t do that.

375
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,812
[Gon] Next time: "Defend x And x Attack"!

376
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,857
[Gon] Killua! Are you better 
at defending or attacking?

377
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,526
-[Killua] What do you think? 
-[Gon] Um... attacking?

378
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,527
[Killua] Bingo.
