You can have the win.

never actually decided

who we were gonna have compete.

166

Bisky: You already told everyone
you were going to do the sumo.

167

Razor: I don’t care
who you give the win to,

168
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,513
so just give it
to one of the guys

you win sumo.

with an eight-on-eight game...

Razor: Yes, one point each.

Eight points will go
to whichever team is victorious.

Tsezgerra: So that’s
how this works.

187

No matter how many
of his weaker members we defeat,

Looks like we have
an eight-on-eight game.

276
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,722
Here are the rules.

277
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:05,025
Each team starts
with seven players on the court

278
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,426
and one out.

279
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,996
First team with no players
in the court loses.

280
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,732
Any player who’s hit
with a ball while in the court

281
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,735
is out and goes outside.
However,

282
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,738
you may bring one player
inside the court again

283
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,940
by saying, "back."

284
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,776
Also if the ball lands
outside the court

285
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,944
and you don’t have
any players there,

286
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,180
the opposing team gets the ball.

287
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,950
Now the important stuff.

288
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,952
We’ll use the cushion rule.

289
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,154
Ricochets are live
until they land.

290
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:38,426
For example, if I throw the ball
and it hits opposing player a,

291
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,460
ricochets, and hits
opposing player b

292
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:44,765
before hitting the floor,
both a and b are out.

293
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,199
Goreinu: But in that scenario,

294
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,770
if player b can catch the ball,
then player a is safe.

295
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:50,971
Razor: Exactly.

296
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,139
But let’s say
that I throw the ball

297
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,375
and it hits
opposing player a, ricochets,

298
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,811
and hits my own teammate,
player c,

299
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,347
before hitting the floor,

300
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,983
only player c is out, not a.

301
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,284
Goreinu: Let me
get this straight.

302
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:05,986
So if player c catches the ball,

303
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,388
does that mean player a is out?

304

to the court using "back."

Whenever you’re ready.

What did you just say?

is that we’re ready
to defeat you now.

Goreinu: He stopped it
with one hand.

335

Razor: Time for us
to launch the counterattack.

336
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,485
( Goreinu gasps )
He’s so far back.

337

Is he gonna pass it?

338
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,194
So fast!

339

of the court.

348
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,590
Razor: Oh, I see.
You have the ability

349
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,259
to change places
with your nen beasts.

350
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:30,597
Bisky: The nen creature
was completely shattered.

351
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:33,601
That must reflect what goreinu
imagined would happen

352
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:36,237
when he saw razor’s attack.

353
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,272
Tsezgerra:
He instantly saw the gap

354
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,008
between our opponent’s strength
and his own.

355
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,077
He won’t easily rid himself
of that image,

356
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,648
and it’ll be impossible
for him to recover in time.

357
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,651
He’s finished, no question.

358
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:54,388
Killua: So goreinu’s nen beast
is the one that’s out, right?

359
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:57,357
Number zero: Right. The switch
was performed with nen,

360
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,260
so it didn’t break any rules.

361
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,630
However, if you wish for goreinu
to return to the court,

362
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:04,665
you’ll have to use "back."

363
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,633
( Goreinu sighs )
Damn it.

364

I can’t let it end like this.

365

Razor: Now let’s move on.

is so fast.

Tsezgerra: S-such speed.

368
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,217

Not good.

Razor: He focused his aura
in his back.

That’s the only reason
that wasn’t a fatal blow.

Don’t touch me.

i’m really out of shape.

Damn it.
In overall combat ability,

I should be stronger
than those two by a long shot,

388

but in basics
like agility and reflexes,

389
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,176
I simply can’t compete.

my training over from scratch.

which order to pick them off in.

Killua: Question, ref.

413
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,469
What happens if the last player
inside the court gets hit,

414
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:24,638
but calls, "back,"
at the same time?

415
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,474

There would still be a moment

when no players
were on the court,
