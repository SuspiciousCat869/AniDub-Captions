1
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,175
Ging: Hmm?

2
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,677
What do you want?

3
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,546
cheadle: I heard
that you are leaving tomorrow.

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,649
Walking away from the election
and your son?

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,350
Ging: That bald shrimp!

6
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,254
Why did he tell her,
of all people?

7
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,990
Cheadle: Why not stay
and see it through?

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,992
Ging: We already know
the outcome.

I’ve had my fun, so i’m going.

00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,364
Meeting that leorio guy
was the highlight.

11
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,267
He’s got huge potential.
No doubt about that.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,169
Cheadle: What are
you talking about?

13
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,205
We’ve got four candidates left.
Nothing’s been decided.

14
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,040
Ging: Yeah, exactly.

15
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,175
That is what i’m talking about.

But if you really wanted to win,

33
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,124
then you should have tried
a lot harder before.

34
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,727
You needed to secure a majority

35

and clear
the turnout requirement.

36

Cheadle: Why are you
telling me this?

39
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,237
All that’s easy to say
in hindsight.

40
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,473
Ging: If i’d warned you
about it beforehand,

41
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,141
you’d have done the opposite.

Ugh. You’re so difficult.

look, feel free
to chalk it up to hindsight.

44

It won’t make judgment day
come any slower.

45

Cheadle: Wait! Stop!

( Cheadle sighs )

48
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,258
Fine. I’ll do whatever you say.

00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,127
What’s it going to be?

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,629
Ging: It sure doesn’t sound
like you’re too happy about it.

51
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,834
Cheadle: I have no idea
what pariston is thinking.

( Sighs )

53
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,639
So can you tell me
how to beat him?

54
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,707
Ging: You’ve never done
anything i’ve said.

55
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,577
this seems a bit
out of character for you, but...

56
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:01,648
All right, fine. We’ll begin
with pariston’s way of thinking.

57
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,750
Listen closely.

58
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,254
He doesn’t want to win,
not really,

59
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,289
but he doesn’t want
to lose, either.

60
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,592
That makes him strong.

61
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,193
( Cheadle gasps )

62
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,896
Hold on. How can that be?

63
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,864
Ging: Yeah, yeah, I know.

64
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,733
Your strong common sense
tells you

65
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,769
that your will to win
makes you the stronger one.

66
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,471
I’m right, aren’t I?

67
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,907
Nothing wrong with that.
you’re right.

68
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,310
and that’s why
you’re so easy to read,

69
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,647
especially when you
want to win a game,

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,417
and you can’t win this game
unless you have more votes.

71
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,186
Cheadle: A game?

72
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,789
Ging: See? You thought I was
just being amoral, didn’t you?

73
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,426
and because you’re
so big on morals, balance,

74
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,329
and doing things by the book,
that ticks you off.

75
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,430
( Cheadle scoffs )

76
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,165
Ging: Hey, look at me!

77
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,734
You’re not acting much like
your dog persona right now.

78
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,335
You’re just being yourself.

79
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,539
Pariston’s familiar
with both sides of you,

80
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,608
so he knows when you switch
from one to the other.

81
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,777
he knows exactly
what you’re thinking about

82
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,745
and what you’ll do next.

83
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,783
It makes you easy to beat,
and he still doesn’t want to.

84
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,950
He’s tough, right?

85
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,320
Cheadle: Then what
do you suggest I do?

86
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,554
Ging: I told you already!

87
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,757
sure, I could
just tell you what to do,

88
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,259
but, if I did,
you’d never listen.

89
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,495
How many times do we
have to go through this?

90
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,232
Okay, i’ll tell you
what’s gonna happen

91
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,967
if the game continues as is.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,969
After the next vote,

93
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,571
you and pariston
will be all that’s left.

94
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,574
In the two-candidate vote
after that,

95
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,676
first and second will flip.

96
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,211
( Cheadle gasps )

97
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:40,380
Ging: That’s gonna happen
every single time.

98
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,650
( Cheadle sighs )

99
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,785
Pariston wants
the turnout rate low,

100
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,487
so we can expect
the temp hunters

101
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,591
he has under his thumb
to abstain, all of them.

102
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,825
Cheadle: Why’s that?

103
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,427
Ging: Like I said,

104
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,296
it’s a game he doesn’t
want to win or lose,

105
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,732
so he’ll drag this out
until the last day.

106
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,402
He just wants to have some fun.

107
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,371
He’s just like netero and me.

108
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,307
well, except I
get bored a lot faster.

109
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:09,910
But that guy is patient.

110
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,745
If the vote was about

111
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,347
who’s following
in netero’s footsteps...

112
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,318
Pariston’s the winner.

113
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,719
( Cheadle gasps )

114
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,455
Shut up! I don’t want
to hear that from you!

115
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,926
Ging: You’re jealous of him,
aren’t you?

116
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,663
what, did you love
that pervy old man that much?

117
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,432
Cheadle: Shut up!

118
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,834
You are so arrogant!

119
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,536
You just have to tell me
when the election will end,

120
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,373
you idiot!
So go on! When is it?

121
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,044
Ging: Sure, I can do that,
but, before it’s over,

122
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,681
learn to stay in character.
You’re impossible to talk to.

123
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:53,320
The day netero blew up,
100 airships

124
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,557
belonging to the association
set off for east gorteau.

125
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,661
There’s no record
of their departure.

126
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,664
On paper, they’re all
in hangars for maintenance.

127
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,733
You didn’t know anything
about that, did you?

128
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,770
you should make friends
with some mechanics and pilots.

129
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,673
Cheadle: What are
you talking about?

130
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,709
ging: They recovered
approximately 5,000 cocoons,

131
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,477
half-human, half-beast cocoons

132
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,913
that were made
by the chimera ants.

133
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,518
they have
the ability to use nen,

134
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,487
and i’d be willing to bet
they’ve hatched by now.

135
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,557
And now that he’s got
such a big playground,

136
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,494
pariston plans to have
a little fun with them.

137
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:37,931
The day of reckoning will be
the day of the next hunter exam.

138
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,801
however,
if the bylaws are reformed,

139
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,036
the situation might change some.

140
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,540
Figure the rest out yourself.

141
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,041
You’re a hunter, right?

142
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,680
- ( Fanfare playing )
- Piyon: All right, everyone!

143
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,716
we will now begin
the eighth round of voting

144
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,118
for the election
of the 13th chairman.

145
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:02,589
Each of the four candidates
will help us kick things off

146
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,625
by reading speeches
they’ve prepared.

147
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,794
After that, we’ll hold
a brief q-and-a session.

148
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,631
Then we’ll move on to the vote.

149
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:14,034
Leorio: How in the hell
did this happen?

150
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,437
( Sighs )
I guess it’s my fault.

151
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,074
piyon: Now, not all
of the candidates qualified,

152
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,642
and those that didn’t

153
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:25,546
will begin with their comments
for the association.

154
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,882
Botobai: I’ll start by thanking
everyone who supported me

155
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,051
in this election.
Thank you all.

156
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:34,621
But moving forward, I ask
for those who had faith in me

157
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,557
to support
a different candidate,

158
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,459
and I strongly believe

( Crowd gasping )

318
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,923
You see, i’ve learned something
after serving

319
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:06,026
as chairman netero’s
vice chairman for three years.

320
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,396
There are three conditions
vital for a chairman to meet.

321
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,998
First is combat strength!

322
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:16,236
That is, given the nature
of what we do, quite necessary,

323
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,606
as evidenced
by the recent events.

324
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:21,208
Second is experience!

325
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:24,444
Wisdom is much enhanced
by experience.

326
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:27,915
As a hunter, of course you can
never have too much of it.

I get so incredibly irritated.

he’s never saying

333
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,233
what he’s truly thinking.

would make great leaders.
