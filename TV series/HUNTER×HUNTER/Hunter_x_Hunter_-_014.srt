Strange beasts

[squeaking]

5
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,468
Vast riches.

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,803
Hidden treasures.

7
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:14,932
Evil haunts.

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,643
Uncharted frontiers.

9
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,522
The mysterious unknown.

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,276
The people who are captivated by 
the magic in those words...

11
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,028
are called...

12
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,742
Hunters.

13
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,158
[grunting]

14
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,952
[Kurapika] 
We entered the long and difficult path,

15
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,121
broke down the wall,

16
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,749
and from there we snuck into 
the short and easy one.

17
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,920
Even under pressure, you were able 
to calmly assess our options,

18
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,131
and think of a way 
to get around them.

19
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,092
And that is what makes you so special.

20
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:19,139
HIT x THE x TARGET

21
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,562
[narrator] One by one, 
each of the 24 applicants who passed

22
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,066
the third phase of 
the Hunter Exam exited Trick Tower,

23
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,486
eager for a long awaited breath 
of fresh air.

24
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,761
Congratulations on escaping 
Trick Tower, everyone.

25
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,974
All that remain now are 
the Fourth Phase and the Final Phase.

26
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,559
Only two more.

27
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,398
The Fourth Phase will take place 
right over there on Zevil Island.

28
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,066
Now, let's proceed.

29
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,575
To begin with I will need each of you 
to draw lots now.

30
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,661
-[surprised gasping] 
-Really?

31
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,913
Draw lots for what? 
What will that decide?

32
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,876
[amused] Hm. Who you hunt, 
and who hunts you.

33
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:34,047
In this box are exactly 24 
numbered cards.

34
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,882
Which means,

35
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,928
that one of the numbered cards 
will correspond with your badge.

36
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:45,517
Now, each of you will draw a card 
in the order you exited the tower.

37
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,019
All right. 
Which of you was first?

38
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,669
[clicking noises]

39
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,966
Guess that means I'm next.

40
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,348
After him, I'm next.

41
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,275
-Oh, hey, Killua. 
-Huh?

42
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,903
He mentioned us hunting and being hunted.

43
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,947
Do you think that means 
we're gonna be fighting each other?

44
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,324
Yeah, probably does.

45
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,867
[whistles]

46
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,855
Now, I don't know 
what this is all about,

47
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,942
but I know you've got to draw it 
like you mean it.

48
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,985
Yeah!

49
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,248
[Lippo] 
Has everyone drawn?

50
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,545
Very well. Now if you would, 
please go ahead and remove the sticker.

51
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,766
The number you see is your target.

52
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,309
[gasping]

53
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,571
[breathes uneasily]

54
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,908
This box has recorded the number 
that each of you drew.

55
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,161
Each card was tallied 
and then stored in memory.

56
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,163
So if you like,

57
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:16,209
you're free to dispose of the cards. 
It makes no difference at this point.

58
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,630
The objective is to steal 
your target's ID badge.

59
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,340
Oh, good.

60
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,301
So we don't have to kill each other, then.

61
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,388
The method is up to you. 
Procure the badge however you see fit.

62
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,852
But if you kill your target, 
you can take their badge easily.

63
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,188
Yeah, that sure sounds like 
the fastest way to me.

64
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,566
[sounding scared] 
So that's how it's gonna be?

65
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,860
Come on, there's nothing to be scared of.

66
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,320
[Lippo] 
Listen carefully!

67
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,699
Collecting the ID badge of 
your specified target

68
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,826
will earn you three points. Understand?

69
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,580
Your own badge is also worth three points.

70
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,334
And all the other badges 
are worth one point.

71
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:02,464
In order to move on to the Final Phase, 
you will have to collect six points.

72
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,425
So during your time there on Zevil Island,

73
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,596
gather enough badges to collect six points 
or fail the Exam.

74
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:15,769
Only those who do will clear 
the Fourth Phase of the Hunter Exam.

75
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,444
[Khara] I'd like to commend all of you 
on your work in the Exam's Third Phase.

76
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:30,116
I'll be your guide. It's nice to meet you. 
You can call me Khara.

77
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:35,580
It will take two hours for this boat 
to reach its destination, Zevil Island.

78
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:40,585
All 24 applicants who've made it this far 
are granted an open invitation

79
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,005
to participate again in next year's Exam 
no matter what!

80
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,259
So even if you don't pass this time, 
we really hope you'll try again.

81
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,180
Never say die, right... everybody?

82
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,768
[Khara] 
Wow, that went over well..

83
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,439
It appears the battle has already begun.

84
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,108
You're right.

85
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,527
Everybody has already taken off 
their badges

86
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,530
and tucked them away 
so they won't get stolen yet.

87
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,323
All right, everyone.

88
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,868
For the next two hours, 
you're all free to do whatever you like.

89
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,872
Thank you and I hope you all enjoy 
the rest of the voyage.

90
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,506
[grunts] 
So, uh...

91
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,299
hypothetically,

92
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,261
if you happened to be my target, I mean...

93
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,097
Don't expect me to show you any mercy, 
okay?

94
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,890
Well, of course not.

95
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:40,353
If you happened to be my target 
I would say the same thing to you.

96
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,772
Am I your target? Really?

97
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,276
[chuckles] 
I'm speaking hypothetically.

98
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,529
Oh yeah, I knew that. 
We're speaking hypothetically.

99
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,740
Hm. 
You needn't worry.

100
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,075
You're not my target, Leorio.

101
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,577
Oh, I see.

102
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,039
Uh, oh! So you know, 
you're not my target, either.

103
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,212
Hey.

104
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,476
So, uh... Who did you get?

105
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,436
What did you draw?

106
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,854
It's a secret.

107
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,027
[laughing]

108
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,446
Don't worry about it.

109
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,907
You're not my target, Gon. 
I promise.

110
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,493
That's good. 
Because you're not mine, either.

111
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,831
You want to show our numbers 
at the same time?

112
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,124
Okay.

113
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,126
Ready, and!

114
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,879
[gasps]

115
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,589
[Killua Zoldyck] 
Number 44 is...

116
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,636
[Gon Freecss] 
Really?

117
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,390
You've got seriously bad luck.

118
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,142
Oh, do you think so?

119
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,522
So, who is number 199, anyway?

120
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,733
-I'm not sure, I thought maybe you knew. 
-No.

121
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,777
If I'd have just been smarter about it,

122
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,779
I would have memorized 
everybody's numbers.

123
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,658
Once he explained it, 
that's when I started paying attention.

124
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,452
But everyone had taken off 
their badges already.

125
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,121
Pretty lame, huh?

126
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,166
[uneasy breathing]

127
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,961
Gon.

128
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,921
Oh, what's up?

129
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,300
Are you happy or scared right now? 
Which one is it?

130
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,553
Oh.

131
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,266
Kind of both, 
I guess.

132
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:48,273
If I had to fight with Hisoka one-on-one, 
I wouldn't stand a chance against him.

133
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,110
But if all I have to do 
is just steal his badge,

134
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,280
I don't know, 
I think I might actually have a real shot.

135
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,614
Yeah.

136
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,035
The way it is now, 
well, at least I've got a chance.

137
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,956
And to be honest, 
it does scare me a little bit.

138
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,250
But I think it's worth it.

139
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,086
I gotcha.

140
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,215
Well, let's do our best.

141
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,138
Don't die, okay?

142
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,932
Yeah, and same to you.

143
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:35,028
[Khara] Thanks for being patient, 
everyone. We've arrived at Zevil Island!

144
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,404
Okay then.

145
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,574
You will be disembarking in the order 
you completed the Third Phase,

146
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,492
from the shortest to the longest.

147
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,953
Ugh, not this again.

148
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,080
You'll go ashore one at a time,

149
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,709
with two minute intervals separating 
each of the applicants, all right?

150
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,962
I guess that means 
we'll be waiting here a while.

151
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:53,963
Yeah.

152
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,925
[Khara] You'll be on the island 
exactly one week.

153
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,092
That means

154
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,428
you only have seven days 
to collect your six points

155
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,805
and then return to this location.

156
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,559
First applicant, 
get ready to disembark now.

157
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,320
Now I understand.

158
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,489
The first to go ashore 
have the advantage.

159
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,284
Right. They can hide 
and watch everyone's movements,

160
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,204
including their target's, 
before they make their move.

161
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,331
That's two minutes.

162
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,250
The second person may go.

163
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,793
-[clicking noises] 
-[Khara gulps]

164
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,591
The third person may go.

165
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,093
Yeah, all right!

166
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,512
The seventh person.

167
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,806
The eleventh person.

168
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,058
The fifteenth person.

169
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,561
The twentieth person may go.

170
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,319
That's two minutes. 
The twenty-first person may go.

171
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,322
-Bye. 
-Bye.

172
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,121
Okay.

173
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,332
I guess I'll start off 
by scouting the island.

174
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,587
That's two minutes. 
The twenty-second person may go.

175
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,006
Great.

176
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,799
-See ya. 
-Good luck.

177
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,932
[Gon] 
First, I've got to find Hisoka.

178
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:32,520
HUNTER GLOSSARY

179
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,733
ZEVIL ISLAND

180
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,577
[Gon] 
How am I going to steal Hisoka's badge?

181
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,790
Such a good boy.

182
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,877
[Gon grunting]

183
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,920
Very nice.

184
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,132
I'm beginning to get excited.

185
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,469
[Gon, gasping for air]

186
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,849
[coughing]

187
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,435
Hmm.

188
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,650
[Gon] I definitely can't get his badge 
in a head-to-head fight.

189
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,118
It's an applicant.

190
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,707
And there's another one behind him.

191
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,002
[groans]

192
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,047
[Gon] 
He's targeting the guy in front.

193
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,075
[grunting]

194
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,495
[cries out]

195
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,580
[Gon] 
He missed!

196
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,252
That was close. 
A little too close, even.

197
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,758
Sorry, pal, but I don't go down that easy. 
[begins to slur]

198
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,345
[groans] 
What the...

199
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,267
You bastard.

200
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,479
I coated the arrow with 
a fast-acting tranquilizer.

201
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,649
So you're not going to be able 
to walk much for about a week.

202
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,901
Don't worry, though.

203
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,695
There's fresh water nearby.

204
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,447
So you probably won't die.

205
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,491
But I'll be taking this, of course.

206
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,160
Later.

207
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,956
[Gon] 
Wow.

208
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,625
He was able to hide his presence

209
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,752
while he quietly stalked his prey.

210
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,091
And his target sensed the shot being fired 
and was able to dodge it,

211
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,136
avoiding what would've been 
a serious injury.

212
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,556
But, the stalker had that covered,

213
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,766
coating his arrow with poison.

214
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,729
So that's how you hunt!

215
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,615
If I'm going to have any chance 
of stealing Hisoka's badge,

216
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,408
that's the only way.

217
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,711
First, I'll have to sneak up on him 
without being noticed,

218
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,131
then wait for my chance,

219
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,591
and take it!

220
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,720
[yelling] 
All right!

221
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:02,188
But this target's not moving 
like Hisoka will be.

222
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,065
[sighs]

223
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,237
Either way, 
I'll only get one shot.

224
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,989
I've got to hook his badge 
while he's not paying attention,

225
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,699
or I don't stand a chance.

226
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,121
[grunts] 
Okay.

227
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,754
Try to read his movements.

228
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,593
[yelling] And now!

229
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,436
[grunts]

230
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,776
[Gon] Aw. 
This won't do it.

231
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,738
It's way too easy 
to follow a swinging target.

232
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,992
I already know exactly where 
it's gonna go.

233
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,370
[croaking]

234
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,711
That's right.

235
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,006
I've got to remember, 
he'll try to move out of the way.

236
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,676
[water running]

237
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,813
[Gon] If I can't catch a flying bird 
by watching how it moves,

238
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,566
then I'll never be able to steal 
Hisoka's badge.

239
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,407
[grunts]

240
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,828
Almost.

241
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,747
Oh well.

242
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,541
I really can't expect to catch a bird 
on my very first try.

243
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,170
[yelling] There! 
All right! [grunts]

244
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:56,969
[sighs]

245
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,349
Got to figure out 
whose number this is.

246
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,606
The sun is just about to set.

247
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,068
I should probably stay in one location 
until morning.

248
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,571
[panting]

249
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,954
Damn. I didn't think 
all this was going to be so hard.

250
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,918
It's way too dark for me 
to see anything.

251
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,087
And there aren't any birds out 
anymore.

252
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,881
Guess I'll start fresh in the morning.

253
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,648
All right, now it's back to training!

254
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,401
[Gon grunts]

255
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,870
[panting] 
It's hopeless.

256
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,998
Maybe this is impossible.

257
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,710
Catching a bird mid-flight...

258
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,004
accurately? 
What was I even thinking?

259
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,424
Hm?

260
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,267
But, if a bird can catch a fish 
while it's swimming...

261
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,365
There it goes!

262
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,124
That's it!

263
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,501
That's the key.

264
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,255
That's how I can tell 
when my target's going to move.

265
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,234
Now! 
[grunts]

266
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,572
I did it!

267
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,699
I figured it out!

268
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,661
I've just got to go for the target 
the moment it goes for its prey.

269
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,918
[man] 
Huh, the kid's impressive.

270
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,170
He actually mastered 
the art of the hunt.

271
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,259
But concentration like that 
will come back to bite you. [snickers]

272
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,723
[narrator] Gon finally mastered the trick

273
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,892
that would aide him 
in his hunt for Hisoka.

274
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,145
However, 
unbeknownst to him,

275
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,980
Gon was being hunted himself.

276
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,988
[Gon] Next time. 
"Explosion x of x Deception."

277
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,615
-Explode! 
-[Killua Zoldyck] Explode!

278
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:28,657
[Gon] Kaboom!

279
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,992
[Killua] Oh, mushroom.

280
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,036
