He protected his right

We don’t think it’s right
to let them die

327
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,652
just because we hate them.

328
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,688
Both sides
risk their lives in battle,

329
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:04,491
and both are prepared
to kill if necessary,

330
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:08,763
but when the fight’s over, well,
those rules cease to apply.

331
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,864
Gon: I still
haven’t forgiven genthru

332
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:14,135
for killing all those other
players, not yet, at least,

333
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:15,870
but before the fight
even started,

334
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:17,571
the three of us agreed

335
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,574
we’d bring six clone cards
with us just in case.

336
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,643
I don’t really remember
why we decided that,

337
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:25,679
but I do know one thing.

338
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,881
It wasn’t based
on logic or reason.

339
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:31,085
It just made sense to all of us.

340
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,886
Once the fight was over

341
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,089
and we’d obtained
the angel’s breath card,

342
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,691
we would use it
on whoever was hurt.

343
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,695
We made the decision together,
so we wanted to stick to it,

344
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,097
but I get how you feel,
Mr. Goreinu.

345
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,899
Guess it can’t be helped.

346
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,802
Sorry, killua.

347
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:50,071
Could you wait a little longer?

348
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,905
Killua: Not a problem.

349
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,108
My hands will eventually heal
on their own.

350
00:17:57,945 --> 00:18:01,582
Gon: Things have changed,
so we can’t use clone anymore,

351
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,917
and there’s just
one angel’s breath left.

352
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:05,853
Goreinu: Hang on. Only one?

353
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:07,821
Are you talking
about the original card?

354

to use it on genthru.

Goreinu: Well, to be honest,

366
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:36,483
even before you
told me everything,

367
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:39,520
i’d decided to give it to you,
and not just angel’s breath,

368

but all the cards
that we gathered in the game.

Thing is, we all decided
to quit the game.

Gon: So Mr. Battera...

375
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,441
Goreinu: Yeah,
he paid off team tsezguerra

376
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,943
for breaking the contract.

377
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,945
I settled
for four billion Jenny.

some of that over now!

380

what are you talking about?

381
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,185
Of course you get some.

I could never
have done this on my own.

It was only possible,
