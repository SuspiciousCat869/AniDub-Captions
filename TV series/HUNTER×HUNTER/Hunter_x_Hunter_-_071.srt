332

Another player
has cast contact on you.

Phinks: This is phinks.
We found him.

334
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,189
We’re heading in your direction
as we speak.

335

( Hisoka chuckles )

336
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,227
Bara: Wouldn’t it be faster
to target the kids?

337
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,964
They probably don’t have
the original strip of beach,

338
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,766
but I bet they got a copy.

339
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,504
Genthru: If so, it would be
a card created by clone.

340
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,372
Bara: Yeah, you’re right.

341
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,241
Genthru: Once those kids
see tsezguerra surrender,

342
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,778
they’ll give up
without a fight.

343
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,746
If we target the brats,

344
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,748
tsezguerra will have
time to recover,

345
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,516
which could be
rather troublesome.

346
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,752
He’s a single-star hunter,
after all,

347
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,788
and we don’t know
what his ability is.

348
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:05,392
Tsezgerra: Genthru doesn’t know
what you’re capable of.

349
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,927
He and his team assume

350
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,663
that we have
the original strip of beach,

351
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,399
and that could prove
to be very helpful.

352
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:15,669
So they’re after what they
think is the original card,

353
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,003
the one we have.

354
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,007
We’ll buy you
as much time as possible.

355
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,409
Use it to regain your strength.

356
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,511
If you want to beat this game,

357
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,814
you’ll have no choice
but to fight them.

358
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:30,317
You’re the only ones
with a chance of beating them.

359
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,018
There’s no doubt in my mind.

360
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:36,690
But, gon, what you did
just now was selfish.

361
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,426
But more than that,
it was incredibly foolish.

362
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,728
If they had accepted
your challenge and come,

363
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:43,564
what would have happened
to killua,

364
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:45,566
given the extent
of his injuries?

365
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,434
( Gon grunts )

366
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,736
Tsezgerra: By losing control
of your emotions,

367
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,972
you endangered
not only yourself,

368
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,574
but your friends, too.

369
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,643
I’m really sorry.

370
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,913
Tsezgerra: That aside,

371
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:01,048
it will all
come down to accompany.

372
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,350
If we can stave off
their pursuit,

373
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,852
we should be able
to buy plenty of time.

374
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:08,489
But if we let
too much time pass,

375
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,958
then they might
just decide to change things

376
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:12,626
and target you instead.

377
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,361
We probably have a week.

378
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,363
More, and you’re on your own.

379
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,866
Killua: One week.
That’s not very long,

380
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,336
and, to be honest,
it’s probably optimistic.

381
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,671
They might even decide
to focus on us

382
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:27,374
after only three days or so.

383
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,342
Goreinu: Then i’ll team up
with tsezguerra.

384
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,578
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

385
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,947
If we’re buying you time,

386
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,748
that implies
we have an alliance.

387
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,383
Tsezgerra: Wait.

388
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,586
There’s very little benefit
in allying with them,

389
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,589
especially now
that the enemy knows

390
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,991
that the eight of us
have been working together.

391
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:46,326
And that being the case,

392
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,062
we won’t be able
to act as decoys

393
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:49,797
while you take out genthru,

394
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,499
so of course
we’ll have to be careful

395
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,735
with the two cards
they still lack,

396
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,070
both number two and number 75.

397
00:18:57,104 --> 00:19:00,074
Leaving them with any one party
would be dangerous,

398
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:01,909
and we can’t afford the risk.

399
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:05,979
That means that my offer
to buy time isn’t an alliance.

400
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:08,449
What i’m offering you
is a trade.

401
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,717
Gon: A trade, huh?

402
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,985
Tsezgerra: Just three weeks,

403
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:13,721
that’s all the time
we can buy you,

404
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:15,522
and if we succeed,

405
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:19,627
you’ll give us number 75,
the wild luck alexandrite card.

406
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,028
Killua: I don’t get it.

407
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:23,931
You just said
you could only buy us a week.

408
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,098
Tsezgerra: Well, that’s assuming

409
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,134
that we stay on the run
for that long.

410
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:31,705

to force a stalemate of sorts.

412
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,808
But if you guys
really want 75,

413

we’ll just tell you how
you can get your hands on it.

414
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:40,948
Tsezgerra: No. We’re well aware
of how to obtain it.

415
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:44,151

a few empty slots left,

and that’s including goreinu.

417
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:48,989
We would be required
to turn all of our cards over

418
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,425
to the villagers,
and that’s no longer reasonable.

But that isn’t nearly enough
time for killua’s hands to heal
