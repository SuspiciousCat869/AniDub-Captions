1
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:05,589
Silva! Do it now!

2
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,769
[Silva grunts]

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,690
[explosion]

4
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,652
[theme music playing]

5
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,191
FAKE x AND x PSYCHE

6
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,322
[thunder clapping]

7
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,234
[indistinct chatter]

8
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,032
[man 1] Hey! What the hell is going on?

9
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,744
[man 2] It came from below 
There was a huge explosion underneath us.

10
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,040
I'm through with waiting! 
I’m gonna go see for myself!

11
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,000
[Bean] Everyone, calm down.

12
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,629
Moments ago, we were able to get 
in touch with the Ten Dons.

13
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,341
They wish to speak to you directly 
through a live video feed.

14
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,513
The auction will proceed as planned, 
so try to remain calm.

15
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,057
Please enter the auction hall 
on the tenth floor.

16
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,896
[executive 1] I'll be fine. 
This is on the tenth floor.

17
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,899
I'll be safe as long 
as I don't go downstairs.

18
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:15,862
[executive 2] It'll be alright. 
Her fortunes are 100 percent accurate.

19
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,534
[executive 3] As long as you heed 
the warning, her fortunes won’t come true.

20
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,161
Nothing to worry about.

21
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,544
[electricity surging]

22
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,922
Hey. How is everybody doing?

23
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:38,427
First, I apologize for being 
out of touch. Sorry.

24
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,931
Things got a little bit messy there, 
but everything is fine now.

25
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,644
The leader of the infamous Phantom Troupe 
has been dealt with.

26
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,438
[indistinct chatter]

27
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,567
It's only a matter of time 
before we get to the rest of them.

28
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,111
So leave all the hunting 
to the professionals

29
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,280
and enjoy the rest of your auction.

30
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,781
[audience cheering]

31
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,410
Tonight is a special occasion, 
so we’ll be watching live.

32
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,330
And of course, we look forward 
to seeing some serious bidding.

33
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,460
You heard it for yourselves, gentlemen.

34
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,547
The Ten Dons will be watching 
a live feed of the proceedings.

35
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,467
Please concentrate on the auction.

36
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:32,481
[fly buzzing]

37
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,574
[thunder crashing]

38
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,505
[phone ringing]

39
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,093
That you, Illumi?

40
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,888
[Illumi] Yeah. Where's my client?

41
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,681
[Silva] He's here.

42
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,268
[Zeno groaning]

43
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:18,068
Oh. Were you two just fighting? 
So, is he still alive?

44
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,573
Just in the nick of time. 
Good. Give him a message for me.

45
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,035
We've disposed of the Ten Dons.

46
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,498
And tell him to wire the money 
to the account. He knows the one.

47
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,211
Up we go. Well, what a surprise.

48
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,005
Seems we both get to live another day.

49
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,715
[Chrollo] But your mission?

50
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,844
[Zeno] 
The Ten Dons were our clients, you see.

51
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,764
And so now that they’ve all been 
disposed of, things have changed.

52
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,392
You are no longer our target.

53
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,478
Huh. I see.

54
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,481
You won't get another chance like this.

55
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,693
Perhaps. But you don’t really think 
we’re in this business

56
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,486
for the fun of it, do you?

57
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,448
It’s not as if we take any pleasure 
in killing.

58
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,994
And I certainly don’t want to work 
or die for nothing.

59
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,164
I was the one who commissioned Illumi 
to assassinate the Ten Dons.

60
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,207
Did you know that?

61
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:19,004
Of course, I did. But that is irrelevant. 
Makes no difference.

62
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,966
We simply do the job we're hired to do 
and nothing more.

63
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,175
I understand.

64
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,512
-So, can I ask you something? 
-[Zeno grunts]

65
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,767
If we were to fight, just the two of us, 
which of us would win?

66
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,646
Hmm. I would. 
There's no question about it.

67
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,900
Though it would be 
a different story altogether

68
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,277
if you were actually trying to kill me.

69
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,071
Damn insolent brat.

70
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,491
[Chrollo] So he knew?

71
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,631
[sighs]

72
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,552
[thudding]

73
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,055
I'm so beat!

74
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,267
I’ve no chance 
of stealing their abilities.

75
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,566
[Melody] So, you want us to wait 
at Hospital L?

76
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,903
[Kurapika] Yes, it's more dangerous here 
than we thought.

77
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,572
We'll send her over by ambulance 
in a short while.

78
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,576
[doctor] She's just unconscious, 
so you shouldn't have to worry.

79
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,872
But she'll certainly be a lot safer 
at the hospital than she is here.

80
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,248
Make the preparations.

81
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,463
[Franklin] Looks like you had fun, boss. 
You doing okay?

82
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,258
[Chrollo] Yeah. Just a little tired, 
that’s all.

83
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,303
You did go up against the Zoldyck family.

84
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,931
I wish I’d been there to see.

85
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,892
Watching how those two fought you 
would have been very informative.

86
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,771
[Feitan] 
Fighting would be more fun than watching.

87
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,109
Kortopi, are we all ready 
to do the next step?

88
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:09,322
Of course. I can't make living copies, 
just ones that don't move.

89
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,535
[Chrollo] Good enough. 
We'll stick to the plan.

90
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,744
Also...

91
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:20,375
[sighs] Don't touch the ambulance 
that's carrying the girl.

92
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,798
You really think that we'll be safe 
on the trip over?

93
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,551
If they were planning 
to attack the ambulance,

94
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,636
they would've done so on its way here.

95
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,432
Stray bullets shouldn't be a concern 
anymore, either.

96
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,853
[auctioneer] It's the moment 
you've been waiting for!

97
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,149
Get ready, because this auction 
is about to begin!

98
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,943
[audience applauding]

99
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,904
If you would, 
please allow me to introduce

100
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,115
the first item of the evening!

101
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,744
[Bean sighs] I was getting worried there 
for a moment.

102
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,121
But all's well that ends well.

103
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,917
None of the leaders were hurt. 
So, at least there's that.

104
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,252
We did alright.

105
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,337
Hmm?

106
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,716
Thank you.

107
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,926
-Huh? 
-[Hisoka snickers]

108
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,399
Coming up next, 
another splendid item for you!

109
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:31,696
A solid gold execution sword, 
direct from the Yul National Treasury!

110
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,323
[audience exclaiming]

111
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,159
Bidding starts at 20 million!

112
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,411
-[man 1] 40 million! 
-[man 2] 50!

113
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,247
[auctioneer] I hear 50 million Jenny. 
Thank you, sir.

114
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,832
[man 3] One hundred million!

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,628
I guess I can put him on autopilot. There.

116
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,217
Next, we have a Celadon porcelain vase 
from the Lai Dynasty.

117
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,052
It’s still completely intact,

118
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:58,223
and is, without a doubt, the very last 
of its kind in the entire world.

119
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,018
Okay, so where’s the Celadon vase? Um…

120
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,186
Here it is.

121
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,272
Kortopi, this one is next.

122
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,233
Here, I'll leave it to you.

123
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,026
Okay.

124
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,032
[audience exclaiming]

125
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,493
[auctioneer] 
And here’s the Celadon vase now!

126
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,872
Let's start the bidding off 
at 100 million!

127
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,166
-[man 1] 200 million! 
-[man 2] 330!

128
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,751
[man 3] 380!

129
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,295
[sirens wailing]

130
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,258
[guard] Hey, you there.

131
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,136
Aren't you gonna participate 
in the auction?

132
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,804
What are you talking about?

133
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,973
The leader of the Phantom Troupe 
was killed.

134
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,517
-[gasping] 
-[guard 2] Moving ahead as planned.

135
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,019
But that's impossible.

136
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,188
It can't be.

137
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,483
[guard] They're hunting down 
the stragglers now.

138
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,735
[guard 2] 
They don't call 'em pros for nothing.

139
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,906
[Zenji chuckling]

140
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,244
While your useless ass was busy 
wasting time with the ambulance,

141
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,081
it looks like the Zoldycks 
actually stepped up and got the job done.

142
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,459
And since there's no real need 
for you any longer,

143
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,005
why don't you just run along and suck up 
to your fortuneteller girl?

144
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,342
Head over to the hospital, 
maybe the hotel, eh?

145
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,679
Or even better, how about you go 
and lick the boots

146
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,640
of that old fraud who's just 
as useless as you?

147
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,392
Sound good? [yelps]

148
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,234
[Kurapika] I won't believe it 
until I see it with my own eyes.

149
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,666
[man 1] This is the leader? 
He's young.

150
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,085
Too young to be messing with us.

151
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,256
[man 2] 
Hey, don't damage him from the neck up.

152
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,508
We're gonna put his face on the Internet.

153
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,385
[man 3] We found the other members!

154
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,512
[man 4] Right, I'm on my way.

155
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,350
Five bodies, total? 
Try to identify them.

156
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,313
DNA, teeth, fingerprints. 
Check all the databases.

157
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,650
And whatever you do, 
don't touch their heads.

158
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,277
[man 5] Once we know who they are, 
we'll kill their relatives,

159
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,779
their lovers, everyone!

160
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,323
Make sure the whole world knows 
that this is what happens

161
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,158
when you screw with us like this.

162
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,668
[Kurapika grunting]

163
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,671
[panting]

164
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,590
[auctioneer] Alright, everyone. 
This is it!

165
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,010
It's time for our very last item 
of the night!

166
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:46,307
One of the seven most beautiful colors 
in the world, the Scarlet Eyes!

167
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,934
[audience exclaiming]

168
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,687
[auctioneer] 
Now that the Kurta Clan's extinct,

169
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,398
only 36 pairs will ever exist.

170
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,986
This particular pair exhibits 
an exceptionally brilliant scarlet.

171
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,281
So, let's start the bidding 
at 100 million!

172
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,032
-[man 1] 110 million! 
-[dialing]

-[Kurapika] Boss? 
-A-hundred-seventy!

177
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,624
-[Kurapika] It's Kurapika. 
-[bidding continues]

178
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,544
[Kurapika] I apologize. 
I predicted incorrectly.

179
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,337
The leader of the Spiders is dead

180
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,214
and the auction is proceeding 
as scheduled.

181
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,549
[Nostrade] What?

182
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,427
[Kurapika] The Scarlet Eyes 
are being auctioned as we speak.

183
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,306
-Should I bid? 
-Of course! You must win them.

184
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,391
Is there a limit, sir?

185
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,144
No! Bid whatever it takes to win them.

186
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,937
Yes, sir. I understand.

187
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,317
-[man 4] 300! 
-I hear 300 million Jenny!

188
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,236
Do I have any other bids out there? 
Anyone at all?

189
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,613
-[Kurapika] 350! 
-[gasps]

[man 2] 370!

00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,537
[man 3] 390!

193
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,247
Five hundred!

194
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,999
[Zenji] One billion.

195
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,125
[gasping]

196
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,005
[snickering]

197
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,091
[Nostrade] 2.9 billion?

198
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,968
[Kurapika] Yes, sir. That's right.

199
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,637
Unfortunately, I got into a bidding war

200
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,931
with the bald man 
from the assassin's meeting.

201
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,100
Zenji, huh? Damn it.

202
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,271
[Nostrade] I didn't expect him 
to spend this much.

203
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,273
Curse that loathsome pig.

204
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,692
But no matter.

205
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,362
This means more money for the community,

206
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,490
which will only serve to bolster 
my prestige.

207
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,120
As long as I have Neon's fortunetelling, 
I can make it back.

208
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,541
Fine. It won't be a problem. 
You did well, so thank you.

209
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:37,835
That's right.

210
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,755
This is just an investment 
in my journey to the top.

211
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,719
In order to succeed, it's imperative 
that I keep Neon happy.

212
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,223
She's my secret weapon.

213
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,643
Now and forever.

214
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:04,404
As long as I have her... [snickering] 
I'll have all the money I could ever want.

you could get away from me?

00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,448
[Killua] Really?

237
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,202
We were captured and these two 
were sitting here drinking?

238
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,956
Hey! You're back, huh? 
Join the party!

239
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,457
Come on, have a drink with us.

240
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,835
Idiot. We’re not old enough 
to drink alcohol!

241
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,171
And I'm pretty sure you're not either, 
are you?

Who cares if I'm not? 
Hey, where I come from,

243
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,802
you can start drinking 
as soon as you’re 16!

[Killua] I see.

245
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:42,186
Man. Look, I had no idea. 
I’m just amazed you both got out alive.

246
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,190
Wow, I never realized 
that the Phantom Troupe was so dangerous.

247
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,444
Oh! We actually used one of the tricks 
that you taught us, Mr. Zepile.

248
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,488
-It really came in handy! 
-Huh?

00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,664
[Killua] You’ve just gotta make your own!

252
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,916
[Zepile] I get it.

253
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,337
Even though I wasn’t there, 
I’m glad I was able to help in some way.

254
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,049
[Zepile exhales]

255
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,678
I hadn't thought about it that way, but...

256
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,056
a little bit of con artistry 
might actually go a long way

257
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,309
-against the Phantom Troupe. 
-[Leorio] Right!

258
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,519
Forgery is the way to go!

259
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,106
You see, guys, I haven’t just 
been drinking myself silly.

260
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,067
I’ve been learning a whole lot 
from Zepile, here.

261
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,653
And tomorrow morning, 
we'll hit up the auction.

262
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,655
You guys are coming too, right?

263
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,494
I'd like to, but I need to find Kurapika 
and learn all about Nen.

264
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,289
Kurapika? So you got through to him?

265
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,292
Yep. But we’re waiting for him 
to call us back.

266
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,503
Wait. You say you’re going to learn 
about Nen from him?

267
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,714
-Yeah, that's right. 
-Why?

268
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,342
He just learned about Nen 
himself, didn't he?

269
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,512
Sure, but Kurapika managed to defeat 
a member of the Phantom Troupe.

270
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,015
-Seriously? 
-Yeah.

271
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,102
He knows something about it we don’t. 
He has to.

272
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,441
Like a strength that doesn’t need power 
or even experience to make it work.

273
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,487
[Neon squealing]

274
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,531
Awesome! Thank you so much, Daddy!

275
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,326
[giggles] So pretty!

276
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,036
[Nostrade chuckles]

277
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,538
So, am I off the hook now?

278
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,666
[Neon] Uh huh! I forgive you!

279
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,460
Well, that’s certainly good to hear.

280
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,546
[Neon laughing]

281
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,760
Good work, all of you.

282
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:42,056
My daughter’s condition has improved 
so we’ll be heading back to the hotel.

283
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,019
Tomorrow, we need to buy 
that actor’s used tissue.

284
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,355
And that will be the end of the auction.

285
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,318
The day after tomorrow, 
I’ll leave first thing in the morning.

286
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,780
However, I want you to accompany 
my daughter while she shops.

287
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,989
[all groaning]

288
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,582
[Melody] Kurapika.

289
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,836
Don’t worry about the rest of the auction 
and the shopping trip.

290
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,295
We’ll handle it ourselves.

291
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,006
You should get some rest, okay?

292
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,801
Yes, you’re right.

293
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,972
Thanks. I think I will.

294
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,810
[Basho] Is he really okay?

295
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,822
[dialing]

296
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,992
[Gon] Hello? Kurapika?

297
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,870
Yeah.

298
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,249
You said you wanted 
to stop the Troupe, right?

299
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,669
Well, that won’t be necessary now.

300
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,798
The Spiders are dead.

301
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,801
[Gon gasps] What do you mean? 
Kurapika?

302
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,055
[dial tone]

303
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,225
[Hisoka] Hmm. What a shame.

304
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,564
And here I was trying 
to lift his spirits a little.

305
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,069
[Feitan] 
The Mafia community was nothing special.

306
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,071
[Shalnark] We didn't even need Nobunaga!

307
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,364
[Nobunaga] Hey, shut up!

308
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,492
So, what'd he say?

309
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,076
That the Phantom Troupe's dead.

310
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,454
-They're what?
