along with your current
training regimen.

165
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,665
Also...

166
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,467
We’ll begin sparring.

167
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,903
Use ryu just as I taught you.

168
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,971
Start out by trying it slowly.

169
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,974
When you’re on the defensive,

170
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,710
you’ll want to determine
your opponent’s attack power

171
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,546
before defending with ryu.

172
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,981
With that said, begin!

173
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,884
Killua: I’ll go first,
okay, gon?

174
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:41,488
Right foot, 55 on both fronts.

175
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:45,493
Gon: Right foot, 60 offensive
and defensive, I think.

176
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,496
Left hand, 60 for both.

80 offensive and defensive.

179
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,739
Left elbow, 80 offensive
and defensive power.

180
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,914
Bisky: If they keep this up
every day for two months,

181
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:10,083
they should be able
to fight easily at full speed

182
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,519
while still using ryu.

183
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,857

Bisky: It’s been two weeks.

191

You’ve made a lot of progress.

192
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,512
It looks like you’re both ready

195
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,083
Bisky: Yes.

196
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,151
You’ll start training
in individual categories.

197
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,553
Both: Three!

198

That was a tie.

200
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,559
You can train exclusively
in your own category.

201
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,562
In the case of an enhancer...

202
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,465
You’ll focus
on your enhancer skills

203
00:09:57,498 --> 00:10:01,068
while training in transmuter
and emitter abilities equally.

204
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,804
That’ll help you master
your own category faster.

208
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,575
Another tie.

209
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,010
Gon: Really good job, killua.

210

Both: Osu!

213
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,585
Bisky: We’ll start off
in the enhancer category.

214
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,488
The first exercise
is breaking rocks.

215
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,525
And I want you
to break them like this.

216
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,960
Smash a thousand
with a single stone in a day,

217
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,195
and you’ll clear the level.

218
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,530
Now begin!

219
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,236

Killua: This is pretty tough.

221
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,209
I’m just changing the stone’s
offensive and defensive power

222
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,212
to 100
right at the moment of impact,

223
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:49,216
but I can feel my nen
getting weaker as I go.

in your hand breaks, it’s over.

Damn it! I messed it up!

230
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,927
Bisky: What are
you talking about?

231
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,529
You were actually doing well.

232

Killua: Okay,

233
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,734
let’s do
a transmuter exercise next!

234
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,270
Bisky: Now, now.
Don’t be so hasty.

235
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:12,740
You’re only allowed to train
in one category per day.

00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,646
Gon: We keep tying.

240
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,215
Bisky: All that means
is that you’re both growing

241
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,150
a lot more accustomed
to using gyo.

242
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,053
Killua: But it’s not any fun
if there’s no winner.

243
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,755
Gon: Then let’s decide
with rock-paper-scissors,

244
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,725
and the loser has to do
a thousand push-ups, okay?

245
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,759
Killua: Fine by me.

Killua: Damn it!

251
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,703
Bisky: Hey, boys, have you heard

252
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,138
that this game
is based on the martial arts?

253
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,173
Killua: Uh...

254
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,145
Bisky: Paper represents
a palm attack to the organs.

255
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,582
Scissors represent
a finger jab to the vitals.

256
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:59,186
Rock represents a punch
targeting muscle and bone.

257
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:04,825
A long time ago, martial arts
were called jaken, or evil fist,

258
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,660
and considered so destructive

259
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,328
that they were
completely forbidden.

260
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:11,065
But masters were able
to continue their training

261
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,601
by pretending to play.

262
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,870
And that’s how
many people think janken,

263
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,139
or rock-paper-scissors,
first came to be.

264
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,273
Killua: Wow...

265
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,607
You’re really old.

00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:28,983

( Birds squawk )

271
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,356
Player: Gentlemen,
we currently have

272
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:39,660
133 specified-slot cards
of 90 different types,

273
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:43,230
and of course it’s all thanks
to your tireless efforts.

274
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,098
Of the remaining 10 cards,

275
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,835
we know the location
of seven of them.

276
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,804
They’ll be ours
before you know it.

277
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:54,241
But tsezgerra’s group
is closing in.

278
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,310
They’ve obtained the same number
of specified-slot cards,

279
00:12:57,344 --> 00:13:00,080
and now the final hurdle

280
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,782
will likely be a showdown
against their group.

281
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,786
However, I believe
we have more spell cards

282
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,754
and of much higher quality,

283
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,158
so our victory
is all but assured.

that I feel I really need
to share with you.

291

00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,441
you must touch me
somewhere on my body

327
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:10,444
and then say the phrase,
"I caught the bomber."

328
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,347
That said, don’t forget
about my secret weapon,

329
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,282
the little flower ability.

330
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:19,386
I can use it to stop
anyone who tries to touch me.

331
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,423
You must be very careful when
attempting to disarm the bombs.

332
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,259
That’s all.

00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:37,905
My other ability is countdown.

338
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,309
Why am I telling you
all of this,

339
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,110
you might be wondering.

340
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:47,514

just waiting for the day

and members were gathered.

343

Bomber: And now
I have a proposition.

344
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,524
I will trade your lives

345
00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:01,128
for the 90 specified-slot cards
you’ve obtained.

346
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:06,366
If you agree to my terms, then I
will use an alternative method

347
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,436
to simultaneously disarm
all of the bombs.

348
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,806
Do nothing,
and all of you will die

349
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,109
when the counter reaches zero.

350
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,245
You should discuss this
amongst yourselves.

351
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:22,182
I’ll be waiting for you
at Mr. Battera’s old mansion,

352
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:25,453
and whoever comes
must come alone.

353
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,254
Puhat: Do you have a screw loose
or something, buddy?

354
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,591
If we just catch you right here
and now and disarm the bombs,

355
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,860
it’s all over.

we’ll just let you walk away?

358

Bomber: Relax.
If you get too excited,

359
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,001
the countdown will accelerate.

360
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,269

is linked to your heartbeat.

meet again soon!

He escaped out of the game!

369

Player #12: Hurry!
We gotta follow him!

370
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,157
Player #13: Wait.
But if we leave,

371

will vanish!

Player #15: Just calm down!

374

Going after that guy
would be foolish!

375
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,400
Did you already forget

376
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,036
why we decided to team up
in the first place?

377
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,104
Because none of us
are strong enough fighters!

378
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,307
Does anyone here actually think

379
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,209
we’re powerful enough
to beat him?

380
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,511
Player #10: It’s impossible.

381
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:28,516
He must be quite strong.
His nen abilities prove it.

382
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,920
If all of us decided to attack
him together as a unified front,

383
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:35,522
he could simply use
little flower to stop us.

384

Player #16: Damn!
We were getting so close, too.

385

Player #10: To start,

386
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,663
it’s imperative
that we come to a consensus.

387
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:46,500
Do we try to fight, or do we
just hand over the cards?

388
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,335
Player #1:
Hand them over, please!

389
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,103
Do it.

390
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:55,642

is running out of time.

would be the one to show up.

Thought you’d have
had company. ( Gasps )

395

Bomber: Sub and bara.
They’re the other bombers.

396
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,966
Now i’ll have to ask you
to hand over your ring.

Thing is,
we still haven’t agreed,

00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,342

402
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,945
He wants you to let us have
the angel’s breath card

403
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:34,048
so that we can use it
to save jispa.

If they can’t decide in time
and they explode,

then you lose everything,
