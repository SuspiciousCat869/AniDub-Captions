I know how they’ll react.

339
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,250
They’ll do everything
in their power

340
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,586
to keep the spiders
from the nen exorcist.

341
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,723
That could be interesting
in and of itself,

342
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,459
but I don’t want to delay
my fight with chrollo

343
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,494
any longer than I have to.

344
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,197
I came here
to look for chrollo.

345
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:18,532
( Both gasping )

346
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,001
He’s still crippled
by kurapika’s nen,

347
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:24,104
but there’s actually
a way to remove it.

348
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,438
Gon: Exorcism.

349
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,107
Hisoka: You knew?

350
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,076
well, that will
make this much easier.

351
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,679
I’m looking for chrollo
to pass that along,

352
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:34,715
but I have no leads.

353
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,017
Before long,

354
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,152
i remembered
that some of the spiders

355
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,588
were interested in this game.

356
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:45,025
so, of course,
if I can locate them,

357
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,594
they might be able to tell me
where chrollo is.

358
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:51,031
And using his handle
all but guarantees

359
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,699
they’ll try to contact me.

360
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,235
Okay.

361
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,703
So he was just pretending

362
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:56,770
to be a member
of the phantom troupe.

363
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,104
Yeah.

364
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,041
Now I have a question for you.

365
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,609
Tell me.

366
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,378
Did the two of you really
come all the way out here

367
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,246
just to ask me that?

368
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,615
Yeah. Sure did.

369

The truth is,

372
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,723
we’re here looking for people
who are really strong,

373
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:18,726

you might join us.

All right.

May I ask why you’re looking
for strong people?

377
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,635
hey, wait a minute.
I don’t think I like this.

378

It’s risky.

I know who he is.

a certain kinship with him.

Well, technically,

391
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,438
I should’ve said that
he wasn’t telling the truth.

392
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,807
But how could you tell?

393

It was really more of a hunch.

Biscuit: It’s obvious
he’s hiding something.

So best to keep him around

if I entered this game

what would I do?

467
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:17,631
First, i’d see how important
the spell cards are.

Gon and bisky ran into hisoka

That must have been while they
were training near masadora.

00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:29,476
He was in masadora!

472

Normally it wouldn’t make sense
for him to leave.

Most players pass through there
looking for spell cards.

If he really was looking
for the troupe,

( Thinking ) At least here,
boredom isn’t an issue.

477
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,559

He’s bored because

478
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,361
he’s got nothing to do.

479
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,564
So he isn’t looking for anyone.

480
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,899
No! He’s already found them.

481
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,802
That’s it.

482
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:58,806
That’s in line with what bisky
was saying earlier.

483
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,841
Hisoka already met up
with the troupe.

for something.

But what?

486
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:06,680

00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,348
an exorcist!

The exorcist is here
on greed island.

489
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,624

492
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,331
If hisoka finds out we know,

493
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,100
he’s bound to slip away
from us.

494
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:29,837
if he leaves,
we’ll be down an ally

495
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,439
and we won’t know
what the troupe is doing.

496
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:35,508
We can’t let that happen.

497

499
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,581

try to recruit him.

500
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,118
even if he won’t join,
we should at least meet him.

501
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,453
And that way, he’ll be on
our binder list.

502
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,756
Yeah, it’d be better if we knew
what they were up to.

503
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,859
( Gasps )
( Thinking ) The binder!

504
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:53,727
We can find out for sure.

505
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,762
Can I see your binder,
hisoka?

506
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:58,499
We’re trying to find a guy
named tsezguerra,

507
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,501
so I want to see
if he’s on the list

508
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:01,802
of players you’ve met.

509
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,704
List?

510
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:05,505
( Thinking )
This is perfect.

511
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,741
if I started asking
a bunch of questions,

512
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,676
hisoka would get suspicious.

513
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,745
But since gon
doesn’t know anything,

514
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,880
hisoka won’t see
a problem with it.

515
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:15,716
Book.

516
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:16,883
Killua: ( Thinking )
If he refuses

517
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,385
to show us the screen,

518
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,020
that’ll just support
my theory.

519
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,490
Hisoka: There he is.
tsezguerra.

520
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:24,492
Really?

521
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:27,094
Yes. Look. Here

522
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:32,099
( thinking )
He’s showing us? No way!

523
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,800
It doesn’t look
like there are

524
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,502
any troupe members listed.

525
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,505
Was I being paranoid?

526
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:41,442
could hisoka actually
still be looking for them?

527
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,910
Hmm.

528
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:45,712
in that case,
would you recite this spell?

529
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,716
Don’t worry.
We’ll do all the talking.

530
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,518
Hisoka: Contact on.
tsezguerra.

531
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,720
( Energy whooshes )

532
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,155
( Chuckling )

533
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:59,760
My texture surprise certainly
does come in handy.

534
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:04,931
Man: ( Singing in Japanese )

535
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:08,435
Narrator: Hisoka’s ability
completely fools

536
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,936
killua and his friends.

537
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,805
But the question remains,

538
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,943
is he friend or foe?

539
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:22,983
