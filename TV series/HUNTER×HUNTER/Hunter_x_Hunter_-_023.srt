00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:08,884
[narrator] In the forests of the Dentora 
region of the Republic of Padokea

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:14,348
lies a dormant volcano 
measuring 3,722 meters high.

4
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,808
It is known as Kukuroo Mountain.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:21,730
It is home to a family 
of famous assassins, the Zoldyck family.

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,943
Visitors arrive every day, 
in hopes of catching

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,112
a glimpse of the mansion 
which has never been seen.

8
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,575
It's one of this nation's 
most popular tourist attractions.

9
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,747
[theme music plays]

10
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,994
[Zebro] Well, how long 
will you be staying here?

11
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,204
Until we see Killua!

12
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,957
And we're not leaving a second before!

13
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,877
[chuckles]

14
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,630
[Zebro] All right, then. Follow me.

15
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:16,136
THE X GUARD'S X DUTY

16
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,932
[narrator] Gon and his friends 
have begun to confront

17
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:25,354
the obstacles that they must overcome 
in order to reunite with Killua.

18
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:30,192
They head toward their destination 
with no idea what awaits them.

19
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,947
[Zebro] Here we are. 
These are the servants' quarters.

20
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,452
It's getting pretty late... 
so, you can stay here tonight.

21
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:46,458
[rumbling]

22
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,044
-[Kurapika] Uh... 
-[Zebro] Please, come on in.

23
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,091
Hey, anybody home?

24
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,469
[man] 
Guests, huh? Don't see that every day.

25
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:03,141
[Zebro] This is Seaquant. 
He works with me here at the estate.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,601
[Gon] Good evening.

27
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,187
Hmm.

28
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,565
Zebro doesn't take a liking 
to just anybody.

29
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,360
Make yourselves at home.

30
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,613
Though in this house, 
that's easier said than done.

31
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:26,373
You wanna see young Master Killua? 
[laughs] Now, that's pretty funny.

32
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,500
[Leorio] Actually, we're dead serious.

33
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,713
Then let me give you some advice. 
Give up now and go home.

34
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,214
What did you say?

35
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,217
[Seaquant] Zebro told you 
about the Testing Gate, right?

36
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,804
If you wanna know what this place is like, 
that's an example.

37
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,473
[Gon] It won't be easy. We get that.

38
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,977
But still, I'm not leaving yet.

39
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,855
Not until I see Killua!

40
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,360
Before, when he was in trouble,

41
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,612
I wasn't there for him 
like I should've been.

42
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,914
If I was... If I'd just been there...

43
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,209
I know I could have stopped him.

44
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,215
He's my friend, 
and he's really important to me, okay?

45
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,139
[Zebro chuckles] I understand.

46
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,768
In that case, why don't you do 
some training while you're here?

47
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,270
-What do you mean? 
-Hey now, Zebro.

48
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,022
[Zebro] Listen to me, Gon.

49
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,150
You three can try to open 
the door together.

50
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,068
There's nothing wrong with teamwork.

51
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,406
And with a little bit of training, 
it should be possible.

52
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,700
How about it?

53
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,455
I don't like the idea of being tested.

54
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,500
But if there's truly no other way...

55
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,085
I guess we'll just have to do it!

56
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,545
Yeah!

57
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,049
All right. Then, I'm going to need 
all three of you to put something on.

58
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,217
[Gon, Kurapika and Leorio] Huh?

59
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,429
[Leorio grunting]

60
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,725
[groans] How is this so heavy?

61
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,936
[Zebro] It weighs 50 kilograms.

62
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,730
Wear it at all times, 
except when you're sleeping.

63
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,731
[Leorio groans]

64
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,192
I'll make it heavier 
as you get used to it.

65
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,193
[Leorio yells]

66
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,404
[Zebro] Here, have some tea.

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,742
[Leorio grunting] What the--?

68
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,910
[all grunting]

69
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,580
The cups weigh 20 kilograms. 
And this teapot weighs 40.

70
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,623
What?

71
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,125
[Zebro] All the furniture 
and utensils in this house

72
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,253
weigh over 20 kilograms each.

73
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,464
[Kurapika] I see what you're getting at. 
So, this will serve as training.

74
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,007
[Seaquant] What's the point?

75
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,219
You know they're just gonna give up 
in two or three days.

76
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,428
What was that?

77
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:49,683
Oh, Seaquant, unless I'm mistaken, 
your shift's already started, hasn't it?

78
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,268
Yeah, I think you're right.

79
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,394

[door rumbling]

81
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,649
Sorry about that. 
He really isn't such a bad person.

82
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,485
Oh, by the way, where's the bathroom?

83
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,153
Right through that door over there.

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,031
[Leorio panting]

85
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,660
Let me guess. The bathroom door is also...

86
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,913
Of course. That door weighs 500 kilograms.

87
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,665
Five-hundred?

88
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,626
What? You're kidding me!

89
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,671
I'm gonna spring a leak!

90
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,635
[footsteps approaching]

[water drips]

92
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,787
[Kikyo] Kalluto, dear, open the door.

93
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,840
[Kikyo] 
Kil, have you learned your lesson yet?

94
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,761
[Milluki] It's no use, Mama. 
He isn't even the least bit sorry.

95
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,221
-We need to make him suffer more.

96
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,306
[fan cracks]

97
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,726
-Enough! Shut your mouth, Milluki! 
-[Milluki huffs]

98
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:19,856
[Kikyo] Kil, darling, why don't you stop 
being so stubborn

99
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,733
and just say that you're sorry?

100
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,780
Oh, and about that friend of yours. 
His name is Gon, isn't it?

101
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,990
He'd be better off leaving,

102
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,577
but it sounds like he wants 
to try his hand at the Testing Gate.

103
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,498
Gon, he's... he's here?

104
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,710
Milluki! You said far too much. 
Now, you see, Kil--

105
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,047
-Why the hell didn't you tell me? 
-[whip cracks]

106
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,967
Don't you ever talk to Mom 
like that again!

107
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,927
I told you to shut your mouth!

108
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,389
I didn't think telling you was necessary.

109
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,642
He can't open the gate, 
not in a million years.

110
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,310
-[Killua] He will. 
-[gasps]

111
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,313
He'll do it. I know it.

112
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,526
Well, isn't that absolutely divine?

113
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,405
However, he won't make it here. 
I can promise you that.

114
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,572
[Killua] Gon will.

115
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,826
He can do it. He'll prove you wrong.

116
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,122
No question. 
He'll definitely make it here.

117
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,636
[Leorio] Gon, wait.

118
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,513
You just watch, okay?

119
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,390
But why?

120
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,934
You need to let your arm 
heal properly, first.

121
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,229
If Kurapika and I can open it ourselves, 
you don't have to worry.

122
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,856
Let us handle it.

123
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,733
Fine.

124
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,486
-You ready, Kurapika? 
-Yeah!

125
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,531
[both grunting]

126
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,120
[Seaquant] Come on, you're only 
wasting your time.

127
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,877
[Kurapika] No use. It won't budge.

128
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,336
[Leorio] Damn it!

129
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,756
But we only just started training.

130
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,800
If we work hard enough, 
I know we can do it!

131
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,553
[Kurapika] 
I wish I could share your optimism.

132
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,618
[chuckles]

133
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,954

[both panting]

138
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,691
I'm telling you, 
this is never gonna work.

139
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,443
You're just kidding yourselves, 
you know that.

140
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,989
Well, if you're so sure, 
quit watching and go do your job.

141
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,160
[Kurapika] Gon is one of us.

142
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,665
[sighs] And he's made it clear 
that he wishes to see his friend.

143
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,999
Quite clear.

144
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,670
It's only right to help him 
achieve his goal.

145
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,676
[Leorio] Let's give it another shot!

146
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,177
[Kurapika] Yeah!

147
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,681
[both grunting]

148
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,939
[Seaquant] Oh, give me a break. 
You can't keep pushing mindlessly.

149
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,109
Get your timing in sync.

150
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,988
You have to push both doors 
simultaneously with everything you've got.

151
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,240
Otherwise, it'll never open.

152
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,993
[Zebro chuckles]

153
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,246
[Leorio] Get our timing in sync.

154
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,375
[Kurapika] Push both doors simultaneously, 
and with all our might.

155
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,002
You ready?

156
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,421
One!

157
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,505
And two!

158
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,464
[both] Three!

159
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,968
[both grunting]

160
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,471
[all gasp]

161
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,852
[Gon] Leorio! Kurapika!

162
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,442
It moved a little.

163
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:47,081
HUNTER GLOSSARY

164
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,753
TESTING GATE

165
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,343
[man] What's that?

166
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,846
The Testing Gate? Are you certain?

167
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,600
And?

168
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,103
[Seaquant] Oh, well, I just wanted 
to let you know, is all.

169
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,272
Very well.

170
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,653
Why does he always have to be 
so damn gruff?

171
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,579
[Leorio grunting]

172
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,884
Hey, you two. Look, why don't you try 
taking those vests off, today?

173
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,679
Huh? Well, don't mind if I do.

174
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,810
All right, now we'll be able 
to open the gate for sure!

175
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,608
-Let's do this, Kurapika! 
-Right!

176
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,694
One, and two...

177
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,695
[both] Three!

178
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:04,284
[both grunting]

179
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,459
[gasps]

180
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,345
[Leorio] Damn it. 
That's as far as it'll go!

181
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,225
You can't give up yet. 
Keep pushing!

182
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,935
Okay, I'm with you!

183
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,647
Gon!

184
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,692
What do you think you're doing? 
Your arm, remember?

185
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,861
It's okay. It's healed now.

186
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,779
[Kurapika] What, already?

187
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,198
-[Leorio] Are you sure, Gon? 
-[Gon] Yep!

188
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,160
So anyway, we gotta match our breathing?

189
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,913
-Uh, that's right. 
-Well, let's push.

190
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,498
Here goes!

191
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,499
Ready!

192
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,459
Get set!

193
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,752
Go!

194
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,838
[all grunting]

195
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,180
-It's opening. 
-[Zebro chuckles]

196
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,308
[gasps]

197
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,392
[Gon grunts]

198
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,394
[Gon] Ow!

199
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,066
[both panting]

200
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,359
It opened.

201
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,905
[Leorio] Hell yeah!

202
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,949
-[Kurapika] We really did it, Gon! 
-[Gon] Uh-huh!

203
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,665
[Zebro] Now then, just follow this path 
and head toward the mountain.

204
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,876
The mansion should be up there somewhere.

205
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,339
Never been there myself, 
which is kind of embarrassing,

206
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:46,386
considering I've worked here for 20 years. 
I'm sorry I can't be of any more help.

207
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,137
No, sir, you have been.

208
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,724
Mr. Zebro, Seaquant, 
thanks for everything.

209
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:52,850
[chuckles]

210
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,395
[Gon] Thanks again!

211
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,313
See you later!

212
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,196
[Zebro] They're really something.

213
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,409
Those three might actually have 
what it takes to reach the mansion.

214
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:13,121
[snickers] It's not gonna happen. 
They'll die for sure.

215
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,666
Are you speaking from your experience 
back then?

216
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,169
-[wind rustles] 
-[birds squawk]

217
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:29,053
[Seaquant] A single apprentice butler 
wiped us out to the last man.

218
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,640
And that made one thing 
painfully clear:

219
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,643
that I'd gotten myself in 
way over my head.

220
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,814
I recall you were so impressed 
that you asked for a job here.

221
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,108
Yeah, well, excuse me.

222
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:49,157
But the bosses and workers here 
are monsters. Every last one.

223
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,909
And once you step onto their turf...

224
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,997
[Kikyo] The Testing Gate opened?

225
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,457
[butler] Yes, ma'am.

226
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,542
[Kikyo] 
This is a critical time for Killua.

227
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,129
We simply cannot allow anyone near him!

228
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,966
Especially unnecessary distractions 
like friends.

229
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,302
-Is that clear? 
-[butler] Yes, ma'am.

230
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,446
Please leave now. 
You're trespassing on private property.

231
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,449
I can't allow you to pass 
without permission.

232
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,077
[Gon] But we called ahead, 
and we came in through the Testing Gate.

233
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,623
[Canary] The butler's quarters did not 
give you permission to enter.

234
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,417
What the heck do we need to do 
to get permission?

235
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,003
I even told them I was Killua's friend 
and everything.

236
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,006
Who knows? 
No one has ever received permission.

237
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,510
[Gon] Then I guess we're gonna 
have to trespass!

238
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,637
I suppose so.

239
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,766
In any case, 
this is where I draw the line.

240
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,021
Take one step past it and I will remove 
you by force if necessary.

241
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,248
Damn it!

242
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,710
[Gon] Leorio! Kurapika!

243
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,464
Stay where you are. 
I'll handle this.

244
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,550
Ow!

245
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,178
Look, we didn't come here 
to fight anyone.

246
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,389
We just want to see Killua.

247
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,600
Your motives don't matter.

248
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:44,063
I have my orders, and it is my duty 
to follow them.

249
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,334
Try all you like.

250
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,050
I'll never let you pass.

251
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,054
[Gon] I will pass.

252
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,724
I'm gonna see Killua!

253
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,360
[Canary] Welcome home, Master Killua.

254
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,323
[Killua] Yeah.

255
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,996
-I made one. 
-Huh?

256
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,416
[Killua] A friend.

257
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:10,232
[staff thudding]

258
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,633
Stop right there.

259
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,594
Please go away!

260
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,688
Why won't you just give up? 
You know it's pointless!

261
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,190
Please stop him! You're his friends! 
Why...?

262
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,032
[Gon] What's the big deal?

263
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,952
I just came here to see my friend.

264
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,913
The only reason I'm here 
is to see Killua!

265
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,956
[gasps]

266
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,251
[Gon] So why are you making me 
go through all of this?

267
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,672
[birds cawing]

268
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,595
-[Gon] Hey. 
-[Canary gasps]

269
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,224
[Gon] I crossed the line. 
Shouldn't you hit me?

270
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,729
I can tell you're different from Mike.

271
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,273
You may be trying to cover up 
your feelings,

272
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,358
but you still have a heart.

273
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,947
When I mentioned Killua's name, 
your eyes softened, just for a moment.

274
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,915
[Canary sniffling] Please...

275
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,295
Help him. Help Master--

276
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,005
[glass crackles]

277
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,135
[all gasping]

278
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,053
[Kikyo] Honestly...

279
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,556
What was that servant babbling about?

280
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,935
She made it sound 
like we were being mean to Killua.

281
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,024
How rude. She's just a bloody apprentice.

282
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,696
And you must be Gon. 
Illumi told me all about you.

283
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,492
Killua is aware that you've been 
on the premises for some time now.

284
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,580
I have a message from Killua 
that he asked me to relay to you.

285
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,084
"Thank you for coming. 
I'm happy that you did.

286
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,465
But I can't see you right now. 
I'm sorry."

287
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:47,056
[narrator] Gon and his friends have 
finally made it inside the Zoldyck estate.

288
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,476
But now, they face 
their greatest obstacle yet:

289
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:56,482
a sad message from Killua himself, 
saying that he cannot see them.

290
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,071
[theme music plays]

291
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,363
[Gon] Next time. 
"The Zoldyck Family."

292
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,657
[Gon] Who is Killua to you, anyway?

293
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,451
[Kalluto] My big brother!
