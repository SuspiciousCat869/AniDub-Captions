1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,044
TEN (ENVELOPE)

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,212
[narrator] Ten:

3
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,590
The ability to envelop your body 
in a shroud of Nen aura,

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,260
making it tougher 
and slowing the effects of aging.

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,303
ZETSU (SUPPRESS)

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,346
Zetsu:

7
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,140
A technique which shuts off 
your flow of Nen aura.

8
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:19,019
Effective for concealing your presence 
and recovering from fatigue.

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,270
REN (REFINE)

10
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,230
Ren.

11
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,483
A technique for creating 
an especially strong Nen aura.

12
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,027
It is crucial for increasing your power.

13
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:28,779
HATSU (RELEASE)

14
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:29,780
Hatsu:

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,742
The release of your Nen aura, 
after using Ren to boost it.

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,580
These four elements 
are known as the Four Exercises

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,416
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,709
FOUR EXERCISES

19
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,260
[theme song playing]

20
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,500
[cheering]

21
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:07,919
Oh...

22
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,256
[Hisoka] Oh… Don’t look at me like that…

23
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,008
SCHWEEN

24
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,510
It’s really turning me on!

25
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:20,724
A BIG DEBT x AND x A SMALL KICK

26
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:28,899
[narrator] Gon was finally able to land 
a solid punch to Hisoka’s face.

27
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,277
But will he be able to win the match?

28
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,406
Critical hit for Gon! Two points!

29
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,659
[Cocco] Amazing!

30
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,286
Gon managed to land a critical hit!

31
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,499
He’s come back from a deficit 
to take a two-one lead.

32
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,250
Gon is on top!

33
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,213
But wait a second!

34
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,798
Hisoka looks just fine.

35
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,051
In fact, it doesn’t like he took on 
very much damage at all!

36
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,096
The referee’s call 
might be open to question!

37
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,893
The referee is perfectly entitled 
to award points however he pleases.

38
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,436
Huh?

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,148
As you’re aware some award points 
based on damage done

40
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,527
while others base their scores 
on strategy and technique.

41
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,612
My personal opinion is that,

42
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,738
in this case

43
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:21,076
the referee was rewarding the fighter 
for using the stone block in his attack.

44
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,619
Oh, is that so?

45
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,914
And… who are you?

46
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,291
Okay!

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,628
[cheering]

48
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,844
[Cocco] Oh, look at that!

49
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,056
Hisoka has moved for the first time 
since the fight started.

50
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,517
And is that a hint of a smile I see?

51
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,730
Can this mean 
that he’s finally getting serious?

52
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,070
Whoa!

53
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,491
Whoa!

54
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,096
Whoa! What was that all about?

55
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,931
I have no idea!

56
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,776
One question:

57
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,778
How much have you learned about Nen?

58
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,530
I know all the basics.

59
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,032
[Hisoka] Ah.

60
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,618
That means you’re an Enhancer.

61
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,204
[Gon] 
Uh... But… how the hell did you know that?

62
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,497
[chuckles]

63
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,791
[Hisoka] You're so adorable

64
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,960
and not very good at keeping secrets, 
are you?

65
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,254
[Gon growls] 
Shut your big mouth!

66
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,756
Just tell me how you knew!

67
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,134
It’s personality analysis 
based on aura type.

68
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,053
It’s not an exact science…

69
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,182
much like personality profiles 
based only on blood type.

70
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,854
Enhancers are simple and determined!

71
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,439
He’s right!

72
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,024
He’s right!

73
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,153
Oh, and am a Transmuter, by the way.

74
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,947
Both whimsical and a liar!

75
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,198
He’s right!

76
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,282
He’s right!

77
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,536
Emitters are short-tempered.

78
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,913
Specialists tend to be independent.

79
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,958
Conjurers are high-strung and nervous.

80
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,502
Manipulators are argumentative.

81
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,089
We’re quite compatible, you and I.

82
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,050
Our opposing personalities attract.

83
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,428
We could become great friends…

84
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:50,725
But I’d be careful if I were you, 
as Transmuters are known to be fickle.

85
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:55,480
What was once treasured 
can easily become trash.

86
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,112
[Hisoka] So...

87
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,579
I really hope you don’t disappoint me.

88
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,746
Gon.

89
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,587
-[Gon grunts] 
-[audience roars]

90
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,798
He's fast!

91
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,008
[Gon grunts]

92
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,768
[audience roaring]

93
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,981
[Cocco] That was one powerful kick!

94
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,318
He sent that stone tile 
flying all the way to the entrance!

95
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,166
[Gon grunts]

96
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,428
[cries out in pain]

97
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,514
[rasping in pain, determined growl]

98
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,185
[tired exhale]

99
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,524
[Cocco] Look at that speed, folks!

100
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,027
Hisoka is showing his true power!

101
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,821
Critical hit Hisoka.

102
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,074
Bringing the score to three-two!

103
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,911
[Cocco] His nonstop flurry of attacks 
has been scored a critical hit

104
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,413
and Hisoka regains the lead!

105
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,207
[Gon panting]

106
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,754
[Cocco] 
Gon looks confused and is backing off.

107
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,381
Can’t he fight back?

108
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,592
Amazing…

109
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,010
Too amazing!

110
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,014
[Hisoka] What’s wrong?

111
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,849
Come on, attack me.

112
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,018
Don’t wanna. I’m thinking!

113
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,689
[panting]

114
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,986
I can barely follow him with my eyes

115
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,905
and the rest of my body 
just can’t keep up!

116
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,658
At this rate, 
he’ll beat the crap out of me!

117
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,910
[Hisoka] Hmmm… Very well.

118
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,954
If you won’t come willingly,

119
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,039
I suppose I’ll have to force you.

120
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,296
You’ve gotta use Gyo!

121
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,758
Dammit!

122
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,303
[focusing grunt]

123
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,561
Do you even have the slightest idea

124
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,813
what’s about to happen?

125
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,275
[straining]

126
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,495
[screaming]

127
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,539
[Cocco] Whoa! Look at that!

128
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,291
Gon is being drawn toward Hisoka!

129
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,103
[rasping in pain]

130
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,023
This is my “Elastic Love”…

131
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,984
better known as Bungee Gum.

132
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,738
It can expand as well as contract…

133
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,157
attach and detach

134
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,242
as I desire

135
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,536
[grunts in pain]

136
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,584
You will never escape me now.

137
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,044
[cheering]

138
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,966
Critical hit and knockdown!

139
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,094
Three points awarded to Hisoka!

140
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,345
Six to two!

141
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,805
[groaning]

142
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,351
[Cocco] Hisoka clobbers Gon 
with a strong right!

143
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,061
And Gon is down!

144
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,399
His aura turns into a rubbery substance 
that attaches to other objects.

145
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,901
Bungee Gum.

146
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,571
Only Hisoka can attach and detach it.

147
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,323
What are you doing?

148
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,616
Stand up, Gon.

149
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,827
Dammit…

150
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,411
It’s six to two!

151
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,831
Hisoka has widened his lead even more!

152
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,584
Is he about to claim yet another victory 
in his undefeated streak?

153
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,919
Hey! Get up, kid!

154
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,338
Come on, ref! 
You’re totally favoring Hisoka!

155
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,798
You can do it, Gon!

156
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,466
Can you fight?

157
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,717
Of course!

158
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,515
[Cocco] Ohh, Gon is back on his feet!

159
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,518
But you can tell 
he’s really taken a beating out there!

160
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,395
Now here’s a question for you…

161
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,354
[Gon] Huh?

162
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,358
And if you answer it correctly, 
I’ll give you a free hit.

163
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,609
You will?

164
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:56,823
At what point during this match 
did I attach my Bungee Gum to your cheek?

165
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,325
When did he attach it…?

166
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,662
One: When I elbowed you.

167
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,082
Two: When I landed a clean hit.

168
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,377
Three: When I landed the critical hit.

169
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:11,880
When was it?!

170
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,594
Number three! 
It was when you hit me with both hands!

171
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,470
Wrong!

172
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,723
The answer is four.

173
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:26,477
It was actually when I was giving you 
my aura personality analysis.

174
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,646
No fair!

175
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,819
[Gon] Damn!

176
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,239
If only I’d been using Gyo 
from the very beginning…

177
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,657
Hmm...

178
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,367
Ah, yes.

179
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,494
One word of caution.

180
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,664
Had you been using Gyo,

181
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,251
then during my aura personality analysis,

182
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,045
you would have been able 
to see exactly

183
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,422
what my aura was doing the entire time

184
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,591
and avoided it quite easily.

185
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,430
But what about situations 
one, two, and three?

186
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,895
Have you figured it out?

187
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,856
I could also have attached my Bungee Gum

188
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,983
to you while attacking you directly.

189
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,654
You only need to conceal your aura

190
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,573
when you wish 
to catch your opponent off guard.

191
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,534
Normally, you use your aura 
when attacking.

192
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,373
It doesn’t really matter 
if your opponent can see your aura

193
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,208
while you’re landing attacks.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,960
He's right.

195
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,254
If I can’t dodge his attacks,

196
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,715
using Gyo to see his aura 
won’t do me any good at all!

197
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,134
This is bad.

198
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,054
His power’s way more dangerous 
than I thought it’d be!

199
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,141
So, you’ve gotta dodge 
all of Hisoka’s attacks.

200
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,519
That’s the only way 
that you’re ever gonna keep him

201
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,354
from attaching Bungee Gum to you.

202
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,982
But if you’re able to defend…

203
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,359
Defense wouldn’t be effective.

204
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,737
He can attach his aura 
to the part you block with.

205
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,739
[sighs]

206
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,367
I can’t escape…

207
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,995
What should I do?

208
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,040
That’s enough talk for the time being.

209
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,252
Now what do you say 
we begin preparing for battle?

210
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,379
Resume.

211
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,969
[moans]

212
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,096
If I can’t escape…

213
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,016
I’ll go forward!

214
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,773
[ecstatic moan] Gon…

215
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,443
Gon!

216
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,070
That’s good…

217
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,823
You’re so very good!

218
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,283
Those eyes…

219
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,951
That look…

220
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,120
That spirit!

221
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,790
[ecstatic moan]

222
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,252
[ecstatic moan]

223
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,547
[ecstatic moan] I just can’t wait...

224
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,300
to break you.

225
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,640
[roaring]

226
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,810
[Hisoka] Oh… but no. Not yet…

227
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,062
[Hisoka grunts]

228
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,481
[Cocco] Whoa!

229
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,068
[Hisoka] More… More!

230
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,529
[Hisoka] 
Until it’s almost a shame to destroy you.

231
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,948
[Cocco] Ooh! That’s gotta hurt!

232
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,950
[Hisoka] Until you’ve matured…

233
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,827
[Cocco] Look at him go, folks!

234
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,789
[Hisoka] Until you’ve reached 
soaring new heights…

235
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,957
[grunts] Patience…

236
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,168
[Cocco] A vicious assault!

237
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,628
[moans]

238
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,632
[Gon groans]

239
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,634
[Cocco] Oh! Not again!

240
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,885
[Gon groans in pain]

241
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,430
[Cocco] Hisoka draws Gon 
right into another epic left uppercut!

242
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,817
Good! I blocked that one!

243
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,864
I’m getting used to his Bungee Gum 
yanking me around all over the place.

244
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,491
But it’s not over.

245
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,617
Not yet!

246
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,580
I’m scared.

247
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,750
But I can’t let my fear take over.

248
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,210
If I do,

249
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,004
I’ll never be able 
to fight anyone else again!

250
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,674
Both critical hits!

251
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,259
That’s two more points!

252
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,929
-Plus, a knockdown for Hisoka! 
-Huh?

253
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,057
That’s nine points for Hisoka 
and four points for Gon!

254
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,934
[Gon] But he never knocked me down!

255
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,519
And I even blocked his attack!

256
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,021
-What? 
-Something is up with this ref!

257
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,274
Gimme a break, ref! Get your eyes checked!

258
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,111
Ooookay… 
We have yet another interesting call.

259
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,405
The crowd’s not pleased 
with the ref’s decision,

260
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,824
and they’re really letting him hear it!

261
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,659
[referee] Fight!

262
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,291
If he gets ten points, I lose.

263
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,084
I only have one point left…

264
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,545
He doesn’t need a knockdown.

265
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,631
If just one more attack hits me, 
it’s over!

266
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,258
[chuckles]

267
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,594
You should be more vigilant, Gon.

268
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,430
Take a look over to the right.

269
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,817
I’m so sorry.

270
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,778
I suppose what I meant to say 
was my right.

271
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,659
And that’s another knockdown 
and a clean hit!

272
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,453
Two more points awarded!

273
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,662
Eleven to four!

274
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,664
The winner by TKO is…

275
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,501
Hisoka!

276
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,544
Huh?

277
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,384
[Wing sighs]

278
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,053
[relieved exhale]

279
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,604
While you were busy pleading 
your case to the referee,

280
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,398
I sent the aura on my left hand 
to the stone.

281
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,444
That’s nine points for Hisoka 
and four points for Gon!

282
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,157
When I saw my opening,

283
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,368
I activated the Bungee Gum.

284
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,670
Huh? It’s really… over?

285
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,922
[Hisoka] You’ve made progress.

286
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,467
But you do still lack experience.

287
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,680
If we had ten more matches,

288
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,516
I believe we might actually 
have a good fight.

289
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,395
Of course, that’s assuming 
those fights take place here,

290
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,896
in Heavens Arena.

291
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,774
Therefore,

292
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,610
I will not be fighting you here again.

293
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,698
Our next fight will be in the real world,

294
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,783
without rules to hinder us.

295
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,786
With our lives on the line.

296
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,300
[Gon] He’s so far beyond me.

297
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,137
But he’s not so far out of reach 
I can’t catch up someday.

298
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,974
I need more training in Nen.

299
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,185
I’ve gotta find a power 
that’s as strong as Hisoka’s!

300
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,990
[Cocco] This victory marks 
ten wins for Hisoka,

301
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,743
and earns him the right 
to challenge a Floor Master!

302
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,580
Gon fought bravely, 
and we wish him luck in his next match.

303
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,333
Well, that’s all for now, folks!

304
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,586
This is your commentator Cocco, 
signing off!

305
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,380
A referee is supposed to be impartial.

306
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,466
But with this matchup

307
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,345
I thought it was prudent 
to try and finish the fight quickly,

308
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,306
even if that meant 
that I had to lower my standards.

309
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,392
[spectator 1] So he’s a technical judge.

310
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,935
[spectator 2] What does that mean?

311
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,397
[spectator 1] See, if a ref thinks 
a fight is gonna get too dangerous,

312
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,485
he’ll award points like crazy 
to try to get it over with fast.

313
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,694
Oh yeah?

314
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,947
Yeah, it’s something you gotta think about 
when you’re placing a bet.

315
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,449
Ah, man!

316
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,577
I was sure Hisoka 
was gonna win ten-nothin’!

317
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,542
About your fight with Hisoka…

318
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,586
There’s nothing I can tell you.

319
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,382
You understand better than anyone,

320
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,258
having faced him yourself.

321
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,260
“Understand”?

322
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,263
What he learned during that fight 
of course.

323
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,431
Right!

324
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,892
What... exactly did you learn?

325
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,060
It’s secret!

326
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,478
[scoffs]

327
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,647
[Wing] Gon. Killua.

328
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,941
As you continue on your paths,

329
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,360
it will become ever more important

330
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,279
to master your very own styles of Nen.

331
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,115
-Yes! 
-Yeah.

332
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,702
I’m really glad I got the chance 
to meet both of you.

333
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,706
I look forward to training hard, 
so I can surpass you one day.

334
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,250
You really think you can surpass us?

335
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,793
I promise you I will!

336
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:11,961
Not gonna happen.

337
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,879
Can’t wait to see you do it, Zushi!

338
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,173
Osu! [laughs]

339
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,509
-[Killua] Well, let's go. 
-[Gon] 'kay.

340
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,345
Bye, Mister Wing! 
And thank you for everything!

341
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,806
Yeah. Thanks a lot 
for all your help, Wing.

342
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,392
You boys take care of yourselves!

343
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,061
[Gon] Bye, Zushi! See you later!

344
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,271
Osu!

345
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,908
[Killua] Well… you finally accomplished 
your goal huh, Gon?

346
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,285
[Gon] Yep!

347
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,246
[Killua] No reason 
for us to stick around anymore, then.

348
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,790
So… what are you gonna do next?

349
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,584
[Gon] I’m going back to Whale Island.

350
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:52,960
[Killua] Whale Island?

351
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,086
Yeah.

352
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,464
Since I was able 
to “pay back” Hisoka,

353
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,424
I want to go back home

354
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,385
and finally show Aunt Mito 
my Hunter’s License.

355
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,222
It’s crazy. 
I haven’t been home in over six months.

356
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,979
-[Killua] I guess I'll come with you. 
-Huh?

357
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,565
Yeah, I really want to meet Aunt Mito.

358
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,984
[Gon] You do? Then let’s go together!

359
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,570
[Killua] Sure. I’ll just tag along.

360
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,162
[Gon] Bye-bye… Heavens Arena.

361
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,877
[narrator] Gon fulfilled his promise 
to punch Hisoka

362
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,670
and return his badge to him.

363
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,923
Despite losing the fight,

364
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:43,552
Gon was satisfied that he had achieved 
his goal at long last.

365
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,973
[theme song playing]

366
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,498
[Gon] Coming up:

367
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,916
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

368
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,293
[both] Hunterpedia!

369
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,961
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

370
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,421
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

371
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,797
Today, we're introducing--

372
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:02,923
-Gon! 
-Who, me?

373
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,051
Gon became my very first friend 
when we met at the Hunter Exam.

374
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,177
He's fun to be around

375
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,929
because his expressions 
are always changing.

376
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,931
And you never know what he’s thinking. 
[chuckles]

377
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,688
[Gon] Next time: “Ging x And x Gon”!

378
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,773
Hey! Wanna come to my house, Killua?

379
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:23,068
[Killua] I-- I’m not v-- very useful b-- 
but t-- thanks for letting me stay over!

380
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,570
[Gon] You're stuttering.
