How the hell do you expect me 
to calm down?!

We got it right! Do you really want 
to jeopardize that?

Is it something I said?

Your superhuman physical ability 
and your powers of observation defy logic.

You, too, are worthy 
to take the Hunter Exam.

The entry period for Hunter applicants 
is officially closed.

So, with no further ado...

the Hunter Exam will now begin!

114
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,897
The first phase is quite simple.

115
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,608
All you have to do 
is follow me to the second phase.

116
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,151
So, try to keep up.

117
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,030
[Gon] That’s when I made friends 
with a boy I met.

118
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,158
His name’s Killua 
and he’s about the same age as me.

-[Killua] Hey. How old are you? 
-Twelve years old.

Same as me.

121
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,964
I think I’ll run for a little while.

122
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,174
Whoa! Cool!

123
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,385
My name’s Killua.

124
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,720
Hi, I’m Gon!

125
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,225
[Gon] 
Hey why do you want to be a Hunter anyway?

126
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,019
Who, me?

127
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,312
I never said I wanted to be a Hunter.

128
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,649
I just heard the Exam 
was supposed to be really hard.

129
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,776
It sounded kinda fun, so here I am.

130
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,945
But it’s not as fun as I thought.

131
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,698
What about you?

132
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,534
[Gon] 
Well, the thing is my dad’s a Hunter.

133
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,663
So, I decided I was gonna be a Hunter 
just like him, no matter what!

134
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,041
[Killua] Hmm. 
So, what kind of Hunter is he?

135
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,292
[Gon] No idea.

136
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,629
-It’s the weirdest thing I’ve ever heard! 
-Huh?

137
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,007
You want to be the same kind of Hunter 
as your dad

138
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,384
but you don’t know anything about him? 
That’s nuts!

139
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,512
Mito’s the one who raised me 
and she told me a little,

140
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,682
but I’ve only ever seen him in pictures 
she showed me from a long time ago.

141
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,477
-Wait, so who’s Mito? 
-She’s my aunt.

142
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,770
Ah.

143
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,940
She said that my dad took the Hunter Exam 
when he was only 12 years old, too.

144
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,693
He passed his first try 
and became a Hunter.

145
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,570
That's when he decided 
to leave the island.

146
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,823
So, I came here in order to find out 
why he chose being a Hunter

147
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,325
over staying at home with me.

148
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,701
Hm...

149
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,038
[examinee] The exit!

150
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,247
Oh, thank goodness!

151
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,715
[both] Goal!

152
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,054
Yeah! I did it! I finished first!

153
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,681
What are you talking about? I totally won.

154
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,647
Now, let’s go over the rules of the game.

155
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,483
All you have to do 
is simply take this ball away from me.

156
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:13,071
If you can do that 
before the airship arrives, you win.

157
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,543
[both] I’ve almost got it!

158
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,383
[Gon] Whoa!

159
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,181
Well now.

160
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,687
Excellent teamwork! 
You get an ‘A’ for effort!

161
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,440
The Hunter Exam’s...

162
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,193
[in unison with Gon's voice] 
...been a lot of fun with Killua around.

163
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,863
We’re best friends now, 
so that’s pretty cool.

165
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:08,001
LETTER

166
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,753
[Gon] Besides Killua,

167
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,797
there are applicants 
from all over the world

168
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,382
who came to take the Hunter Exam,

169
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,259
so there are lots of amazing people.

170
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,729
[appreciative exhale]

171
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,814
Not bad,

172
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,357
little boy.

173
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,986
Is that a fishing pole?

174
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,030
How original!

175
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,868
I’d like to see it. Do you mind?

176
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,786
[Leorio] Leave him alone.

177
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,040
[yells] Your fight’s with me!

178
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,088
[roaring]

179
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,927
[Hisoka] 
Did you come here to help your friend?

180
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,053
[gasps]

181
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,473
Such a good boy.

182
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,602
I adore that look.

183
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,063
[grunting]

184
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,652
Well done.

185
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,656
I’m beginning to get excited.

186
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,081
[roaring]

187
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,462
[Gon choking]

188
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,257
[Hisoka] It’s so delightful.

189
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,135
I love that look!

190
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,059
[coughing]

191
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,688
[Hisoka] Don't worry.

192
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,984
I didn’t kill your friend. 
He’s going to be just fine.

193
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,779
And that’s because he passed!

194
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,406
[Hisoka chuckling]

195
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,034
And yes.

196
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,661
You pass as well.

197
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,497
Now, go and become a good Hunter.

198
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,839
[Gon] But I’ve gotta say.

199
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,049
It was actually pretty exciting 
back there.

200
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,554
I was so scared that all I wanted to do 
was run away.

201
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,972
But I couldn’t.

202
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,850
‘cause I was excited at the same time.

203
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,226
Isn’t that weird?

204
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,152
There were 404 applicants 
at the start of the Hunter Exam

205
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,821
but by the time 
we reached the Third Phase,

206
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,948
there were only 41 left.

207
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,409
[Beans] Ah… Ahem.

208
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,288
Everyone. This is the site 
of the Exam’s Third Phase.

209
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,791
You’ll be competing here 
at the top of the Trick Tower.

210
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,585
Did you say, ‘Trick Tower’?

211
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,587
[Beans] In order to pass this Phase

212
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,298
you must 
reach the base of the tower alive.

213
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,217
The time limit is 72 hours.

214
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,515
[Leorio] Whoa. Where the hell are we?

215
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,434
See that? Over there.

216
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,651
[Lippo] Gentlemen, let me explain.

217
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,488
You’ve probably already noticed

218
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,949
that some of the prisoners of Trick Tower 
are standing before you.

219
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,077
Not just prisoners.

220
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,413
The Hunter Exam Committee 
has also officially hired them on

221
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,748
as Examiners.

222
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,920
In this Phase you’ll be fighting 
against all five of them.

223
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,714
Without knowing what’s up their sleeves,

224
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,508
there’s far too much at stake.

225
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,260
-Given that, I’ll- 
-[Tonpa] Nope. I’ll go.

226
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,222
Mister Tonpa?

227
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,895
[Tonpa grunting]

228
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,188
[Bendot] Begin!

229
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,983
[growling]

230
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,654
[yells] I... give up!

231
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,905
Huh?

232
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,698
What?

233
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,204
Did he just...

234
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,540
say that he gives up?

235
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,168
Uh maybe he meant ‘give me a sec’…

236
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,255
[chuckles lightly]

237
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,176
We each light a candle at the same time

238
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,304
and whoever’s candle goes out first 
is the loser.

239
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,724
[startled cry]

240
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,228
Hey. Take a look at Gon’s candle.

241
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,647
The flame suddenly got a lot stronger!

242
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,441
I should’ve known.

243
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:45,361
He somehow laced Gon’s candle 
with gunpowder or some other accelerant.

244
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,488
That’s why it’s burning so much faster!

245
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,784
I guess now that the flame’s burning 
so much stronger,

246
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,871
it’ll take a lot more than a little breeze 
to put it out.

247
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,873
[Sedokan gasps]

248
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,417
He’s fast!

249
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,752
[Gon blows the candle]

250
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,048
[chuckles]

251
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,967
I win!

252
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,560
Look at his tattoo;

253
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,228
it’s a spider with twelve legs!

254
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:20,771
And that means…

255
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,398
Name’s Majitani!

256
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,276
I’m one of the Phantom Troupe’s 
four devas!

257
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,778
That first strike 
was just an introduction.

258
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,324
This is your last chance to give up.

259
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,868
If you do, I’m still willing to...

260
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,174
Hey… What’s wrong with you?

261
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,759
What are you--

262
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:51,886
Huh?

263
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,014
[strangled cries]

264
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,409
All right! I know what we’re betting on!

265
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,412
Let’s bet on 
who’ll win rock paper scissors!

266
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,415
[giggles]

267
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,125
Hey, what’s so funny?

268
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,212
[Leroute] It’s just I can already tell 
what you’re going to use.

269
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,507
I’m something of a mind reader, you see.

270
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,467
That’s a lie!

271
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,843
You can bluff all you want,

272
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,179
but it’ll take a lot more than that 
to scare me!

273
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,681
You’ll believe it soon…

274
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,266
[grunts]

275
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,644
-You ready? 
-[cries out]

276
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,813
And rock! Paper!

277
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,106
[both] Scissors!

278
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,573
[Leroute] Well? What’ll you use next?

279
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,950
Come on. Think hard.

280
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,702
[Leroute laughs]

281
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,453
Damn it! [grunts]

282
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,955
[screaming]

283
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,540
What is happening?!

284
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,749
Here we go!

285
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,336
Here comes the draw!

286
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,175
[laughs]

287
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,344
I win! Yay!

288
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,017
How do you wanna do this?

289
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,226
[man] Do this?

290
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,145
You have the wrong idea.

291
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,691
See, you’re about to be on the wrong side 
of a one-sided massacre.

292
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,653
I don’t care about the Exam 
or reducing my sentence.

293
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,906
All I want is to hear you scream.

294
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,034
Really? Fine.

295
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,202
We’ll just keep fighting 
until one of us dies.

296
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,497
That’s right. A battle to the death.

297
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,960
Soon... I’ll tear your body apart

298
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,630
with just my bare hands. You got it?

299
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,967
[heart beating]

300
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,427
[all gasp]

301
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,731
[heart beating]

302
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,486
That’s mine.

303
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,779
[grunts]

304
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,822
It belongs to me.

305
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,242
Give it back.

306
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,786
Give it to me.

307
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,760
[announcer] Please select a path.

308
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,513
There are two available options 
to choose from.

309
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,766
The long and difficult path 
which the entire group can take,

310
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,394
or the short and easy path

311
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,938
which will be limited 
to only three of you.

312
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,651
I’m going to press ‘O’.

313
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,822
It’s just we all made it this far 
by working together.

314
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,156
We should finish together.

315
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,533
Gon…

316
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,952
[Gon] It’s a big risk. I know that.

317
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,995
But still, we’ve got to try!

318
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,331
[grunting]

319
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,135
[Gon] 
We entered the long and difficult path,

320
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,928
broke down the wall

321
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,014
and from there, 
we snuck into the short and easy one.

322
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,150
Boy, my butt hurts!

323
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,070
I certainly wasn’t expecting 
the short and easy path to be a slide.

324
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,073
[Hisoka] Three of them, eh?

325
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,784
[announcer] Thirty seconds remain.

326
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,620
Even with that big slide, 
that was really close!

327
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,789
My hands are covered in blisters.

328
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,249
[Leorio] Same here.

329
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,045
[announcer] Leorio, number 403, 
is the twenty-third to pass.

330
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,548
My hands are wrecked

331
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,926
but all five of us 
cleared the tower together, didn’t we?

332
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,866
And it’s all thanks to Gon!

333
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,308
[long signal sounds]

334
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,227
[announcer] The Third Phase 
of the Hunter Exam is over!

335
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,855
Twenty-five applicants have passed,

336
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,815
including one deceased.

337
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,739
[Gon] That’s pretty much it, Aunt Mito.

338
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,825
That’s how I completed 
the Third Phase of the Exam.

339
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,204
I don’t know how many phases 
are left to go

340
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,040
but I’m gonna pass every last one of ‘em.

341
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,792
‘cause I’m gonna be a Hunter...

342
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,169
just like Dad.

343
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,129
Until next time!

344
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,381
Gon Freecss.

345
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,475
[Mito] Well, did you hear that, Ging?

346
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,394
It looks like your son is following 
in your footsteps.

347
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,274
So? Are you happy?

348
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,404
[theme song playing]

349
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,990
[Gon] Next time: "Hit x The x Target!"

350
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,491
A sneaky hit!

351
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,577
[Hisoka] Hit and run.
