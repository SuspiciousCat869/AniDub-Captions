[narrator] Ten:

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,882
The ability to envelop your body 
in a shroud of Nen aura,

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,260
making it tougher and slowing 
the effects of aging.

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,387
Zetsu:

5
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,098
A technique which shuts off 
your flow of Nen aura.

6
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:19,019
Effective for concealing your presence 
and recovering from fatigue.

7
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:20,854
Ren:

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,525
A technique for creating 
an especially strong Nen aura.

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,069
It is crucial for increasing your power.

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,905
Hatsu:

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,700
The release of your Nen aura 
after using Ren to boost it.

12
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,830
These four elements 
are known as the Four Exercises

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,542
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,218

[clapping]

16
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,379
Splendid. Just splendid.

17
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,965
Including your last two matches,

18
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,217
you’ve made progress.

19
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,430
You’ve made the grade, 
so set the place of your choosing.

20
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,226
I’ll take you on any time.

THE x TRUE x PASS

23
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,451
[narrator] Hisoka finally consents 
to a fight with Gon,

24
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:44,373
who prepares by continuing 
to train tirelessly in the use of Nen.

25
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,794
[Wing] Today we’re going 
to begin our study of Hatsu.

26
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,505
Once you master Hatsu,

27
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,424
then you will have mastered 
all of the basics of Nen.

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,718
At that point in your education

29
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,429
you’ll need to start developing 
your own Nen style.

30
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,764
[Gon, Zushi and Killua] Osu!

31
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,434
[Wing] Hatsu is the technique 
by which you control your aura.

32
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,562
In other words, 
it’s the culmination of Nen abilities

33
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,648
of which there are six categories.

34
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,903
Enhancers strengthen and reinforce 
natural abilities.

35
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,031
Emitters propel aura.

36
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,660
Transmuters change the quality of aura.

37
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,414
Conjurers materialize objects out of aura.

38
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,959
Manipulators control things with aura.

39
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,005
And Specialists are those 
with a unique and distinct aura

40
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,591
that doesn’t fall 
within the other five classes.

41
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,722
It’s incredibly important 
that you find an ability that suits you.

42
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,182
What do you mean, ‘suits you’?

43
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,351
[Wing] Nen abilities are highly personal

44
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,979
with two areas of particular prominence.

45
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,232
The ability that you’re born with

46
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,027
and of course, the ability 
you’ve refined later in life.

47
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,697
For example:

48
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,282
Gon here was born with muscles

49
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,534
that are more flexible and springy 
than most.

50
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,415
His acute senses were honed 
by a childhood spent mostly in nature.

51
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,169
So, you see, from the moment of birth

52
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,380
your Nen ability falls 
within one of the six categories.

53
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,759
It’s possible for your Nen aura 
to change types later on,

54
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,427
although that’s quite rare.

55
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,806
If you attempt to learn a new ability,

56
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,476
one that doesn’t fit your natural aura,

57
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,186
you will have a hard time.

58
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,359
This depicts the compatibility 
of the six categories.

59
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,737
The closer a class is to your own,

60
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,031
the greater your chances of learning it.

61
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,493
If you are born with an aura 
of the Enhancer category,

62
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:48,330
you will find Enhancer abilities 
easiest to learn and master.

63
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,666
The adjacent Transmuter 
and Emitter classes

64
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,543
will also be easy to pick up.

65
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,295
On the other hand,

66
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,881
the Specialist class, 
which is furthest away,

67
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,592
would undoubtedly prove quite difficult.

68
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,930
I’ll demonstrate using skills 
you’ve already seen.

69
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:11,061
Hisoka is able to change his aura 
into a rubber-like substance.

70
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,562
So, he’s a Transmuter.

71
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,608
Gido uses his tops as a weapon 
by making them spin faster,

72
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,652
which is an Enhancer power.

73
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,072
But trying to manipulate so many tops 
as weapons

74
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,741
also requires the skill of a Manipulator.

75
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,620
Since that isn’t very compatible, 
he wasn’t very effective.

76
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,705
As for Kastro,

77
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,208
his Tiger Bite Fist was incredibly strong.

78
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,709
Had he mastered it,

79
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,337
he would have been 
among the strongest Nen users.

80
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,800
I believe that his aura 
fell into the Enhancer class.

81
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,802
However, he made the choice

82
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,471
to focus his energy on the power 
to create a double,

83
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,348
which is a Conjurer ability.

84
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,560
He also required 
the ability of a Manipulator

85
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,478
to control the double.

86
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,855
As you can see,

87
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,275
both of those are relatively far 
from the Enhancer category.

88
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,487
[Gon] So neither of them 
was compatible with an Enhancer type?

89
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,239
Correct.

90
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,408
Learning an incompatible ability

91
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,578
requires a great deal 
of work and natural talent.

92
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,247
As a result of the focus of his training,

93
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,125
he squandered most of his talent 
in Nen ability.

94
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,918
What you’re saying is,

95
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,670
Kastro made the wrong choice.

96
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,505
He was such a great fighter.

97
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,798
What a shame.

98
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,508
What do you think?

99
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,635
Are you all 
beginning to see the importance

100
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,513
of fully understanding your own aura 
as well as its nature?

101
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,723
[Gon and Zushi] Osu!

102
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,016
[Killua] Okay, so…

103
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,020
if you don’t know your aura’s type, 
like, what category it’s in,

104
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,479
is there a way to find out?

105
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,232
There is.

106
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,281
Water Divination,

107
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,868
a Shingen-ryu screening tool 
for classifying aura.

108
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,037
It’s also used in training Hatsu.

109
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,583
Perform Ren with your hands 
placed on either side of the glass.

110
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,336
Your ability will be revealed 
by what happens.

111
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,223
[Gon] The water’s overflowing!

112
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,435
[Wing] If the volume of water changes,

113
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,354
then you’re an Enhancer.

114
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,900
This change demonstrates that my aura 
falls within the Enhancer category.

115
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,278
Okay. Now it’s time for you to try.

116
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,208
So Gon’s an Enhancer, too?

117
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,132
-[Killua] Hm? 
-[Zushi] The leaf moved!

118
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,260
That movement indicates 
that you’re a Manipulator.

119
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,683
All right, then. That just leaves me.

120
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,731
[focusing grunt]

121
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,445
What gives? Nothing’s happening.

122
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,989
[Wing] Indeed…

123
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,241
The leaf isn’t moving either…

124
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,494
Does that mean… 
I don’t have what it takes?

125
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,537
Oh, no.

126
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,247
Try tasting the water, Killua.

127
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,415
[Killua] Taste it?

128
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,712
Hey… I think it might’ve gotten sweeter.

129
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,380
Yeah, you’re right!

130
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,549
That’s true. It does taste sweet.

131
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,010
Wait… then this isn’t plain water?

132
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,012
Perfectly ordinary.

133
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,764
Only the taste of it has changed…

134
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,433
due to Killua’s aura.

135
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:37,934
What does that mean?

136
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,769
[Wing] It means you’re a Transmuter.

137
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,521
Wow!

138
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,148
You’re a Transmuter?

139
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:48,570
Okay. Now the three of you know exactly 
what kind of aura you’re working with.

140
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,405
For the next four weeks,

141
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,865
I want you three to train

142

a more pronounced change in the water.

00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,262
-Killua, you're up first. 
-All right.

165
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,777
I'm done.

166
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,782
So sweet!

167
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,118
You’re right! It tastes like honey!

168
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,037
Excellent. And Zushi?

169
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,372
[Zushi] Osu!

170
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,376
[straining grunt]

171
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,632
[Gon] Whoa!

172
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,135
[straining grunt]

173
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,307
[exhausted exhale, defeated sigh]

174
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,226
That’s the best I can do!

175
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,769
That’s all right.

176
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,189
But it isn’t going to be enough to pass.

177
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,858
I’m afraid you’ll need to train 
a bit more.

178
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,067
Osu.

179
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,611
Next… Gon.

180
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,820
Osu!

181
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,248
[glass crackles]

182
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,000
[both gasp]

183
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,920
Stop! Gon, stop!

184
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,010
The water increased so forcefully 
it cracked the glass.

185
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,095
Honestly...

186
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,264
I’m impressed!

187
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,476
I was feeling pretty good about this.

188
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,895
All right, Gon, Killua.

189
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,606
Today, you are both graduating.

190
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,316
-Oh... 
-Really?

191
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,818
-We did it, Killua! 
-That’s awesome!!

192
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,112
Master… Do I graduate, too?

193
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,158
You still need to train 
a little bit longer.

194
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,118
Osu…

195
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,370
Just keep at it.

196
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,829
Yeah. You’ll get it!

197
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,956
Osu...

198
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,832
-And Gon… 
-Oh?

199
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,751
I’ve one more thing for you.

200
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,087
Something important I still need to say.

201
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,713
What is it, Mr. Wing?

202
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,549
The Other Hunter Exam…

203
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,717
You’ve passed it...

204
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,135
Gon Freecss.

205
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,224
Congratulations.

206
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,392
You made it!

207
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,898
[Gon] The Other Hunter Exam?

208
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,358
That’s correct.

209
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,527
You were able to pass with flying colors.

210
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,903
What do you mean, sir?

211
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,116
One cannot be a full-fledged Hunter 
without learning how to use Nen.

212
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,662
Such skill and power are requirements 
of a terribly dangerous profession.

213
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,248
One of your duties as a Hunter

214
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,460
will be attempting to apprehend 
evil poachers and other such criminals.

215
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,715
You must be strong enough to fight crime 
if you are to be a true deterrent.

216
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,510
But this power is highly destructive 
when abused.

217
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,638
Revealing the existence of Nen 
during the Exam

218
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,015
would be quite risky.

219
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,393
Therefore, only those 
who have already passed the Main Exam

220
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,519
are tested.

221
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:32,895
Oh, I get it.

222
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,315
You would’ve tested us, 
Gon at least,

223
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,108
no matter what happened, wouldn’t you?

224
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,067
[Wing] Yes.

225
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,030
I should also have mentioned 
that the Grand Master of Shingen-ryu

226
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,531
happens to be Chairman Netero.

227
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,741
[Gon and Killua gasp]

228
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,452
[Wing] 
The master has told me so much about you.

229
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,370
That goofy old man?

230
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,705
[Wing] Killua.

231
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,789
[Killua] What?

232
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,417
I want you to go back 
and take the Hunter Exam again.

233
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,337
You’ll definitely pass next time.

234
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,005
-Oh... 
-He’s right!

235
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,467
At this point, 
you are more than qualified enough.

236
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,052
That I can guarantee.

237
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,805
Well… if I feel up to it.

238
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,640
[Gon] Hey, Mr. Wing?

239
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,810
Have you heard anything 
about any of the other people who passed?

240
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:13,853
I have.

241
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,982
Hanzo and Kurapika

242
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,610
have learned Nen from other teachers.

243
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,156
Pokkle, on the other hand, 
is struggling with Ren.

244
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,744
Leorio has begun studying 
for the medical school exam.

245
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,207
Hisoka and Illumi were already 
well-versed in the use of Nen,

246
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,084
so they were qualified, of course.

247
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,087
[Gon] 
So Kurapika and Leorio are working hard!

248
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,380
[Killua] Yeah.

249
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,340
That’s not all, Gon.

250
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,634
I have one bit of advice.

251
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,512
When you fight Hisoka tomorrow,

252
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,806
don't push yourself too hard.

253
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,016
-All right? 
-Right!

254
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,483
Zushi.

255
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,361
You will continue your training 
for four more weeks.

256
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,445
Osu...

257
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,157
Have more confidence.

258
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,787
You’re really progressing 
at an incredible pace.

259
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,997
You’re one in a hundred thousand.

260
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,375
Wait, I’m one in a hundred thousand?!

261
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,793
O-- Osu!

262
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,503
Those two, however…

263
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,964
are even rarer talents.

264
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,882
Perhaps one in ten million.

265
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:26,926
Osu!

266
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,305
Is that supposed 
to make me feel better, Master?

267
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,267
[Zushi] But… One day…

268
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,519
I’m gonna catch up to both of them!

269
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:04,922
[Cocco] Hello, everyone!

270
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,759
In the arena today we have a match 
between Gon and Hisoka!

271
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,888
The battle you’ve all been waiting for 
is about to begin.

272
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,599
And as you can see, the stands are packed!

273
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,686
The fight hasn’t even started 
and the tension in the air is palpable!

274
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,480
[spectator 1] How much longer?

275
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,898
[spectator 2] Come on, let’s go!

276
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:27,987
[flexes knuckles]

277
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:33,993
[determined grunt]

278
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,873
[cheering]

279
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,424
[Cocco] The first to arrive is Gon!

280
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,885
After four fights, 
he has a three-one record.

281
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,845
He’s really on a roll!

282
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,264
[spectator 3] You can do it, Gon!

283
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,433
[spectator 4] 
Hey, where’s your fishing rod?

284
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,769
You can’t catch Hisoka 
with your bare hands!

285
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:06,984
[Cocco] And next, arriving in the arena 
with a fiery display…

286
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,820
is Hisoka!

287
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,990
[cheering]

288
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,826
[Cocco] The memories 
of his lethal battle with Kastro

289
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,412
are still fresh in everyone’s minds!

290
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,457
A nine-three record means a win today

291
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,085
earns him the right 
to challenge a Floor Master!

292
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,422
He’s won every single match 
he’s actually showed up for.

293
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,634
Will his undefeated streak continue?

294
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,846
[cheering]

295
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,066
[Hisoka] Oh...

296
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,236
Don’t look at me like that…

297
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,612
SCHWING

298
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,739
It’s really turning me on!

299
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,454
[Wing] What a sinister aura he has.

300
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,040
Gon… don’t overdo it.

301
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,167
[audience] Oh!

302
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,384
You win by points or knock out.

303
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,595
No time limit!

304
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,972
One round!

305
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,226
Begin!

306
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,147
[Cocco] This is the match 
you’ve been waiting for, folks!

307
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,898
The die has been cast!

308
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,776
Who will make the first move?

309
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,988
It's Gon!

310
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,616
[Gon grunts]

00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,201

A clean hit! Hisoka: One point!

322
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,431
[audience roaring]

323
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,559
That... was an amazing exchange!

324
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,771
So amazing that I could barely 
get a word in edgewise!

325
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,066
[chuckling]

326
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,026
What’s the matter?

327
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,987
I haven’t moved a single step 
from where I started.

328
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,698
What? Really?

329
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,865
[grunts]

330
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,158
Dammit!

331
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,618
Well, just you wait!

332
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,580
[Gon] Okay.

333
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,833
I shouldn’t have to connect each hit.

334
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,669
I can mix in some feints 
to get the same effect.

335
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,798
[Killua] 
Hisoka looks like he’s having fun.

336
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,426
In terms of actual skill,

337
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,053
there’s a world of difference 
in their combat experience.

338
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,638
But he still has a weakness.

339
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,141
Hisoka thinks he’s stronger,

340
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,810
so there’s no way he’ll ever back down.

341
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,520
That’ll give Gon a chance...

342
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,357
[Gon] Fine. I know just the trick!

343
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,819
[roaring]

344
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,120
[growling]

345
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,666
[Cocco] There it is! Gon’s Stone Flip!

346
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,960
[roaring]

347
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,339
[Hisoka] He shattered the tile 
to create a hail of rubble.

348
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,593
Gon...

349
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,012
Where is he?

350
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:24,867
[no sound]

351
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,672
[narrator] Gon has finally landed 
a critical hit on Hisoka.

352
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,051
But the match has only just begun...

353
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,511
and it won’t be long

354
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,931
before Gon experiences 
Hisoka’s true power.

355
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,684
[theme song playing]

356
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:57,835
[Gon] Coming up:

357
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,420
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

358
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,629
[both] Hunterpedia!

359
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,381
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

360
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,258
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

361
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,885
Today, we're introducing Hisoka.

362
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,429
He reels in opponents 
with Rubbery Nen called Bungee Gum.

363
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,807
And he uses Texture Surprise 
to duplicate other objects.

364
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,976
[both] Schween!

365
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,652
[Gon] Next time: 
“A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick”!

366
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,404
[Killua] Go, Gon, go!

367
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,615
[Gon] Gon Shot!
