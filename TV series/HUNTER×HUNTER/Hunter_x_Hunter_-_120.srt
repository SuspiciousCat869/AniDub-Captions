Narrator: Beelzebub
is pouf’s ability

194
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,817
to split himself into clones,

195
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,387
the smallest
being nano-sized particles.

196
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,858
He can divide himself
into a variety of sizes,

198
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,129
the greater in number
they can be.

199
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,932
However, no matter
the size of his clones,

200
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,267
the core command center

201
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:10,137
must remain at least
the size of a bee.

202
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,372
Shaiapouf: Oh, smoke man,

203
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,475
if you hadn’t
removed the barrier,

204
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:18,278
my main body would never
have been able to escape,

205
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:22,850
and my combat capacity
would have been reduced by half.

206
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:27,154
I’m sure a puppet master such
as yourself is acutely aware

207
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,423
of the incomparable
difference in strength

208
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,092
between a clone
and your own body.

209
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:37,131
But now that i’m free,
i’m invincible.

210
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,966
You’ve already lost.

211
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,002
You should have deliberated
a little more carefully.

212
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,439
When you realized
the pupa was empty,

213
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,140
you could have asked yourself

214
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,576
whether its contents
had escaped the smoke

215
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,012
or whether they remained inside.

216
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,216
Even if I seemed to speak
from the outside,

217
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,818
you could have asked yourself

218
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,120
whether or not the voice
was even real.

219
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,956
The plan I executed earlier

220
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,194
was an act of pure desperation
borne out of necessity.

221
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,931
My clones could have continued
to undermine your comrades

222
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,766
for quite a long time,

223
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,501
and some might have been fooled,

224
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:18,172
but as long as a few were
as skilled as you seem to be,

225
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,774
they would have
realized that I was a fake,

226
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,375
sooner or later, anyway.

227
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,780
Had you comprehended the truth

228
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:30,150
instead of allowing yourself
to be blinded to it,

229
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,453
had you realized
that my main body

230
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,188
remained within the barrier,

231
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,990
you would have
understood my ability

232
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,393
and would have
searched for me...

233
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,229
And in that case,

234
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,965
I would have had
no way to fight you,

235
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,467
given my reduced state of being.

236
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:48,502
( Squish )

237
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,971
In other words,

238
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,341
if you’d kept me imprisoned
as per your initial plan,

239
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,343
you might have lost
some colleagues,

240
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,412
but you would have
been able to defeat me.

241
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:04,251
Truth be told, I was 10%
resigned to that outcome.

242
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,989
Your emotions were perfectly
aligned to accomplish that.

243
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:12,425
I suppose the explosion
must have thrown you off.

244
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,261
( Sighs ) Such a pity.

245
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,265
But i’m free again,

246
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,869
and now i’ll evaluate
the situation in the palace.

247
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:27,274
Narrator: Morel was far
from being in perfect form,

248
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:31,478
even before the storming
of the palace was under way.

249
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:34,815
He then faced pouf
in a battle of wits

250
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,483
while under tremendous stress,

251
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,386
but considering
his extreme fatigue

252
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,153
and profound anxiety,

253
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:44,024
it’s no wonder
that he jumped the gun.

254
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,425
However, he arrived

255
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:48,329
at the perfect time
to support knuckle,

256
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:51,999
preventing him
from engaging youpi alone.

257
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,369
Therefore, the timing with
which he released smoky jail

258
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:59,473
was in hindsight
quite a miraculous feat,

259
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:04,077
and it was certainly more than
a simple product of coincidence.

260
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:07,948
It would be safe to say morel’s
vast wealth of experience

261
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,851
played a role in saving him.

262
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,986
Not long
after entering the palace,

263
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,022
morel immediately
began to prepare

264
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,057
by weighing
the strength of the enemies

265
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,192
against that of his own team.

266
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,829
Deep down, he knew
they had underestimated

267
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,064
the power of those
they would be fighting.

268
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:28,101
When he realized the length of
time his people could hold out

269
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:31,472
was considerably shorter than he
had previously anticipated,

270
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,507
he shifted his focus to deciding

271
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,842
whether or not
to attack the pupa.

272
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,778
This allowed him
to avoid the turmoil

273
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,547
of choosing
between maintaining smoky jail

274
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:42,283
and supporting his team.

275
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,551
Morel’s cunning,

276
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:47,221
derived from his knowledge
of the battlefield,

277
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,089
saved his friend’s life.

278

The real one’s hidden

280
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:00,567
This time, i’m gonna land
a counterpunch on him.

281
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:10,844
Morel: Five wiped out. 84 left.

The smoke ones are fake.
They feel completely different.

284
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:23,390
When the real one lands a punch,
i’ll know it immediately.

285
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,994
That moment will be his last.

310

It’s the smoke guy

pointy-headed fat thing.
