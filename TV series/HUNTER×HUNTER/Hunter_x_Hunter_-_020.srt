Vast riches.

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,678
Hidden treasures.

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,015
Evil haunts.

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,809
Uncharted frontiers.

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,438
The mysterious unknown.

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,901
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words…

9
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,111
are called…

10
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,491
Hunters.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,747

BAFFLING TURN x OF x EVENTS

00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,126
Oh, good. You’re awake.

18
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,212
Where am I?

19
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,923
In a waiting room 
that is next to the arena

20
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,299
for the Final Phase.

21
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,220
All righty, then.

22
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,139
[Gon] Oh, right.

23
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,308
I was in the middle of the Hunter Exam.

24
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,770
Your arm will be fine, by the way.

25
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,564
The break was clean and easily set.

26
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,609
In fact, that limb will be even stronger

27
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,069
once it mends.

28
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,783
In any case, 
congratulations on your win, Gon.

29
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,500
-Mr. Satotz, I-- 
-You can't.

30
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,091
Just as someone 
who has failed the Hunter Exam

31
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,634
can no longer pass,

32
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,387
someone who has passed the Hunter Exam,

33
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,930
can no longer fail.

34
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,058
What you make of it is entirely up to you.

35
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,478
If you feel you’re unqualified 
to be a professional,

36
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,564
you may put away your license.

37
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,441
Or destroy it, if you wish.

38
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,651
You can even sell it,

39
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,529
though it’s of no practical use 
to anyone else.

40
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,825
However, you have officially passed 
the Hunter Exam,

41
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,203
and no one who passes it 
will ever be allowed to retake it.

42
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,166
Due to the efforts of our predecessors

43
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,002
professional Hunters 
are treated quite well.

44
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,545
As a result,

45
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,464
there is no end of applicants

46
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,258
seeking a license 
for the worst intentions.

47
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,719
If it weren’t for the likes of them,

48
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:25,432
we would gladly pass everyone who applies, 
without exception.

49
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,607
Most professional Hunters

50
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,526
value this card 
even above their own lives.

51
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,570
All the same,

52
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,239
it’s really nothing more 
than a silly piece of junk.

53
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,325
What’s important

54
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,328
is not the way that you become a Hunter

55
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,996
but what you do.

56
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,666
What I do, huh?

57
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,003
[Satotz] Gon.

58
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,840
You must decide for yourself 
when you're ready to use this card.

59
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,885
I’m confident 
that you’ll make the right choice.

60
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,268
[affirmative nod]

61
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,646
You know, 
I got a lot of help to get this far,

62
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,898
and I owe a lot of people 
a bunch of favors.

63
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,360
Once I’ve paid everyone back 
then I think I’ll be ready.

64
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,697
Then please allow me the honor 
of congratulating you once again.

65
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,741
Thank you, Mr. Satotz.

66
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,746
What happened to the other applicants?

67
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,790
The Exam’s still going on, right?

68
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,211
Oh no. The Exam has already ended.

69
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,506
-Seriously? 
-That’s right.

70
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,551
You’ve been out for almost the entire day.

71
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,302
The entire day?

72
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,681
The others who passed 
are completing a brief orientation.

73
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,767
The same orientation you’ll undergo later.

74
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,686
Who wound up failing?

75
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,480
It was...

76
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,193
Killua.

77
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,614
Killua failed?

78
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:05,907
But why?

79
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,035
I feel I should begin

80
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,581
by telling you about all that transpired 
after you lost consciousness.

81
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,042
Perhaps that way, 
you’ll better understand the outcome.

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,674
Just as soon as you were out cold…

83
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,180
Whenever he wakes up,

84
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,433
he’ll probably decline his advancement.

85
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,604
He’s right. 
Sounds like something Gon would do.

86
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,233
Only one person fails this round, right?

87
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,360
So, if Gon is disqualified,

88
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,363
then wouldn’t that render 
the rest of our upcoming fights

89
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,448
completely meaningless?

90
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,743
You’ve no need to worry. 
Gon has certainly passed.

91
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,079
Nothing he says or does 
can change that now.

92
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,956
[both sigh]

93
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,625
[Netero] As a matter of fact

94
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,544
he could even throw a fit 
and kill me where I stand

95
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,255
but we still wouldn’t be able 
to revoke his license.

96
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,673
Yes, I see.

97
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,387
So why?

98
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,181
Why did you let him win?

99
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,975
What did you say?

100
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,144
You didn’t have to kill him.

101
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,772
With your skills, 
you could’ve made him surrender...

102
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,315
somehow.

103
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,782
I expect, when I torture someone,

104
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,534
my victim will despise me 
for the rest of their life.

105
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,704
It's more effective and less stressful.

106
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,040
When you’re in pain,

107
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,669
your eyes show a gleam of hostility 
toward the person responsible.

108
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,381
Even with the most extensive 
training and discipline

109
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,050
that sign of rage 
is difficult to suppress.

110
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,303
But Gon’s eyes had no such gleam.

111
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,555
Can you believe that?

112
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,391
I had just broken his arm.

113
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,060
but I could tell 
just by looking into his eyes

114
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,896
that he had already forgotten 
all about it.

115
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,777
So, I guess you could say 
the little guy won me over.

116
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,153
[amused hmm]

117
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,699
If you need a reason why I “let him win”, 
there you have it.

118
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,997
[Satotz] You won over your opponent, Gon.

119
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,291
Hanzo admitted as much himself.

120
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,256
After that, 
the second match of the Phase began.

121
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,093
[Masta] Round two! Kurapika versus Hisoka.

122
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,679
Begin!

123
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,227
[Satotz] After the two of them 
had been fighting for a while…

124
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,478
[Kurapika grunts]

125
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,688
[gasps]

126
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,314
[inaudible]

127
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,858
[Kurapika stunned]

128
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,234
[Hisoka chuckles]

129
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,616
[Hisoka] I lose this one.

130
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,870
[Satotz] And that’s how Kurapika won.

131
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,372
[Gon] What did Hisoka say?

132
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,082
[Satotz] I couldn’t say.

133
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,502
But I do know 
that he conceded voluntarily.

134
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,631
The third match 
pitted Hanzo against Pokkle.

135
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,303
Pokkle found himself 
In much the same position as you

136
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,639
but he admitted defeat. 
Almost immediately, in fact.

137
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,809
I’m sorry, but I won’t go easy on you.

138
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,104
[Satotz] 
And with that, the match was over.

139
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,983
The fourth match was between 
Hisoka and Bodoro.

140
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,193
[Bodoro roaring]

141
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,449
[grunting]

142
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,578
[groans]

143
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,829
[Bodoro groans in pain]

144
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,707
[Satotz] 
The match was extremely one-sided,

145
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,627
but Bodoro flatly refused to give in.

146
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,676
However, while Bodoro was lying 
on the floor,

147
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,221
Hisoka whispered something in his ear...

148
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,892
And this time it was Bodoro 
who surrendered.

149
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,646
The fifth match featured 
Killua and Pokkle,

150
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,482
but Killua walked away 
as soon as it began.

151
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,820
In a confident tone, he declared…

152
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,116
Yeah, sorry. But I’m just not interested 
in fighting you.

153
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,286
[Satotz] He must have felt certain 
he could win his next match.

154
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,205
But then,

155
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,625
Leorio requested 
that the sixth match be postponed

156
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,336
while Bodoro recovered from his injuries.

157
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,213
So, in the meantime,

158
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,591
the match between Killua and Gitarrackur 
was held.

159
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,594
[Masta] Begin!

160
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,391
[Satotz] It became apparent that Killua 
had made a grave miscalculation.

161
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,321
It’s been a while, Kil.

162
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,181
[Killua gasps in shock]

163
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,109
Big brother!

00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:46,080
ILLUMI

166
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,291
Wait. So Gitarrackur

167
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,335
is Killua’s brother?

168
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,836
Yes.

169
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,297
And his name is Illumi.

170
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,593
[terrified speechless breaths]

171
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:01,930
Hey.

172
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,642
He’s Killua’s brother?

173
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,436
Those needles were used 
to change his appearance?

174
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,610
I heard you stabbed Mom and Milluki.

175
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,028
Guess so.

176
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,739
Mom couldn’t stop crying.

177
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,866
Well, who would blame her?

178
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,160
Anybody’d cry if their kid did that.

179
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,079
She was just so happy.

180
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,580
[Leorio's dumbfounded reaction]

181
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,792
[Illumi] She was delighted to see 
that her son had finally grown up.

182
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,504
But she’s concerned about you 
being out on your own.

183
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,091
And she asked me to check up on you 
when I got the chance.

184
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,425
Lucky me, huh?

185
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,138
I had absolutely no idea 
that you wanted to be a Hunter.

186
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,851
As for me, I’m here to get a license 
for a job that’s coming up.

187
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,605
I don’t actually want to become a Hunter.

188
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,649
I just felt like taking the Exam.

189
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,485
I see...

190
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,696
Well, that’s a relief.

191
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,115
In that case, I have some advice for you.

192
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,494
You're not cut out to be a Hunter.

193
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,748
You were born for one purpose:

194
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,919
To be an assassin.

195
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,553
That’s really what he said?

196
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,640
Killua mentioned his family

197
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,392
but they sound crazy.

198
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,811
But that wasn’t the extent of it.

199
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,857
You’re a puppet of darkness, 
devoid of passion.

200
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:40,153
There is nothing you desire, 
nor is there anything you wish for.

201
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,613
As someone who lives in the shadows,

202
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,576
the only pleasure you’re capable of 
is derived from causing death.

203
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,998
Because that’s how Dad and I raised you.

204
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,082
[quivery breaths]

205
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,170
What do you imagine that you 
would accomplish by becoming a Hunter?

206
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,423
[Killua] It’s true.

207
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,842
I don’t really want to be a Hunter.

208
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,511
But...

209
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,513
everyone wants something.

210
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,349
Even me.

211
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,517
-You don't. 
-Wrong!

212
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,686
There is something that I really want!

213
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,313
[Illumi] Hmm...

214
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,483
Enlighten me. What is it that you want?

215
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,528
Hmm...

216
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,033
What’s the matter?

217
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,285
There really isn’t anything, is there?

218
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,411
There is!

219
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,043
I...

220
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,003
I want to be...

221
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,297
friends with Gon.

222
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,930
I’m... I'm just so sick of killing people.

223
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,599
I want to become friends with Gon...

224
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,644
and just have fun.

225
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,312
Impossible.

226
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,817
You are incapable of friendship.

227
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,737
The only thing that you can do

228
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,615
is discern whether or not 
you can kill them.

229
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,159
That is all you were ever taught.

230
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:16,457
Gon is such a radiant personality 
that you don’t know how to classify him.

231
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,168
You don’t actually desire his friendship.

232
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,045
No…

233
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:26,300
[Illumi] If you stay with him one day 
you’ll end up wanting to kill him.

234
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,636
You’ll wonder if you can.

235
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,805
And you’ll want to find out.

236
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,056
Because…

237
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,351
you are, by nature, a murderer.

238
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,979
[shuddering breaths]

239
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,730
[grumbling]

240
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,901
-We’ve warned you already, sir. So please… 
-[Leorio] Yeah, yeah, I know.

241
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,027
Killua!

242
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,698
I couldn’t care less 
if this guy’s your brother, all right?

243
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,658
He’s a worthless piece of crap!

244
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,243
So, don’t listen to him!

245
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,204
Just beat the crap out of him like usual 
and win!

246
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,832
You want to become friends with Gon?

247
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,750
Are you kiddin’ me?

248
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,754
You’re already friends! 
How do you not know that?!

249
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,089
[Killua gasps]

250
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,592
[Leorio] 
Gon sure seems to think so anyway!

251
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,677
Is that true?

252
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,263
Hell yeah, it’s true, you idiot!

253
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,141
Oh, no. That isn’t good.

254
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,186
So, he already considers Kil a friend?

255
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,189
Fine. Then I’ll just kill Gon!

256
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,733
-[Leorio and Kurapika: shocked] 
-[Hisoka and Netero: surprised]

257
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,403
[Illumi] 
Assassins have no use for friends.

258
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,614
They only get in the way.

259
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,740
[speechless breaths]

260
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,743
Where can I find him?

261
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,580
[Leorio] Please, wait a second!

262
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,457
The match is still--

263
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,251
[Leorio gurgling in pain]

264
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,172
[Illumi] Where?

265
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,383
[Leorio] 
He’s in the waiting room right over there…

266
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,469
-[Illumi] Thank you. 
-[Leorio groaning in pain]

267
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,891
Hmm...

268
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,979
Oh, what a pain.

269
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,275
I need to acquire a Hunter’s license 
right now, so I can do my job.

270
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,403
But if I kill them, I'll fail,

271
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,240
and then Kil will pass automatically.

272
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,367
Oh, no!

273
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,119
The same thing will happen 
if I kill Gon.

274
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:18,996
Hmm...

275
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,623
Wait!

276
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,459
I’ll pass the Exam and then kill Gon!

277
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,836
[shuddering breaths]

278
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,464
You bastard!

279
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,716
[Illumi] If I pass the Exam first,

280
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,971
I can kill everyone here and still 
keep my license, isn’t that right?

281
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,516
Well yes, according to the rulebook.

282
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,476
[Illumi] Did you hear that, Kil?

283
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,190
If you really want to save Gon, 
you’re going to have to beat me.

284
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,240
Will you fight me to save your friend?

285
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,784
You can’t do it, can you?

286
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,703
Because deep down,

287
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,456
you’re more worried about whether 
you can defeat me than anything else,

288
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,749
aren’t you?

289
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,126
[gasps]

290
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,839
[Illumi] 
And... you already know the answer.

291
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,843
“I’m not strong enough 
to beat my big brother.”

292
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,388
Remember the lesson I drilled into you?

293
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,641
Never go up against a superior opponent.

294
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,268
[Killua panting in panic]

295
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,145
[Illumi] Don't move!

296
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,733
Move one more inch 
and I’ll assume the fight has begun.

297
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,279
The same goes for if our bodies 
come in contact with each other.

298
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,530
The fight starts.

299
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,283
There is only one way to stop me

300
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,535
and you know it.

301
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,955
But don't forget...

302
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,000
If you decide that you won’t fight me,

303
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,003
your dear Gon will certainly die.

304
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,046
[shuddering breath]

305
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,048
Take him out, Killua!

306
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,799
We’ll protect you!

307
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,468
He won’t kill you or Gon!

308
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,429
We’ll do whatever we have to do 
to stop him!

309
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,182
Go on! Let him have it!

310
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,059
[shuddering breath]

311
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,109
[Killua] You win, Illumi.

312
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,362
I admit defeat.

313
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,573
[Kurapika and Leorio gasping]

314
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,287
Oh! Excellent!

315
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,207
No need for us to fight then, huh?

316
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,292
[Illumi laughs]

317
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,669
I lied, Kil.

318
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,545
I was never going to kill Gon.

319
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,799
That was only a test 
to see what you were made of.

320
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,967
And now I know for certain.

321
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,056
You are simply not qualified 
to make friends.

322
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,974
Not that you need any.

323
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,436
You’ll keep doing what you’ve always done:

324
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,648
the job Dad and I trained you to do.

325
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,861
I’ll order you to take the Hunter Exam 
when the time is right.

326
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,822
But not now.

327
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,575
[Satotz] 
Something drained out of Killua then.

328
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,663
Leorio and Kurapika did their best to help

329
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,832
but he simply wouldn’t respond.

330
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,002
The sixth match 
was between Leorio and Bodoro.

331
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,465
Bodoro had recovered 
but at the onset of the match…

332
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,633
[Masta] Begin!

333
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,119
[Satotz] It was over in a flash.

334
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,331
And so just like that, 
Killua killed Bodoro.

335
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,294
The committee disqualified him, 
though that goes without saying.

336
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,131
-[Satotz] Gon! 
-[Gon] Where is everybody?

337
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,551
[Satotz] You must lie down! 
You need to rest!

338
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,409
Gon!

339
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,089
Apologize to Killua!

340
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,928
[narrator] Gon was angry.

341
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,015
Illumi had trampled on Killua’s desire 
to be Gon’s friend

342
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,393
sending his younger brother 
into deep despair.

343
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,146
In fact, Gon was more than angry.

344
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,398
He was furious.

345
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,028
[theme song playing]

346
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,614
[Gon] Next time: Some Brother Trouble!

347
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,699
Do Leorio and I look alike?

348
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,367
Get outta here…
