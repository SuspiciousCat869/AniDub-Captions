00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:01,919
TEN (ENVELOPE)

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:03,420
[narrator] Ten:

3
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,965
The ability to envelop your body 
in a shroud of Nen aura,

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,427
making it tougher, 
and slowing the effects of aging.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,595
ZETSU (SUPPRESS)

6
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:12,804
Zetsu:

7
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,390
A technique which shuts off 
your flow of Nen aura.

8
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:19,353
Effective for concealing your presence 
and recovering from fatigue.

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,437
REN (REFINE)

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,396
Ren:

11
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,816
A technique for creating 
an especially strong Nen aura.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,236
It is crucial for increasing your power.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:28,946
HATSU (RELEASE)

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,947
Hatsu:

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,992
The release of your Nen aura, 
after using Ren to boost it.

16
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,164
These four elements 
are known as the Four Exercises

17
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,542
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

18
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:42,960
FOUR EXERCISES

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,385
[theme song playing]

20
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,374
[whooshing]

21
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,920
[Zushi] Master?

22
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:11,798
[Wing] Master...

23
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,593
It was never my intention, but...

24
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,095
have I...

25
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,474
Have I awoken a terrible monster?

26
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:25,562
DESTINY x AND x TENACITY

27
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,565
[narrator] One month has passed

28
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,109
since Gon was injured 
in his fight with Gido.

29
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,653
In Heavens Arena,

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,156
all eyes are focused 
on a certain upcoming match.

31
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,117
[grunting]

32
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,329
Hey, Gon! I got something--

33
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,456
Oh! Killua!

34
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,709
What’s up? I was just thinking about 
going out to look for you.

35
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,295
Whoa! You’re better already?

36
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,464
[Gon] Yeah! [grunts]

37
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,594
Check it out! I’m all good!

38
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,346
Yeah, Okay, I get it.

39
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,266
Those injuries should’ve kept him 
out of commission for four months,

40
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,018
but he recovered in one!

41
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,646
What is your body made of anyway?

42
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,731
I really don’t know how to answer that.

43
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,441
You’re such a weirdo.

44
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,778
So... Weren’t you gonna 
say something earlier?

45
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,613
Oh. That’s right.

46
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,408
Tickets, huh?

47
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,035
But these aren’t just any tickets.

48
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,288
They’re for Hisoka’s fight.

49
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,671
As a 200th floor level fighter 
I got dibs on tickets.

50
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,215
Hisoka’s match is real popular.

51
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,008
I even saw scalpers.

52
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,260
Mmm...

53
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,929
So, I’ve been trying 
to gather up information.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,640
Turns out Hisoka’s the real deal.

55
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,436
He has an eight and three record 
with six KO’s,

56
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,521
all of which ended in death.

57
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,567
[Gon] Yeah, but he’s lost three matches.

58
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,361
[Killua] His three losses were forfeits.

59
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,821
Forfeits? Really?

60
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,490
Well, he reached 
the registration deadline,

61
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,076
so he signed up for a fight, 
then didn’t show.

62
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,619
Okay, what does that mean?

63
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,247
That when Hisoka does compete,

64
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,749
he never loses.

65
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,792
Guess so.

66
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,170
And out of all the times he’s fought,

67
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,756
he’s only given up a total of four points.

68
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,384
One of ‘em was a knockdown 
and three were clean hits.

69
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,888
Which means he’s gotta be as strong 
as any of the Floor Masters.

70
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,515
[Gon] Wow. That’s pretty intimidating...

71
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,978
[trembling with excitement]

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,354
[Killua] Damn it.

73
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,774
You sure don’t look 
very intimidated to me.

74
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,655
[Killua] 
So, his opponent is some guy named Kastro.

75
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,993
Two years ago, he managed to get 
the only knockdown ever against Hisoka.

76
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,119
[Gon] Hmm...

77
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,790
Of the four points Hisoka 
has ever given up to another fighter,

78
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,584
this Kastro guy is responsible 
for three of them.

79
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,795
Three points against Hisoka?

80
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,215
[Killua] 
Guess you could say they’ve got history.

81
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,426
They both registered for the same day, 
so they could fight each other.

82
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,553
[Gon] Hmmm…

83
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,639
This is your chance.

84
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,266
You’ll get to analyze 
Hisoka’s fighting style.

85
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,435
Maybe he’ll even go all-out!

86
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,770
Uh….

87
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,189
Are you sure this is okay?

88
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,316
I made that promise to Mister Wing...

89
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,654
[Wing] I won’t allow you to participate 
in any matches for two months.

90
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,825
Nor will I allow the study of 
or training in the use of Nen.

91
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,078
Are you kidding? 
Of course it’s okay!

92
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,205
You’re just gonna be watching a match.

93
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,040
[both gasp]

94
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,250
Not okay.

95
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,420
Viewing a match counts 
as studying the use of Nen.

96
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,548
Uh, Mister Wing!

97
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,299
C’mon, don’t scare us like that!

98
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,009
[Wing gasps] Gon,

99
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,387
has your arm healed up already?

100
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,931
Uh, yes sir! It’s all better now.

101
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,226
[Wing] What incredible regeneration!

102
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,271
Can’t he watch the match 
since he recovered and everything?

103
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:58,567
Oh, no. When I told Gon he had to 
wait two months, I meant two months.

104
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,277
[groans]

105
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,196
Now, Gon. You still have another month.

106
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,825
You are to continue to practice Ten 
and recover from your injuries.

107
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,911
Um… Right, Mister Wing. I understand.

108
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,997
Well… That’s all, then.

109
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,456
Osu! Take care!

110
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,919
Okay. Well, that’s it.

111
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,088
You’ll just have to watch a recording.

112
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,923
I’ll go see it in person.

113
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,091
Mm.

114
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,971
[Wing] They’ve kept their promise 
every day and have only performed Ten.

115
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,893
I can tell from the faint aura 
that constantly surrounds them

116
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,519
under normal circumstances.

117
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,691
Their aura flows 
like a great but tranquil river.

118
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,154
Master Wing?

119
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,196
[Wing] Hm?

120
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,490
Oh, never mind. It’s nothing, really, sir.

121
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,161
[Wing] This won't do.

122
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,706
It seems I’m the one who’s losing my calm.

123
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,880
[Cocco] Hello! I’m your announcer, Cocco!

124
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,967
Today in Heavens Arena, 
we have Kastro versus Hisoka,

125
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,303
-the match you’ve all been waiting for! 
-[gasps]

126
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,307
Just take a look at this crowd, folks! 
Isn’t it amazing?

127
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,391
[cheering]

128
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,314
The match won’t get started 
for another hour,

129
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,067
-but the arena is already packed! 
-[remote beeps]

130
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,659
[Wing] This is a promise thread.

131
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,287
Its purpose to remind you 
of the promise you made.

132
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,677
[Gon moaning]

133
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:59,270
[Cocco] Hisoka took home the win 
when they faced each other two years ago!

134
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,858
The audience here is obviously fired up 
to see this fated rematch unfold

135
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,861
as Kastro looks to take his 
long-awaited revenge!

136
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,448
His record is eight wins and three losses,

137
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,534
but only because he failed to show!

138
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,287
Hisoka the magician is the grim reaper 
who’s prone to taking days off!

139
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,042
With nine wins after his loss to Hisoka 
for a nine-one record,

140
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,169
only one away 
from challenging the Floor Masters,

141
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,796
is Kastro!

142
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,090
He’s vowed to get payback.

143
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,842
But will he succeed?

144
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,428
Get ready for an epic battle

145
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,848
between the two fighters 
closest to reaching the Floor Masters!

146
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,060
[Killua] Wow. I figured he’d be 
all big and muscle-y.

147
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,437
[Cocco] Next up,

148
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,440
we have an interview with Kastro 
from a few days ago!

149
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,986
I wouldn't fight 
if I didn't expect to win.

150
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,030
You’ll see that in the last two years,

151
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,698
I’ve become a different person.

152
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,451
[Killua] Huh. Sounds confident.

153
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,500
Let’s see if he’s got what it takes 
to back that confidence up.

154
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,972
NO TRESPASSING 
UNLESS AUTHORIZED

155
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,102
[gasps]

156
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,816
Huh? What the-?!

157
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,325
[gasps]

158
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:38,995
[Killua] There he is.

159
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,636
-[Kastro] May I help you? 
-[gasps]

160
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,264
[Killua] What?!

161
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,226
But... that’s impossible!

162
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,104
He was sitting on that couch 
just a second ago.

163
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,522
When did he move?

164
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,817
Did he open the door 
and slip around behind me,

165
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,777
all without me noticing?

166
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,071
No! There’s no way!

167
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,992
I never took my eyes off the door 
until after I heard him talk.

168
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,036
He never had the chance...

169
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,288
So how...?

170
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,793
Oh! Well, I-- 
I was just hoping for an autograph.

171
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,794
[Kastro] From me?

172
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,088
Well, that is quite an honor.

173
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,632
-Killua. 
-[gasps]

174
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,386
I try to keep tabs on all my rivals 
on the 200th floor.

175
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,805
What’s wrong? Isn’t Gon with you today?

176
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,391
Wow, I guess you really 
do know everything, huh?

177
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,768
So, are you here to scout out opponents?

178
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,978
No, not really.

179
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,439
I just wanted to get a look at you 
up close is all.

180
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,526
Well then, now that you have, 
what do you think of me?

181
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,737
You’re pretty damn impressive.

182
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:55,822
Thank you.

183
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,825
And your Zetsu 
was quite impressive as well, Killua.

184
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,826
Oh?

185
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,411
However, you made a mistake.

186
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,205
It would have been wiser 
to conceal your presence here.

187
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,083
Aura of your caliber suddenly disappearing

188
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,586
would be enough to give anyone pause.

189
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,256
So, you’ve been keeping tabs on me 
ever since I got onto this floor?

190
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,507
[Kastro] Pretty much.

191
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,885
Well, then I want to know...

192
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,012
how did you do that just now?

193
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,473
Unfortunately, I cannot tell you that.

194
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,602
After all, I might have to fight you 
one of these days.

195
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,645
Don’t worry ‘bout that.

196
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,190
I don’t really plan 
on fighting here anymore.

197
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,441
[Kastro] Is that so?

198
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,818
Because that isn’t what your aura says.

199
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,073
[chuckles] Oh, I’m only joking.

200
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,201
I’ll show you my answer in the match.

201
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,911
I’ll be waiting at the Battle Olympia.

202
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,706
[door creaking]

203
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,251
I’m certain you can get there.

204
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,630
[angrily] 
I said I’m not gonna fight, okay?!

205
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,881
[grumbles]

206
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,258
[cheering]

207
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,767
[Cocco] It’s finally time!

208
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,146
The long-awaited rematch 
between Hisoka and Kastro has arrived!

209
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,107
I’m grateful, Hisoka.

210
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,610
If not for your initiation,

211
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,404
chances are that I never would have 
gotten this strong.

212
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,740
[chuckling]

213
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,575
Who did you say got strong?

214
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,244
[Kastro] Just so you’re aware,

215
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,913
in the nine matches that I’ve had 
since my loss to you,

216
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,666
I’ve never once used my full power.

217
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,460
Every one of them was a warm-up

218
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,504
to defeating you.

219
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,339
[referee] Begin!

220
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,091
Here I come!

221
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,801
[roaring]

222
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,347
[grunts]

223
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,641
[gasps]

224
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,978
That was a clean hit!

225
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,647
Kastro has landed 
the first strike of the match!

226
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,275
Hmm...

227
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,111
[Killua] What the hell was that?!

228
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,324
Get serious, Hisoka.

229
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,579
[Cocco] 
Kastro has landed the first strike!

230
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,374
Hisoka has surrendered the first point,

231
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,252
after failing to evade 
Kastro’s light-speed chop!

232
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,046
[grunts]

233
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,425
[Killua] Was that an optical illusion?

234
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,973
I’m not the person I was two years ago.

235
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,975
I won’t go so easily next time.

236
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:35,356
I think I’ll decide when I get serious, 
if you don’t mind.

237
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,983
Then so be it.

238
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,611
But I strongly recommend 
that you decide quickly.

239
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,242
[Hisoka grunts]

240
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,580
[audience] Ooh!

241
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,168
[Killua] Again? 
I was sure he'd dodge that one, too!

242
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,047
[grunts]

243
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,510
Are you just going to run,

244
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,970
or are you going to fight me?

245
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,265
[Kastro grunts]

246
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,518
[Hisoka grunts]

247
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,066
That’s a clean hit and a knockdown!

248
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,403
[cheering]

249
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,489
[Cocco] What a surprise, folks!

250
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,032
I can hardly believe it!

251
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,410
Kastro has been knocking 
his opponent around like a rag doll!

252
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,871
The score is now four-zero, but...

253
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,373
what did I just see?

254
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,208
Was that my imagination?

255
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,128
So, you still won’t change your mind?

256
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,673
Is it really preferable to you 
to die in ignorance?

257
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,384
Seems so.

258
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,054
[referee] C--Can you still fight?

259
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,515
-[Hisoka chuckles] 
-[referee gasps]

260
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,979
[Hisoka] Am I seeing things?

261
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,067
Because it looked to me 
like you just vanished.

262
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,029
[Cocco] That’s right! That’s what it was! 
He vanished!

263
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,656
That’s what I saw, too!

264
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,032
No.

265
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,452
‘Vanished’ is close, 
but it’s not quite the right word.

266
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,747
You were right in front of me,

267
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,582
preparing to deal a kick,

268
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,876
and then suddenly, 
you were behind me.

269
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,923
I’d have to say that comes the closest 
to describing what happened.

270
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,220
But something still feels wrong...

271
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,305
out of place.

272
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,682
Yes.

273
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:36,936
I can’t help but feel as if I’m missing 
something very basic here.

274
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,230
This is futile.

275
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,942
You can’t solve anything 
if you keep running away from me.

276
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,320
In any case, I’m done waiting.

277
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,573
I’ll take your arm with my next strike.

278
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,246
If you insist on remaining pompous,

279
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,706
be my guest.

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,336
I’m beginning to think 
that you weren’t meant for anything more.

281
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,298
TIGER BITE FIST

282
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,426
[Kastro growling]

283
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,054
[spectator 1] That’s The Tiger Bite Fist!

284
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,015
[spectator 2] Kastro’s getting serious!

285
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,975
[Killua] Tiger Bite Fist?

286
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,895
Masters can rip whole trees in half 
with their hands

287
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,104
using that technique.

288
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,358
Meanwhile, Hisoka still 
hasn’t figured out Kastro’s ability.

289
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,028
Then again, neither have I.

290
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,947
At this rate, Hisoka’s dead meat!

291
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:31,908
Here I come!

292
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:34,994
[gasps]

293
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,998
Take it already.

294
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,294
[snorts] Is this a trap 
or just foolish complacency?

295
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,172
One way or the other, your arm is mine!

296
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,552
This one, that is.

297
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,141
-What the--?! 
-Hisoka’s arm is...

298
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,978
Hisoka’s right arm 
has been completely severed!

299
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,898
[audience screaming]

300
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,571
If you still think you can get your way, 
you are sorely mistaken.

301
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,617
This is all within expectations.

302
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,161
The hell it is! [grunts]

303
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,876
[Cocco] Wow!

304
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,545
Have we ever seen Hisoka

305
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,172
in such a perilous situation before, 
folks?

306
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,925
He's taken on some serious damage!

307
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,970
[laughs] Yes, I see.

308
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:37,098
Now I know exactly what your ability is.

309
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,391
You can create...

310
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,101
a double, right?

311
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,228
Very impressive.

312
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,605
You finally got it.

313
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,858
A double? What’s he talking about?

314
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,616
[gasping in shock]

315
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,958
So, it wasn’t an optical illusion 
after all!

316
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,460
When Kastro attacked,

317
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,131
it looked like there was another Kastro 
superimposed on top of him!

318
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,302
[Cocco] What in the world 
is going on here?!

319
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,930
Am I seeing things 
or has Kastro really split in two?

320
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,807
Did he just clone himself?

321
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,143
Kastro went from disappearing 
to multiplying!

322
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,645
Did he have a twin all along?

323
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,858
I wonder if this is 
what they call a doppelgänger.

324
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,651
[both] Indeed it is.

325
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,530
[Zushi] Did he say a doppelgänger?

326
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,532
[Wing] Yes.

327
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,783
But Master...

328
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,952
What does that mean? 
I’ve never heard of it.

329
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,788
It refers to a double

330
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,082
or in other words, an additional you.

331
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,544
When you spot someone 
who closely resembles you,

332
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,504
that is called a doppelgänger.

333
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,840
I’m sorry, Master. 
I still don’t get it.

334
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,343
Whenever you encounter your doppelgänger,

335
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,512
you begin to experience 
headaches and fatigue,

336
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,016
both of which continue 
until your double vanishes.

337
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,435
Some people believe

338
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,730
that the double actually siphons energy 
away from the original,

339
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,107
prompting these physical reactions.

340
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,527
But Kastro isn’t suffering at all 
right now.

341
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,321
He’s way too strong for that!

342
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,491
That’s only a story, Zushi.

343
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,453
It’s clear he mastered this

344
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,246
through intense training.

345
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,586
I did as you advised

346
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,339
and observed you without trying to evade.

347
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,842
And it turns out ‘vanished’

348
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,054
was the right word 
for what you’ve been doing all along.

349
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,390
But then,

350
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,477
why couldn’t I shake the feeling 
that there was something missing before?

351
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,146
You vanished, yes...

352
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,191
but I still felt your presence by my side.

353
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,569
In fact, just before you vanished,

354
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,114
I felt even more of you.

355
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,242
Before you disappear,

356
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,119
you duplicate yourself.

357
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,956
[both chuckle] I’m impressed 
that you managed to figure that out.

358
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,627
Using Nen, I was able to successfully 
create a double.

359
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,672
And while my double 
goes on the attack for me,

360
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,966
I lurk safely in the shadows.

361
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,677
[both Kastros] As soon as you react...

362
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,763
[Kastro] ...I release my double 
and attack myself.

363
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,226
[Killua] So that’s why 
he wears those clothes.

364
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,687
The fluttering helps create blind spots.

365
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,606
That’d be hard to figure out 
during combat,

366
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,775
even for a skilled Nen user.

367
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,237
[Kastro] You see…

368
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,698
my double is no mere illusion.

369
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:41,824
It’s real.

370
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,618
Just as real as I am 
until I make it vanish.

371
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,037
You must know this.

372
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,123
You felt it strike against you.

373
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,459
To put it simply,

374
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,919
you’re going to have to face 
two of me at once!

375
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,301
Now behold the culmination 
of my mastery of Nen.

376
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,845
The True Tiger Bite Fist!

377
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,764
[chuckles]

378
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,225
[Cocco] Incredible! 
We have an upset in the making!

379
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,604
Hisoka won two years ago, 
but now he’s in big trouble!

380
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,399
Is Kastro about to avenge 
his only previous defeat?!

381
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,360
And now I will sever your left arm,

382
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:22,323
if only to see if you can maintain 
your appearance of disinterest.

383
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,451
[chuckles] Well, let’s find out...

384
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,539
Maybe I feel more up to it now.

385
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,546
[narrator] Kastro, the fearsome user 
of conjured doubles

386
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,548
and Hisoka, the magician.

387
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:44,345
The end of their battle will be 
as incredible as the match itself.

388
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,389
Though Gon knows nothing of this yet.

389
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,726
[theme song playing]

390
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,252
[Gon] Coming up:

391
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,753
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

392
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,255
[both] Hunterpedia!

393
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,007
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

394
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,592
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

395
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,594
Today, we're introducing Riehlvelt,

396
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,513
who uses accumulated aura 
to move his wheelchair around.

397
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,056
And he fights with two whips!

398
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,434
Come to think of it, 
there’s probably a secret there.

399
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,435
Whip! Whip!

400
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,941
[Gon] Next time: "A x Surprising x Win"!

401
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,860
[Killua] Hey, Gon. 
If you could clone yourself,

402
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:23,944
what would you do?

403
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,404
[Gon] 
Play rock-paper-scissors!

404
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,615
[Killua] 
Wouldn’t you just tie every time?
