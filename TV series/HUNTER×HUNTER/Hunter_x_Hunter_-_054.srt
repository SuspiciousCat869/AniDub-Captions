Ready? Go!

[both chomping]

7
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,400
Kurapika!

8
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,614
-I'm happy for you. 
-Huh?

9
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,157
The Spiders are dead.

10
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,661
And that means that you can finally focus 
on your main goal, right?

11
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,414
You have to go out there and find them. 
The eyes of your people.

12
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,916
Gon...

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,918
Mm!

14
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,962
And if there's anything we can do 
to help you out, just--

15
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,881
[snickering]

16
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,092
-[Gon] Why, you! 
-[Killua yelping]

17
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,678
You did it first. 
I was just getting revenge!

18
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,388
[Gon] I didn't do it on purpose!

19
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,515
-[Killua] You did so, you big liar. 
-[chuckles]

20
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,892

[chuckles]

23
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,774
What are you so upset about, huh?

24
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:15,570
We sold one piece and walked away 
with a cool 355 million Jenny!

25
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,949
That's the problem. 
It could have sold for a lot more.

26
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,367
[Leorio] We got plenty!

27
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,954
Wrong. We could have gotten 
well over 400 million for it,

28
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,372
if we'd just waited.

29
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,791
Bad luck, that's what it is.

30
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,085
You sure take this seriously.

31
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,589
Besides, even if we did get more, 
it’s not like you would’ve seen any of it.

32
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,508
[Zepile] That's not the issue here.

33
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:43,098
If we take the money and run, 
that’s 170 million apiece! [cackling]

34
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,351
Are you really friends 
with Gon and Killua?

35
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,520
-[phone ringing] 
-I'm kidding, lighten up.

36
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,730
Yeah, hello?

37
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,940
Oh. Hey, Kurapika!

38
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,326
Wow, it's been a while 
since we were all together!

39
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,494
Yeah.

40
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,247
[Gon] Where's Mr. Zepile?

41
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,541
[Leorio] Oh, he went back over 
to pick up the check

42
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,126
and find some more loot to sell.

43
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,044
Hey, you know something?

44
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:14,629
[Kurapika] What?

45
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,174
You've got this intensity about you.

46
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,093
Your presence is a whole lot stronger 
than it was.

47
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,136
Really?

48
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,473
Well, I wish I could say the same for you.

49
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,808
And you’ve also gotten 
a lot more annoying!

50
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,893
[elevator dings]

51
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,104
[Leorio] Oh, yeah. 
I heard you killed a Troupe member.

52
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,066
How the hell did you do that 
when you only learned Nen recently?

53
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,779
If the reason you’re asking 
is that you’re planning

54
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,907
to catch the Spiders yourself, 
you can stop.

55
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,825
That's not the only reason.

56
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,870
You've mastered Nen and we want 
to learn how too.

57
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:51,166
Not just to catch the Spiders, 
but because we'll need it in the future.

58
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,960
You don't want my advice.

59
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,671
I'm afraid it won't do you 
any good, anyway.

60
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:57,923
[Gon] Why not?

61
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,636
Because my power can only be used 
against the Troupe.

62
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,845
[all gasp]

63
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,225
[Gon] A contract with conditions?

64
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,434
Yes.

65
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,396
Your mental state has 
an incredibly powerful effect on your Nen.

66
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,275
The more determined you are, 
the more powerful the Nen.

67
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,028
But the risk incurred is great, as well.

68
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,198
In exchange for stronger Nen,

69
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,409
I vowed that I would only use it 
against the Spiders.

70
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,703
And I established a rule for myself.

71
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,414
Oh, yeah? What kind of rule is it?

72
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,460
My chains must be used 
exclusively on the Spiders.

73
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,754
Or I will die as a result.

74
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,172
[both gasp]

75
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,633
Hold on! What do you mean?

76
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,679
There is a Nen dagger in my heart.

77
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,852
If I break the rule, the blade 
will pierce through, killing me.

78
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:57,148
The rule proves my resolve. 
That's the contract with conditions.

79
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:02,362
My ability is the product of my pure 
and unadulterated hatred.

80
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,574
It will only work when used 
on the Spiders.

81
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,078
I'm telling you this because I trust you. 
Don't tell anyone else.

82
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,496
What the hell?

83
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,499
Why would you tell us something 
that's so damn important?

84
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,709
Huh?

85
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,546
I'm not really sure.

86
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,509
Maybe I felt dispirited 
because their leader is dead now.

87
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,803
It'll be fine if we keep it quiet.

88
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,221
No it won't.

89
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,975
One of the surviving members 
has the power to read memories.

90
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:37,230
If the Spiders find out about this, 
Kurapika's a dead man!

91
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,025
But she didn't learn anything last time.

92
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,986
You're right, but that's only 
because we didn't know

93
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,196
Kurapika was the chain user back then.

94
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,534
Okay, so that means we just have 
to stay away from them.

95
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,787
Since they've already checked you out, 
they think that you're clean.

96
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,248
[Killua] 
There's also a guy called Nobunaga.

97
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,208
He's really dangerous.

98
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,254
He's looking for Kurapika 
and he's still trying to get me and Gon.

99
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,925
[Leorio] But he doesn’t know 
that you guys know Kurapika… does he?

100
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,844
-No. 
-Well, then what's the problem?

101
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,388
Just keep your distance 
from the memory reader.

102
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,516
You and everyone else 
who knows Kurapika’s the chain user.

103
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,811
I've also been in contact with Hisoka.

104
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:17,771
[Leorio grunts]

105
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,272
With Hisoka?

106
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,984
[Kurapika] He knows that I am 
the chain user, as well.

107
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,406
We had made a pact, but his target, 
the leader of the Phantom Troupe,

108
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,200
is dead gone now.

109
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,994
So I have no idea what he'll do.

110
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,457
[thunder rumbling]

111
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,169
Hold on just a second.

112
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,296
What do you mean, we're leaving?

113
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,590
[Chrollo] Just like I told you.

114
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,592
We're leaving tonight.

115
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,638
We'll take the rest of the treasure.

116
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,057
And that's the end of it.

117
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,934
-[thunder rumbling] 
-[Nobunaga] Not yet.

118
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,144
[Chrollo] What else is there?

119
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,855
[Nobunaga] We have to find the chain user.

120
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,234
-[Chrollo] You're obsessed. 
-[Nobunaga] Damn right, I am.

121
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:09,239
We haven’t avenged Uvo’s death yet 
and you want us to just pack and leave?

122
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,741
He’s gonna be bored in the next world

123
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,244
if we don’t send the chain user 
to join him.

124
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:19,416
Why don't you cut it out, Nobunaga? 
The boss gave an order.

125
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,836
Right. The boss’ orders are absolute.

126
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:28,842
But I’ve got to wonder, are you really 
speaking as our leader, Chrollo?

127
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,970
Nobunaga, knock it off!

128
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,889
Shut up! I'm trying to talk 
to Chrollo, here.

129
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,731
[Chrollo] Before I can answer...

130
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,525
Nobunaga...

131
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,112
I need you to answer my questions.

132
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,200
[thunder rumbling]

133
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,788
[Chrollo] Nobunaga, 
I need you to answer my questions.

134
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,751
-What's your birthday? 
-Huh?

135
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,253
[Chrollo] I asked what day you were born.

136
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,381
September 8th, in the year '70.

137
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,550
[Chrollo] Blood type?

138
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,093
[Nobunaga] B positive.

139
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,636
[Chrollo] Name?

140
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,681
Nobunaga Hazama. You know that!

141
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,809
What is this? 
What do you wanna know next, huh?

142
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,520
Nothing. That's enough.

143
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,315
Write it all down. Here.

144
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,777
Write it down? 
You could’ve said that to begin with.

145
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,963
Huh? The hell is this?

146
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,884
Your fortune in verse. 
One hundred percent accurate.

147
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:57,347
I can tell the future, a skill I stole 
from Nostrade's daughter.

148
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,225
And you're sure 
that it's completely accurate?

149
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,896
[Chrollo] Each of the four verses predicts 
what's going to happen in that week.

150
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:12,445
"Forever set, a previous moon is lost. 
The others mourn him with ceremony grand.

151
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,490
The wolf alone misses out 
on morning frost,

152
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,618
and seeks frost moon’s shadow 
across the land.

153
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,371
Harvest barren, wine spilled,

154
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,624
lovers slumber 
beside the bloody Scarlet Eyes.

155
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,462
Though cut in half shall be your number, 
unhindered the spider flies."

156
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:36,469
This is the fortune 
Nostrade's daughter gave me yesterday.

157
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,684
It says a precious moon has been lost, 
so is that...

158
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,478
It's Uvo.

159
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,021
[gasps lightly]

160
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,441
[Chrollo] 
That girl didn't know anything about Uvo.

161
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,570
In fact, she'd never heard of any of us.

162
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,699
Yet she was able to predict our attack 
on the Mafia auction.

163
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:02,328
And there were fans 
of her fortune-telling among the Ten Dons.

164
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,207
I get it. That’s why the first time 
we attacked,

165
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,878
somebody had already moved 
the merchandise to a new location.

166
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,840
Kinda curious. 
What was Nobunaga's fortune?

167
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:18,386
My hand wrote it itself. 
I have no idea what it is.

168
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,471
Nobunaga can tell you.

169
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,891
[Shalnark] Well, what's it say?

170
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:28,104
Come next week, 
five of us will most likely die.

171
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,857
Oh, yeah? Does it say which five?

172
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,360
[Nobunaga] 
No. I can't figure any of this out.

173
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,947
Well, I kind of understand 
the second poem.

174
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,450
The spider losing half its number.

175
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,912
The spider would be us, wouldn't it?

176
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:44,913
[Nobunaga] Yeah.

177
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,917
And the limbs would be the members, 
so half would be six.

178
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,086
That means five more after Uvo.

179
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,674
The very same line appeared 
in my fortune too.

180
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,676
[Shizuku] Let me see that.

181
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,349
Hey, Boss. Do you think 
you can tell my fortune?

182
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:13,191
"Forever set, a precious moon is lost. 
The others mourn him with ceremony grand.

183
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,319
But lonely not, be the moon of frost.

184
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,155
Soon your blood will join 
his grave of sand.

185
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,453
In the chamber of treasure ill-gotten, 
there is no choice but endless sleep.

186
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:31,292
Your greatest fear should solitude be, 
lest upon your lonesome form he creep.

187
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:36,214
Just as I expected. 
Looks like I'm gonna die next week.

188
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,715
Seriously?

189
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,636
Yeah, you see? 
I only got two poems in mine.

190
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,431
And look, Pakunoda and Shalnark 
are gonna die too.

191
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,975
-Oh? 
-Really?

192
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,436
How do you know it's Pakunoda 
and Shalnark?

193
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,358
It think the months mentioned here 
refer to Phantom Troupe members.

194
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,446
The frost moon is November. 
Uvo's the 11th member, the 11th month.

195
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,656
[Chrollo] Exactly.

196
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:06,536
The harvest moon is in September, 
the wine moon is August,

197
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,372
and the lover’s moon is June.

198
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,042
This refers to numbers six, 
eight and nine.

199
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:18,131
And "barren" is mentioned, 
which I believe implies death.

200
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,467
I’m just not certain 
who “Scarlet Eyes” refers to.

201
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,303
Well, it isn't one of us.

202
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,389
I'm guessing it might be a reference 
to the chain user.

203
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,557
[gasps]

204
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,518
[Pakunoda] Scarlet Eyes. 
I remember now.

205
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,520
The clan whose eyes turned red.

206
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,606
[Feitan] Then there was a survivor?

207
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,650
[Shalnark] So it would seem.

208
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,610
Will he die too?

209
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,404
It's hard to tell.

210
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,240
It doesn’t say anything other 
than the guy is bloody.

211
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,244
[Shalnark] Nobunaga, this means 
if we fight the chain user,

212
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,165
we'll suffer serious casualties 
and lose half our members.

213
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,169
Your ability can be replaced 
as easily as mine,

214
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,588
but not Shizuku's or Pakunoda's.

215
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,133
The Troupe can't afford 
to lose either of them.

216
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,844
[thunder crashing]

217
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,306
Today is Saturday of the first week.

218
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,392
So if we leave now and return home,

219
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,271
then that means we can avoid 
running into the chain user next week.

220
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,901
The best thing about these fortunes 
is that if we pay attention...

221
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,196
they tell us how to avoid catastrophe.

222
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,533
If we leave here 
without fighting the chain user,

223
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:32,246
this fortune is 100 percent certain 
not to come to pass.

224
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,293
Nobunaga, you and Uvo 
were our attack unit.

225
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,546
You were already prepared to die.

226
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:46,260
I believe that both of you accepted 
that role of your own free will.

227
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,514
[Nobunaga] Yeah, that's right.

228
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,976
[Chrollo] Shizuku, Paku and Shal 
collect intelligence.

229
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,020
They provide our support.

230
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,981
You could even call them our lifelines.

231
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:04,445
And your duty is to serve as their shield. 
You agree with that assessment?

232
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,197
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

233
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,573
[Hisoka] Wait.

234
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,912
You should tell the other members' 
fortunes now.

235
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,833
It’s quite possible 
that they could provide additional clues

236
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,835
for how to avoid the prophecy.

237
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,673
[Killua] What do we do?

238
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,385
Now that we all know 
about Kurapika’s secret,

239
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,761
it’s dangerous to wait.

240
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,849
If Gon or I get captured again, 
we won’t be able to escape.

241
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,560
But we do have Kurapika with us now.

242
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,355
So we need to take them out 
before they can recover or run.

243
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,358
And we know where their current base is.

244
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,279
If we take too long, 
it'll give them a chance to get away.

245
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,448
That means we need to move fast.

246
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,623
They could be making a getaway plan 
as we speak.

247
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,668
We don't have time to overthink it.

248
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,840
That woman, the one who reads memories, 
is a threat.

249
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,428
But now that their leader’s dead, 
I’ll do what Gon suggests

250
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,681
and focus on recovering 
my brethren's eyes.

251
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,017
-Seriously? 
-Yeah.

252
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,768
And you're sure about this?

253
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,271
Look, it's obvious he's made up his mind.

254
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,858
You can try all you want, 
there’s no changing it now.

255
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,278
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,699
But thanks. 
I do appreciate the information.

257
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,119
[phone ringing]

258
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,787
It's from Hisoka.

259
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,915
[gasps]

260
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,709
[Hisoka] The corpses were fake.

261
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,966
[Gon] Kurapika?

262
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,469
The corpses were fake.

263
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,347
[Leorio gasps] 
You mean the Troupe members?

264
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,600
Yeah. The ones we thought 
were dead, aren't!

265
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,312
Of course! A Conjurer could have pulled 
that off easily!

266
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,774
Damn it! Why didn't I realize this sooner?

267
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,444
The situation has changed. 
Now what?

268
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,404
We're here to help.

269
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,948
Right.

270
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,074
Yeah.

271
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,202
[phone ringing]

272
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,329
Hello?

273
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,414
[Melody] Kurapika, it's me.

274
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,042
Oh. Melody. What is it?

275
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,629
[Melody] The community has called off 
the hunt for the remaining Troupe members.

276
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,588
What?

277
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,467
[Melody] We just received word 
that they come from Meteor City.

278
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,886
[Kurapika] The Troupe? Really?

279
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,683
And apparently the order came directly 
from the Ten Dons themselves.

280
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,103
They even took the offer for reward money 
off the table.

281
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,106
[thunder rumbling]

282
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,192
[Killua] The reward's been rescinded?

283
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,694
Seriously?

284
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,448
So the Phantom Troupe 
comes from Meteor City.

285
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,828
It makes sense. 
Their identities are still unknown

286
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,999
And the cops haven’t caught them yet. 
That would explain all of that.

287
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,875
What is Meteor City?

288
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,004
A place populated by people 
who don’t exist,

289
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,797
for all intents and purposes.

290
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,716
There’s a whole city like that?

291
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,511
Yeah. Officially, the town 
has a population of zero.

292
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,390
But it’s said that there are at least 
ten million people who live there.

293
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,855
It started off as a dump 
over 1,500 years ago.

294
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,150
You were allowed to dump anything there.

295
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:34,405
And whatever trash was thrown away, 
that’s what people lived off of.

296
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,659
-Trash, weapons, even people. 
-[baby crying]

297
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,661
[Leorio] No matter what’s left there,

298
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,623
the residents take it in 
without a second thought.

299
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,629
I’ve heard people from Meteor City 
share a bond thinner than water,

300
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,715
but at the same time thicker than blood.

301
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,886
Also, there’s an organization

302
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:01,057
that provides gold and weapons 
under the pretext of dumping garbage.

303
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,893
Namely, the Mafia community.

304
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:08,189
What? What do you mean? 
The Mafia is hunting the Troupe!

305
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,234
In return, the Mafia picks new recruits 
from among the residents.

306
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,280
These are people 
who basically don't exist, remember?

307
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,282
Perfect for criminal activity.

308
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,786
The Troupe managed to destroy 
the intimate business relationship

309
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,538
that used to exist between the Mafia 
and Meteor City.

310
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,374
Even after all that's happened,

311
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,752
the Mafia wants to retain the relationship 
with Meteor City.

312
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,562
[Hisoka] "With eyes of red, 
a customer comes to call.

313
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,649
Half of him an angel, the other death.

314
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,819
Secrets of the moons tell him all.

315
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,364
Those of the frost moon, 
he awaits with bated breath.

316
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,952
On the day of the sun, 
under this customer’s care,

317
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,122
alone with the man of cross reversed...

318
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,042
Removed from the calendar 
is the false hare.

319
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,295
With six months gone, the year is cursed."

320
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,555
What does your fortune say? 
Show me.

321
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,313
I don't recommend it. 
It might startle you.

322
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,232
Oh, just let me see it.

323
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,359
Very well.

324
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,321
[gasps]

325
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:41,323
[Pakunoda] Everyone, look at this.

326
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,911
A customer who has eyes of red?

327
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,080
Wait, the secrets of the moons?

328
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,584
Hold on a minute, those would be 
our secrets, wouldn’t they?

329
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,461
[Franklin] Hisoka, what is this?

330
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:54,879
Let me see!

331
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,256
[gasps lightly]

332
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,843
[Nobunaga] 
"A red-eyed customer comes into view.

333
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,679
Of bartering and sweet deals he croons.

334
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:09,435
The sword of law he plunges into you, 
and makes off with secrets of the moons.

335
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,189
The 11-legged spider longs for home.

336
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,150
Five more legs shall break 
before it's done.

337
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:21,906
But from your shelter do not roam, 
for of those five, you shall be one."

338
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,658
Hisoka.

339
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,288
Did you sell out Uvo?

340
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,542
Answer me!

341
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,968
[narrator] 
The words in Hisoka’s fortune changed

342
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,471
the moment it was passed to Pakunoda.

343
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:49,183
The question is... what could that mean?

344
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,479
[theme music playing]

345
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,547
-[Gon] Coming up, Gon... 
-[Killua] And Killua's...

346
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,923
[both] Hunterpedia!

347
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,508
-I'm Gon! 
-I'm Killua!

348
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,302
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

349
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,804
Today, we'll introduce Bonolenov! 
He's a Troupe member.

350
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,141
His face, body and powers 
are completely covered by bandages.

351
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:16,020
[both] Spin, spin, spin, spin!

352
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,945
[Gon] Next time: 
"Allies and Lies."

353
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,573
-[Killua] My Highness. 
-[Gon] Your Highness?

354
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,200
-[Killua] His Highness, Killua! 
-[Gon] Yeah, yeah.
