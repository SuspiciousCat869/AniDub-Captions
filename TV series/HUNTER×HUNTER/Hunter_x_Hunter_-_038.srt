00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,945
are called...

Hunters.

[theme song playing]

13
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,908
What’s that?

14
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,620
-It's something Ging left with me. 
-What?

15
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,873
He asked me to give this to you 
when you became a Hunter.

[narrator] 
Three mysterious items were inside the box

19
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,805
that had been sealed with Nen...

20
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,808
One of these items, an old cassette tape,

21
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,811
gave Gon a long-awaited opportunity:

22
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,607
the chance to hear his father’s voice 
for the first time.

23
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,652
[Ging on tape] Hey... Gon.

24
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,489
So, you became a Hunter too, huh?

25
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,450
This is my dad’s voice...

26
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,494
[Ging] Anyway...

27
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,287
I have a question for you.

28
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,873
Do you...

29
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,833
want to see me?

30
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,543
[gasps]

31
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,004
[Ging] If you do,

32
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,839
keep listening.

33
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:54,966
If you don’t,

34
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,135
just press the stop button.

35
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,853
I'm guessing that's a "yes".

36
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,314
But I’ll ask you one more time.

37
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,817
Are you sure?

38
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,487
Hunters are selfish creatures.

39
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,532
We’re willing to sacrifice 
anything and everything

40
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,200
to get what we want.

41
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,329
If you just think 
it would be nice to see me...

42
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,997
stop the tape here.

43
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,875
I’ll give you a minute.

44
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,378
What do you think?

00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,396
Well... I don’t want to see you.

[both gasp]

52
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,859
[Ging] Honestly, I don’t know 
how I could face you.

53
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,445
After all...

54
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,530
I walked away from being a parent

55
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,157
for purely selfish reasons.

56
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,034
I’m not a decent guy...

[birds tweeting]

00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,876
[Ging] I don’t have any way of knowing 
how much time will pass

59
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,419
before you listen to this tape.

60
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,297
I figure it’ll be at least ten years.

61
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,093
But it doesn’t matter.

62
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,721
There’s one thing that will never change.

63
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,186
I’ll always be...

64
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,687
the guy I am.

68
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,246
[Ging] As you sit there, 
listening to this tape,

69
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,458
I’m sure I’ll be off, 
horsing around somewhere.

70
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,712
If you still want to see me,

71
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,047
find me.

72
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,632
But like I said...

73
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,009
I don’t want to see you.

74
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,677
If I hear you coming,

75
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,054
I’m gonna bolt.

76
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,973
Catch me if you can.

77
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,935
You are a Hunter now, aren’t you?

78
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,608
[Killua] Hmm.

79
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,110
If you thought your dad 
would be easy to track,

80
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,654
then you better think again.

81
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,280
-[Gon] Hey, wait. 
-Hmm?

82
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,200
-Ging’s still there. Let it play. 
-Oh.

83
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,160
[Ging] Oh...

84
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,830
there’s one more thing 
I forgot to mention.

85
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,666
It’s... about your mother.

86
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:33,834
[gasps]

87
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,670
[Ging] If you want to know more, 
keep listening.

88
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,839
If you don’t then--

89
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,383
Are you sure?

90
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,801
Uh-huh.

91
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,803
But what about the rest of it?

92
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,429
What if he left you another clue?

93
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,181
No way. Not him.

94
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,058
I can feel it.

95
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,394
And like I said before...

96
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,895
I do have a mom:

97
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,063
Aunt Mito.

98
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:57,858
[Killua] I see.

99
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,448
[grunts] Hey, are you hungry?

100
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,075
I’ll go get us something to eat.

101
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,201
[Killua] Sure.

102
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,375
-Hey, Gon! 
-Huh?

103
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,502
The tape started moving all by itself!

104
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,712
Wait, what?!

105
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,881
Is that aura?

106
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,090
It’s Nen!

107
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,592
And it’s rewinding the tape!

108
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:24,885
Nen?

109
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,095
He’s close! He’s gotta be!

110
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,974
No. Over ten years ago 
he imbued it with aura,

111
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,852
so it would start rewinding 
the minute that it stopped!

112
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:34,895
But why?

113
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,021
I’ve no idea.

114
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,692
Look! Now it’s recording!

115
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,653
Wait, I think I get it. 
He’s erasing his voice!

116
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,696
What?!

117
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,073
[Gon grunts]

118
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,326
It won’t stop, dammit!

119
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,164
[Killua] It’s still going!

120
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,957
Even when I unplug it?

121
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,293
I’m breaking it.

122
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,336
Sorry!

123
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,465
Crap!

124
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,841
It’s no use.

125
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,343
The Nen’s protecting it!

-Huh?

[grunts]

129
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,445
It looks like it’s finished.

130
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,572
[sighs]

131
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,790
[Killua] Look! Now it’s recording!

132
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,834
Wait, I think I get it. 
He’s erasing his voice!

133
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,919
[Gon] What?!

134
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,129
[Gon trying to press button 
on recording]

135
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,050
The duplicate cassette tape 
was completely wiped, too.

136
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,387
I just don’t get why he would go through 
all this trouble.

137
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,224
He probably didn’t want 
to leave any clues or anything for us.

138
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,684
[Gon] What do you mean?

139
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,937
You can extract a whole lot of information 
from a simple audio clip.

140
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,896
[Gon] Really?

141
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,732
You can determine about 
how tall the speaker likely is,

142
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,401
their weight, their age,

143
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,778
diseases, facial features,

144
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,822
even a psych profile.

145
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,615
Oh...

146
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,784
From the noise in the background

147
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,286
you can even determine 
their exact location.

148
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,539
But that’s not what he was worried about.

149
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:18,832
There’s something else.

150
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,208
What are you talking about?

151
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,502
His Nen abilities.

152
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,586
[gasps]

153
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,464
There might be a Nen user somewhere

154
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,925
who can analyze data 
better than a machine.

155
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,427
I bet there is.

156
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,178
They can hear your voice

157
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,724
and it would tell them everything 
they’d ever need to know about you.

158
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,308
I see...

159
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,519
Your dad is tough.

160
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,812
Like, really tough.

161
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,439
[grunts]

162
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,150
This is useless.

163
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,027
Lucky it wasn’t the only clue.

164
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,903
We’ve still got two more left.

165
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,198
The ring and the memory card.

166
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,744
The ring probably won’t help, 
but the memory card might.

167
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,621
Yeah. But it’s smaller than a normal one.

168
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,666
You think we’re gonna need 
special hardware for it?

169
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,085
Wait-- You mean you can’t tell?

170
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,213
This is only designed to work with the JS.

171
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,798
What’s a JS?

172
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,427
A gaming console called the Joystation 
from three generations back.

173
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,345
Man, don’t you know anything?

174
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,931
If this island still has cassette players,

175
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,517
there’s gotta be an old console 
around here somewhere.

176
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,227
There a toy store here?

177
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,979
I’m pretty sure there is.

178
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,231
-Okay. Hold on. 
-Huh?

179
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,320
Oh! Where are you going?

180
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,571
To the toy store.

181
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,697
Huh?

182
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,492
-[Gon] It’s outside the port! 
-Huh?

183
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,659
[Killua] Got it!

184
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,871
Have a safe trip, okay?

185
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,720
[Gon] Oh... so this is a Joystation...

186
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,472
This takes me back.

187
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,349
I used to play it a lot.

188
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,018
There were a bunch of cult classics 
made for it.

189
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,103
Hmm...

190
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,814
Then is this memory card a cult classic?

191
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,441
‘Cause I don’t see a title on it anywhere.

192
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,486
You’ve never played 
any video games, have you?

193
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,113
That’s pretty weird.

194
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,489
Seriously?

195
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,282
That’s not a game disc.

196
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,660
It holds a game's memory data.

197
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,954
I guess that means 
we can’t use it to play.

198
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,455
[Killua] Nope.

199
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,541
You’re supposed to put the disc in here.

200
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,711
But if you insert the memory card 
and power it on without a game inside,

201
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,006
you can see all the different games

202
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,800
that are using that memory.

203
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,093
Oh, okay.

204
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,012
[Killua] Huh...

205
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,141
It looks like there’s only one game 
saved on it.

206
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,309
It’s called Greed Island.

207
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,019
[Gon] Greed Island?

208
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,690
Well, anyway, 
there are lots of saves on here.

209
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,026
It might be pointless 
but I’ll try to copy the data.

210
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,322
[Joystation voice] Copying Greed Island.

211
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,366
Okay.

212
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,285
[computer beeps]

213
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,495
What are you doing?

214
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,830
Searching online.

215
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,582
We know what it’s called...

216
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,542
I’m looking for a store that sells it.

217
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,669
0 MATCHES

218
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,463
What? No way! 
Not a single match?

219
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,382
That means it’s all sold out?

220
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,885
But I can’t find any used copies, either.

221
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,929
Even a totally sold-out game 
would be out there somewhere...

222
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,557
Well... I guess it’s possible

223
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,143
this game was never actually 
on the market.

224
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,519
What does that mean?

225
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,938
Maybe it was an indie game or something

226
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,857
and it never got distribution.

227
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,444
Or it could even be a game 
that was banned from sale for some reason.

228
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,322
I’ll keep looking and see what I can find.

229
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,450
Got it.

230
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,745
Well, it turns out it was actually 
sold through legitimate channels.

231
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,788
It says “Greed Island...

232
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,250
A hunting game exclusively... 
for Hunters.”

233
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,628
For Hunters, huh?

234
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,505
What the--! 
Look at that price tag!

235
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,633
Five hundred and eighty million?!

236
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,093
-It’s five point eight billion! 
-Say what?!

237
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,845
That’s crazy!

238
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,764
No game has ever cost that much money!

239
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,557
Only a hundred copies were made.

240
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,226
That’s not very many, is it?

241
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,186
No, it’s practically nothing!

242
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,605
Which means the developers 
were really cocky!

243
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,690
But it makes sense.

244
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,484
The price tag is ridiculous,

245
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,402
unless, of course, you’re a Hunter.

246
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,071
That explains how they sold out.

247
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,865
Do the developers have any more 
left in stock?

248
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,283
Good question.

249
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,244
I guess it’s worth a shot to ask them.

250
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,497
[representative] I’m sorry,

251
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,291
the game you’re inquiring about 
is no longer in stock.

252
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,337
And unfortunately, there are no plans 
to re-release it at this time.

253
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,005
Oh, okay. Thank you.

254
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,634
That was a dead end.

255
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,388
Then... we’ll have to find someone 
who has a copy

256
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,014
and see if they’ll let us have it.

257
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,224
You’re right.

258
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,643
So first we’re gonna need 
to locate a seller.

259
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,646
Why don’t we post an ad 
on a reverse auction website.

260
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,107
But... where will we get the money?

261
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,484
We’ll pool our money from the Arena

262
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,404
and that gets us 
to just over eight hundred million.

263
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,282
We still need another five billion.

264
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,534
-[Killua] Not necessarily. 
-Huh?

265
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,121
With these private deals, 
the seller has all the power.

266
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,791
And they usually set a higher price 
than what they originally paid for it.

267
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,168
[Gon] Then... it’ll cost even more?

268
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,378
Probably.

269
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,172
[both] Hmm...

270
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,176
[Gon] Well... we can still post a want ad, 
just in case.

271
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,430
Yeah. But I doubt anybody 
is gonna click on it.

272
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,724
“We are looking for a game.

273
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,810
Does anybody have 
Greed Island for sale?

274
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,771
Price... negotiable.”

275
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,359
[both gasp]

276
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,904
[both] Oh!

277
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,034
[gasps] Wow, look!

278
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,245
We already have more than 10,000 hits! 
I don’t believe it!

279
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,330
I thought so.

280
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,833
It looks like they’re all trying 
to unload counterfeit copies on us.

281
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,295
Considering the high price, 
we really should’ve seen this coming.

282
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,172
This isn’t gonna work.

283
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,050
No way we can verify 
every one of these offers.

284
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,385
Besides, what’s the point

285
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,929
if we can’t even tell 
if it’s the real game?

286
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,349
Then what do you think we should do now?

287
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,393
Well, we need to uncover 
a lot more information.

288
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,936
Let’s dig deeper online.

289
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,106
But I’m really no expert 
in all that stuff.

290
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,110
So, who do we know 
who’s into gaming and the internet?

291
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,487
[gasps]

292
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,947
I... think I might know somebody...

293
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:25,990
[Gon] Huh?

294
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,327
In fact, he might even own 
a copy of Greed Island already.

295
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,204
Really? You think so?

296
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,914
Guess I’ll ask him...

297
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,499
but I really don’t wanna.

298
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,958
Who is it? Who is it?

299
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,213
Hey. Gotoh? It’s Killua.

300
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,006
Mister Gotoh?

301
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,886
Yeah. Yeah, I’m doing great.

302
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,098
Now? Who cares where I am?

303
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,975
If I tell you, Mom’s gonna find out 
sooner or later.

304
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,978
Anyway... 
can you get Piggy for me?

305
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,397
Who’s Piggy?

306
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,399
[pig grunts]

307
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,318
[Milluki] What?! 
Killua wants to talk to me?

308
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,363
Screw that. 
Tell him I stepped out or something.

309
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,948
Shut up! You’re lying!

310
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,033
He hasn’t left the house in ages!

311
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,911
You go tell him if he doesn’t 
pick up the phone in ten seconds,

312
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,871
I’ll break all of his figurines!

313
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,164
[irked grunt]

314
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,251
All right, all right. 
Just put him on.

315
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,544
Hey, Kil.

316
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,130
If you even think 
about laying a finger on my collection,

317
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,673
I’m gonna kill you.

318
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,758
Chill out, bro. 
I was only kidding.

319
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,552
You’re so scary when you get mad!

320
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,971
Wait, your brother?

321
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,727
What the hell do you want, anyway?

322
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,312
Hurry up, I’m busy.

323
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,650
Oh yeah. Greed Island?

324
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,110
I’ve heard of it.

325
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,653
It’s a super-rare game.

326
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,656
Why? You’ve never been interested 
in rare games.

327
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,324
Do you own a copy?

328
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,742
[Milluki] No, I don't.

329
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,453
-[sighs] 
-[Milluki] I wanted one,

330
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,831
but I was five when it went on sale, 
and I didn’t have any money.

331
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,293
But I heard there were 
over twenty thousand requests

332
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,253
and only a hundred copies.

333
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,592
Because of that each copy 
costs a whole lot of Jenny;

334
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,302
about five point eight bil.

335
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,097
I tried to track one down 
right after the thrill wore off,

336
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,224
but I couldn’t even find an owner.

337
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,311
It’s legendary for all kinds of reasons.

338
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,104
So, what’s the deal?

339
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,190
You looking for a copy or what?

340
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,066
-Kinda. 
-[Milluki] Well, forget it!

341
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,443
It’s impossible.

342
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,069
Even I had to give up.

343
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,449
Oh? You had to admit defeat 
‘cause it was too much for you to handle?

344
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,950
[annoyed growl]

345
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,744
That was years ago.

346
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,330
I’ve got a few leads now, smart guy.

347
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,415
But considering how much effort 
it would take,

348
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,376
not to mention money, 
it’s not worth my time.

349
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,755
So...

350
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,299
What were those leads 
you were talking about?

351
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,927
[Milluki] Yeah, right. 
Like I’d tell you for free.

352
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,972
If I had a Greed Island memory card, 
would you... reconsider?

353
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,182
[Milluki] Huh?

354
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,059
What are you saying?

355
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,437
[Killua] I just happened to get my hands 
on a memory card, that’s all.

356
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,272
I figured with your skills,

357
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,607
you could analyze the data

358
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,193
and reverse engineer 
the game itself, right?

359
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,819
[Milluki] Is that true?

360
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,655
You better not be lying.

361
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,073
[Killua] I never lie.

362
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,866
Not when I’m making deals.

363
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,162
[Milluki] Okay, fine.

364
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,580
I have two leads.

365
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,831
Wait a minute.

366
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,291
Not over the phone!

367
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,876
Don’t worry, Kil.

368
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,461
If somebody is eavesdropping,

369
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,880
this information won’t do them any good.

370
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,632
Okay. First lead...

371
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,094
Yeah. Yeah. I see.

372
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,054
Okay, got it.

373
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,390
I’ll send it to you in the usual way.

374
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,814
Sorry... but I kinda had to promise him 
the copy of the memory card in exchange.

375
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,567
Sure. 
It’s just a copy anyway, so I don’t mind.

376
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,903
Well in return, 
I got two leads that sound pretty solid.

377
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,363
One’s a website.

378
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,282
It’s only accessible to Hunters,

379
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,033
which is no problem for you.

380
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,620
I’m almost positive we can find 
more leads on Greed Island there.

381
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,580
[Gon] Really?

382
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,332
That means 
I get to use my Hunter’s License!

383
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,792
Stupid!

384
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,795
If you use your home computer, 
they’re gonna know your address!

385
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,132
You really want bad guys 
showing up on this island

386
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,717
to steal your Hunter’s license?

387
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,176
Oh. Yeah, I forgot.

388
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,680
You’ve gotta use public computers 
for this kind of thing,

389
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,765
like at a hotel or a ‘net café.

390
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,602
Well... there’s no rush.

391
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,478
I still don’t even know the address.

392
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,606
Once my brother gets the memory card,

393
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,065
he said he’d send it to me.

394
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,276
Or lead two:

395
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,069
The Yorknew City auction.

396
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,156
What?! Hold on, isn’t Yorknew City--?

397
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,699
Yeah.

398
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,410
We’re supposed 
to meet Kurapika and Leorio there.

399
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,661
Also,

400
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,623
they’re holding the world’s greatest 
auction there in September.

401
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,126
My brother said it’s probably a hoax,

402
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,045
but there’s a rumor going around

403
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,214
that someone’s gonna be auctioning off 
dozens of copies.

404
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,843
Then maybe... that someone is Ging!

405
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,220
Yeah. So maybe it’s not a rumor.

406
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,972
It just might be credible!

407
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,851
[Gon] But we’re gonna need 
a crazy amount of money to buy a copy.

408
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,020
Yeah, you’re right about that.

409
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,731
[Gon] I guess...

410
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,068
it really was our destiny 
to go to Yorknew City.

411
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,509
[Milluki] Hmm...

412
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:41,180
Battera, the tycoon, 
is offering 17 billion for Greed Island

413
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:45,935
and 50 billion more for a memory card 
with a complete saved game on it.

414
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,437
That's truly legendary.

415
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,440
[chuckles] Interesting...

416
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,529
I’ll put an end to this legend myself.

417
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,532
[Gon] Wow!

418
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,701
This is incredible!

419
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,285
What’s the big occasion?

420
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,455
You probably won’t be back to visit 
for a little while.

421
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,581
[gasps]

422
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,167
Aunt Mito...

423
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,671
Who knows 
when you’ll get a chance to eat again?

424
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,798
Better fill up while you can.

425
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,675
[chuckles softly]

426
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,343
Mm-hmm.

427
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,761
[chuckles]

428
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,018
[Gon] All right!

429
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,812
[Gon and Killua] Thank you for the food!

430
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,072
[indistinct chatter]

431
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,086
[Gon] Aunt Mito!

432
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,713
So long!

433
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,215
I’m gonna go find Ging, I promise!

434
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,342
And after I meet him,

435
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,887
I’m gonna come back to the island, okay?

436
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,810
Bye! Take care! I’ll miss you!

437
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,832
[narrator] Ging told Gon to find him,

438
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,377
leaving a riddle behind 
as a clue to his whereabouts.

439
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,463
In order to solve that riddle

440
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,756
and meet his father,

441
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,135
Gon leaves home once again 
with his friend, Killua, by his side,

442
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,138
and sets sail for Yorknew City.

443
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,017
[theme song playing]

444
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,751
[Gon] Coming up:

445
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,253
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

446
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,754
[both] Hunterpedia!

447
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,631
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

448
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,133
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

449
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,843
Today, we're introducing Ging!

450
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,178
He’s my dad, 
and I became a Hunter to find him!

451
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,890
Oh, yeah, so what do you think 
your dad wants, anyway?

452
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,018
I really don't know, but as soon as 
I find him, I’ll be sure to ask!

453
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,523
[Gon] Next time:

454
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,983
"Wish x And x Promise"!

455
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,818
Go to sleep or you’ll be late.

456
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,529
[Killua] Who, me? Nah. I don’t need sleep.

457
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,573
[Gon] Try to get plenty of rest, everyone!
