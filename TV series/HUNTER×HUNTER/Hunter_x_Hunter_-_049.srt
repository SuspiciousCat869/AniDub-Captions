1
00:00:01,115 --> 00:00:03,128
[Leorio] Yeah. It looks real.

2
00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:05,340
And there’s a video attached to it.

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:06,757
We’ve got two targets.

4
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,675
A man and a woman.

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,610
I’ll head out right now,

6
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:12,221
so you just meet me there.

7
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,263
[Gon] Got it.

8
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,849
-Come on. Let’s go! 
-Okay.

9
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:25,458
[theme song playing]

10
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:41,268
PURSUIT X AND X ANALYSIS

11
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,316
[narrator] Following a tip 
about the Phantom Troupe,

12
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,710
Gon and his friends move out.

13
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:52,828
Once there, they encounter 
Machi and Nobunaga.

14
00:01:53,153 --> 00:01:56,159
But the pair is not simply waiting around 
to be caught.

15
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,839
What do you think? 
Did Uvo really get himself killed?

16
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:03,039
Probably, yeah.

17
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:07,821
Uvo may have been a brute, 
but he wasn’t stupid.

18
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:10,865
I certainly can’t disagree with you there.

19
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,759
[Nobunaga] It didn’t matter 
how tough his opponent was,

20
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:16,673
he always had the wits and experience 
to prevail.

21
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:18,198
[phone ringing]

22
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:20,516
[woman] Yeah, hello?

23
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:22,851
[Leorio] I’m the guy who posted the ad.

24
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,255
[woman] Well, you’re late! Where are you?

25
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,980
Please stop looking around.

26
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:28,867
We can see you, so don’t worry.

27
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:32,027
Is that them? 
The couple right behind your boyfriend?

28
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,280
I’m wiring the money to your account. 
Confirm receipt.

29
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,826
Really?

30
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,514
[woman] Let’s go! Come on!

31
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,084
[Machi] But Uvo didn’t come back 
this time.

32
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,837
Has he ever been this late 
without letting us know before?

33
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:53,715
You heard what he said, didn’t you?

34
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,810
He wasn’t coming back

35
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,963
‘til he settled the score 
with the chain user.

36
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:01,306
Yeah, I heard. That’s why I said probably.

37
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:03,767
I didn’t say that I was sure he was dead.

38
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,695
[Nobunaga] That your hunch?

39
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,354
[Machi] Just a hunch.

40
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:11,692
[Nobunaga] Well… your hunches are right, 
more often than not.

41
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:14,186
[Leorio] Okay. 
We should decide our next move.

42
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,280
So how should we go about 
capturing these two?

43
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,034
[Killua] We don’t.

44
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:22,828
Look, they’re way out of our league. 
It’s not happening.

45
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,874
[yells] Oh, come on! 
We won’t know until we try,

46
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:28,385
and besides, 
why didn’t you mention this before?!

47
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,637
Stop yelling. They’ll notice us.

48
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,766
But it’s the truth.

49
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,631
I knew it as soon as I saw them.

50
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,604
A while back my dad killed a Spider 
for a job.

51
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,847
-[Gon] Huh? 
-What?

52
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,932
He doesn’t complain much…

53
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:47,310
but he said the job 
wasn’t worth the price.

54
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,732
And that is the highest compliment 
he gives a target.

55
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,712
He even got all of us together

56
00:03:55,312 --> 00:03:57,731
and told us we should steer clear 
of the Phantom Troupe.

57
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,116
But that was years ago,

58
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,470
so I thought we might stand a chance.

59
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:06,146
[Leorio] They can’t be that strong…

60
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,540
can they?

61
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:10,386
Just imagine if the people 
sitting at that table

62
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:11,877
were both Hisokas.

63
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:15,048
I guess...

64
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,383
it’s safe to say that 
that’s a lot more than we can handle.

65
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:21,553
Okay. So, what do you think 
they’re doing here?

66
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,756
They’re dating.

67
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:24,191
It’s a date. Right?

68
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,592
Wait… Is it really?

69
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:26,877
[Killua] No, of course not.

70
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:29,170
They noticed that other couple 
behind them.

71
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,398
I can tell they’re paying close attention 
to their surroundings.

72
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,278
I thought they were just being cautious

73
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:37,996
since the Mafia’s after them.

74
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:40,697
But if that was the case,

75
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,259
they wouldn’t be sitting in a public area 
like that.

76
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,647
Instead, they act like 
they don’t have a care in the world.

77
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,166
They’re waiting 
for someone to find them,

78
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:52,685
acting as bait

79
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:54,704
and trying to draw out their prey.

80
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,923
We’re being observed.

81
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,133
And they’re not amateurs.

82
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:03,571
[Nobunaga] Yeah. 
I can’t tell where they are,

83
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,263
they’re watching us.

84
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,765
[Machi] Is it the chain user?

85
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,351
[Nobunaga] No idea.

86
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,726
But if it is,

87
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,646
the Boss gave us free reign 
to do whatever we want.

88
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,891
I don’t know about you,

89
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,861
but I got the distinct impression 
he wants us to recruit him.

90
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:19,236
Machi...

91
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,559
The Boss said to find him 
and bring him back.

92
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,407
Those were our only orders.

93
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:29,496
Come on, you haven’t forgotten all 
about the unspoken rule, have you?

94
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:33,068
“Alive or dead 
and by any means necessary”?

95
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,371
You’re welcome 
to interpret the Boss’s orders

96
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:37,921
any way you see fit,

97
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,007
but you can’t force me 
into agreeing with you.

98
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:43,520
Don’t put words in my mouth, all right?

99
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:46,092
Besides, you’re the one forcing the issue.

100
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,197
The atmosphere has changed.

101
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,249
I’m getting a bad feeling…

102
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:57,941
Do you think they noticed us?

103
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,052
Not yet.

104
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:00,610
We’re still in the clear.

105
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,863
You sure about that?

106
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:04,865
Remember, I can’t use Zetsu 
to mask my presence

107
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,199
like the two of you.

108
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,580
Zetsu would attract attention,

109
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:10,245
so we can’t use it here.

110
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,665
They can sense Nen, 
but they aren’t trying.

111
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:16,052
They’re looking at people in the area

112
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,079
trying to find anyone who acts suspicious.

113
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:20,772
Be careful.

114
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,841
And wipe those looks off your faces.

115
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,426
Just act natural.

116
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:26,303
[fake chuckling]

117
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,638
[Killua] You know what? Forget it.

118
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,677
[Nobunaga] Let’s decide, 
right here and now.

119
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:34,663
Are we going to take him dead,

120
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:37,040
or try to bring him in alive?

121
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:40,310
Oh, all right.

122
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:46,398
Heads.

123
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:47,391
Tails, then.

124
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,454
HIRUMA MANSION

125
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,997
[Chrollo] Her?

126
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,959
[Shalnark] Yeah. 
She’s Nostrade’s daughter.

127
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,417
Her name’s Neon.

128
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,447
According to the information 
on the Hunter Website,

129
00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:03,424
the chain user we’re looking 
for is one of her bodyguards.

130
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,136
As for the rest of her bodyguards,

131
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:09,055
we have pictures and names 
for these five here.

132
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,608
[Chrollo] This girl…

133
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,494
she’s responsible for Nostrade’s success?

134
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:15,728
[Shalnark] Most likely.

135
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,907
The info’s on the Hunter website, 
so it should be accurate.

136
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,235
[Nostrade] I see.

137
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:26,863
So that’s what happened.

138
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,199
Getting a new room was a smart move.

139
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,035
The Phantom Troupe 
is using the Hunter website;

140
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,055
there’s absolutely no doubt about it.

141
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,775
Neon wouldn’t be safe right now 
without your quick thinking.

142
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,359
Thank you.

143
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:42,013
Now, first things first,

144
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:44,833
we need to transport 
my daughter home urgently.

145
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,477
Is that all right with you, Neon?

146
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,504
It sounds like I don’t have a choice.

147
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:52,597
With the auction canceled,

148
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,717
I don’t see any point in being here.

149
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,267
And that makes me sad,

150
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,478
because I really wanted to go to that…

151
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:01,982
They’ll hold another auction 
next year, pumpkin.

152
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,566
So, don’t be sad.

153
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:07,038
And I promise I’ll recover the items 
you wanted from those bandits,

154
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:08,822
if it’s the last thing I do!

155
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:09,940
[Neon] Really?

156
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,202
Of course, my dear, I promise.

157
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,537
And have I ever in your life 
broken a promise to you?

158
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,248
[Neon] Well, yeah… 
More than you’ve kept!

159
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,675
[Nostrade laughs]

160
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,463
[Nostrade] All right, you got me. 
[chuckles]

161
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:24,879
Your names are Melody and Basho, yes?

162
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,374
-Yes. 
-Yes.

163
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,384
You two take Neon 
back to the mansion immediately.

164
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,969
Be safe.

165
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,513
I want you both wearing simple disguises.

166
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,307
Now, Neon.

167
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,309
Go back to your room 
and pack up your things.

168
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,871
[Neon] Okay.

169
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:44,991
[Nostrade] All right. 
Let’s get down to business.

170
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:50,030
The Underground Auction 
will be resuming tonight.

171
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:51,281
[all five] huh?

172
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,401
[Nostrade] The time and place 
haven’t changed.

173
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:55,368
The community must demonstrate

174
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,789
that they will not 
be intimidated by anyone.

175
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:02,453
The Ten Dons have vowed to recover 
all of the stolen merchandise.

176
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:04,153
[Kurapika] But… sir…

177
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:06,356
As I mentioned earlier,

178
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,944
the man we captured gave up information.

179
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,967
He claimed that a Shadow Beast 
took everything

180
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,137
before they even arrived.

181
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,680
Yes, that much is true.

182
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:20,226
However, all of the Shadow Beasts 
are dead.

183
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:21,395
[both gasp]

184
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:23,648
[Nostrade] Nine bodies 
have been recovered.

185
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,149
The final member, the Owl,

186
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:30,046
was the one 
in charge of transporting the merchandise.

187
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,540
He was probably captured by the Troupe.

188
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,618
The Ten Dons understand 
how frightening Nen can be.

189
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,414
If a Troupe member 
can compel a confession,

190
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,873
they won’t need to resort to torture.

191
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,644
We think the merchandise the Owl took

192
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,854
has fallen into the Troupe’s hands.

193
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:50,550
So, as I was just saying,

194
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,785
with all the Shadow Beasts destroyed,

195
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,804
the Ten Dons will hire pros 
to handle the Troupe.

196
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,013
Sir?

197
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,977
[Nostrade] The Mafia uses murder 
as a tool of intimidation

198
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,665
but it’s not our area of expertise.

199
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,283
Considering the nature of our opponents,

200
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,021
it would be wise for us 
to leave it to the experts.

201
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,615
We’ll have them crush the Troupe 
on our behalf,

202
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,102
while avoiding further losses ourselves.

203
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:23,289
However, it’s a chance for us 
to build our reputation.

204
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:26,678
We can’t allow the assassins 
to take all the credit.

205
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,212
And so, Kurapika,

206
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:32,417
I want you to join the assassin team.

207
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,101
[Chrollo] Take care of the chain user 
for me.

208
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,237
[Shalnark] Will do.

209
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,317
[Killua] They’re on the move.

210
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,401
Now what?

211
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,431
Like I said, 
we can't beat them in a fight.

212
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,323
We’ll figure out a way.

213
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,367
Failure’s not really an option.

214
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:00,535
He’s right.

215
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,738
We can’t leave empty-handed, not now.

216
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:04,914
Okay, fine.

217
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,885
But listen. Gon and I will track them.

218
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,855
But no matter what, 
we can’t let them spot us.

219
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,940
Which means we’ll have to use Zetsu.

220
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,424
Got it?

221
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:18,346
Wow...

222
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:21,472
I can see them standing here 
but I can’t sense them.

223
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,642
Hey, Gon. Promise me two things.

224
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,645
If they see us, we give up immediately

225
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,074
and retreat, no questions asked.

226
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,112
Same if I say further pursuit 
is impossible for any other reason.

227
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:35,153
Okay?

228
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,487
[Gon] Okay.

229
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,252
[Killua] The signal to abort 
will be one ring.

230
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:41,677
Make sure your phone is on vibrate.

231
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,013
If they split up, we follow the woman.

232
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:45,555
Leorio,

233
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,226
call Zepile and keep an eye 
on the auction for us.

234
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:49,517
No problem.

235
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,170
I’m guessing you’ve never 
tracked anyone before?

236
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,649
Oh, uh… Yeah, kinda.

237
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:57,050
I tracked Hisoka during the Exam.

238
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,962
Really? And he didn’t notice you?

239
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:01,471
No. 
I shadowed him pretty much the whole day.

240
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,183
All right! Not too shabby!

241
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:08,228
That hurt! What did you hit me for?

242
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,797
[Killua] Huh? Oh, no reason.

243
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,842
Well, you shouldn’t have a problem, then.

244
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:15,136
Just be sure to stay 
out of their field of vision,

245
00:12:15,261 --> 00:12:16,361
no matter what.

246
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:18,029
Ok, ready to go?

247
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,507
[Gon and Leorio] Yeah!

248
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,012
[Killua] The targets have passed the plaza 
and gone down a side street.

249
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,688
[Gon] Roger that.

250
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:27,799
Do you think they know we’re here?

251
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,082
[Killua] It’s fine.

252
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,168
We’re using Zetsu, 
so they won’t unless something goes wrong.

253
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,814
But they’re expecting someone 
to follow them,

254
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:36,023
so be careful.

255
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:38,342
Okay. You too, Killua.

256
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:42,021
Ugh... He’s really telling me 
to be careful?

257
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:43,940
I’m the one on high alert,

258
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,666
looking for changes in their behavior!

259
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:51,571
Good.

260
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:52,974
They haven’t noticed us.

261
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,108
When they realize we’re here,

262
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,901
they’re bound to react somehow.

263
00:12:57,624 --> 00:12:59,112
They can try to hide it,

264
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,016
but their faces or gestures 
will give them away.

265
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,828
I’ve been playing life-or-death games 
of ‘shadow’

266
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,406
ever since I was three.

267
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,225
I won’t lose sight of them.

268
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:12,702
I can’t!

269
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:16,222
Are we being followed?

270
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,089
Yes, most likely.

271
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,799
It’s a pretty good bet, anyway.

272
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:22,386
Guess they know what they’re doing.

273
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:24,138
I don’t sense a damn thing.

274
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:27,033
They must be quite skilled.

275
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,743
[Killua] Damn, they’re moving 
toward a deserted part of the city.

276
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:49,497
Maybe they figured out 
they’re being followed.

277
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:52,024
So, could this be a trap?

278
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,509
No…

279
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:56,329
They don’t know our exact locations.

280
00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:58,796
Unless they don’t know 
they’re being followed

281
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,800
and they’re heading back to their hideout.

282
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:03,861
That’d be a huge win for us.

283
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,803
So, a trap...

284
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,221
or their hideout?

285
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:08,598
Which is it?

286
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,711
If it’s a trap, we bail.

287
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:13,779
Hideout, we keep following them.

288
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:20,184
There’s nothing unnatural 
in their behavior.

289
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:21,819
We keep going!

290
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,262
Our stalker isn’t taking the bait.

291
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,340
Which means that it’s probably 
not the chain user.

292
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:34,609
[Machi] Why’s that?

293
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:37,595
[Nobunaga] I can sense 
multiple people tailing us

294
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:39,462
but the chain user…

295
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,165
probably works alone.

296
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,423
[Machi] Think so?

297
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:46,095
Yeah, he works as a bodyguard 
for the Nostrade family, right?

298
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:49,265
Yet he managed to defeat Uvo 
completely on his own,

299
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:50,973
and that’s no easy task.

300
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:53,434
But the Mafia hasn’t taken any action,

301
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,154
which supports my theory.

302
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:57,398
If they were responsible,

303
00:14:57,598 --> 00:14:59,809
they’d be using Uvo to threaten us

304
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,877
whether he was dead or alive.

305
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:06,277
Not to mention the news 
would probably be all over the web by now.

306
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,145
Since it’s not the chain user 
probably defeated Uvo alone,

307
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:13,547
without ever reporting it to the Mafia.

308
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,992
Doesn’t make sense.

309
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,095
Why would someone with ties to the Mafia 
work alone?

310
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,415
Probably a personal grudge.

311
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,134
“Probably”, huh? 
You’ve been saying that a lot.

312
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,403
Oh, shut up.

313
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:31,013
If he went out seeking revenge 
without Mafia backup,

314
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,683
I doubt that he’d be 
teaming up with someone else.

315
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:36,746
Thus, the chain user works alone.

316
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:39,407
The group following us 
is totally unrelated.

317
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:42,560
Impressive how full of holes 
your logic is.

318
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:45,021
Okay, fine then Let’s hear what you think.

319
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:46,498
All right.

320
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:48,228
If you really must know…

321
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,328
I suspect that there’s a link 
between these guys and the chain user.

322
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:55,046
Hunch again?

323
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:56,581
It is.

324
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,275
You’ve gotta be kidding.

325
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:00,394
People who rely on their gut feelings

326
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:02,964
really shouldn’t criticize 
someone else’s logic.

327
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,473
So, what do you think?

328
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,669
[Killua] They’re waiting for someone, 
or trying to draw us out.

329
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:08,934
One or the other.

330
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,179
Yeah, but do you think 
they know we’re following them?

331
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,549
[Killua] Right now, it’s fifty-fifty.

332
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,785
But they definitely don’t know 
our location.

333
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,977
That’s why they’re trying to lure us out.

334
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,480
They want us to show ourselves.

335
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:21,982
[Gon] What do we do?

336
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,119
[Killua] They might be waiting 
for someone else.

337
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:26,219
-Hold your position. 
-[phone ringing]

338
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:28,988
Gon, I’m hanging up.

339
00:16:29,232 --> 00:16:30,948
-[phone ringing] 
-Pay close attention

340
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:32,544
and if they react at all,

341
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:34,994
we’re gonna make a run for it. 
And don’t stop!

342
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,955
The next time I ring it means we bail.

343
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:38,998
Got it?

344
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,451
Yeah, I got it.

345
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:42,668
[Phinks] It’s Phinks.

346
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,996
Oh, what’s up, Phinks?

347
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:46,132
[Phinks] Just wanted to see 
how you’re doing.

348
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,716
We were being followed for a while

349
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,609
but they haven’t made their move.

350
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,261
And we can’t locate them,

351
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,931
so this’ll take some time.

352
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:55,641
[Phinks] Oh, yeah?

353
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,141
Then how about a hint?

354
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,268
Wait, what are you talking about?

355
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,955
[gasping in shock]

356
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:37,857
[grunts]

357
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,519
A diversion?

358
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,062
Got him!!

359
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,416
He blocked it easily,

360
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,851
with his left hand!

361
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,729
[straining]

362
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:53,473
[Killua roars]

363
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:54,833
[whistles]

364
00:17:58,027 --> 00:17:59,028
[Nobunaga] Hey.

365
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:00,030
[Killua gasps]

366
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,374
Hello, Phinks.

367
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:03,708
What are you doing here?

368
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:07,295
I swear I was told 
that you were heading out with the Boss.

369
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:09,271
This is the fourth floor!

370
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:10,673
Well, like they say,

371
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,960
“deceive your allies 
to deceive your enemies”.

372
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:14,268
[shrill chuckle]

373
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:16,806
Looks like the Boss got me good again.

374
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:19,442
Zetsu masters all over the place?

375
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:20,801
Guess I should’ve known…

376
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:24,747
They tailed us while we tailed them? 
And our targets didn’t know?!

377
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,022
They tricked us!

378
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,032
[Nobunaga] So, kiddo…

379
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:30,511
I’ve got a couple of questions for you.

380
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:38,784
Do you know the chain user 
and think before you answer.

381
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,199
He’s a Nen user who fights with chains.

382
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,184
We’re trying to find him.

383
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:47,995
Is he the one who asked you to follow us?

384
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,670
Was this his idea?

385
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,090
[Gon] I don’t know him.

386
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:54,944
We followed you two for our own reasons 
and not anybody else’s.

387
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:57,419
I just need a split second,

388
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,138
an opening, to get away!

389
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:01,308
Your thoughts?

390
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,726
I just can’t tell...

391
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:06,580
If he’s lying, he’s certainly good at it.

392
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,773
Why don’t I check.

393
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,051
[Nobunaga] Question one:

394
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,095
Why were you following us?

395
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:14,305
Be concise.

396
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:18,859
A bad lie will make things worse.

397
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:23,239
Because the Mafia has put out 
a huge bounty on your heads.

398
00:19:24,014 --> 00:19:25,831
Websites are offering a lot of money

399
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,160
just for information on your whereabouts.

400
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,211
[Nobunaga] Question two:

401
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,213
Who taught you to track people?

402
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:33,674
I guess mainly...

403
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:38,171
I used a Nen ability 
to hide myself called Zetsu.

404
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:40,888
See, I... want to be a pro Hunter.

405
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,617
Who taught you to do that?

406
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,803
It was a Shingen-ryu master.

407
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:47,012
And three:

408
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,272
Do you know a Nen user 
who fights with chains?

409
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:52,101
Fights with chains?

410
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,820
[Nobunaga] 
He’d be a Conjurer or Manipulator.

411
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:59,510
We want to know if your master 
has chains hanging from his right arm.

412
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,985
Or is it you?

413
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,661
You should come clean right now if it is.

414
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:05,087
I really don’t know.

415
00:20:05,262 --> 00:20:07,075
My master is an Enhancer and...

416
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,085
he just taught me 
the four basic exercises, nothing more.

417
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,088
Well, that’s a pity.

418
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:15,166
If you don’t know, we got nothin.

419
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,173
It’s time for the last question.

420
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:19,136
I’ll give you two choices

421
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,262
but think carefully before you answer.

422
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,359
Do you want to die now or later?

423
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:26,802
It’s up to you.

424
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,311
You have three seconds.

425
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:32,374
[terrified breath]

426
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:34,033
[phone buzzing]

427
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,323
It’s no use. Don’t try anything.

428
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:40,690
Yes.

429
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:42,950
Understood. On our way.

430
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:44,762
Little boy.

431
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:47,239
That friend of yours 
surrendered quietly.

432
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,460
[Pakunoda] I’ll ask again.

433
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,586
Do you know the chain user?

434
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,688
I already told you that before.

435
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:56,839
I don’t!

436
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:57,975
I see.

437
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,910
What about you, boy?

438
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,635
Do you have any guesses?

439
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,396
[tires screeching]

440
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:26,170
Welcome to our hideout.

441
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:27,112
[both gasp]

442
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,353
[narrator] Gon and Killua find themselves

443
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:38,315
standing inside the hideout 
of the dreaded Phantom Troupe,

444
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,519
gripped by the anticipation 
of what’s to come.

445

00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,751
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

448
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:57,209
[both] Hunterpedia!

449
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:59,012
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

450
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:00,662
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

451
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,097
Today, we're introducing Machi!

452
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:04,293
She’s Phantom Troupe 
and she’s a Transmuter!

453
00:23:04,443 --> 00:23:06,537
She can turn her aura into Nen threads.

454
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:08,326
Her big technique is Nen stitches.

455
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:09,874
She can put your body back together!

456
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,158
[both] Just like this!

457
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:16,904
[Gon] Next time: “Ally x and x Sword”.

458

-Gotcha! 
-[Killua buzzing like mosquito]

459

[Gon] Hey! Look! I caught it!

00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,988
[Killua] That’s one of Milluki’s 
mini-bombs!

461
00:23:23,178 --> 00:23:24,288
[Gon and Killua] Ka-boom!
