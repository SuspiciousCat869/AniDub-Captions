here the same way we did,

this was greed island.

But now that the boss
can’t use nen anymore,

he can’t enter
through the usual channels,

so he must have hired someone
to come to the island for him,

Tsezgerra: Actually we have 95.

317
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,413
Genthru: I’m sure
you have some of the items

318
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,848
and you’re waiting for someone
else to use gain on them.

319
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,385
In fact, it’s entirely possible

320
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:15,856
that angel’s breath is the last
card that you need to obtain,

321
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:18,058
and I can’t think
of a single reason

322
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:21,294
we would give that to you and
lose the game in the process.

323
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,464
( Tsezgerra chuckles )
Stop playing dumb.

324
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:27,534
I happen to know
that you and your people

325
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:30,037
are currently monopolizing
both angel’s breath

326
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,774
and night Jade, which means
the game is not over yet.

327
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:34,875
Genthru: Oh?

328
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,477
I wish you boys
the best of luck,

329
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:40,114
but we’re never going
to let you have these cards.

330
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,082

331

332
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,518
spirited away hollow,

333
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,387
and then to top it all off,

334
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:48,989
there’s miniature dragon.

335
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:52,158
And you only have
to give us night Jade,

336
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,994
not angel’s breath.

337
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:58,164
We’d be giving you one ss-rank
and two s-rank,

338
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,233
while you’d only
give up an a-rank.

339
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,402
That’s too good to pass up.

340

a little time to discuss it.

341
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,110
Tsezgerra: To be clear,
this is our final offer.

342
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,112
We won’t negotiate any further.

343
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,314

344

It’s too good to be true.

345
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,519
Genthru: Tsezguerra
is awfully cautious.

346
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:22,322
I doubt he’s looking
to pick a fight with us.

347
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:26,493
But that said, he’s not the type
to make a losing deal, either.

348
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,129
Which must mean he thinks

349
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,930
he can obtain
an angel’s breath on his own.

350
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,165
Bara: What do you think?

351
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,002
I mean, there are
40 types of spell cards.

352
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,436
Does he have all of them?

353
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,339
Genthru: Maybe. If so,
they’re just waiting for us

354
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,941
to use gain on one
of our angel’s breaths.

355
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,075
Sub: Could be,

356
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,944
but it took
a whole lot of hard work

357
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,946
to monopolize night Jade.

358
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,347
If one of the cards
got destroyed,

359
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:51,552
one of our Jade jewels
would turn back into a card.

360
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:53,287
Those guys might be able

361
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,023
to get their hands on an ss-rank
angel’s breath,

362
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,960
but the a-rank night Jade is
a lot harder for them to get.

363
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,364
Genthru: This is a real gamble.
