1
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:11,011
We have to assume that this is the work 
of a Conjurer.

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,263
[Killua] You're right. No doubt about it.

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,599
These buildings weren't here yesterday.

4
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,978
This has to be Nen.

5
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,690
Oh, man, these guys are out 
of their minds.

6
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,194
They have someone who can conjure up 
entire buildings!

7
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,947
We should be prepared 
for any traps they've set.

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:34,034
[Killua] Yeah. It also pretty much proves 
they're still around here somewhere.

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,413
The problem is these buildings create 
way too many blind spots.

10
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,542
I can only see 20 percent 
of the area at one time.

11
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,336
[Kurapika] 
But if you move around too much,

12
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,421
there's a chance you might 
run into one of them.

13
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,757
I'd really like to avoid that.

14
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,720
The thing is, I have no idea what I'd do 
if I heard their voices behind me.

15
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,681
My heart is already pounding.

16
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,059
-Voices, huh? 
-[Killua] What?

17
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,103
Nothing. Never mind.

18
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,897
Just go back to your post 
for the time being.

19
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,941
I'll call you back in five minutes.

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,821
Melody. How are things going on your end?

21
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,948
-We're still shopping. 
-[Neon] I wanna see that one!

22
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,075
This is harder than normal bodyguard work.

23
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,120
-[Neon] I guess it's not too bad. 
-I think Basho's about to snap.

24
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,289
[Neon] Let's go back to the other store!

25
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,124
Okay, I understand.

26
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,792
[crashing]

27
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,129
[theme music playing]

28
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:47,834
Beloved x And x Beleaguered

29
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,964
[Chrollo] Just to be perfectly clear, 
you've already told me

30
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,384
everything Uvo knew about the chain user?

31
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,053
[Shalnark] Yeah. 
When we were investigating

32
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,681
the Nostrade family 
using the Hunter website,

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:05,394
Uvo pointed out the three at the top 
as the members he thought he recognized.

34
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,480
It was late on the night of the first, 
when we realized

35
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,649
that they were the daughter's bodyguards.

36
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,194
And the girl... it was just yesterday 
when I met her.

37
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,446
That's when you stole her ability, 
wasn't it?

38
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,241
-The first time you made contact? 
-[Chrollo] Yes.

39
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,161
And here is an updated list 
of all the bodyguards in question.

40
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,539
There are two new members.

41
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,873
Oh, wow.

42
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,835
They already updated it? 
That was so fast.

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,880
So I count seven bodyguards. 
There might even be more than that.

44
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,259
That's an awful lot of people 
to guard one little girl.

45
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,760
[Phinks] He loves his daughter.

46
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:43,265
[Chrollo] More like he holds her ability 
in higher regard than the girl herself.

47
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,353
Her father got to where he is today 
by capitalizing on her power.

48
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:52,023
And of course, there are many 
who resent his advancement.

49
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,694
But why did she come to Yorknew City 
in the first place?

50
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,196
My guess, she's here for the auction.

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,574
[thunder crashing]

52
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,452
Are you okay?

53
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,537
[Chrollo] Shizuku, Pakunoda.

54
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,747
[Pakunoda] We're listening.

55
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,498
Nice.

56
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,712
How could I have been so blind? 
Damn it, what's wrong with me?

57
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:19,092
Nostrade's daughter comes to Yorknew City. 
Why? If only I had thought about it...

58
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,971
perhaps we could have found 
the chain user sooner.

59
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,601
It's safe to assume that this girl 
came to Yorknew for the auction,

60
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,561
along with her bodyguards.

61
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,649
I was too focused on her fortune-telling 
ability to give it much thought.

62
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:39,196
According to the website, 
she's known to collect certain body parts.

63
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,364
It would seem that's her hobby.

64
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,242
Body parts? The Scarlet Eyes!

65
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,577
That's right.

66
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,956
Which means that the chain user joined 
the Nostrade family for a reason.

67
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,585
He knew that the Scarlet Eyes 
would be sold at the auction

68
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,380
and that Nostrade's daughter 
would be interested in buying them.

69
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,926
The chain user wants two things.

70
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,387
To exact revenge on us 
and retrieve the eyes.

71
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,683
Okay, Shal, what about the Scarlet Eyes? 
Were we able to retrieve them?

72
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,019
Sorry, but I'm not sure.

73
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:15,023
I had the auctioneer running on autopilot 
for pretty much the whole auction.

74
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:19,110
[Chrollo] Kortopi, do you remember 
copying the Scarlet Eyes?

75
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,695
Yes, I did.

76
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,406
[Chrollo] Your copies function as your En.

77
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,034
So can you tell where the copy is?

78
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,370
Yes, if I'm touching the original.

79
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,917
I found them.

80
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,468
[Kortopi] Got it.

81
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,429
There's something of the same shape 
in that direction,

82
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,807
approximately 2,500 meters.

83
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,102
[Nobunaga] Is the chain user there?

84
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,104
[Kortopi] We should hurry.

85
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,023
The effects of the En will fade 
in a few hours.

86
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,733
Do you have the map?

87
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,319
[Phinks] Here.

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,197
[Chrollo] North by northwest...

89
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,283
Twenty-five-hundred meters...

90
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,702
The Beitacle Hotel.

91
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:10,996
[Nobunaga] Boss...

92
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,833
Let me go check it out. 
I beg you.

93
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,754
Very well.

94
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,923
-[gasps] 
-[Chrollo] But I'm coming with you.

95
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,843
-You got it. 
-Paku, Machi, Shizuku.

96
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,595
You're coming, too.

97
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,890
-Shal, you'll switch with Kortopi. 
-Okay.

98
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,602
[phone vibrating]

99
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,811
[Killua] Hello?

100
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,939
-[Melody] Is this Killua? 
-[Killua] Yeah, who are you?

101
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,651
[Melody] One of Kurapika's colleagues. 
Could you look to your left?

102
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,534
Hang up and whisper a command to me. 
Anything at all.

103
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,246
Raise your right hand.

104
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,627
[Killua] That's a hell of an ear! 
That's gonna come in handy.

105
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,928
[Nobunaga] 
Really? Didn't we already go there before?

106
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,221
I thought the Beitacle Hotel...

107
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,516
Isn't that one of the places 
the Nostrade family was staying?

108
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,978
It was, but by the time Shal got to look 
at the Hunter website,

109
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,855
they had already checked out 
of their rooms.

110
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,524
[Chrollo] They probably checked 
back into the same hotel

111
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,569
under a different name. 
They're being cautious.

112
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,115
The rain makes it difficult 
to make out what they're saying,

113
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,576
but there's a group of people 
talking over there.

114
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,163
There are five or six of them, 
including some women.

115
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,500
And they're all headed 
away from those abandoned buildings.

116
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,918
That's amazing.

117
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,296
Gon and I have done a lot of training 
but I can’t hear that.

118
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,173
Because it’s my ability.

119
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,802
For Kurapika to ask me for my help,

120
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,013
I’m guessing he must be getting 
really desperate.

121
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,181
Think so?

122
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,184
He wants to do everything by himself, 
doesn't he?

123
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,187
Oh, you're right. He sure does.

124
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,441
Would you happen to be an assassin?

125
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,027
Well, I used to be. How did you know?

126
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,529
[Melody] Your footsteps.

127
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,074
You're right beside me, 
but they're estinto.

128
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,200
Esti-what?

129
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:16,788
Estinto. It's a musical term 
that means they're just barely audible.

130
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,375
[Killua] Oh. I guess I’m in the habit 
of moving silently.

131
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,044
[Melody] Yours are the quietest 
I've ever heard.

132
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,463
Your technique is very impressive.

133
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,967
It's easy to see why Kurapika 
would rely on you.

134
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,721
Maybe. But I’m not too thrilled 
about this.

135
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,681
Oh, is that so?

136
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,433
[gasps] Wait, stop.

137
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,939
They're 100 meters away, 
just around the next corner.

138
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,942
You can pick out their footsteps?

139
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,987
Each person’s has their own unique sound.

140
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,740
Oh. I'll check it out.

141
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,075
[phone ringing]

142
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,869
Hey, Killua.

143
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,079
-[Killua] The woman's here. 
-She is?

144
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,623
[Killua] She's with her buddies. 
There are six of them.

145
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,460
-The guy with the topknot’s here, too. 
-[Gon groans]

146
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,672
There's one more thing. 
There's a guy we didn't see yesterday.

147
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm willing to bet he's the leader.

148
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,594
[Gon] What’s he look like?

149
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,639
[Killua] He's wearing a black coat 
with an inverted cross on the back.

150
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,894
He has black, slicked-back hair. 
I can't see his face.

151
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,979
Damn it! They're really alert.

152
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,648
I'm too scared to circle around front.

153
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,485
Give it to me. Where are you now?

154
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,197
[Killua] In front of the Motoba Building. 
They're heading west on Continental.

155
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,408
[Kurapika] There's a station nearby. 
Can you board their train?

156
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,411
[Killua] Depends. 
If it's crowded, I can manage.

157
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,914
Hurry. Head to the south.

158
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,332
[munching] Okay!

159
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,090
[Killua] Melody's in the same car as them.

160
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,719
We're headed toward Castor. 
I'm in the last car on the train.

161
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,930
Heading to Castor?

162
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,099
The auction site's in that direction.

163
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,977
[Kurapika] 
For that matter, so is our hotel.

164
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,565
[Squala] 
Yeah. Yeah. I know, Eliza, I know.

165
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,568
Honestly, I'm starting to get 
pretty sick of this job!

166
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,655
I should be happy 
I'm spending time with the dogs?

167
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,450
Hmm. It sure beats taking care 
of that spoiled brat, I guess.

168
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,246
I'm fond of Ms. Neon, 
but she's just so... hyper.

169
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,374
Look at this, Eliza! 
It's so cute!

170
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,000
[grunts]

171
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,546
[sighs] Well, won't be much longer.

172
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,091
-I'll find a better job, and-- 
-[growling]

173
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,010
[knocking on door]

174
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,805
-[Squala] Who's there? 
-[man] Room service.

175
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,765
[Squala] Leave it by the door.

176
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,183
[Squala whistles]

177
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,617
[dog growling and barking]

178
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,953
Okay, let's eat.

179
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,499
Man, I have really gotta find 
another job and fast.

180
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,877
I don't have the energy 
for this kind of work.

181
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:13,464
I just need to find something 
that will support Eliza and these guys.

182
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,134
But that's easier said than done.

183
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,344
[dog whining]

184
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,345
Huh?

185
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,642
Don't worry, buddy. 
I'll figure something out soon.

186
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,361
[phone vibrating]

187
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,821
[Killua] They got off.

188
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,407
They got off at Liber Station,

189
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,868
and they're heading 
for the Saloma Mall exit.

190
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,245
Not good. The hotel is that way.

191
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:45,830
[dialing]

192
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,833
Seriously? They found out 
we switched our rooms?

193
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:53,254
[groans] This isn't funny! 
We need to get out of here now!

194
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,841
I better take these with me.

195
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,512
[Leorio] The station's over there. 
Should we get a little closer?

196
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,805
[Kurapika] No.

197
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,976
Any closer than this 
then the Troupe might sense my hostility.

198
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,313
Hey, Gon. 
This is far as it’s safe to go.

199
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,066
I need to be this far from the station

200
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,693
or else they’ll notice me 
before I want them to.

201
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,823
It'll take approximately 0.5 seconds 
to land an attack.

202
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,744
And that’s more than enough time 
for them to engage an evasive maneuver.

203
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,580
Unless they're distracted, of course.

204
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,254
[both gasp]

205
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,342
The spiders!

206
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,139
It's moving. Descending slowly.

207
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,643
So, on an elevator. Are they leaving?

208
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,603
Let's hurry up and get in there, then.

209
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,106
We will apprehend him as a group.

210
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,817
Try to stay close enough 
to provide assistance.

211
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,321
Pakunoda, once we have him, 
get the information on Uvo.

212
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,489
Got it.

213
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,660
After that, Nobunaga, they're all yours.

214
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,121
Go.

215
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,000
They're running there now. 
And they're fast!

216
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,876
Can we head them off by car?

217
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,546
Well, it is evening rush hour. 
At this rate,

218
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,506
-they might be a lot faster on foot. 
-[car door opening]

219
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,133
Huh? Kurapika!

220
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,385
I'll contact you soon. Wait till then!

221
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,056
[Gon] Wait, Kurapika! 
I have an idea! Kurapika, come on!

222
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,727
Melody and I are still 
at the station entrance.

223
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,396
But they just ran off to the northwest.

224
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,440
Right. In pursuit.

225
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,526
[Killua] Wait, you're chasing them? 
That's dangerous!

226
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,487
They're gonna notice you! Knock it off!

227
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:46,034
You there! Damn! He hung up. 
What the hell?

228
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,413
[women laughing]

229
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,372
[both gasp]

230
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,918
[woman 1] Whoa, what's that?

231
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,088
[woman 2] Are those ninjas?

232
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,926
[Kortopi] Target is moving rapidly 
toward two o'clock.

233
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,636
Then he must be in a car.

234
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,808
I was going to wait 
till I found another job.

235
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,228
But not now! Today's my last day!

236
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,647
[Killua] Leorio, where's Gon?

237
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,901
He took off after Kurapika. 
He told us to wait here,

238
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,528
but there's no way in hell 
I can just sit here doing nothing!

239
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,657
I'm driving to the Beitacle Hotel, 
but I'm stuck in traffic!

240
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,371
Grr! Fine, we'll go after 'em! 
What is wrong with these people?

241
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,499
Damn it! It's like they just do 
whatever the hell they want!

242
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,795
We're being followed.

243
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,630
Since when?

244
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,633
Oops. I was too focused on the target.

245
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,302
Is the chain user behind or in front?

246
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,597
Nobunaga, Pakunoda and Kortopi, 
go ahead.

247
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,807
[Pakunoda] Roger that.

248
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,018
[both gasp]

249
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,069
[Chrollo] See them?

250
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,781
[Shizuku] Just shadows, not faces. 
One of them's in the alley.

251
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,699
[Machi] The other's behind the trash can.

252
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,577
[Chrollo] Okay. Keep using Gyo.

253
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,829
[both] Roger.

254
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,216
[Kurapika] Come on, spiders. 
I'm ready.

255
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,717
[Gon] Kurapika, stop!

256
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:31,764
We can't fight the three of them and win 
if they know we're here! Don't do it!

257
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,602
Guess I'll have to take my chances.

258
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,856
[Kurapika] Gon?

259
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,109
I'm sorry, okay? 
I'll stop following you. Just forget it!

260
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,153
[Machi] Him again?

261
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,114
[Chrollo] 
The one you mentioned. This is him?

262
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,701
The other one's here as well. 
Come on out.

263
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,744
[thunder rumbling]

264
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,333
Well? The Mafia reward has been canceled, 
so what do you want with us?

265
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,086
Really, it has? We didn't know!

266
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,090
[thunder crashing]

267
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,011
[Machi] What do we do, boss?

268
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,972
-[Chrollo] Seize them. 
-[dialing]

269
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,765
Phinks? It's me.

270
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,685
Come to the Beitacle Hotel.

271
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,897
[Machi] Shouldn't we get rid of them here?

272
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,025
No, I have faith in your instincts.

273
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,195
If they're connected 
to the chain user somehow,

274
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,946
we should keep them alive.

275
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,699
My instincts aren't all that trustworthy.

276
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,410
[Gon] Hey, can I ask you something?

277
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,831
How can you kill people 
who have nothing to do with you?

278
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,541
[thunder crashing]

279
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,305
[Chrollo] You have a lot of hostility 
for someone who's just surrendered.

280
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,979
Perhaps because... 
they've nothing to do with us? No.

281
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,316
On second thought, it's not that simple.

282
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:10,821
My motives are unimportant now. 
I don’t like speaking of them.

283
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:16,077
But surprisingly enough, 
or, as I expected...

284
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,206
The reason’s the key 
to understanding myself.

285
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,459
[Killua] What's he talking about?

286
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,796
[Chrollo] Head to the hotel 
and wait for Phinks and the others.

287
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,632
If they try to escape, kill them.

288
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:30,883
[Machi] Understood.

289
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,515
[Melody] Now that they're on high alert, 
we have to keep our distance,

290
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,017
otherwise, they're bound to notice us.

291
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,104
Make sure you're concealing your presence.

292
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,023
-Damn it! 
-We just have to be patient.

293
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,526
-I'm aware of that! 
-I don't think you are!

294
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,905
Your reckless pursuit 
exposed them to needless danger.

295
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,534
Do you even know why they allowed 
themselves be captured?

296
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,913
If you get caught here too, then no one 
will be able to stop the Troupe!

297
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,587
[Kurapika breathing deeply]

298
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,921
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,550
Humans all have to lower their guard 
sooner or later.

300
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,303
You're no different. We must wait.

301
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,846
You're right.

302
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,015
[Melody] Where's Squala?

303
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,184
[Kurapika sighs] 
He's not answering his cell.

304
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,481
This is not the chain user.

305
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,901
No, but I recognize his face 
from the list.

306
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,445
Step outside!

307
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,824
[Squala] 
Well, I've got my fair share of skill.

308
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,328
I've survived some close calls.

309
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,250
That experience has given me 
a sixth sense.

310
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,670
Right now, it's telling me...

311
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,508
that today, I'm...

312
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,886
[Nobunaga] 
Make one move and I'll kill you.

313
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,387
[Squala grunting]

314
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,766
I have questions I want you 
to answer truthfully.

315
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,604
One of your associates uses chains, 
doesn't he? Where is he?

316
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,107
What are you talking about? 
And who are you, anyway?

317
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,527
Do you realize 
I'm with the Nostrade family-- [yells]

318
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,448
Just answer the damn question, 
or else your left's next.

319
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,120
Hey! Didn't I tell you not to move?

320
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,332
Stay still and answer 
the woman's questions, you idiot.

321
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,668
What did you do to Uvogin?

322
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,545
The big guy that you 
and your friends captured.

323
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,300
That guy? He escaped from us somehow. 
After that, I have no idea!

324
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,094
Where are the other bodyguards?

325
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,098
They already went back to the island. 
I was on my way home too, when you guys--

326
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,516
-[Pakunoda grunts] 
-[Squala yells]

327
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,310
-There's a penalty for lying. 
-But I'm not lying!

328
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,938
Why would I lie in a situation 
like this one?

329
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,942
[Pakunoda] I'll ask you one more time. 
Where is the chain user hiding?

330
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,862
[Squala] I don't know who you're talking 
about. I don't know any chain user, okay?

331
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,531
One last question.

332
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,077
Is there anyone you care for or love?

333
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,707
Do you really think I'd be 
in this business if there were?

334
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,376
[Pakunoda] Hmm...

335
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,421
Her name is Eliza.

336
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,588
[Squala gasps]

337
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,633
She's very... beautiful.

338
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,301
[Squala sighs]

339
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,847
If any of you lay a finger--

340
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,943
[thunder rumbling]

341
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,364
I kept telling you not to move.

342
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,867
Just wouldn't listen.

343
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,912
So, did you get any decent data 
on the chain user?

344
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:47,997
[Pakunoda] Of course.

345
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,125
It would be far too much trouble 
to explain,

346
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,877
so I'll just shoot it into you...

347
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,173
with my Memory Bomb.

348
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,510
I'll stop if you're scared.

349
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,971
Oh, shut up. Go ahead.

350
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,319
[Nobunaga] I see.

351
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,906
So that's what you look like, 
Mr. Kurapika!

352
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:28,704
I'll remember your name and your face 
until I get the chance to murder you!

353
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:36,670
[narrator] The Phantom Troupe has, 
at last, identified Uvogin's killer.

354
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,007
Kurapika races to rescue Gon and Killua.

355
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,469
The final battle draws near.

356
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,889
[theme music playing]

357
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,250
-[Gon] Coming up, Gon... 
-[Killua] And Killua's...

358
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,626
[both] Hunterpedia!

359
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,336
-I'm Gon! 
-I'm Killua!

360
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,671
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

361
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,506
Today, we'll introduce Nobunaga.

362
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,176
He's an Enhancer and an Iaidō master 
who uses a four-meter En radius.

363
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,804
His aura lets him take down foes 
with one strike.

364
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:09,763
One strike?

365
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:10,973
[both] You're out!

366
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,480
[Gon] Next time: 
"Initiative and Law."

367
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,025
[Killua] The keyword is dark adaptation.

368
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,236
-[Gon] What does it mean? 
-[Killua] Look it up, dummy.
