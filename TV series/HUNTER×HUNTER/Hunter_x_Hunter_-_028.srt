[narrator] Heavens Arena.

00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,381
The 251-story building

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:09,927
which stands 991-meter tall,

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,095
is a mecca for fighters.

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:16,517
When combatants win a fight, 
they may advance by one class,

6
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,977
and receive a corresponding reward.

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,230
After reaching the 100th floor,

8
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,232
they are assigned a private room.

9
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,858
And those contestants

10
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,570
who are skilled and fortunate enough 
to reach the 200th floor

11
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:32,950
earn the right to challenge 
the strongest fighters, the Floor Masters,

12
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,702
in an intense battle for survival.

13
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,080
This is without a doubt

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,083
the best stage a warrior could ask for.

[theme song playing]

16
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,460
You say that your brother...

17
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,337
is able to use Nen?

18
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,215
I need to understand 
what Nen and Ren even mean!

19
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,551
And not just halfway.

20
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,219
I need to know it!

21
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,766

[narrator] After Killua fought Zushi,

24
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,110
the young practitioner 
of Shingen-ryu martial arts,

25
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,113
Zushi mentioned the Four Exercises.

26
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,660
Gon and Killua are about to learn 
the secret of those principles

27
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,912
from Zushi’s master, Wing.

28
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,332
[Wing] Paying attention?

29
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,960
Nen, or flame, 
is a power that fires our souls.

30
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,131
In other words, 
it’s the strength of your will.

NEN (FLAME)

00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,927
And the Four Exercises

33
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,013
is a training regimen 
that strengthens your will.

34
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,890
“Strengthens your will”

35
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,016
Training?

00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,935
-[pen squeaking on the board] 
-[Wing] Correct.

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,936
TEN (POINT)

38
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,480
[wing] 
Ten: focus the mind on a single point,

39
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,941
reflect on the self, 
and determine the goal.

ZETSU (TONGUE)

Zetsu: to put into words.

REN (TEMPER)

43
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,405
Ren is to intensify your will.

HATSU (RELEASE)

45
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,199
Hatsu is to release it into action.

46
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,954
[Gon] Ten. Zetsu. Ren. Hatsu.

47
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,248
The Four Exercises.

48
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,959
See, Zushi tempered his ‘refusal to lose’

49
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,836
during his battle with you, Killua.

50

[shuddering breath]

51
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,098
[Wing] Now allow me to demonstrate.

52
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,391
Killua?

53
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,437
For this demonstration, 
I would like to “kill” you now.

54
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,105
Is that all right?

55
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,440
Sure. Why not.

56
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,858
But you won’t be able to.

57
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,527
Let’s do this in order.

58
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,571
First, Ten.

59
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,533
I focus my mind on a single point.

60
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,786
Zetsu:

61
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,788
Express your desired intent.

62
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,665
Either mentally or verbally.

63
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,588
I will kill you.

64
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,917
[quiet grunt]

65
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,340
That was a taste of Ren.

66
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,176
With enough strength and focus,

67
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,095
the will functions as action or Hatsu.

68
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,389
With a strong will

69
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,809
your opponent will back down.

70
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,228
A more familiar term would be ‘bluffing’.

71
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,982
Ren hardens that which is soft

72
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,235
and you suddenly find 
that you’ve lost your ability

73
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,320
to correct an incorrect idea.

74
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,532
Therefore, until your soul 
has fully matured,

75
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,033
avoid using Ren.

76
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,743
As it stands now,

77
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,704
you three boys should really focus 
on training your souls.

78
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,128
[Killua] Let's go, Gon.

79
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,215
[Wing] 
If you truly wish to learn about Nen,

80
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,759
set your sights on mastering Ten first.

81
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,011
If you master Ten,

82
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,931
you no longer feel the pressure 
of an opponent’s will.

83
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,104
[Gon] Thank you very much!

84
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,819
Wait up, Killua!

85
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,614
-[Wing] Zushi. 
-Yes, sir?

86
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,491
[Wing] Let's begin training.

87
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,868
Oh... Osu!

88
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,328
First off…

89
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,834
[Gon] He lied?

90
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,918
Yeah.

91
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,045
What he said was true, far as it went

92
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,381
and his power is the real deal, too.

93
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,467
There are a few things it doesn’t cover.

94
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,468
Like?

95
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,637
[Killua] Like how tough Zushi is.

96
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,264
In our fight,

97
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,850
he got up every time I knocked him down.

98
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,643
That was pretty annoying.

99
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,855
Which is why I got 
a little pushy with him at the end.

Oops!

106
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,217
[commentator] 
Oooh! Zushi sails out of the ring!

107
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,511
And straight to the hospital, 
by the looks of it!

108
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,971
That’s gotta hurt!

109
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,266
[cheering]

110
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,605

111
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,982
Zushi must be invincible!

112
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,275
[panting]

113
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,362
[Killua] No way…

114
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,616
[commentator] But the referee has awarded 
a critical hit and knockdown.

115
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,703
Killua wins by TKO, with 11 total points.

[cheering]

117
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,291
It wasn’t his strength of will alone

118
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,168
that kept him standing that whole time.

119
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,796
There’s gotta be something else 
he’s hiding.

120
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,387
[Wing] What’s the matter, Zushi?

121
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,514
Your Ten is aggravated.

122
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,517
Master...

123
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,643
[Wing] Hm?

124
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,647
Why did you lie to Gon and Killua 
just now?

125
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:01,898
Lie?

126
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,985
Are you referring to my explanation?

127
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,111
[Zushi] Yes!

128
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,573
The Four Exercises are Ten, Zetsu, 
Ren and Hatsu.

129
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,325
But they don’t mean what you told them.

130
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,537
Did you decide to lie to them 
because they aren’t your students?

131
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,913
FLAME

132
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,415
[Wing] I didn't lie.

133
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,419
That ‘Nen’ is an important discipline 
in training the mind...

134
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,255
[pen squeaking on the board]

135
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,424
...for this Nen.

136
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,592
NEN (MIND FORCE)

137
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:34,848
However, it’s true that I cannot teach Nen 
to someone who is not a student.

138
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,017
So, I used the other Nen as a hint,

139
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,102
just to help them along.

140
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,188
If the Nen I teach 
is used in the wrong way,

141
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,483
it can become a terrible weapon, Zushi.

142
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,111
For example…

143
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,487
[paper tearing]

144
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,850
You could turn a simple piece of paper

145
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,769
into quite a harmful blade.

146
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,439
Furthermore, you could harden your body 
as a defensive measure.

147
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,028
With enough work, anyone can use Nen.

148
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,821
Which is why

149
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,949
you must be very careful 
when choosing who to teach it to.

150
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,870
Master…

151
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,497
It’s just...

152
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,666
that I hadn’t gotten the chance 
to read that book yet.

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,085
Huh?

154
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,503
And that juice…

155
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,879
it was mine…

won’t work on me.

168
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,254
That’s because...

169
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,424
I’m as slippery as a snake, 
and my fangs are just as sharp.

170
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:37,137
Fangs that are just dying 
for a taste of your vital points.

171
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:44,102
[Wrestler] [laughs] 
You might sport a vicious chop, kid,

172
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,522
but it won’t be enough 
to save you from these muscles!

173
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,566
And do you wanna know why?

174
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,775
[grunts]

175
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,361
Because I’m totally ripped, obviously!

176
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,114
[sighs]

177
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,116
And begin!

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,326
[kung fu kiai]

179
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,495
[roaring]

180
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,712
[cheering]

181
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,132
That’s a critical hit and knockdown!

182
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,135
That’s three points! It’s a knock out!

183
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,804
And, winner is Gon!

184
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,601
Critical hit and knockdown!

185
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,810
That’s three points!

186
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,270
Knockout!

187
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,563
Killua wins!

188
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,941
[cheering]

189
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,402
[commentator] Once again, Gon and Killua

190
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,905
have knocked out their opponents 
with one attack,

191
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:41,326
meaning both of them have successfully 
cleared the 190th floor!

192
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,747
Both competitors advance 
to the 200th floor!

193
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,166
The 200th floor already?!

194
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,584
[Wing] Zushi.

195
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,836
Master, Wing!

196
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,090
Killua and Gon have already reached 
the 200th, have they?

197
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,677
Yes! They’re both amazing fighters!

198
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,763
I really need to train m--

199
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,765
What the--?

200
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,141
Master?

201
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,653
[Wing] 
I guess I don’t have a choice.

202
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:18,947
Enjoy.

203
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,373
The 200th floor!

204
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,624
So, what’s it like?

205
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,833
Beats me.

206
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,335
Never actually been there.

207
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,878
But I guess we’re gonna find out.

208
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,635
[elevator dings]

209
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,309
[Gon] Wow!

210
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,271
The 200th floor sure is fancy, huh?

211
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,897
[Killua] Where’s reception?

212
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,982
RECEPTION DESK

213
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,441
[Killua] Maybe this way?

214
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,322
We finally made it!

215
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,407
Yeah.

216
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,789
[both gasp]

217
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,299
[Gon] What is this?

218
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,261
It suddenly feels like we’re in a jungle 
swarming with monsters!

219
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,098
But it looks like an ordinary hallway.

220
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,691
Let’s go.

221
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,900
We can do this!

222
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:44,699
RECEPTION DESK

223
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,088
[Gon] It’s not working…

224
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,548
I can’t go on!

225
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,133
I don’t want to!

226
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,801
Do you feel that bloodlust?

227
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,262
It’s directed right at us!

228
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,764
[straining exhale]

229
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,724
[Killua] Okay, that’s enough!

230
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,808
Who’s there?!

231
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,352
Show yourself!

232
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,402
You must be Killua and Gon.

233
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,988
The reception desk is this way,

234
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,367
so please register 
for a 200th match today.

235
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:33,081
Be advised that your eligibility 
for this floor expires at midnight,

236
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,665
so please don’t delay.

237
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,795
Did that feeling come from her?

238
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,463
I can't tell.

239
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,966
By the way, on the 200th floor,

240
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,220
there are currently 173 contestants.

241
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,056
And from this floor up,

242
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,059
all weapons are allowed in all matches.

243
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,770
So, please feel free to use 
whatever you have.

244
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,981
Also, as of the 200th floor,

245
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,150
you will no longer receive prize money.

246
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,404
Now you will be fighting only for honor.

247
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,906
Please keep that in mind, 
if you participate.

248
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,835
[gasps]

249
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,347
Hi-- Hisoka…

250
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,599
But what are you doing here?

251
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,853
It isn’t that strange, is it?

252
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,021
I love to fight

253
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,024
and this is a temple devoted to the craft.

254
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,863
The real question is why are you here?

255
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,948
Just kidding…

256
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,993
This meeting is no mere coincidence.

257
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,536
I've been waiting for you.

258
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,707
Remember how you ordered your tickets 
for the airship over the internet?

259
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,794
With only a little effort on my part,

260
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,298
I was able to find out exactly 
when you would arrive.

261
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,092
Well, in any case,

262
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,386
I knew you would come here eventually.

263
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,139
And so...

264
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,640
as your senior,

265
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,435
I have a little bit of a warning 
for the both of you.

266
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:23,107
You’re still not ready 
to set foot on this floor.

267
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,527
Not by a long shot.

268
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,239
[Gon and Killua grunting]

269
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,328
[Hisoka] 
When you will be depends on your efforts.

270
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,706
For now, leave this floor.

271
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,374
It’s far too early.

272
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,417
[Killua] Wait, what?!

273
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,586
That’s stupid! We just got up here!

274
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,259
I won't let you pass.

275
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,887
But it’s not like you could anyway.

276
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,807
[Killua] [grunts] What the hell…?!

277
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,809
[Gon] What is this?!

278
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,483
[both straining]

279
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,694
[Wing] Don't be reckless!

280
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,452
[Gon] Mr. Wing!

281
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,871
What he’s saying is true.

282
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,915
You have no defense against his Nen.

283
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,916
Nen?

284
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,376
As it stands,

285
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,378
you're both naked in a blizzard,

286
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,256
both of you wondering why it’s so cold.

287
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,841
If you continue to strain your bodies,

288
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,176
you may die.

289
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,095
So, this is Nen?

290
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,473
He can stop us from moving forward 
through willpower?

291
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,058
You liar!

292
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,060
Yes. I was lying.

293
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,147
Though some of what I said 
was technically true.

294
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,442
I will teach you the truth about Nen.

295
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,777
So, for the time being,

296
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,654
I suggest we withdraw.

297
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,491
Uh ‘scuse me…

298
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,826
[receptionist] Oh yes?

299
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,036
If we don’t register for a fight today,

300
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,663
how would that affect us?

301
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,749
Well, you would have 
to start all over again

302
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,126
from the first floor.

303
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,044
Killua, however…

304
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,796
he’s been here before,

305
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,464
and refused to register.

306
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,717
So, if he fails to do so again,

307
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,927
his commitment 
will be called into question

308
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,346
and he will be banned from participating.

309
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,185
[Killua] Mr. Wing.

310
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,229
If we withdraw,

311
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,441
will we be able to make it back here 
by midnight?

312
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,449
Hmm...

313
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,744
[Wing] That all depends on you.

314
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,961
[Wing] Simply put this is Nen.

315
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:55,635
Nen refers to the ability 
to control your “aura”

316
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,679
which, as you may know, 
is also known as life energy.

317
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,014
NEN (MIND FORCE)

318
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,477
Everyone in the world 
has a small amount of life energy.

319
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,479
But in most cases,

320
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,314
it simply leaks away.

321
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,526
The ability to build up and contain 
this life energy is known as Ten.

322
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,986
is called Ten.

323
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,279
(ENVELOPE)

324
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,699
Using Ten you can make your body tougher

325
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,701
and considerably slow 
the effects of aging.

326
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,952
TEN (ENVELOPE)

327
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,871
Then comes Zetsu

328
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,831
which shuts off the flow of aura.

329
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,041
ZETSU (SUPPRESS)

330
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,586
It’s quite effective for concealing 
your presence from others

331
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,296
and recovering from fatigue.

332
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,007
Which brings us to Ren,

333
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,258
REN (REFINE)

334
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,511
It enables you to produce more aura.

335
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,686
Can you feel that?

336
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,980
Yeah. It’s like pressure…

337
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,525
But it doesn’t feel weird or creepy.

338
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,569
That’s because I have absolutely 
no malice.

339
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,782
I must admit I’m impressed.

340
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,784
Their senses are amazing.

341
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,246
Perhaps it’s a product of the environments

342
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,664
in which they were raised.

343
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,958
But their innate gifts are also a factor.

344
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,213
Aura is an energy dwelling 
within all humans…

345
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,217
which makes it very effective 
against other humans.

346
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,511
For better or for worse.

347
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,682
If you attack a helpless person 
with malice,

348
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,310
you can kill using aura alone.

349
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,067
Only one thing can protect you 
from a user of Nen.

350
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,571
You must learn to use it yourself

351
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,157
and use Ten for defense.

352
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,952
Block the other person’s aura 
with your own.

353
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,581
Otherwise...

354
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,856
Your body will be shattered 
beyond all recognition.

355
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,781
[narrator] Hisoka blocks the path 
leading beyond the 200th floor.

356
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,117
Will Gon and Killua 
have begun their studies

357
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:29,413
but will they be able to learn enough 
about true Nen to pass Hisoka

358
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,248
and reach the receptionist

359
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,626
all before the clock strikes midnight?

360
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,800
Not yet.

361
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,384
It’s too soon.

362
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,679
[theme song playing]

363
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,539
[Gon] Coming up:

364
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,957
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

365
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,542
[both] ...Hunterpedia!

366
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,669
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

367
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,421
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

368
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,757
Today, we're introducing Mr. Wing, 
Zushi’s master

369
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,718
and an expert at Shingen-ryu!

370
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,636
It seems like he’s pretty good with Nen.

371
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,221
Oh yeah, but isn’t his shirt untucked?

372
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,848
And he’s got bedhead!

373
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,148
Next time: Awakening x And x Potential!

374
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,483
[Gon grunting]

375
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,735
Did you feel anything?

376
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,153
[Killua] Nope. Nothing.
