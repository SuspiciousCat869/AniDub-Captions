Evil haunts.

Uncharted frontiers.

8

The mysterious unknown.

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,068
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words…

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,153
are called…

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,282
Hunters.

[theme song playing]

13
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,534
I... give up!

14
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,202
-What? 
-What?

15
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,787
[Leorio] Bastard!

16
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,749
I knew we shouldn’t have trusted you!

17
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,127
All you’re good for 
is sabotaging the other applicants.

18
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,338
You’re just a worthless piece of garbage!

19
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,089
It took you long enough.

20
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,342
That’s what I do every year.

21
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,678
And I’ll keep on doin’ it 
for as long as I can.

22
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,598
I don’t care 
about passing the Hunter Exam;

23
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,266
I’m in it for the thrills.

where long-term prisoners are held.

27
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,246
Gon and friends have chosen to partake 
in a five-on-five battle

28
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,956
with some of the inmates.

29
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,002
Thanks to Tonpa, 
they’ve already suffered their first loss.

30
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,424
The next round 
will pit Gon against Sedokan.

31
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,720
Who knows what the upcoming battle 
will bring?

32
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,640
Now, then.

SEDOKAN 
149-YEAR SENTENCE, SERIAL BOMBINGS

34
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,268
As you’ve all probably noticed, 
I’m not terribly strong.

35
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:09,856
I don’t enjoy fighting, or running, 
jumping, anything physical, really.

36
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,484
[Gon] I like that stuff a lot more 
than thinking.

37
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,487
I guess I’ve never really been 
all that great at using my head.

38
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,822
[Sedokan] I thought so.

39
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,408
So, I came up with a game.

40
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,284
One I think we’ll both enjoy.

41
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,495
-A game? 
-[Sedokan] Yes.

42
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,708
Yes. A simple game that doesn’t rely 
on mental or physical activity.

43
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,792
What is it?

44
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,002
[Sedokan chuckles]

45
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,924
We each light a candle at the same time

46
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,885
and whoever’s candle goes out first 
is the loser.

47
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,303
All right?

48
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,305
Yep. Makes sense to me.

49
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,807
I’m in; let’s do it!

50
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,934
[Sedokan] Okay. In that case…

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,069
So which candle do you want to use?

52
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,654
It’s your choice.

53
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,823
Press ‘O’ for the long candle

54
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,243
or press ‘X’ if you would rather have 
the short one.

55
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,580
Choose by majority rule.

56
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,332
So, we have to choose one?

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,168
This is a damn trap!

58
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,504
Normally, you’d want to go 
for the long one.

59
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,258
Which means that low-life 
must’ve done something to sabotage it!

60
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,595
[Kurapika] 
Yes. That would be the safe assumption.

61
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,513
However, it could be a trick

62
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,932
and he’s actually tampered 
with the short one.

63
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,561
Hey, you’re right. 
So, when you put it that way…

64
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,855
Correct. There is no end.

65
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,816
Sounds like you’ve got yourselves 
a real dilemma.

66
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,276
You keep your big mouth shut!

67
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,486
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,491
Something happens when you’re presented 
with an obviously biased choice:

69
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,495
suspicion mounts and 
the decision-making process seizes up.

70
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,790
Yes. This truly is a dilemma.

71
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,125
Moreover,

72
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,504
the psychological impact 
of making the wrong choice

73
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,716
is much greater than if the option 
was between two evenly matched options.

74
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,594
[grumbles]

75
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,221
[smug chuckle]

76
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,223
[Sedokan] All right, then…

77
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,017
Please, take all the time you need.

78
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,228
It’s a majority decision

79
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,730
but feel free to talk about it first.

80
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,734
No rush. We have plenty of time, 
believe me.

81
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,779
Hey! What should I pick?

82
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,155
Dammit.

83
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,740
Good question.

84
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,371
[chuckles]

85
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,424
Gon! The choice is up to you!

86
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,303
Pick whichever candle you think is best 
is the best option.

87
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,138
That’s how we’ll all vote.

88
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,723
Are you sure about this?

89
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,685
It’s just that 
he doesn’t think things through.

90
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,979
Instead of fretting over the choice,

91
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,815
let’s just put our faith 
in Gon’s instincts.

92
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,234
Trust his instincts, huh?

93
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,278
Oh, I get to choose?

94
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,863
In that case

95
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,698
I’ll go with the long candle, okay?

96
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,740
[smirks]

97
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,201
You want the long one? 
Are you sure about that?

98
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,538
Of course! The longer the candle, 
the longer it burns.

99
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,706
It’s kind of a no-brainer.

100
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,126
Well, that’s one way to look at it.

101
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,962
I told you he wasn’t gonna 
think it through.

102
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,214
Well. That settles it.

103
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,799
[beep]

104
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,427
Yeah, it’s not like 
we’d be able to figure out

105
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,845
which one’s the trap, anyway.

106
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,846

109
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,602
[Sedokan] Okay!

110
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,979
Looks like you get the long candle

111
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,148
and I’ll take the short one.

112
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,195
[metal grinding]

113
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,240
All right. Let’s light ‘em together.

114
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,294
[chuckles]

115
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,759
[chuckling]

116
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:17,812
[Killua] So, uh...

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,816
Normally how long 
would it take that candle to burn?

118
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,486
I would estimate five to six hours.

119
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,530
[strong wind blowing]

120
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,119
Oh, wow.

121
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,746
That sure was a close one.

122
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,248
[wind blows]

123
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,378
[Leorio] There’s a pretty strong wind 
coming up from below.

124
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,213
They’ll have to stay still

125
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,382
and keep an eye on those flames.

126
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,926
There’s no chance 
to let their guards down.

127
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,526
If you don’t pay attention 
your candle will blow out.

128
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,236
[Gon] Yeah, I know.

129
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,780
That’s because you’re planning 
to do something bad.

130
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:09,864
Aren’t you?

131
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,242
Otherwise, your short candle 
would go out first.

132
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,994
I won't do anything.

133
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,746
‘Cause, you see...

134
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,999
I came prepared.

135
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,339
[startled cry]

136
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,300
[smirks] There. See?

137
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,178
Hey. Take a look at Gon’s candle.

138
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,681
The flame suddenly got a lot stronger!

139
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,349
I should’ve known.

140
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,811
He somehow laced Gon’s candle 
with gunpowder or some other accelerant.

141
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,313
That’s why it’s burning so much faster!

142
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,111
[Gon] Ow! Hot!

143
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,696
-[Killua] At this rate... 
-[Gon] Hot...

144
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,865
[Killua] ...he’s only got another 
two or three minutes!

145
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,824
[Leorio] Damn!

146
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,160
Hey! That was a dirty trick!

147
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,079
I knew it! You messed with the long one, 
didn’t you?

148
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,541
[smirks] You’re wrong.

149
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,462
I had four candles prepped and ready.

150
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,089
The disparate choice I presented you with

151
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,509
was merely camouflage 
for the actual trap!

152
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,389
You assumed that one of the two 
would be a trick candle.

153
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,142
The choices were so uneven

154
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,269
you never stopped 
to consider the possibility

155
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,521
that I’d rigged both of them.

156
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,152
In the end it didn’t really matter 
which of the candles you picked.

157
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,822
Long or short…

158
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,326
I’d have handed you 
an oil-soaked candle either way.

159
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,796
I guess now that the flame is 
burning so much stronger…

160
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,008
it’ll take a lot more 
than a little breeze to put it out.

161
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:53,843
Hm?

162
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,388
He's fast!

163
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,770
[chuckles]

00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,939
I win!

165
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,442
Yes!

166
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,904
[solemn grunt]

167
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,031
[Lippo] Ooh.

168
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,535
That one’s got a real spring 
in his step, doesn’t he?

169
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,664
And he knows how to take advantage 
of a bad situation.

170
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,708
Impressive. Very impressive.

171
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,839
[Gon] All right! I won!

172
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,632
You sure as hell did!

173
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,217
That’s one win for us!

174
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,554
Once Kurapika and I win, we can advance!

175
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,768
Idiot. That’s what you get 
for relying on cheap tricks.

176
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,604
Damn.

177
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,650
[hooded prisoner] Proper deception 
calls for a little sacrifice.

178
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,193
Watch and learn.

179
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,195
[loud clatter]

180
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,535
All right.

181
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,120
I’ll take the next one.

182
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,660
[roaring]

183
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:48,625
HUNTER GLOSSARY

184
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,879
LIPPO

185
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,673
[prisoner cackling]

186
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,759
The next contender’s gotta face me!

187
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,510
MAJITANI 
108-YEAR SENTENCE

188
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,888
MULTIPLE CRIMES, 
INCLUDING FRAUD AND BLACKMAIL

189
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,098
Man, that is one freaky body.

190
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,100
Yeah. And face.

191
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,105
Do ya see this, kid?

192
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,067
I’ve killed nineteen people so far.

193
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,361
But it’s such an uneven number.

194
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,613
To tell the truth, it kinda bugs me.

195
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,115
[snickering]

196
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,661
I’ve been lookin’ forward 
to meeting number twenty for a while.

197
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,580
[evil laughter]

198
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,959
Oh, great. 
We’re dealing with a serial killer?

199
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,421
[Majitani] The only way I’ll do this is 
if we put our lives on the line.

200
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,091
It’s all or nothin’, do ya hear me, brat?

201
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,801
Gimme blood!

202
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,803
Spilling entrails!

203
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,264
And sweet agony!

204
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,059
[roaring in laughter]

205
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,394
Oh yeah.

206
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,563
You must be terrified right now.

207
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,731
[Kurapika] Very well.

208
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,816
[Majitani] Huh?

209
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,068
You can decide how we settle this.

210
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,736
And I will accept it.

211
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,657
[Majitani chuckles] 
You’ve got some balls, kid!

212
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,117
[scoffs]

213
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,786
But I know you’re quaking in your boots.

214
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,747
How long can you keep up 
the tough guy act?

215
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,084
Then you’re accepting a death match.

216
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,129
We go until one of us 
either dies or admits defeat,

217
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,798
and not a second earlier, understand?

218
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,466
However…

219
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,095
Don’t think admitting defeat or surrender 
will stop me.

220
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,514
Never has and, in fact, it never will,

221
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,725
so get it out of your head right now.

222
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,228
[maniacal laughter]

223
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,313
Well?

224
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,356
Scared stiff now, aren’t ya?

225
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,651
[Kurapika] Fine. I accept.

226
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:39,944
Huh?

227
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,492
Shall we begin?

228
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,162
[Majitani] What is he, an idiot?

229
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,247
Didn’t he hear what I just said?

230
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,916
This is the real deal. 
We’re fighting to the death!

231
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,171
Wait, he should be trembling 
just at the sight of me!

232
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,883
Hold on! There’s something 
I forgot to mention.

233
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,677
Absolutely no weapons are allowed.

234
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,513
So, this has to be a simple fistfight.

235
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,058
Even though I’ve been hired 
as an Examiner,

236
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,352
I am still a prisoner.

237
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,022
And that means 
that I’m not allowed to carry weapons.

238
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,899
That makes sense.

239
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,567
I understand.

240
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,697
It there anything else you forgot?

241
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,866
If not, I’d like to get started.

242
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,659
[Majitani grunts]

243
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,205
That little bastard!

244
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,165
He had a concealed weapon.

245
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,959
I’m glad I said something 
before it was too late.

246
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,129
But from the look of it, 
he doesn’t rely on it much.

247
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,674
Is he really that confident 
in his combat skills?

248
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,094
No. I don’t think its that’s it, either.

249
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,723
[derisive snort] 
I bet he’s dying to run away

250
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,018
but he doesn’t want to look like a coward 
in front of his friends.

251
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,521
Or maybe he’s just so stupid

252
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,107
that he doesn’t comprehend how scary I am!

253
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,192
He can’t even wrap his head around it!

254
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,237
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, that’s gotta be it!

255
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,489
[sinister grin]

256
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,699
Well, in that case,

257
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,620
I’ve got a few cards up my sleeve 
for dealing with fools like him.

258
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,290
[inhales deeply, grunts]

259
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,751
[flexing and grunting]

260
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,343
Hey, guys. Is Kurapika gonna be okay?

261
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,346
‘Cause if you ask me, 
this guy looks pretty dangerous.

262
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,641
[Killua] 
What looks so dangerous about him?

263
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,270
It’s obvious, well, to me, anyway,

264
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,855
that this guy’s a big talker.

265
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,275
He doesn’t have the guts to hit anybody, 
let alone kill them.

266
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,820
-[Gon] I wouldn’t worry about it much. 
-Huh?

267
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,405
Why not?

268
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,450
Because when I’m looking at him, 
I don’t get chills or anything.

269
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,826
What does that mean?

270
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,295
I think it’s time 
to show you my secret weapon!

271
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,337
[roars]

272
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,339
The first of many!

273
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,591
Here he comes!

274
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,140
[roaring]

275
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,350
[Kurapika grunts]

276
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,271
Oh, my God.

277
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,523
He just punched a hole in the damn floor!

278
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,778
[Majitani] That was perfect.

279
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,532
And that’s not the only trick 
up my sleeve.

280
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,828
[smirks]

281
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,622
[gasps]

282
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,257
Look at his tattoo; 
it’s a spider with twelve legs!

283
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:49,675
And that means...

284
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,220
Yeah. I recognize it.

285
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,680
Anybody who wants to be a Hunter

286
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,517
has heard all about tattoos like that one.

287
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,773
It’s the symbol worn by members 
of that nefarious band of vicious thieves,

288
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,483
the Phantom Troupe!

289
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,278
Really?

290
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,656
Yeah. No doubt about it.

291
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,783
Its meaning is widely known.

292
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,328
In fact, I-- I heard about them 
straight from Kurapika.

293
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,802
[Majitani] Between the steel implants

294
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,805
that gives me the strength 
to shatter rock with my bare hands

295
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,266
and the symbol of the Phantom Troupe...

296
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,018
they make one hell of a combo.

297
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,939
Nobody would want to fight me 
after getting a peek at those!

298
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,441
[Majitani laughing]

299
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,110
[Majitani] Aw, what’s wrong?

300
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,778
Cat got your tongue?

301
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,366
Name’s Majitani!

302
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,327
I’m one of the Phantom Troupe’s 
four devas!

303
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,788
That first strike 
was just an introduction.

304
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,166
This is your last chance to give up.

305
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,378
If you do, I’m still willing to...

306
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,213
Huh?

307
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,679
[seething breathing]

308
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,267
Hey... What’s wrong with you?

309
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,685
What are you...

310
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,729
Huh?

311
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:27,982
[grunts]

312
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,318
[Majitani groaning]

313
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,529
[strangled cries]

314
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,532
[Majitani] Wait! Wait, I get it!

315
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,660
Hold on, wait! Please don’t!

316
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,454
You win, okay?

317
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,099
[whistles]

318
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,437
[Kurapika] Take this to heart.

319
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,147
First,

320
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,192
a genuine Phantom Troupe tattoo 
has the member’s number

321
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,402
inscribed on the spider’s back.

322
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,656
Second,

323
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,742
they don’t bother tallying the people 
they’ve killed

324
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,786
because it’s irrelevant to them.

325
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,246
And third,

326
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,541
don’t ever mention the Phantom Troupe 
to me again.

327
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,544
If you do...

328
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,006
I will kill you with my bare hands.

329
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:46,894
Oh, wow…

330
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,230
Kurapika...

331
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,818
Yeah. I saw that one 
coming from a mile away.

332
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,209
[Leorio] Hey, are you okay?

333
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,129
[Kurapika] Yes. I’m not injured.

334
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,672
[Leorio] No, I mean,

335
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,216
is it safe for us 
to be around you right now?

336
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,845
[Kurapika] 
From the first moment I saw him,

337
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,265
I knew he wasn’t nearly 
as powerful as he looked.

338
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,225
And in my mind,

339
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,603
I knew right from the start 
that the tattoo was a fake.

340
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,481
But as soon as I saw that spider,

341
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,192
my vision went almost completely red.

342
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,612
Well, nobody’s gonna blame you for that.

343
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,573
[Kurapika] To be perfectly honest…

344
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,532
-Huh? 
-Huh?

345
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,410
Whenever I see a spider, any spider,

346
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,538
all my rationale collapses 
and I turn primal.

347
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,543
You should've told us. 
Like, a long time ago.

348
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,921
[Kurapika] That can only mean one thing.

349
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,841
The rage inside me 
remains as strong as ever.

350
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,468
I suppose...

351
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,219
I should be happy.

352
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,557
I think we ought to keep Kurapika 
away from any spiders, from now on.

353
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:07,892
Oh yeah.

354
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,395
[Bendot] Damn you, Majitani.

355
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,689
You were completely worthless out there.

356
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,777
Those facial scars on him 
are from a botched plastic surgery.

357
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,237
That’s one hell of a fraud he pulled off.

358
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,823
Okay. You know what’s happening, right?

359
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,367
After two losses, it’s do or die.

360
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,744
[hooded woman] I’ll handle it.

361
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,497
In fact, I know just the thing.

362
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,419
All right!

363
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,922
Time for me to secure our victory!

364
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,928
[narrator] 
With Kurapika’s triumph over Majitani,

365
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,930
they only need one more win

366
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,849
to clear the trial 
and reach the next Phase.

367
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,062
But the question on all of their minds

368
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,774
is how will Leorio 
handle the next challenge?

369
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,780
[theme song playing]

370
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,530
[Gon] Next time: 
Trick To The Trick!

371
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,992
The trick to the trick is to trick... 
I can't say it.

372
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,327
[Killua] Say it properly!
