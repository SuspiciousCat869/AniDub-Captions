00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,961
[roaring]

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:04,880
[narrator] Strange beasts

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,924
and monsters.

4
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,801
Vast riches.

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,678
Hidden treasures.

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:14,973
Evil haunts.

7
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,768
Uncharted frontiers.

8
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,188
“The mysterious unknown.”

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:26,068
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words…

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,070
are called…

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,990
Hunters.

12
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,875
[theme song playing]

13
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,115
Okay, now!

14
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,169
[Menchi] The joy of discovering 
something delicious.

15
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,880
And now you know what it feels like.

16
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,091
That feeling is 
what we risk our lives for.

17
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,474
SHOWDOWN x ON x THE AIRSHIP

18
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,190
[narrator] 
After clearing the Exam’s Second Phase

19
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,151
Gon and his friends 
fly through the starry sky

20
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,862
toward the site of the Third Phase.

21
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,073
[man] I will now take the opportunity

22
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,077
to introduce myself properly 
to the remaining 42 applicants.

23
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,536
I am Netero,

24
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,665
the Chairman of the Selection Committee 
for this year’s Hunter Exam.

25
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,667
It’s a pleasure to meet all of you.

26
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,585
And I’m his secretary, Beans.

27
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,671
[Netero] I had originally planned

28
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,007
to make my appearance 
during the Exam’s final phase

29
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,968
but, well seeing as how I’m already here…

30
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,558
I have to admit,

31
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:07,020
there’s nothing I love more 
than this feeling of tension in the air.

32
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,149
So, I think I’ll stick around 
for the remainder of the trip.

33
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,818
[laughs]

34
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,278
We are scheduled 
to arrive at our destination

35
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,948
tomorrow morning 
at 8:00 a.m. exactly.

36
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,617
You’ll find dinner waiting for you 
in the dining hall.

37
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,578
You’re also welcome 
to get some rest, of course.

38
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,707
You’re free to do as you please 
until we contact you.

39
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,333
The evening is yours.

40
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,837
Hey come on, Gon! 
Let’s go and explore the airship!

41
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,130
Yeah!

42
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,048
They’ve got so much energy!

43
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,884
Not me, though. 
All I wanna do now is crash.

44
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,094
As do I.

45
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:43,306
However, there is one thing 
that still concerns me.

46
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,183
[Leorio] Oh? What’s up?

47
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,061
[Kurapika] How many more phases 
are there in the Exam?

48
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,856
Huh. Yeah, they haven’t said, have they?

49
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,484
As long as I’ve been doing this, 
it’s averaged five or six.

50
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,822
Which means that we’ve still got 
another three or four left to go.

51
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,701
Well, in that case we should 
get some rest now, while we can.

52
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,288
Okay but I’d be careful if I were you.

53
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,789
Huh?

54
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,750
You heard the secretary, right?

55
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,252
He only told us when we’re arriving.

56
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,088
He didn’t say 
that the Third Phase of the Exam

57
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,799
wasn’t gonna happen right here 
on the airship itself.

58
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,386
And we’ll be notified, but who knows 
if that’ll be at 8:00 a.m. or not?

59
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,513
Hold on. Are you serious?

60
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,390
I suppose that makes sense.

61
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,683
[Tonpa] You might wake up

62
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,395
and find out the Exam already took place 
and you slept right through it.

63
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,689
If you wanna get to the next phase,

64
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,485
then ya better not let your guard down, 
even up here. Understand?

65
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,653
C’mon, gimme a break.

66
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,865
Well. Thanks for the advice. See ya later.

67
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,909
We’ll be sure to keep it in mind.

68
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,952
Good luck to all of us, eh?

69
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,955
Psyched ‘em!

70
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,666
I bet they’re both so nervous 
they won’t sleep a wink!

71
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,919
They’ll be worthless by morning.

72
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,590
[Kurapika] There’s no chance 
the next phase

73
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,509
will take place on the airship.

74
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,261
If that were their intention, 
they wouldn’t have told us

75
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,931
we were free to do as we pleased 
and enjoy the amenities

76
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,600
but to stand by and wait for instructions.

77
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,935
[snoring]

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,565
[tapping]

79
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,860
[Menchi] So. How many applicants 
do you think’ll make it this year?

80
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,029
You mean, who’ll pass the Exam?

81
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,282
[Menchi] Yep. Looks like we’ve got 
a pretty impressive group here.

82
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,661
Though, I did try to fail them all, sure. 
But still.

83
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,538
Gee, I don’t know.

84
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,082
I guess it depends on 
what the other phases are.

85
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,334
That’s a good point. 
I hadn’t thought of that.

86
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,003
But a few of ‘em stand out, 
didn’t you notice?

87
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,756
And one even has this whole aura thing 
going on.

88
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,008
What do you think, Satotz?

89
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,678
[Satotz] I’m inclined to agree.

90
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,014
I quite like the rookies this year.

91
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,724
Yeah! Same here!

92
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,476
I like number 294.

93
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,728
I really think he’s got a good shot 
at winning.

94
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,815
[Satotz] I’m partial to number 99, myself.

95
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,485
He looks like a spoiled, selfish brat 
if you ask me.

96
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,820
What about you, Buhara?

97
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,780
Who I think will pass?

98
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,450
Well, he’s not a rookie 
but my money’s on number 44.

99
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,412
I’m sure you guys must’ve noticed it, too.

100
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,290
but when number 255 was throwing a fit,

101
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,085
44 was the one who looked 
like he wanted to kill somebody.

102
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,838
He had this cold, intense bloodlust.

103
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,465
[Menchi] Of course, I noticed that.

104
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,758
How could I not?

105
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,219
It looked like 
he could barely restrain himself.

106
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,180
Hold on, didn’t you realize?

107
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,516
He’s been like that 
ever since we showed up.

108
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,644
I’ve had a bad feeling about him 
this whole time.

109
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,937
Really?

110
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,272
Yeah.

111
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,358
He’s the real reason 
I was so edgy during the Exam.

112
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,445
I mean, he kept trying 
to pick a fight with me.

113
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,615
I had a similar experience.

114
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,992
He should be carefully monitored.

115
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,703
Though it pains me to admit this,

116
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,915
I feel we are all birds of a feather 
with him.

117
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,501
But his affinity for darkness,

118
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,296
is infinitely stronger than ours.

119
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:08,219
We Hunters, as you know, 
are constantly seeking out new rivals.

120
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,140
And the Hunter Exam 
has no shortage of opponents,

121
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,019
each perfectly qualified 
and worthy of respect.

122
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,232
And every now and then in our searches 
we encounter someone...

123
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,235
Someone who chooses to surge forward

124
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,738
when you or I would opt for the brakes.

125
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,616
An anomaly of sorts.

126
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,815
[shudders]

127
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,153
[cook] Hey! Kids!

128
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,364
What are you doing? 
Stay out of the kitchen!

129
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,574
Go eat in the dining hall with the others!

130
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,575
[Gon and Killua grunt]

131
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,538
[Killua] Huh?

132
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,747
Hey! Awesome!

133
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,541
-Gon, Look! 
-What is it?

134
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,584
[Gon] Whoa!

135
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,587
-It’s like it’s covered in jewels! 
-Yeah!

136
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,300
[Gon] Hey... so I was wondering…

137
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,469
[Killua] Huh?

138
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,472
[Gon] Your parents. Are they--

139
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,725
I mean… where are they?

140
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,436
[Killua] Hmm... They're alive. Probably.

141
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,937
[Gon] What do they do?

142
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,605
[Killua] They're assassins.

143
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,066
They both are?

144
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,903
That’s your response?

145
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,948
You really are a riot, aren’t ya?

146
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,453
You’re not the first person 
I’ve told about my parents,

147
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,496
but you’re the first to take it seriously.

148
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,331
[Gon] But it’s true, isn’t it?

149
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,333
Why d’ya think that?

150
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,210
It’s just a hunch.

151
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,795
Weird.

152
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,089
Most of the time people only like me

153
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,675
because they can’t tell 
if I’m serious or not.

154
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:11,843
[Gon] Huh?

155
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,056
[Killua] 
I’m from a family of assassins, so yeah,

156
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,141
they’re all in the business of murder.

157
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,935
And my entire family...

158
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,229
they’ve got real high hopes for me.

159
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,441
But, y’know… I can’t stand it.

160
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,861
Who wants their whole life 
mapped out for ‘em?

161
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,822
When I told them 
I wanted to decide my own future,

162
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,949
they all flipped out. It was crazy!

163
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,744
My mom had tears 
just streaming down her face

164
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,329
and she kept screaming at me

165
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,623
how I had the potential 
to be a top assassin.

166
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,210
Horrible parents, right? 
No wonder I’m rotten!

167
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,628
Then we started fighting,

168
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,798
so I slashed my mom in the face, 
stabbed my brother in the side,

169
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,382
and ran away from home.

170
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,593
I’m sure they’re out for blood now.

171
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,137
-If they all come after me, I’ll kill ‘em! 
-[laughs nervously]

172
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,014
When I get my license,

173
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,266
I’ll hunt ‘em down to the last one!

174
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,187
I’m willing to bet they’ve got 
pretty hefty bounties on their heads.

175
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,273
Hm?

176
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,112
Hm...

177
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,447
[both gasp]

178
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,117
[Netero] Something wrong?

179
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,043
Mr. Netero…

180
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,130
You didn’t see anyone 
coming from that side, did you?

181
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,132
No, I didn’t.

182
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,883
[Killua] When did he...

183
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,511
You’re fast. For an old timer.

184
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,138
Oh. That trick?

185
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,265
I just barely moved, that’s all.

186
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,812
What do you want?

187
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,023
You don’t have anything to do 
‘til the last phase, isn’t that right?

188
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,693
Now, now, no need to be so unkind.

189
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,280
I just got a little bored, 
so I decided to look for some company.

190
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,950
By the way, I’ve been meaning to ask you,

191
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,786
any thoughts on your first attempt 
at the Hunter Exam?

192
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,080
Yeah! It’s a lot of fun!

193
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,332
There haven’t been any written tests yet,

194
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,084
and I was kinda worried about that.

195
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,837
I’m disappointed, honestly.

196
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,715
I expected this to be 
a lot more challenging.

197
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,802
But I assume 
the next phase’ll be more interesting.

198
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,513
Oh, well. We’ll see…

199
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,432
Let's go, Gon.

200
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,684
-Wait! Just a moment. 
-[Killua] Hm?

201
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,854
Would you like 
to play a little game with me?

202
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,107
Game?

203
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,401
And to make it interesting,

204
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,613
if you two can beat me, 
I’ll make you Hunters on the spot.

205
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,865
Really?! I’ll play!

206
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,871
What do you say? Well?

207
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:51,669
HUNTER GLOSSARY

208
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:56,007
NETERO

209
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,309
Now, let’s go over the rules of the game.

210
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,896
All you have to do is simply 
take this ball away from me.

211
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,316
If you can do that 
before the airship arrives, you win.

212
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,777
So, let’s see…

213
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,404
We’re scheduled for an 8:00 a.m. arrival, 
yes?

214
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,700
Well, that’s not too bad. 
You still have nine hours left.

215
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,411
And feel free to use any tactics you want.

216
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,872
I will only defend. I promise.

217
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,832
Huh? That’s too easy!

218
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,001
It’s... barely even a game!

219
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,755
Then why not give it a try 
and see if you’re right?

220
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,091
All we have to do is take the ball?

221
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,133
Yes.

222
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,386
Then, I’ll give it a shot.

223
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,346
Go right ahead.

224
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,144
He thinks I’m weak.

225
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,156
Oh?

226
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,161
I see a bunch of Killuas!

227
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,666
[Netero] One of the assassination arts…

228
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,419
"The Rhythm Echo."

229
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:20,550
It confuses the enemy with afterimages 
created by a varying cadence of steps.

230
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:27,056
To think he’s already 
mastered the technique at his age.

231
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,891
What a dreadful child!

232
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,197
Oh wow!

233
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,833
[Killua] He sure moves around a lot. 
How old is this guy?

234
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,502
Is that all? How disappointing.

235
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,922
[annoyed grunt] In that case,

236
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,467
I’ll just have to slow him down!

237
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,473
Ow! His pivot leg!

238
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,932
[arrogant chuckle]

239
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,353
[groans]

240
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,481
[screaming in pain]

241
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,441
[pensive grunt]

242
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,110
[Netero] He certainly didn’t hold back 
with that kick.

243
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,781
If I were an ordinary person, 
it would have shattered my leg!

244
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,199
[Killua] Damn!

245
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,284
His legs are as hard as iron!

246
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,577
[grunts]

247
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,704
Killua! Tag me, tag me!

248
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,206
C’mon! It’s my turn!

249
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,541
[pensive grunt]

250
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,420
[Netero] This one seems 
like a very honest young man.

251
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,090
I’m curious to see 
what he has up his sleeve.

252
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:43,883
Okay!

253
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,519
[Netero] 
Ah. I see he’s got a quick first step.

254
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,313
But he’s charging straight at me.

255
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,023
Very foolish indeed.

256
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,900
He’s still a child…

257
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,693
Wait, from above?

258
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,323
[Gon] Ow!

259
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,075
[Killua] Idiot!

260
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,160
We already know how high you can jump,

261
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,621
so you don’t have to go all out! Focus!

262
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,165
You had a chance! 
He dropped his guard for a second!

263
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,875
[Netero] Heh, no kidding.

264
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,877
[recovering breath]

265
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,342
He may appear simple-minded 
but he’s clearly using his head.

266
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,344
Well, that didn’t work.

267
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,515
[Netero] They should keep me entertained 
until morning.

268
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,768
[snoring]

269
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,610
[chuckles]

270
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,197
Last time I saw those two, 
they were pretty shaken up.

271
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,035
They were both so nervous, 
I bet they aren’t getting a wink of sleep!

272
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,163
-[snoring] 
-They’re snoring?!

273
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,582
[grunting]

274
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,668
[panting]

275
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,004
[Killua grunting]

276
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:05,882
[groans]

277
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,553
Ow, ow, ow!

278
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,055
You boys aren’t getting anywhere, huh?

279
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,933
Why don’t both of you 
try attacking me at once?

280
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,018
[Killua grunts angrily]

281
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,436
Why, you--!

282
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,813
Okay! We gotcha now!

283
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,233
Not bad!

284
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,860
But still not good enough.

285
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,157
[laughs]

286
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,076
[Gon] 
Mr. Netero hasn’t even broken a sweat!

287
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,080
-Ow! 
-Ow!

288
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,999
[laughs]

289
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,669
[Gon] If we’re gonna beat him, 
we’ve got to get creative.

290
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,800
Gotta say, 
your attacks don’t amount to much.

291
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,638
[Netero groans in pain]

292
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,391
[Netero] What? He kicked off his shoe 
to increase his range?

293
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,602
[grunts]

294
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,188
[surprised Netero groans in pain]

295
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,439
Now’s our chance!

296
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,815
I think not.

297
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,739
Oh! Sneaky kids!

298
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,700
[both] I’ve almost got it!

299
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,629
[both groan]

300
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,423
Well now….

301
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,680
Excellent teamwork! 
You get an "A" for effort!

302
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,600
[Gon] You’re amazing, Mr. Netero!

303
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,018
Really amazing!

304
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,361
Ah, forget it.

305
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,822
I quit. Ya beat me, all right?

306
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,658
Oh… Quitting already?

307
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,619
Don’t quit! We’ve still got lots a time.

308
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,664
And besides, we came so close just now.

309
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,209
Come on. You’re really clueless, 
aren’t ya?

310
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,210
It’s hopeless.

311
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,090
Think about it. The old guy’s barely used 
his right hand or left leg.

312
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,343
He’s way too powerful for us, Gon.

313
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,345
We could keep at this for an entire year

314
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,347
and never get that ball.

315
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,392
Figured it out, did you?

316
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,312
And here I was thinking 
I’d been pretty slick about it.

317
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,105
Oh! I get it now!

318
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,315
[Killua laughs]

319
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,483
You sure know how to piss me off, old man.

320
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,943
Let’s go, Gon!

321
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,903
Nah, I think I’m gonna play 
a little longer.

322
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,904
[Killua] Huh?

323
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,365
Are you deaf? Didn’t you hear 
what I just said?

324
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,535
Look! It’s pointless! 
You’ll never get the ball from him!

325
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,829
S’okay. ‘Cause I don’t really care.

326
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,373
We’ve only used up half of the time limit.

327
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,876
I’m gonna see if I can get him 
to use his right hand

328
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,294
before the rest of it runs out.

329
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,298
I see…

330
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,592
Fine. I get it.

331
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,218
Well, good luck.

332
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,304
I’m going to bed.

333
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,392
Hey, Mr. Netero.

334
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,560
[Netero] Hmm?

335
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,979
Can you tell me 
how Killua did that thing he did?

336
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,274
You know, when he walked slow 
and then there were a bunch of him?

337
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,193
That was...

338
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:16,322
a technique used by those 
engaged in illegal activities.

339
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,033
You have no need at all to learn it.

340
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,827
As a matter of fact, 
you should never try to learn it.

341
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,788
But it’s pretty impressive, huh?

342
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,667
Hmm. It requires an incredible 
amount of training to master it.

343
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,795
Oh man, Killua really is something, 
isn’t he?

344
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,092
-Nice try. 
-[Gon chuckles nervously]

345
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,391
[Killua] Dammit. Now I’m in a bad mood.

346
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,769
Well, it is what it is.

347
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,562
[number 390] Hey, kid! Wait up!

348
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,565
[number 391] Yeah, where are your manners?

349
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,734
-[number 390] Hey! 
-[number 391] Come back here!

350
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,741
If I hadn’t stopped when I did,

351
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:04,662
I probably would’ve ended up killing 
the old man to get the ball.

352
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,126
[both grunt]

353
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,716
Ah. It looks like my little playmate 
is picking up the pace a bit.

354
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,469
Now!

355
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,346
He’s feinting for the ball,

356
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,265
but he’s really going for my stomach!

357
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,349
Huh?

358
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,602
That hurt!

359
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,940
One more!

360
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,903
[Netero] Oh. If he head-butts me 
in my stomach like that again,

361
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,530
he’ll shatter his skull!

362
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:44,368
But if I relax my muscles, 
he might actually lay me out.

363
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,870
Hmm...

364
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,080
Best to avoid that.

365
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,545
Ah... did that kill him?

366
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,134
[grinning]

367
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,220
Gotcha! You just used your right hand!

368
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,472
Huh?

369
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,475
I did…

370
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,395
I did it! Yeah!

371
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,646
[Gon laughing]

372
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,149
Yay!

373
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,363
[snoring]

374
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,537
[Netero] Hello, Captain?

375
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,624
Yes, it’s me. 
Is the flight going smoothly?

376
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,251
I really hate to ask you to do this…

377
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,297
Could you maybe slow the ship down? 
Just a little?

378
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,720
[narrator] Netero had proposed the game 
to kill time,

379
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,890
but as they played, 
he saw something in Gon.

380
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:53,479
The airship and all 42 
of the remaining applicants on board

381
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:57,274
are approaching the site 
of the Exam’s Third Phase.

382
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,863
[theme song playing]

383
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:25,988
[Gon] Next time:

384
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,698
“Decision x By x Majority Rule?”

385
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,075
-[Killua] Major, major-- 
-[Gon] Major trouble!

386
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,452
[Killua] Trouble maker!
