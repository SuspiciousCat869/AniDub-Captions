[indistinct murmuring]

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:09,218
We weren't able to find out 
what happened to Uvo,

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,638
but we did learn the chain user's name 
and what he looks like.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,098
Nothing on his abilities yet.

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,183
[Chrollo] Alright.

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,852
We'll be waiting in the lobby 
of the hotel.

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,397
Looks like they found out 
the chain user's identity.

9
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,817
-[both gasp] 
-That just leaves three more.

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,861
Let's go.

11
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,696
We should go too.

12
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:34,993
[Gon] What do we do?

13
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,621
There isn't any point 
in capturing Pakunoda now.

14
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,124
[Killua] If I were Kurapika, 
I would switch targets.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,878
If I wanted to crush the Troupe, 
I'd go after the leader.

16
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,215
Melody is listening in 
on the conversation,

17
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,217
so they should know where we're going.

18
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:59,142
It’s just a question of when he’ll attack. 
We all need to be on the same page.

19
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:04,565
We need to be precise. 
A second’s delay would be fatal.

INITIATIVE x AND x LAW

22
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,287
Let's wait right here.

23
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,250
[Killua] There are no opportunities 
to attack.

24
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,003
They'll be watching anyone 
who walks in the door.

25
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,382
I just hope Kurapika and Melody 
beat us here.

26

-[Leorio] Come on! 
-[gasps]

27

-[Leorio] Don't you know what time it is? 
-Hmm?

00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,098
Idiot! It's the Beitacle Hotel!

29
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,559
How many damn times 
do I have to repeat myself? Well?

30
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,061
[Gon] Leorio!

31
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,314
Hmm? What are you looking at, kid? Huh?

32
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,900
-Should I kill him? 
-Ignore him.

33
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,193
Look the other way.

34
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,613
What? You think this is a show? Scram!

35
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,824
Look. With failures like you 
working for me,

36
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,034
my future’s about to get real dark.

37
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,077
[gasps]

38
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,330
Listen. I’m gonna close my eyes, 
just this once.

39
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,166
-[gasps] 
-One more mistake and you're fired!

40
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,171
You better get over to the hotel 
by seven o’clock sharp. Do you hear me?

41
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,006
[both] It's a message!

42
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,216
[Killua] Seven sharp.

43
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,218
[Gon] We'll use darkness for cover.

44
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,220
[sighing]

45
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,224
I’ll dislocate my joints and get free.

46
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,854
I just need point-seven seconds to attack. 
I'll have plenty of time!

47
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,649
It'll take a few seconds for their eyes 
to adjust to the darkness

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,317
if the lights suddenly go out.

53
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,746
Everybody made it here.

54
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:11,126
Hey. What's this? 
You boys got caught again?

55
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,378
[chuckles] Okay, I get it.

56
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,506
You changed your minds 
and decided to join us, right?

57
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,800
Look, we didn't know anything 
about your bounty.

58
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,720
It was canceled, wasn't it? 
We just found out about it.

59
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,723
You were stalking us 
and you screwed up again, huh?

60
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,308
You kids never learn.

61
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,102
I guess this must be fate at work.

62
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,730
[Killua] Two more minutes.

63
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,441
Well, let's be friends, okay?

64
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,734
-Fat chance! 
-Huh?

65
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,153
We were only following you guys 
just to get the reward.

66
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,615
And to be perfectly honest, 
I don't even wanna look at you.

67
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:45,619
[Gon] Nice. Now we won't seem suspicious 
when we close our eyes.

68
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,370
Yeah, me neither.

69
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,165
[chuckles] What do you think, boss?

70
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:54,169
They've got guts, don't they? 
Their nerve reminds me of Uvo.

71
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,799
They’re just little kids. 
They don’t even know enough to be afraid.

72
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,676
Anyway, describe the chain user to us.

73
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,639
First things first. Why don’t you 
check them once again, Paku?

74
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,681
[both grunt softly]

75
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,100
Okay then. What should I ask?

76
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,813
Ask them, “what are you hiding?”

77
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,149
[Killua] Damn, that's a great question.

78
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,484
It's straight to the point,

79
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,778
and he can learn 
all kinds of information from it.

80
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,866
[radio DJ] Well folks, 
there's only one minute left

81
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,284
in this week's broadcast.

82
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,287
[Killua] One minute! We've gotta stall.

83
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,331
It's no use.

84
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,999
Your ability...

85
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,461
It lets you draw memories 
out of whoever you touch, doesn't it?

86
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,841
Well, we're not hiding anything. 
And even if-- [grunting]

87
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,969
I’ll find out soon enough, 
so just be quiet.

88
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,223
Even if we did know something, 
we'd hide it from you. It's not that hard.

89
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,432
We'll think about some--

90
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,977
Yeah. That’s what I thought.

91
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,271
[Pakunoda] You boys seem confused.

92
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,817
I extract the purest memories 
that are beneath your consciousness.

93
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,988
I’m not browsing through 
the surface thoughts you create.

94
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,159
My questions are specifically designed 
to stimulate your memory.

95
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,619
They’re brought to the surface

96
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,373
the same way a stone tossed 
into a pond stirs up sediment.

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,128
They’re original memories, 
clean and unprocessed.

98
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,589
And I simply scoop them up.

99
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,174
Deceiving me is impossible.

[grunting softly]

103
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,059

[Pakunoda grunting]

00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,370
[Machi] The kid on the right is loose? 
I can’t see!

111
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,456
So this was their plan?

112
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,959
Oh, no you don’t!

113

-[Gon yelling] 
-[Killua] Gon!

114
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,342
I’ll have to kill her to break the thread!

115
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,218
[gasps]

116
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,681
My hand! She trapped it with her muscles!

117
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,059
[Machi] You're mine.

118
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:19,022
Seems your bloodlust gave you away. 
The darkness can’t help you now.

119
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,148
[Gon] Killua!

[gasps]

121
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,904
Might as well give up.

122
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,241
What a pity.

123
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,328
Well, it was a good shot, 
I'll give you that.

124
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,374
It came from the entrance.

125
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,168
[Shizuku] That guy was working with them?

126
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,713
Forget him! All we need now 
are these two kids, right?

127
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,508
-Our eyes will adjust shortly. 
-You're right.

128
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,510
But wait, where did the boss go?

129
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,803
[thunder crashing]

130
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,559
[Nobunaga] The boss is gone.

131
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,398
Shizuku, hold this one.

132
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,691
[Shizuku] Sure.

133
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,109
Are you okay, Paku?

134
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,361
He broke my left hand and a molar.

135
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,239
[Machi] We underestimated them.

136
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,409
You’re not gonna believe this, 
but these kids--

137
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,410
[Nobunaga] Wait!

138
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,872
Pakunoda, it's for you.

139
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,167
DISCUSS THEIR MEMORIES AND I'LL KILL HIM.

140
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,006
[gasps]

141
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,967
Hey, what the hell is going on here?

142
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,095
[Pakunoda] We missed him 
because he was disguised as a clerk.

143
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,432
No. That can’t be right.

144
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,351
The Boss should have been able 
to evade a chain attack

145
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,353
from that distance without any trouble.

146
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,523
Except the abrupt plunge into darkness

147
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,693
must have delayed his reaction time 
by a split second.

148
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,030
This attack was planned 
to the last detail!

149
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:54,117
Either way, I was only able 
to learn a few key words,

150
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,037
like “blackout” and “seven o’clock sharp."

151
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,622
And another thing that bothers me...

152
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,459
If these kids knew the chain user 
all along,

153
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,254
then why didn’t my previous questioning 
trigger any memories?

154
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:11,092
He must have been hiding his powers 
not just from his enemies,

155
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,136
but from his friends, as well!

156
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,848
From that, we can surmise 
that he’s most likely intelligent,

157
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,270
quick on his feet, secretive, 
and above all, cold-blooded.

158
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,733
That tells me he probably isn’t bluffing.

159
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,487
He was prepared to sacrifice 
a few precious seconds

160
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,639
just to leave me this message.

161
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,493
Which means it's true. It has to be.

162
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,580
His ally has the ability 
to read human emotion

163
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,665
just by listening to heartbeats.

164
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,961
That ally is the reason he had time 
to leave this message behind.

165
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,383
If I talk, he'll almost certainly 
sacrifice his friends and kill the boss!

166
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:58,098
But if I don’t talk, then these kids 
will still be valuable as hostages.

167
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,892
-[Nobunaga] Paku... 
-We have a chance to rescue the boss.

168
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:01,893
-[Nobunaga] Paku. 
-But...

169
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,561
-[Nobunaga] Paku! 
-[gasps]

170
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,733
Don't say a word from here on out. 
Got it?

171
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,989
Machi. You just focus 
on your Nen threads. I’ll take this one.

172
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,450
[both] Kurapika did it!

173
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,994
Since he left us a message,

174
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,622
he’ll probably try 
to contact us again soon.

175
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,584
Until he does, these two are our hostages.

176
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,965
[Chrollo] I am the head of the spider 
and you are the legs.

177
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:36,553
Natural law dictates that the legs 
must follow wherever the head goes.

178
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:42,392
But this is just the chain of command. 
It doesn’t apply to my life or death.

179
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,020
If I happen to die, 
one of you can replace me.

180
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:50,150
And there may come a time when a leg 
has more importance than the head.

181
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,737
Make the right call. 
My orders are priority.

182
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,199
However, my life and my death are not.

183
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:05,039
So, what’s key is survival of the whole. 
Not the individual. Never forget that.

184
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,292
[Pakunoda] So what should we do now?

185
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:12,213
If I tell everyone that I learned 
the chain user’s powers and weaknesses,

186
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,925
we could then use that information 
to defeat him quite easily.

187
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,472
But if I do, 
that makes Chrollo’s death more likely.

188
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:26,477
I’m sure Uvo faced a similar choice 
when he died for the Spiders’ sake.

189
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,146
To die...

190
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,649
What did that fortune from the boss say?

191
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,652
Two choices...

192
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,363
Would speaking be considered a betrayal?

193
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,157
Or would lying?

194
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,452
What’s key is survival of the whole.

195
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,539
[Pakunoda] Right. I'm overthinking it.

196
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,666
[Machi] Paku...

197
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,711
I wouldn’t worry about this too much.

198
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,172
Until we know more, 
you should just keep quiet.

199
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,511
Just hurry up, Phinks! 
Somebody has captured the boss!

200
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:01,971
[Pakunoda] Boss...

201
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,182
We still need you.

202
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,601
Even if that means...

203
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,187
betraying the Spiders.

204
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,494
We'll be fine. 
A number of the enemy were injured.

205
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,996
So they’ll stay put until backup arrives.

206
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,333
-What are you looking at? 
-Nothing.

207
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,586
I just didn't expect the chain user 
to be a woman.

208
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,588
[Kurapika] Who said I was?

209
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,383
I thought you knew better 
than to trust appearances.

210
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,094
Regardless, you should watch what you say.

211
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,889
Since it may well be the last thing 
out of your mouth.

212
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,891
You aren’t going to kill me.

213
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,686
Not after you left 
your precious friends behind.

214
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,148
I may appear calm and composed 
but I will not ignore your threats!

215
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,859
[Leorio] Kurapika! That's enough.

216
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,613
[Chrollo] 
The girl's fortune failed to mention this.

217
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,492
Therefore, this event 
isn't significant enough to matter,

218
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,328
or else I am quite certain 
that it would have come up.

219
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,914
-[Kurapika] Bastard! 
-Kurapika!

220
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,875
[Leorio] If you kill him, 
I'll kick your ass, you hear me?

221
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,461
Should I explain further?

222
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,755
This situation is nothing.

223
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,883
It's no different 
than an afternoon coffee break.

224
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,386
In fact, it’s quite peaceful.

225
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,558
Kurapika, calm down!

226
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,728
Nothing has changed! 
We’re on equal footing now.

227
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,815
Equal? I’m afraid you’re quite 
mistaken in that regard.

228
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:41,529
Your assumption is completely wrong. 
I have no value as a hostage.

229
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,199
Shut up. If you insist on babbling--

230
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,409
[Melody] It's the truth!

231
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,704
Everything that he’s told us 
so far is sincere.

232
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,416
[Chrollo] There you have it. 
This is reality.

233
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,377
You’re the one who’s cornered.

234
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,129
What do you mean by that?

235
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,425
I mean his heartbeat is perfectly normal. 
He’s not shaken by any of this.

236
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,471
He’s not worried or scared, even of death.

237
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,931
He’s accepted his destiny.

238
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:13,019
I can hear that he walks with death 
every single day of his life.

239
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:17,273
How can he produce such a sound? 
Make it stop!

240
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,941
I can't take any more!

241
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,569
I don't want to listen 
to either one of you!

242
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,196
Oh, Melody...

243
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,742
He truly believes that he has 
no real value as a hostage whatsoever.

244
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,079
And yet the fact remains 
that he’s the leader.

245
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,457
[Kurapika] What are you?

246
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,126
What are you people?

247
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,588
The Spiders.

248
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,218
Okay, so what happened?

249
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,011
The lights went out.

250
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,430
The boss was captured in the confusion.

251
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,183
[Kortopi] 
Here's the message from the chain user.

252
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,560
[Feitan] Why didn't you go after him?

253
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,688
-Machi and Paku were injured. 
-[Feitan] So?

254
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,817
So, he has allies who happen 
to be pro Hunters.

255
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,068
So?

256
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,737
Come on! Read between the lines, 
damn it!

257
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,573
It proves that we can use 
these kids as hostages.

258
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,577
If we give chase and we let them escape, 
it's all over!

259
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,247
The chains Uvo couldn’t break out of

260
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,791
are probably the ones 
that captured the Boss.

261
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,876
He can’t escape on his own.

262
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,086
[Phinks] Probably?

263
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,838
I told you it was dark!

264
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,133
By the time our eyes adjusted, 
the boss had vanished.

265
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,844
And with these kids here, 
we weren’t in a position to move!

266
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:32,265
Fine, fine. But let’s not point fingers. 
For now, we just need a plan.

267
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,853
[Kurapika] Were you the leader 
of the Troupe five years ago?

268
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,690
When they mercilessly slaughtered 
the Kurta of the Scarlet Eyes?

269
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,484
Ugh! Answer me!

270
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,072
Are those the chains you killed Uvo with?

271
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,118
What were his last words?

272
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,578
I don't remember them.

273
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,123
That isn't true, is it? 
Am I right, Miss?

274
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,043
But I can relate. I feel the same.

275
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,130
I have nothing to say to you.

276
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,174
-[Leorio] He's trying to provoke you! 
-[Kurapika] Damn it!

277
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,259
-[Leorio] Don't fall for it! 
-[Kurapika] Damn it!

278
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,094
Damn it!

279
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,725
[Chrollo] That proves it.

280
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,769
I'm surprised.

281
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,190
The chain user has a weakness.

282
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,775
One that I can exploit.

283
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,113
[phone ringing]

284
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,698
It's from the boss' phone.

285
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,325
[all gasping]

286
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,868
[Phinks] Hello?

287
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,412
I have three demands.

288
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,206
[Phinks] You the chain user?

289
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,209
The general rule is that you will do 
as I tell you to.

290
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,629
If you don't obey, 
I'll kill your leader immediately.

291
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,049
First, do not come after us.

292
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,302
Second, do not harm the two hostages.

293
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,639
Third, put Pakunoda on the phone.

294
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,476
Can I ask you something first? 
It's about your second demand.

295
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,103
See, the hostages started putting up 
a bit of a fight

296
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,147
so we had to break a few bones.

297
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,233
[snickering]

298
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,276
-[Kurapika] Then we're done here. 
-[hangs up]

299
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,071
[hits redial]

300
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:11,781
[Kurapika] What?

301
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,408
Sorry, I was lying. 
Both of them are okay.

302
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,912
This is your last chance. 
Try to take it seriously.

303
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,539
Now put Pakunoda on the phone.

304
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,832
[Phinks grunting] Ow!

305
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,042
Yes, hello?

306
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,796
You're the only one allowed to hear 
what I have to say.

307
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,422
Move away from the others.

308
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,428
Did you make contact with Squala?

309
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,513
[Pakunoda] Yes.

310
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,515
[Kurapika] 
So, you're aware of Melody, then?

311
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,724
[Pakunoda] I am.

312
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:42,311
[Kurapika] Good, this won’t take long. 
Listen carefully.

313
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,939
I forbid all further communication 
with the others.

314
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,403
No talking, gestures, writing, 
signals or eye contact.

315
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,154
None of that is allowed.

316
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,866
Come to the place I designate 
and come alone.

317
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,288
If your heart rate changes 
in the slightest, I will kill the hostage.

318
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,455
Understood?

319
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,751
Hand off the phone. 
Anyone but the man from before.

320
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,462
[Nobunaga] Uh, hello?

321
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,881
[Kurapika] I'm going to meet 
with Pakunoda alone.

322
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,344
The rest of you return to your hideout. 
All ten Troupe members must be there.

323
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,264
If one is missing, I'll kill the hostage.

324
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,224
-Understand? 
-Yeah.

325
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,853
-[Kurapika] Put Pakunoda back on. 
-Take it.

326
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,316
[Kurapika] Come to Lingon Airport. 
You have until eight.

327
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,194
Remember, you’re to come completely alone.

328
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,574
[Chrollo] Don't hesitate, Pakunoda. 
Bring everyone.

329
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,827
He’s sure to put his friends 
before his mission.

330
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,329
Hey, Paku!

331
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,622
[Nobunaga] Wait!

332
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,001
Let Paku go there by herself. 
We’re gonna go back to the hideout.

333
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,961
Those were his orders.

334
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,671
Who cares about that?

335
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,883
He just said if we disobeyed, 
he was gonna kill the boss!

336
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,928
Are you an idiot? If that happens, 
we'll kill the chain user.

337
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,472
And that will be that.

338
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,891
It's what the boss would want us to do.

339
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,395
Your way of thinking is an insult 
to the Spiders, Nobunaga.

340
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,815
Let’s quit wasting time 
and follow Pakunoda.

341
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,442
It’s the only choice we have!

342
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:15,154
He does have a point. There’s no reason 
that we should let Paku go alone.

343
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,367
If we keep following his orders, 
the fortunes will come true.

344
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:24,789
Look, I’m with Nobunaga on this one. 
We should all follow his orders for now.

345
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,083
-[Kortopi] She's right. 
-For now?

346
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:31,253
How long's that gonna be? 
Until half our limbs are gone or what?

347
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,881
[scoffs] Hey, Shizuku, what do you think?

348
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,676
[Shizuku] Disagreements are settled 
with a coin toss.

349
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,053
[Phinks] 
A coin toss isn’t gonna cut it right now!

350
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,264
Hmm, I think I’ll have to side 
with Nobunaga.

351
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,809
'Cause I don’t want the boss 
to die right now.

352
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,310
Same goes for Pakunoda.

353
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,813
I'm sure she feels the same way.

354
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,441
I suppose that's why she left 
without saying a word.

355
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,903
I don't believe this. 
It’s like talking to a wall.

356
00:19:56,153 --> 00:20:00,449
If it was up to me, I’d kill you right now 
but Pakunoda comes first.

357
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,617
[Nobunaga] Wait!

358
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,710
I’m warning you, take one more step 
and I’ll cut you down.

359
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,964
Oh, yeah? I'd like to see you try it.

360
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,345
Troupe members are not allowed to fight.

361
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,639
[Phinks] Aren't you on Nobunaga's side?

362
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,226
That's what my heart tells me. 
But the rules are the rules.

363
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,645
You break the rules, 
you reject the spider.

364
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:34,191
We’d be rejecting the Boss, too. 
I don't wanna do either of those things.

365
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,652
-[phone ringing] 
-It's the chain-user.

366
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:40,030
Here. Let me take it. 
Yeah, this is--

367
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,407
[Kurapika] Put a hostage on the phone.

368
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,701
[Phinks] You little...

369
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,370
Here.

370
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,664
[Kurapika] Are all of them together?

371
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,416
[Killua] Right now, they are.

372
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,501
But they've been talking 
about going after Pakunoda...

373
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,338
You'd better watch your mouth, kid. 
Still there?

374
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,632
Be at your hideout in half an hour.

375
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,385
I’m sure you’ll be tempted 
to try something,

376
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,053
but then your boss will die.

377
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,097
I'll call again soon.

378
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,184
[Shizuku] Guess we can't follow Paku now.

379
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,393
[Phinks] Damn it!

380
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,607
[Franklin] The boss will die 
if all ten of us aren’t together?

381
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:19,987
And he’s using the hostages 
as messengers. That’s pretty smart.

382
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,866
[Hisoka] This is the perfect opportunity 
to fight the boss.

383
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,285
But if I leave, he'll die.

384
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,454
Well, there you have it.

385
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,915
I'll need some help.

386
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,837
[Illumi] Sure, alright. I’ve known you 
a little longer than Chrollo.

387
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,343
[narrator] 
Kurapika’s revenge has come to fruition.

388
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,472
And his confrontation with the Troupe 
has reached its final stage.

389
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,477
[theme music playing]

390
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,503
-[Gon] Coming up, Gon... 
-[Killua] And Killua's...

391
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,629
[both] Hunterpedia!

392
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,214
-I'm Gon! 
-I'm Killua!

393
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,674
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

394
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,260
Today, you're gonna meet Pakunoda! 
She's a Specialist

395
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,471
and she has the power to see memories 
whenever she touches people or things.

396
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,975
She also has the ability to conjure 
memories into bullets and shoot them.

397
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,476
[both] Memory Bomb!

398
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,983
[Gon] Next time: 
"Signal to Retreat."

399
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,235
[Killua cackling]

400
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,488
-[Gon] What are you doing, Killua? 
-[cackling continues]

401
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,823
[Gon] Maybe we should retreat.
