[Leorio] No good.

I've got nothing.

4
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:08,634
That two billion per Spider reward 
is pretty attractive, but…

5
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,136
finding them will be impossible.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,221
[Gon] Yeah…

7
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,181
Hey!

8
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,351
We could ask for concrete information 
on the website.

9
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,727
Maybe we could even ask

10
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,646
about the Phantom Troupe’s 
current location.

11
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,899
It might help, 
if we offered a really big reward.

12
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,108
We could, but...

13
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,528
we don’t have nearly 
enough money for that.

14
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,112
[Gon] Not a problem.

00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,622
of the elusive Phantom Troupe

20
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,834
and have now obtained the funds 
to buy the information they need.

21
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,046
[Leorio] That’s crazy!

22
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,048
You actually have the money!

23
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,093
Idiot. I can’t believe you actually pawned 
your Hunter’s License.

24
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,970
You’re insane, you know that?

25
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,389
So, what do you think we should do first?

26
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,769
To start with we should buy ourselves 
a Southernbees catalog.

27
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,860
Here is this year’s official 
Southernbees auction catalog, gentlemen.

28
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,487
[Gon] Thank you!

29
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,161
Got it! Greed Island’s right here!

30
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,247
[Leorio] Seven total units on sale…

31
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,958
Wow. Minimum starting bid is...

32
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,585
8.9 billion.

33
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,046
No change there.

34
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,302
Now we just have to wait 
for the information to start rollin’ in.

35
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,430
So first, we’ll catch one of the Spiders

36
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,515
and after that,

37
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,683
all we have to do

38
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,268
is make ‘em tell us 
where the rest of ‘em are hiding. Easy!

39
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,353
What the--?

40
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,897
What’s wrong? Gon?

41
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,400
This thing is…

42
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,403
Look at that! 
You found a Ben’s knife, huh?

43
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,821
Wait, what’s a Ben’s knife?

44
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,616
It’s a knife that a mass murderer 
designed about a hundred years ago.

45
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,035
The guy was also a famous blacksmith.

46
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,496
This looks like one of his original works.

47
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,583
It’s a lesser known piece 
a lot of rabid collectors are after.

48
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,043
Good eye, Gon!

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,629
I didn’t have any idea what it was.

50
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,672
[Killua and Leorio] Huh?

51
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,924
It just caught my attention is all.

52
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,259
I guess I got curious,

53
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,052
so I used Gyo on it.

54
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,763
And that’s when I noticed a faint aura.

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,889
What’s Gyo?

56
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,683
Gyo’s a form of Nen.

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,019
It’s basically when you look really, 
really closely at something.

00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,442
Here, let me see that.

[focusing grunt]

62
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,029
[Leorio] Nope. I don’t see a thing.

63
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,741
You will once you get 
more training in Ren.

64
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,368
Oh, yeah! There’s another way to do it!

65
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,536
Do what?

66
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,871
Another way we can make money.

67
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,790
Don’t you remember 
what Four Eyes said to us?

68
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,792
When we were at Heavens Arena?

69
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:15,714
He said some really talented people 
can use Nen without even knowing!

70
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,924
Who the hell is Four Eyes?

71
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:19,926
[Killua] Wing.

72
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,762
He’s the one who taught us Nen.

73
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,638
So, this knife had aura.

74
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,057
I say we search 
for other things that do, too.

75
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,895
Find one and it’s a good bet 
that it was made by a real master!

76
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,188
I get it!

77
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,689
So, we can find hidden gems

78
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,108
but without having 
to go through a bunch of training

79
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,526
to be professional appraisers!

80
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,155
And then we just auction off 
what we find at a higher price!

81
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,698
If you want it,

82
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,075
all you gotta do is write your price down.

83
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,121
You mean, customers get to name 
their own prices?

84
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,166
[hawker] Yeah. 
That’s the way this market works.

85
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,794
You write down whatever it is 
you’re willing to pay,

86
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,629
and when the time expires,

87
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,257
the item goes to whoever 
had the highest bid.

88
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,803
See, this here is a really popular item.

89
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,681
Just look how the price 
shot up near the end.

90
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,017
I get it now.

91
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,857
Well? Let’s get started!

92
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,735
Sounds good. 
I’ll check out the online forums.

93
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:19,903
[Gon] Hm.

94
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,533
[Gon] Hmm...

95
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,202
This vase is pretty weird

96
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,162
but I’m picking up aura from it.

97
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,040
There’s a bid!

98
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,751
If there’s already a bid,

99
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,462
then you should enter one 
that’s two and a half times higher.

100
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,798
You might end up bidding too high

101
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,592
but at least that way 
you’ll scare off any rivals.

102
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,346
[Gon] Five hundred times two and a half…

103
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,682
Let me see...

104
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,225
Uh!

105
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,649
It’s the same person!

106
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,318
Same there?

107
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,696
Yeah, I found a couple of items

108
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,740
but both of them had bids 
placed by “Zepile” already.

109
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,451
I bid two and a half times higher

110
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,162
but as soon as I did, he quadrupled it.

111
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,123
Then it’s not a coincidence.

112
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,541
No.

113
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,750
[Gon] What now?

114
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,335
We need to keep placing bids,

115
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,087
all the way up to the deadline.

116
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,922
There are two of us,

117
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,216
so I’m sure we’re bound to win something.

118
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,342
Yeah, okay.

119
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,808
In the end we won three and lost one.

120
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,686
Yeah. They got that weird vase 
at the last minute.

121
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,355
{Killua] Not too bad, 
all things considered.

122
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,233
Come on, let’s take ‘em 
to the auction house now.

123
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,655
Oh, I’m terribly sorry…

124
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,825
but the auction house 
simply can’t accept any additional items

125
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,744
once the catalog has been published.

126
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,287
You’re too late, I’m afraid.

127
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,330
Uh...

128
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,873
Can you make an exception?

129
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,918
See, we really had our hearts 
set on auctioning off these items!

130
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,711
Hmm...

131
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,963
Perhaps you might be interested

132
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,924
in trying your luck over 
at the dealer’s market.

133
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,842
[both] The Dealer’s market?

134
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,471
[Gon] So this is it.

135
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,097
The pros will be here,

136
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,059
so if any of these are genuine 
we should get a great price.

137
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,395
Yeah, I know, but I really wanted 
to sell these at the auction.

138
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,314
How much do you think we’re gonna get?

139
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,733
There’s only one way to find out!

140
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,448
Oh… You say you found these 
in your storehouse?

141
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,659
Yeah! And my dad said 
that we should sell ‘em

142
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,369
if the price was good enough.

143
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,080
These are excellent pieces.

144
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,207
Only fifty copies were printed,

145
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,168
and yours has a single-digit 
serial number,

146
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,462
not to mention an authentic autograph.

147
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,422
{Killua] Yeah, we know.

148
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,633
[Gon] That’s where the aura 
was coming from.

149
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,594
[shop owner] 
It’s worth at least 150,000.

150
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,599
And look at this antique doll!

151
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,351
It’s in great shape.

152
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,771
Both the doll and box are pristine, 
which raises the value.

153
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,148
Three hundred thousand I’d guess.

154
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,858
But…

155
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,779
I’m sorry to say this one 
isn’t worth nearly as much.

156
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,155
[both] Oh...

157
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,866
[shop owner] The box and statue 
are from different periods.

158
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,494
The box was made recently.

159
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:18,415
The statue is roughly carved 
and doesn’t adhere to any theme.

160
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,376
I’d say it’s only worth 1,500 Jenny.

161
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,255
[Gon] But there’s a little aura 
coming from it…

162
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,633
Now don’t worry. 
That’s just the price as an artwork.

163
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,095
But the wood it’s made of 
is actually quite valuable.

164
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,388
[Gon and Killua] Huh?

165
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,391
I would be more than happy 
to make you an offer on it.

166
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,978
Sell me the painting and doll 
for 420,000

167
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,897
and I’ll throw in another 80,000 
for the wood.

168
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,941
So, 500,000 total?

169
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,401
What do you think?

170
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,653
There’s no rush. 
Take your time.

171
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,489
But I doubt you’re going 
to find a better offer

172
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,907
from anyone else around here.

173
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,325
In the meantime,

174
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,912
let me analyze this and find out 
the exact age of the wood.

175
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,372
[man 1] Stop right there!

176
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,876
Put that statue down, now.

177
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,669
I’m sorry, but who are you?

178
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,839
Watch out. This guy is a scammer.

179
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,133
That’s a fair price 
for the doll and painting

180
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,635
but he’s lying to your face 
about the statue!

181
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,472
I-- I’m not lying; I swear I’m not!

182
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,348
You sure about that?

183
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,477
Because no collector 
would pay 80,000 for that wood!

184
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,187
All you’re interested in

185
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,814
is the contents of that statue!

186
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,117
That’s actually a wooden vault.

187
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,744
[Gon and Killua] 
Wait, are you serious?

188
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,662
Three hundred years ago,

189
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,333
secret vaults like this were a popular way 
for the wealthy to evade taxes.

190
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,959
[Gon] I didn’t know that.

191
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,087
[man] If it’s the real deal,

192
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,006
then there should be 
some sort of valuable stuffed inside.

193
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,801
You planned on stealing its contents

194
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,303
while you were just pretending 
to analyze its age!

195
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,639
No! No, I would never do that!

196
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:58,973
[man 2] Hold on!

197
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,561
Do you have any proof at all 
that that thing’s a genuine wooden vault?

198
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,854
[man 1] What was that?

199
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,817
It’s fairly obvious that the wood 
is over 300 years old.

200
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,654
But all that tells us 
is the age of the raw material.

201
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,989
It could have been carved recently.

202
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,494
That’s a doctoring method 
called a “facelift”, boys.

203
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,954
A doctoring method?

204
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,166
He means when a counterfeiter 
tries to trick a professional appraiser.

205
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,793
But that isn’t what I’m doing.

206
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,839
An amateur would never recognize 
this seam here.

207
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,383
A seam which contains a type of glue

208
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,010
that was commonly used 
in that time period.

209
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,639
You’re insisting this 
is a real wooden vault, are you?

210
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,723
[man 1] Yeah.

211
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,519
But it’s possible that it’s been opened,

212
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,981
the contents swapped out 
and then the statue was reassembled…

213
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,483
something we call a “transplant”.

214
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,153
When a counterfeiter 
performs a transplant,

215
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,197
they put a new coat of glue 
on top of the old one,

216
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,241
creating a secondary seal.

217
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,744
But only a rank amateur 
would even think of trying that.

218
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,749
A pro would melt the glue with a flame, 
then reseal it.

219
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,086
That would make it look like 
the statue had never been opened.

220
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,547
It’s known as “cauterization”.

221
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,633
[man 1] It’s not cauterized!

222
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,803
If someone had used a flame, 
the wood would be scorched,

223
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,264
or at the very least 
the glue would be discolored.

224
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,601
Even pros would have a hard time 
spotting those details.

225
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,728
Doesn’t prove anything.

226
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,189
I am a pro appraiser!

227
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,773
I swear by my eyes

228
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,443
this is a real wooden vault!

229
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,612
It has never been opened

230
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,823
and the treasure that’s inside 
has never been swapped out!

231
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,868
Okay.

232
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,620
Just for the sake of argument,

233
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,872
let’s say it is a genuine wooden vault.

234
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,416
If the contents have been swapped out,

235
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,001
what’ll you do?

236
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,212
What are you willing to bet?

237
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,887
If you’re right, I’ll be your lackey 
for the rest of my life.

238
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,057
[smirks]

239
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,893
Give it up.

240
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,234
[smirks]

241
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,819
[both] Oh!

242
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,493
[Gon and Killua] Whoa! Awesome!

243
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,373
[Killua] Oh… So, you’re Zepile.

244
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,541
Thanks a lot, Mister Zepile!

245
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,794
Oh, there’s no need to thank me.

246
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,796
It’s just a matter of give and take.

247
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,172
Say twenty per cent?

248
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,215
[both] Huh?

249
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,634
[Zepile] My cut of the profit 
when you sell the treasure.

250
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,512
What?! Are you trying to rip us off, 
old man?

251
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,514
Now that was uncalled for.

252
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,267
Look I’ve got to charge something 
for advising you.

253
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,810
It’s okay.

254
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,979
He did help us out back there, after all.

255
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,272
Gimme a break, man!

256
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,067
We need to collect 
as much Jenny as possible, remember?

257
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,736
We can maybe buy him lunch.

258
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,029
[Zepile] Oh, yeah?

259
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,531
Sure, works for me.

260
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,032
[both] Huh?

261
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,038
[Gon] So, Mister Zepile…

262
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,164
Hm?

263
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,625
I feel kinda bad, 
so we will pay you a commission.

264
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,419
Dude! You’re such a pushover!

265
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,130
Nah. Really, it’s perfectly okay.

266
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,132
Just tell me one thing and we’ll be even.

267
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,759
What was it that made you guys 
bid on all these items?

268
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:22,969
Something tipped you off.

269
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,723
Well? Should we tell him the truth?

270
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,183
Sure. It beats paying him, anyway.

271
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,687
[Zepile] Ah. Nen Aura, huh?

272
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,189
Well, if you’re being honest,

273
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,900
that does explain 
why you purchased that statue.

274
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,571
It was pretty obvious you had no idea 
something was hidden inside.

275
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,700
So why do you two need money so badly?

276
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,119
[Killua] We can tell you, 
but not for free.

277
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,955
You’ve got to answer 
one of our questions, too.

278
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,957
Great. You start.

279
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,834
At the auction

280
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,794
there’s an item we want to buy.

281
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,338
So, we need money.

282
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,798
Oh. Which item is it?

283
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,258
[Killua] It’s our turn now.

284
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,677
Three hundred million Jenny.

285
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,347
That’s how much 
you estimated this treasure’s worth.

286
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,723
So, do you think

287
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,100
that’s how much we could get 
for it at the dealer’s market?

288
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,810
At the dealer’s market?

289
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,147
I don’t really know; 
they deal mainly in hard cash.

290
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,066
So, if you show up early on,

291
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,360
it’s unlikely that you’ll get 
a fair price for it.

292
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,487
-What?! 
-Seriously?

293
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,572
[Zepile] Now it’s my turn.

294
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,948
I'll repeat the question.

295
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,368
Which item are you looking to bid on?

296
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,120
It’s a video game called Greed Island.

297
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,123
Ah! You mean the one 
that’s super expensive?

298
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,876
I’m real curious 
about that weird vase you bought.

299
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,586
How much do you think that it’s worth?

300
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,671
What? This thing?

301
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,091
It’s just a piece of junk.

302
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,509
Totally worthless.

303
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,888
I don’t get why you’d want 
such an expensive game.

304
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,015
Doesn’t it cost like six billion Jenny?

305
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,767
[Killua] Starts at eight point nine.

306
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,561
Thing is we’re trying 
to find Gon’s father.

307
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,773
We need to buy the game 
because it has a clue inside.

308
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,316
Oh…

309
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,402
[Killua] So why did you pick that vase?

310
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,280
Well, you knew that wooden vault 
was the real thing, didn’t you?

311
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,574
So, you could’ve bid on that. 
But you didn’t.

312
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,993
You bid on that weird vase instead.

313
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,286
Why?

314
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,915
Well, you see…

315
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,418
I sort of made this vase myself.

316
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,669
[both] Huh?

317
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,380
“Sort of” because it isn’t 
my original work.

318
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,506
[Gon and Killua] Huh?

319
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,966
This is a knock-off.

320
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,676
In other words, it’s counterfeit.

321
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,511
When I was poor,

322
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,264
this was how I made my Jenny. Until…

323
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,851
I became an appraiser 
and started earning money.

324
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,228
As soon as that happened, 
I quit all of that.

325
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,606
But when I see 
how poorly made these things are...

326
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,692
Oh boy, it’s really embarrassing.

327
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,195
I swore I’d buy them back

328
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,156
whenever I saw them at the market.

329
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,492
Any clue what a real one would cost?

330
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,743
[Zepile] My turn.

331
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,496
What does your dad do for a living?

332
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,790
He’s... a professional Hunter.

333
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,209
I asked how much a real one would cost!

334
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,503
-Forty, fifty K. 
-[Killua grumbles]

335
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,047
Is that so? A pro Hunter, huh?

336
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,468
There are a couple of them 
in the antiques community

337
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,846
and not one of 'em 
is someone you would describe as ‘normal’.

338
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,641
Won’t it be impossible 
for you to find him on your own?

339
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,851
We’ll be fine.

340
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,728
See, I’m a pro Hunter myself.

341
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,480
Wait-- really?!

342
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,484
‘Kay. It’s your turn 
to ask us a question now.

343
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:25,985
Hmm...

344
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,779
Right. This one’ll be my final question.

345
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,742
Is there anything at all 
I can help you with?

346
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,910
[both] Huh?

347
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,120
[Zepile] If you want to make money 
at an auction,

348
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,498
you’ll need someone 
with appraisal experience.

349
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,834
You could say that teaming up 
with the right appraiser

350
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,504
can guarantee you a profit every time.

351
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,007
You choose how much you want to pay me. 
Whatever you think’s fair.

352
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,675
How’s that?

353
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,262
Fine. Then you have to answer 
our last question.

354
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,389
What made you want to help us out?

355
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,891
What’s in it for you?

356
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,270
[wry chuckle]

357
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,023
-It just made me happy. 
-[Gon and Killua] Huh?

358
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,109
Felt nice that someone 
was bidding on my work,

359
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,612
even if it is just 
a worthless piece of junk.

360
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,531
It is not a piece of junk!

361
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,783
That vase you made,

362
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,285
it’s overflowing with your Nen, 
Mister Zepile!

363
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,497
Aura’s common and anybody can produce it

364
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,251
but it’s incredibly difficult to control. 
Like, really hard!

365
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,046
You have to concentrate 
and train for a really long time.

366
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,508
Anybody can see how much effort 
you put into making that vase.

367
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,134
I know I sure can!

368
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,679
This kind of work takes talent!

369
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,683
And I’m sorry 
for saying it was weird earlier.

370
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,311
[sighs]

371
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,689
I can trust my eyes; 
they’ve never fooled me.

372
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,109
When you appraise things long enough,

373
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,611
you can’t help but become 
a good judge of character.

374
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,115
I look at the sellers and the buyers,

375
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,575
not just the goods.

376
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,787
If there’s one thing I’ve learned 
after all this time appraising antiques,

377
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,707
it’s that it’s a lot harder 
to appraise people.

378
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,917
And when I saw you,

379
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,461
the appraiser in me knew right away…

380
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,798
that I really wanted 
to work with you. Truly.

381
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,092
So that’s my answer.

382
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,427
What's yours?

383
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,723
We’re looking forward to it.

384
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,475
We’ll decide on your fee 
once we see what you can do.

385
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:22,977
[excited chuckle]

386
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,354
Great! Now that we’ve got that settled…

387
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,106
-First things first… 
-Huh?

388
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,110
Can you teach me the doctoring methods 
you talked about in the store earlier?

389
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,988
-You really want to know? 
-[Gon] Yep!

390
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,617
Cauterizing and transplant and facelift.

391
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,535
Is that it or are there others?

392
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,911
You know something?

393
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,663
None of that crap matters!

394
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,374
[Gon] But they sound fun! 
Kinda like magic tricks!

395
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,585
[Killua] Yeah, well, 
we’re not here to have fun!

396
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,880
I think I get it now…

397
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,424
why this kid intrigued me.

398
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,012
He’s not concerned with 
whether something is ‘good’ or ‘bad’.

399
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,307
When I came clean 
about making counterfeits,

400
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,311
or when the men in the store 
were talking about the vault…

401
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,774
I didn’t see a hint of disapproval 
or greed on his face.

402
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,941
Not one.

403
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,819
But what I did see...

404
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,113
was pure curiosity!

405
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,866
If something impresses him,

406
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,494
he doesn’t start judging 
whether it’s good or bad...

407
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,373
which means he’s walking a fine line.

408
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,501
He’s that rare kind of person

409
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,087
who can never truly be appraised.

410
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,008
Cauterization:

411
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,136
Definitely the hardest 
doctoring method to detect.

412
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,556
But not too long ago

413
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,642
a new method surfaced.

414
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,477
It’s called an “autopsy”.

415
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,065
That’s when you plainly 
reveal the opened statue

416
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,109
along with a fake treasure.

417
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,945
It’s based on most people’s assumption

418
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,031
that you wouldn’t open the statue 
if the treasure were fake

419
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,117
and that makes them easy to fool.

420
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,079
But this method 
is starting to get old now.

421
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,248
People were getting suspicious,

422
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,667
so of course 
a new doctoring method emerged.

423
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,837
Think you can guess? Give it a try.

424
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,171
Oh, I know!

425
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,297
The statue’s fake

426
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,091
and the treasure inside of it 
it’s fake, too!

427
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,259
[Zepile] Wrong!

428
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,802
-Oh... 
-Wait. I got it!

429
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,221
You take the treasure out 
from a different opening!

430
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,681
Bingo!

431
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,936
You start by creating a new opening 
and removing the treasure.

432
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:33,691
Then, you just insert the fake treasure 
and carefully seal the hole back up again.

433
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,776
That’s known as an “ostomy”.

434
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,695
An “ostomy”.

435
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,031
Many veteran appraisers 
have been deceived by it.

436
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,994
If there are no signs 
that the adhesive was discolored by fire,

437
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,620
they assume that it’s real.

438
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,708
And that, gentlemen, 
is how you fool the pros.

439
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,794
Ah! What an awesome world!

440
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,379
[phone ringing]

441
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,339
Uh, hello?

442
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,925
A Spider?

443
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,219
[Leorio] Yeah. It looks real.

444
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,638
And there’s a video attached to it.

445
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,724
We’ve got two targets.

446
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,017
A man and a woman.

447
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,060
I’ll head out right now,

448
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,479
so meet me there.

449
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,521
[Gon] Got it.

450
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,232
-Come on. Let’s go! 
-Okay.

451
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,527
Hey! Wait a second! 
What about the auction!

452
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,946
You can handle it!

453
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,782
Yeah, just try to get us a good price!

454
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,033
Huh?!

455
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,039
All right! You can count on me!

456
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,088
[narrator] Gon and Killua 
have had their eyes opened

457
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,549
to a brand-new world.

458
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,177
And they are about to make contact

459
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,554
with the Phantom Troupe.

460
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,810
[theme song playing]

461
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,209
[Gon] Coming up:

462
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,669
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

463
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,045
[both] Hunterpedia!

464
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,755
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

465
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,382
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

466
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,842
Today we’ll introduce Shizuku.

467
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,636
Phantom Troupe member 
with a vacuum cleaner named Blinky.

468
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,263
But it can suck up the living!

469
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,431
And its capacity is huge!

470
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,558
Where do you go 
if you get sucked up in it?

471
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:13,767
Nobody knows!

472
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,732
[Gon] Next time: 
“Pursuit x and x Analysis.”

473
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,859
-Right or left? 
-[Killua] Right.

474
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,570
-[Gon] Do we follow the man or the woman? 
-[Killua] The woman.

475
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,495
-[Gon] What’s better, red or blue? 
-[Killua] You pick!
