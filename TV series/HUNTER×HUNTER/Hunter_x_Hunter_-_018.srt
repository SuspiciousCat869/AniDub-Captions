Vast riches.

Hidden treasures.

Evil haunts.

Uncharted frontiers.

00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,230
The mysterious unknown.

00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,984
The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words…

10
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:27,861
are called…

00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,366
Hunters.

BIG x TIME x INTERVIEW

18
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,970
[narrator] Gon and his group 
have been trapped by vipers,

19
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,722
which now block their exit.

20
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,183
But the vipers’ master, Bourbon...

21
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,768
is dead.

22
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,481
Are you telling us that the person 
who set this trap is now dead?

23
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,732
But how?

24
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,734
Well, I killed him.

25
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,237
But my methods are a trade secret.

26
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,532
Hey, Gon. Take Leorio.

27
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,589
[gasp]

28
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,928
[Ponzu] It’s no use.

29
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,682
I’m sorry, 
but you won’t be able to search him.

30
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,017
The snakes are trained.

31
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,936
And if you even try to touch him

32
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,855
or you try to leave the cave and escape,

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,274
every single one of them will attack you.

34
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,073
[Kurapika] 
So, you fought poison with poison.

35
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,285
Judging by his wounds, 
you must have used Neurotoxic Bees.

36
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,497
So, it’s likely that he died 
of anaphylactic shock.

37
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,165
“Anaphylactic”?

38
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,250
What is that?

39
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,378
When a bee stings a human,

40
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,338
certain antibodies are produced

41
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,007
in an attempt to counter the effects 
of the bee’s venom.

42
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,553
But if that person is stung again

43
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,929
by the same kind of bee,

44
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,557
they will experience an allergic reaction.

45
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,270
An extreme allergic reaction 
is known as anaphylactic shock.

46
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,731
Depending on the circumstances,

47
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:51,732
it can be fatal.

48
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,067
That’s what happened. You got me.

49
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,319
So, you killed him with bees?

50
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,323
Bourbon was who I drew as my target.

51
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,418
Once I’d confirmed he was inside the cave,

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,087
I sprayed sleeping gas into the entrance

53
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,424
then waited until it was safe to go in.

54
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,105
When I found him,

55
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,274
Bourbon was completely passed out.

56
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,777
But he had already set up his traps.

57
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,446
[Ponzu screaming]

58
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,990
And unfortunately for me,

59
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,160
there were snakes in the back of the cave, 
hiding in crevices.

60
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,954
I guess the sleeping gas 
didn’t reach them.

61
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,917
I was able to jump out of the way 
just in the nick of time,

62
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,252
so I didn’t get bitten by them 
or anything.

63
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,923
But that’s what triggered my own defenses 
to activate.

64
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,761
[gasps]

65
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,262
That’s where you keep all your bees?

66
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,305
[buzzing]

67
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,183
If I scream, collapse, 
or anything like that,

68
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,019
these little guys 
will attack anyone nearby.

69
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,981
I wasn’t expecting him to die, though.

70
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,026
How could I have known 
he was allergic to bees?

71
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,196
And the snakes kept me from helping him.

72
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,449
Well not like I could’ve done anything.

73
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,035
You can come back now.

74
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,125
The problem is the person 
who set the trap in the first place

75
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,295
died without ever having the chance 
to deactivate it.

76
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,800
And we can’t exactly disarm it 
or ask him for help.

77
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,761
We’re trapped with no hope for escape.

78
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,388
[Leorio groans]

79
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,806
Leorio.

80
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,558
[sighs]

81
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,726
So, it’s hopeless. I gave up.

82
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,146
We’re stuck until the Exam Committee 
comes and saves us.

83
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,898
The Exam Committee?

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,818
Are you saying they’ll rescue us 
from this cave?

85
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,945
You didn’t know?

86
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,448
Each of our number badges 
contain transmitters.

87
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,202
The Examiners know where all 
the applicants are located at all times,

88
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,496
and if someone hasn’t returned 
by the deadline,

89
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,081
they go out and look for them.

90
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:17,377
However, if it’s lost or stolen, 
then you’re on your own.

91
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,589
Luckily, there’s only one more day left.

92
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,633
Best to just give up for this year 
and wait for help.

93
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,218
We can’t do that.

94
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,805
Leorio’s condition is worsening.

95
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,724
He needs to get to a doctor.

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,477
The Examiners aren’t going to budge 
‘til it’s past the deadline.

97
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,647
If you don’t have your badge, 
you’ll be left for dead.

98
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,067
This is his fault, really.

99
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,736
I tried to warn him.

100
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,615
Kurapika! Gon! Don’t come in here!!

101
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,201
[screaming]

102
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,787
All you can do for him

103
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,999
is pray that he can manage to hang on 
until help can arrive.

104
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,292
No.

105
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,835
There’s another way.

106
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,129
One with a good chance of success.

107
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,381
But if he isn’t carrying any,

108
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,092
we’ll have another fatality on our hands.

109
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,011
[Gon] Kurapika.

110
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,514
-Take care of Leorio. 
-But Gon...

111
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,391
It’s there. Don’t worry.

112
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,851
Gon…

113
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,979
Gon! Hey!

114
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,024
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

115
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,610
Didn’t you hear a word I just said?

116
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,694

Oh, no!

121

He-- he’s out of his mind!

122
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,755
[straining]

123
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,926
[Gon] Found it!

124
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,177
[both gasp]

125
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,512
[Gon] Kurapika! Catch!

126
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:53,932
Gon!

127
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,401
Hurry! Give it... to Leorio!

128
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,539
There. You ready, Gon?

129
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,623
Yeah…

130
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,750
I don’t believe it.

131
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,754
He jumped into a nest of snakes 
looking for an antidote

132
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,631
he wasn’t sure was there!

133
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,300
[Kurapika] 
True, but the odds were in his favor.

134
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,761
If you poison someone,

135
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,390
you can’t bargain 
unless you have the antidote.

136
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,976
Yeah, but it was still pretty risky.

137
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,728
[Kurapika] That said...

138
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,604
doing what Gon just did

139
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,982
took an incredible amount of courage.

140
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,153
He’s stabilizing.

141
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,572
He should be all right.

142
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,699
You must be really good friends.

143
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,538
Hey! Do you have 
any of your sleeping gas left over?

144
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,331
I do.

145
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,208
Will you trade it for this?

146
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,170
That’s Bourbon’s badge!

147
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,588
And if you had it,

148
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,590
it would give you the six points you need.

149
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,383
Yeah. That’s right.

150
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,094
But, uh… What are you planning 
to do with it?

151
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,471
The sleeping gas?

152
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,555
Use it!

153
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,266
We’ll put all the snakes to sleep, 
then we can escape.

154
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,726
Releasing it in here

155
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:23,021
would be much more effective 
than when I used it at the entrance.

156
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,399
Within five minutes, 
the cave will fill with gas,

157
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,401
knocking all the snakes out cold.

158
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,695
That’s five whole minutes!

159
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,406
Which is way longer 
than anyone can hold their breath!

160
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,158
I mean, what’s the point in trying

161
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,827
if we’re all just going 
to put ourselves to sleep in the process?

162
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,496
Nine minutes and 44 seconds.

163
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,538
What?

164
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,624
My record for holding my breath.

165
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,335
You can count on me.

166
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,711
I’ll carry you out of here.

167
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,339
Why should I trust you?

168
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,050
You’re just gonna leave me here 
and escape by yourself.

169
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,510
You believe that?

170
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,011
You saw what he did.

171
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,055
Gon braved a nest of venomous snakes

172
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,264
to save Leorio.

173
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,266
[Gon] Trust me.

174
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,311
I’ll get you out.

175
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,646
I promise I will.

176
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,532
It’s ready to go.

177
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,451
[Gon] Wait for my signal, 
then release the gas.

178
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:19,828
Ready and waiting.

179
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,205
[exhales]

180
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,624
[takes a deep inhale and holds breath]

00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,426
[inhales and passes out]

183
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,887
[Gon] 199.

184
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,013
200.

185
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,473
201.

186
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,766
202.

187
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,101
203.

188
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,435
204.

189
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,020
205. [Gon's voice fading out]

190
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,063
206.

191
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,106
207.

192
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,119
[big exhale]

193
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,872
[Gon] All right!

194
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,508
Well I’ll leave Bourbon’s badge 
here with you.

195
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,510
So, the Committee can find you.

196
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,974
Yours goes to Leorio.

197
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,727
That way, he’ll have his six points 
and he can pass.

198
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,897
Consider it a small fee for saving you.

199
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,231
Sorry about that!

200
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,740
[Khara] Phase Four of the Hunter Exam 
is now officially over!

201
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,992
All remaining applicants,

202
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,494
please return to the starting point 
at once!

203
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:48,208
You will be given one additional hour 
to make your way back.

204
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,753
If you still haven’t returned 
by the time that hour is up,

205
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,630
you will fail the Exam.

206
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,801
Furthermore, exchanging badges 
at the starting point is prohibited.

207
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,848
Any attempt to do so 
will result in immediate disqualification.

HUNTER GLOSSARY

209
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:15,443
PONZU

210
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,950
[trumpets playing fanfare]

211
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,912
Now we will check the badges 
of everyone present here.

212
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,249
Number 44, Mr. Hisoka.

213
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,502
Number 58, Mr. Pokkle.

214
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,255
Number 99, Mr. Killua.

215
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,091
Number 301, Mr. Gittarackur.

216
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,427
Number 191, Mr. Bodoro.

217
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,889
Number 294, Mr. Hanzo.

218
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,393
So only six applicants have passed?

219
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,352
Oh, wait!

220
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,771
Hm?

221
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:55,900
Gon!

222
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,068
Three more!

223
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,320
You’re certainly cutting it close, 
aren’t you?

224
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,822
Killua.

225
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,786
[smirks]

226
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,124
Now the last three!

227
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,333
They are…

228
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,211
Number 404, Mr. Kurapika.

229
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,506
Number 403, Mr. Leorio.

230
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,593
And Number 405, Mr. Gon.

231
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:28,933
So, these nine applicants have passed 
the Fourth Phase of the Exam!

232
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,520
[Netero laughing]

233
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,898
Six of the nine that have passed 
are rookies?

234
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,608
Marvelous, marvelous!

235
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,069
Has that ever happened before?

236
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,906
Ah. Well, there has been a trend lately.

237
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,159
We’ll sometimes 
go several years in a row

238
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,536
without a single rookie 
worthy of qualifying.

239
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:53,041
And then we’ll suddenly have 
a whole bunch of promising newbies apply.

240
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,045
This makes four times 
since I became Chairman.

241
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,213
By the way, sir,

242
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,632
what will we be doing for the Final Phase?

243
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,551
Oh yeah, that’s right!

244
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,887
You haven’t told us 
what you have planned yet!

245
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,139
Ah, yes. Well, about that…

246
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,893
They’ll be participating 
in a rather peculiar fight.

247
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,935
Hm?

248
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,771
A “peculiar fight”, you say?

249
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,690
Gather the nine remaining applicants.

250
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,068
I’d like to speak with each of them alone.

251
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,532
Dammit, I’m so pathetic.

252
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,701
The whole Fourth Phase...

253
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,662
I relied on you two 
to do everything for me.

254
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,707
I promise I’ll return the favor.

255
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,917
So...

256
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,127
uh, well, thanks, you guys.

257
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,297
[Beans over speaker] 
Attention, all applicants.

258
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,425
The Chairman wishes to interview you.

259
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,718
Really?

260
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,178
[Beans] When you hear your number,

261
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,806
come to the reception room 
on the second floor.

262
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,434
We’ll start with number 44, Mr. Hisoka.

263
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,436
Thank you for your cooperation.

264
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,237
Please, make yourself comfortable.

265
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,448
Don’t tell me 
that this is the Final Phase?

266
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,451
Not the test itself, you understand.

267
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,328
I just have a few questions,

268
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,456
mostly to satisfy my own curiosity.

269
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,333
Hmm...

270
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,213
To start with,

271
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,257
why do you want to become a Hunter?

272
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,884
[Hisoka] To be frank, I don’t. But...

273
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,094
Go on.

274
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,639
A Hunter License can be incredibly useful.

275
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,641
[Netero] Oh. And how so?

276
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:34,976
For example,

277
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,856
Hunters can often kill 
without any fear of prosecution.

278
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,566
I understand.

279
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,860
Moving on to the next question…

280
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,112
Out of the other eight applicants,

281
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,656
which one are you keeping a close eye on?

282
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,160
Number 99.

283
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,453
Ooh.

284
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,122
405 also caught my eye,

285
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,040
but not like 99.

286
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,626
I would love to challenge him one day.

287
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,712
[chuckling]

288
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,506
Well, one last question and we’re done.

289
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,134
Which of the other 
eight remaining applicants

290
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,886
would you least want to fight?

291
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,681
That would be number 405.

292
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,100
Though 99 is a close second.

293
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,143
[Netero] Ah...

294
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,604
[Hisoka] The time simply isn’t right.

295
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,940
As for now, I’d have to say number 405.

296
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,567
Hm... Understood.

297
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,405
However, the one I would 
most like to fight right now...

298
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,325
would have to be you.

299
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,828
Well. Thank you very much.

300
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,288
That’ll be all.

301
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,922
That is one sly old man.

302
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,345
He left himself so open 
that I lost my edge.

303
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,394
I’m keeping an eye focused on Number 404.

304
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,855
He’s the most well-rounded applicant.

305
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,192
But I don’t want to fight with 44.

306
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,237
Because... I don’t think I could beat him.

307
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,533
Well, Gon. We’re the same age.

308
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,203
Who I don’t wanna fight, 
though is number 53.

309
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,497
I don’t think it’d be very fun at all.

310
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,794
I'm keeping my eye on Number 44.

311
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,629
You can't help but notice him.

312
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,966
Numbers 405 and 99 are out, however.

313
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,176
I simply will not fight children.

314
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,224
Number 99.

315
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,892
[clacking]

316
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,727
And Number 44.

317
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,481
Who am I keeping an eye on?

318
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,817
Hisoka, Number 44.

319
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,860
He’s on my mind the most, anyway.

320
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,990
But there’s no way 
I could ever pick Number 99,

321
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,409
Number 403 or Number 404.

322
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,954
It has to be 44.

323
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,748
He’s obviously 
the most dangerous applicant.

324
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:07,044
The one I’d least want to meet in combat 
is also 44.

325
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,590
I’m watching 405,

326
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,508
purely for positive reasons.

327
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,719
44 for negative reasons.

328
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,513
I will fight anyone if there’s a reason.

329
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,057
Otherwise I’d rather not fight at all.

330
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,644
Number 405.

331
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,689
I owe him and I sure hope he passes.

332
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,651
That’s why he’s the one 
I really don’t want to fight.

333
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,446
Hm, I see.

334
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,948
This is more lopsided than I expected.

335
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,541
-Gon. 
-Huh?

336
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,335
So, we made it to the Final Phase.

337
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,634
HEART-SPIRIT

338
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,093
Hm. That'll do it.

339
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,434
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

340
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,936
I’ve drawn up the brackets.

341
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,855
-Huh? 
-What’s this?

342
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,816
But-- But Chairman!

343
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,861
Come on! You can’t be serious!

344
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,905
[laughing]

345
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,199
Oh, I am quite serious.

346
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,369
That look. He’s serious indeed.

347
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,080
That’s a serious look? You sure?

348
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,584
The winners will pass the Exam 
and earn the title of Hunter.

349
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,840
Gon.

350
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,222
Did something happen in the Fourth Phase?

351
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,518
Since we met up...

352
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,562
you’ve been acting strangely 
and I’m getting concerned.

353
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,774
Ever since we left Zevil Island,

354
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,776
you’ve seemed rather quiet.

355
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,778
[Gon] My target...

356
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,863
was Hisoka.

357
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,743
I waited for the perfect chance 
and stole his badge.

358
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,997
But someone else was following me

359
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,583
and he got me with a poison dart.

360
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,296
After that, Hisoka showed up

361
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,924
and took his badge 
from the guy who took it from me

362
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,509
and then left it.

363
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,053
He said I owed him now.

364
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,930
He really said that?

365
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,724
[Gon] I said I didn’t need it

366
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,350
and he sent me flying.

367
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,274
[Hisoka] I will take it back

368
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,360
but only when you can 
punch me in the face like that.

369
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,491
[Gon] I was just so mad at myself.

370
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,702
I couldn’t do anything.

371
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,079
I was helpless against him.

372
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,681
And when he left,

373
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,641
I got so miserable and lonely.

374
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,934
It was just awful.

375
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,145
I guess it hurt to realize

376
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,147
that I wasn’t strong enough 
to challenge him.

377
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,983
That’s why I wanted some company.

378
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,402
I wanted to find somebody 
I could help.

379
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,362
I guess.

380
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,200
That’s when I decided 
to look for the two of you.

381
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,576
Gon...

382
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,329
Without your assistance,

383
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,290
Leorio and I 
never would have made it this far.

384
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,668
Thank you.

385
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,836
For everything.

386
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,882
I feel the same way.

387
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,717
Thank you, too.

388
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,517
[narrator] 
Gon and his friends have grown closer.

389
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,061
And the nine remaining applicants

390
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,689
are about to enter the Exam’s Final Phase.

391
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,277
[theme song playing]

392
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,822
[Gon] Next time: 
"Can't Win x And x Can't Lose"!

393
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,115
[Killua] Then how do I win?

394
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,742
[Gon] Give it all you’ve got!
