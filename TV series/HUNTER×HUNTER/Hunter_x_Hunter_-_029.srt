00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,295
[narrator] Heavens Arena.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,507
The 251-story building,

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,885
which stands 991 meters tall

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,095
is a mecca for fighters.

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:16,725
When combatants win a fight, 
they may advance by one class

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,144
and receive a corresponding reward.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,438
After reaching the 100th floor,

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,315
they are assigned a private room.

9
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,610
And those contestants 
who are skilled and fortunate enough

10
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,779
to reach the 200th floor,

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:33,242
earn the right to challenge 
the strongest fighters, the Floor Masters,

12
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,744
in an intense battle for survival.

13
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,413
This is without a doubt

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,333
the best stage a warrior could ask for.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,635
[theme song playing]

16
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,628
[Wing] Only one thing 
can protect you from a user of Nen.

17
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,756
You must learn to use it yourself...

18
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,675
and use Ten for defense.

19
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,510
Otherwise...

20
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,686
Your body will be shattered 
beyond all recognition.

21
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:30,067
AWAKENING x AND x POTENTIAL

22
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,612
[narrator] As the hour grows late,

23
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,531
Wing’s lecture has reached its climax.

24
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,870
They have until midnight.

25
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,248
Gon and Killua must learn 
how to use Nen

26
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,834
before the clock strikes twelve.

27
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,881
Nen is a power that dwells 
within every single human person.

28
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,133
However, at the present time,

29
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,345
only a few are capable 
of using that power.

30
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,555
And because of their ability,

31
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,974
they are treated as geniuses,

32
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,895
leaders, psychics, sages, 
and even super humans.

33
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,481
A power that dwells within everyone?

34
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,482
[Wing] Yes.

35
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,193
And there are means 
by which to awaken this power.

36
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,986
But only two.

37
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,990
Either slowly and carefully or by force.

38
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,868
Zushi opted for the slow and careful path.

39
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,037
Not only was he a quick learner,

40
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,914
but he was tireless in his training,

41
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,584
so he was able to master Ten 
in a very short time.

42
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,420
About six months.

43
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,630
But that’s way too long!

44
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,924
We need to learn Ten and pass Hisoka

45
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,135
and we’ve gotta do it before midnight!

46
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,972
Then it seems force is our only choice.

47
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,932
But is that gonna be fast enough?

48
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,017
Exactly how long it takes

49
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,854
is up to you and how well you learn

50
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,106
to contain your aura in that short time.

51
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,900
So, let’s get right to it, shall we?

52
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,652
I will begin your training

53
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,946
by transmitting my aura in your direction.

54
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,074
This is Hatsu, which you saw earlier.

55
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,081
And of course, it goes without saying that 
because I wish you no harm,

56
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,750
I’ll go easy on you.

57
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,295
But this method is still a drastic one.

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,880
In other words,

59
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,382
I will attempt to shock you 
into awakening.

60
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,552
I will rouse your sleeping bodies 
with a jolt,

61
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,138
making it so 
that you can perform Ten easily.

62
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,057
The reason I say ‘sleeping’

63
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,852
is that your aura nodes 
are currently closed,

64
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,229
preventing the free flow of aura.

65
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,565
And so, you see

66
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,609
by transmitting my aura through you,

67
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,987
I am hoping to jolt those nodes 
into an open position.

68
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,240
AURA NODES: NODES WITHIN BODY 
WHICH RELEASE AURA.

69
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:50,123
Under normal circumstances you would 
spend your time training, in meditation,

70
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,585
learning how to sense your own aura 
that surrounds you,

71
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,380
slowly and carefully allowing 
those nodes to fully open.

72
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,509
Even a natural talent like Zushi here,

73
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,260
required three months.

74
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,307
But considering your abilities,

75
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,519
you could’ve accomplished it 
in a week or less.

76
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,105
Which is why it’s unfortunate

77
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,068
that we are being forced to use 
the drastic method.

78
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,903
I don't really get it.

79
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,738
What’s the problem?

80
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,241
I thought faster is always better, 
isn’t it?

81
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,411
This method is a cheat 
and is highly frowned upon.

82
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,206
We are skipping the proper steps.

83
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,876
If I was inexperienced 
or bore any malicious intent,

84
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,336
I could kill you.

85
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,881
Yeah, but you aren’t inexperienced 
or malicious.

86
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,424
So, we’re safe with you.

87
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,384
Right?

88
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,970
[sighs]

89
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,389
And that’s why I’ve been wondering…

90
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,057
ENVELOPE SUPPRESS 
REFINE ACT

91
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,601
[Killua] What made you decide 
to teach us the real Four Exercises

92
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,644
all of a sudden?

93
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,897
Because you are very close to getting it.

94
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:00,235
If you were to enter the 200th floor 
without any of this knowledge,

95
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,028
you would suffer greatly.

96
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,950
You see, up there, 
everyone knows how to manipulate Nen.

97
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,872
And it is customary 
to initiate any new arrivals

98
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,250
who are ignorant of Nen 
by attacking with it.

99
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,628
In other words, 
they do what I am about to

100
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,797
but without the necessary restraint.

101
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,300
They do not care if people die.

102
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,260
It’s all the same to them.

103
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,099
Only those who prove 
they are strong enough to survive

104
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,684
are welcome to stay there...

105
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,311
as the chosen.

106
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,649
They have paid a high price 
for the privilege.

107
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,569
That is why it’s important for you 
to be prepared.

108
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,239
I don’t expect any of that 
was very encouraging

109
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,824
but through this method

110
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,659
I believe you will awaken.

111
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,162
It is clear you have the talent

112
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,080
and ability.

113
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,542
Take off your jackets, face away from me

114
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,669
and put down all your belongings.

115
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,140
[Gon] It’s so hot!

116
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,517
And I can feel this pressure,

117
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,354
even though I know Mister Wing 
isn’t touching me.

118
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,314
[Killua] This is it!

119
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,565
That sensation…

120
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:25,070
It’s like some slimy, invisible thing 
crawling across my skin.

121
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,365
Multiply this by a few million

122
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,159
and it’d feel exactly 
like my brother’s Nen.

123
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,454
Now I’ll begin.

124
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,920
[strangled cry]

125
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,506
[strangled cry]

126
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,720
And now every Aura Node in your body 
has been opened.

127
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,432
Thi-- This is…

128
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:59,062
That, gentlemen, is your aura, 
also known as life energy.

129
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,897
You can see it now

130
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,191
because the nodes in your eyes 
were also opened.

131
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,151
It almost looks like...

132
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,904
steam rising off the spout of a teakettle.

133
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,155
It’s so crazy!

134
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,158
It’s rushing out 
from every part of my body!

135
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,828
And it doesn’t look like it’s stopping!

136
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,580
No way… This can’t be good!

137
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,208
What you see is your life energy,

138
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,878
so if it continues to escape, 
you will become quite tired.

139
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,174
Expend all of your aura and you will 
collapse from extreme fatigue.

140
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,759
Oh, I get it.

141
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,263
Listen to me carefully!

142
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,766
You must keep your focus 
on containing your aura within your body.

143
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,768
Now close your eyes!

144
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,773
Use any stance you prefer.

145
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,568
Whatever helps you to maintain your focus.

146
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,154
Visualize your aura flowing through you

147
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,573
as if it were blood 
flowing through your body.

148
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,868
From the top of your head 
to your right shoulder,

149
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,578
to your hand,

150
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,539
through your legs 
then up your left side.

151
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,084
And now visualize that flow

152
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,836
as little by little

153
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,715
it begins to gradually slow down 
and swirl around your body.

154
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,811
These boys are incredible.

155
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,731
They didn’t even need me to tell them

156
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,609
that a natural stance 
would be the most effective.

157
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,947
They’ve mastered the technique 
after only a few simple directions.

158
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,366
It’s magnificent

159
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,494
and terrifying.

160
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,331
Now slowly open your eyes.

161
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,999
Tell me how you feel.

162
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,876
I feel like…

163
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,962
like I’m surrounded 
by some viscous liquid.

164
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,175
It feels like 
I’m wearing weightless clothes.

165
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,429
I want you both to continue 
holding on to those images.

166
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,889
Once you assimilate them,

167
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,100
you’ll be able to do this in your sleep.

168
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:10,151
Next, I will proceed 
to emit malicious Nen against you!

169
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,826
Before your nodes were forced open,

170
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,870
standing within this would’ve caused 
excruciating pain.

171
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,413
Yeah, okay.

172
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,957
I get it now.

173
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,084
Your whole ‘blizzard’ analogy.

174
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,669
It makes sense.

175
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,463
[Wing] If you can fend off my Nen,

176
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,384
you will finally be able 
to break through his barrier as well!

177
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,887
Prepare yourselves!

178
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,809
[Gon and Killua screaming]

179
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,864
[footsteps]

180
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,276
Mmm.

181
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,910
Welcome to the 200th floor.

182
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,955
Seems I needn’t bother 
with the traditional initiation.

183
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,794
I think I can guess 
why you’ve come to Heavens Arena.

184
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,674
You intended to get some training in 
before challenging me, correct?

185
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,092
That’s right.

186
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,054
But I didn’t expect 
I was gonna find you here.

187
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,514
That saves me some trouble.

188
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,266
[chuckles]

189
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,395
I wouldn’t get too brash 
just because you learned to use Ten.

190
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,942
There is much to learn about Nen.

191
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,568
To be honest,

192
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,197
I feel absolutely no urge 
to fight you right now.

193
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:23,952
However...

194
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,706
If you manage to win 
a single match on this floor,

195
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,625
I’ll accept your challenge.

196
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,592
Let's go.

197
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,976
Newcomers?

198
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,602
Looks like it, huh?

199
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,357
[Riehlvelt] It appears they can use it.

200
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,317
[Sadso] Indeed…

201
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,369
RECEPTION DESK

202
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,997
Welcome to the 200th floor!

203
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,833
Please go ahead 
and fill out all these forms.

204
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,628
So, would you like to register 
for a match right now?

205
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,383
And because this level incorporates 
a self-service system,

206
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,344
you’re permitted 90 whole days 
of fight preparation.

207
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,096
During those ninety days

208
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,890
you can call me for a fight 
any time you desire.

209
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,351
You’re free to fight every day, of course.

210
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,396
Or if you’d prefer, 
you can wait until the very last minute.

211
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,647
It’s up to you!

212
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,066
Once you’ve participated in a fight,

213
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,944
your 90 days of preparation time 
starts over again.

214
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,531
However, if you don’t fight 
before the end of the 90 days,

215
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,949
you’ll be disqualified

216
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,994
and your name will be stricken 
from all of the official records.

217
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,829
Wait, lemme get this straight.

218
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,206
We’re gonna have more than one fight 
up on this level?

219
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,207
Yes.

220
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,961
The only way for you to clear this floor 
is to rack up ten victories!

221
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,090
However, if you lose four times 
before you secure ten wins,

222
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,633
you'll be disqualified.

223
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:03,801
[buzzer]

224
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,053
Also,

225
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,804
if you do win ten times,

226
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,309
your reward is that you’ll have a chance 
to challenge the Floor Masters!

227
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,519
The Floor Masters

228
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,898
are the 21 strongest fighters 
that Heavens Arena has to offer.

229
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,776
Each one 
gets one whole floor to themselves

230
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,820
from 230 all the way to 250.

231
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,573
Are you starting to understand now?

232
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,617
If you’re able to beat a Floor Master,

233
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,535
you win the honor and privilege

234
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,704
of becoming the new master of that floor!

235
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,998
Uh... but wait, there’s more!

236
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,793
The Floor Masters enjoy other perks!

237
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,586
Not the least of which

238
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,256
is you’ll be eligible to participate 
in the Battle Olympia,

239
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,467
the Biennial Festival of Combat!

240
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,219
Isn’t that so exciting?!

241
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,640
Huh? No reaction?!

242
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,725
Sure, whatever you say, lady.

243
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,103
Is there anything special 
about the top floor?

244
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,813
That's what you want to know?

245
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,981
The champion of the Battle Olympia

246
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,359
gets to live on the top floor! 
How about that?

247
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,694
It's an incredible honor!

248
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,199
A penthouse that’s a thousand meters up! 
It’s a life of luxury!

249
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,367
Don't you get it?

250
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,993
Yeah, but Killua,

251
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,497
your house is like 3700 meters up, 
isn’t it?

252
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,709
But-- But wait!

253
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,336
There are other prizes!

254
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,172
-The champion always receives-- 
-Well? Whaddya think?

255
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,633
I dunno. 
If that’s the floor’s big secret,

256
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,427
-I don't care anymore. 
-Ooh!

257
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,138
Yeah! I just want to fight with Hisoka!

258
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,472
Forget all that other stuff!

259
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,183
I don’t get it!

260
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,769
Why did the two of you 
even bother to come here?

261
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,481
Well, I guess that means 
you’re just gonna have to win a fight.

262
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,775
But you’re gonna wait 
a little while first, aren’t you?

263
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,652
[Gon] No way…

264
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,238
I’m ready!

265
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,532
These opponents are different

266
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,702
and I’m not leaving 
‘til I find out just how different!

267
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,666
In that case, I’ll need you 
to fill out this form as well.

268
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,293
‘kay!

[clatter]

270
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,801
[Killua] You want something?

271
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,304
Oh, no. Not really.

272
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,222
We’re simply waiting in line,

273
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,558
so we can register for a match. Right?

274

Oh, I get it now.

00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,360
Hey, Gon.

278
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,071
I think these guys wanna fight 
on the same day you do.

279
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,993
[cackling]

280
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,545
I'm ready.

281
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,297
Just let me know when I fight.

282
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,466
Well, you heard him.

283
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,220
That boy is brimming with energy, huh?

[slow cackling]

[chuckling]

286
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,437
Now, Mister Gon will be in room 2207

287
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,815
and Mister Killua in 2223.

288
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,945
We’ll let you know 
which day your match is set.

289
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,197
Thanks a lot, Miss!

290
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,170
[Killua] 
I’m willing to bet that those guys

291
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,381
must have gone 
through the same tough initiation

292
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,007
Four-Eyes was talking about.

[keys jangling]

If we’d gone in blind,

295
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,097
we both could’ve ended up 
exactly like they did.

296
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,724
Wow! This room is huge!

297
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,434
[Killua] Hey! Aren’t you listening?

298
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,562
Look at how sparkly the bathroom is!

00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,313
Oh, wow!

300
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,066
I’ve never seen such a big bed 
in my whole life!

00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,317

Hey, Gon!

YOUR BATTLE HAS BEEN SET 
FOR 3 P.M., MARCH 11!

What? Tomorrow?

00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,583
That's fast.

I don’t think I can win yet.

00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,219
But that’s okay!

310
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,930
I just need the experience.

311
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,809
I need to find out

312
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,270
what I can do now that I have this power.

We’ve got a thrilling match 
for you today, everyone!

315
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,536
First up is Gon,

316
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:44,415
who managed to zip straight to this floor 
in no time at all!

317
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,253
His opponent will be Gido,

318
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,088
who currently holds a respectable record

319
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,507
of four wins and one loss!

Listen to me.

324
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,989
Ten is only defensive.

325
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,284
In terms of offense 
it will offer you no advantage.

00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,953
It is also important to remember

327
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,581
physical attacks will still cause damage.

328
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,794
An opponent who is highly skilled 
in the use of Nen,

329
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,962
will be able to penetrate your Ten

330
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,757
and can easily deal you a lethal blow.

331
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,302
That’s why you should wait two months 
before you start fighting.

332
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,221
During that time

333
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,473
I will teach you as much as I’m able.

334
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,018
[Gon] I’m really sorry, Mister Wing.

335
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,605
But I’m itching for a fight right now!

336
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,197
Goodness gracious.

337
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,032
That boy’s a real handful.

338
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,244
And... begin!

339
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,287
[cheering]

340
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,499
[roaring]

341
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,046
[cackling]

342
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,219
DANCING SPINNING TOPS

343
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,724
[commentator] 
There they are, Gido's Dancing Tops!

344
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,435
He uses an arsenal 
of dangerous spinning tops

345
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,479
to attack his opponent 
and crush them into submission!

346
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,523
Here we go.

347
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,984
Battle Waltz!

348
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,869
[gasps]

349
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,246
[grunts in pain]

350
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,249
[rasping in pain]

351
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,004
Clean hit!

352
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,589
[commentator] Gon gives up a hit!

353
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,424
One point to Gido!

354
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,176
He’s sure not wasting any time!

355
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,303
Gon’s off to a rough start!

356
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,345
[groans quietly]

357
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,847
[Gido] I can use Nen

358
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,558
to keep these tops 
attacking you for hours.

359
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,978
The attack pattern 
is so incredibly complex

360
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,189
that no one knows 
what they’ll do next!

361
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,815
Not even me!

362
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,236
The tops are bouncing off each other 
and attacking me.

363
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,200
They might be small, 
but they pack a big punch.

364
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,534
Like a hammer!

365
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,624
[narrator] Gon has begun his first battle 
on the 200th floor,

366
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,626
which is filled with Nen users.

367
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,420
It’s nothing at all like he expected.

368
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,341
Will Gon survive this predicament?

369
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,676
Or suffer defeat?

370
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,226
[theme song playing]

371
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,710
[Gon] Coming up:

372
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,211
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

373
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,588
[both] Hunterpedia!

374
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,339
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

375
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,008
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

376
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,051
Today, we’ll be introducing Gido!

377
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,178
He fights with tops controlled by Nen!

378
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,519
Maybe he’ll turn himself 
into one and spin into you!

379
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:14,076
[both] Spin round and round!

380
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,358
[Gon] Next time: 
"Fierce x And x Ferocious."

381
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,193
[Killua] Just don’t be too reckless.

382
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,446
[Gon] A real friend would want me 
to be reckless.

383
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,031
[Killua] Okay, that’s reckless.
