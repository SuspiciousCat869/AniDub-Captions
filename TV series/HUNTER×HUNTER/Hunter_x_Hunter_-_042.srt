1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,671
[Kurapika] They're coming.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,174
They are definitely coming!

3
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,558
[theme song playing]

4
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,259
DEFEND x AND x ATTACK

5
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,179
[narrator] September 1st.

6
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,600
The day Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio

7
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,227
have chosen to reunite in Yorknew City.

8
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,314
And it is on this morning 
that Gon and Killua

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,650
visit the bustling Yorknew marketplace.

10
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,738
[Gon] Wow, look at all the people!

11
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,781
[Killua] The whole purpose of this market

12
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,409
is to swindle the visitors 
who’ve come for the auction.

13
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,329
[Gon] Wait. 
So, this isn’t the auction venue?

14
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,955
No, of course it isn’t.

15
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,708
Yorknew’s “dream auction” 
is held once a year

16
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,669
in the world’s largest auction house.

17
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,464
They say that tens of trillions of Jenny

18
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,967
exchange hands during only ten days 
of official bidding.

19
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,219
Tens of trillions? Really?

20
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,389
Yeah. Something 
that sells for 10,000 today

21
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,808
could go for a hundred million tomorrow.

22
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,685
Bam, instant fortune.

23
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,270
It’s where dreams come true.

24
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,605
[Gon] Wow...

25
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,898
[Killua] Well, anyway,

26
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,234
that’s a big part of the reason 
why so much of the underworld auctioning

27
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,527
happens at the same time.

28
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,945
[Gon] That’s awesome!

29
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,699
[Killua] So hey, you think 
Kurapika and Leorio are gonna show?

30
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,618
[Gon] They promised 
they’d meet us here today,

31
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,203
so I’m sure they will.

32
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,245
[Killua] Right.

33
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,498
They might try to contact us, so...

34
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,503
Gon! You’ve really gotta get a phone!

35
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,921
Every Hunter needs one!

36
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,547
Yeah. I know...

37
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,466
[shop owner] Hey, welcome!

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,343
This one’s the hottest new models.

39
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,388
It’s ultra-thin and no bigger 
than a credit card!

40
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,641
Plus, it has GPS, 
which is great for finding people.

41
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,643
-[Leorio] Don't bother. 
-[Gon and Killua] Huh?

42
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,438
The range is terrible 
and it’s not even waterproof.

43
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,857
The only thing it’s good for 
is making phone calls.

44
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,025
Leorio!

45
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,026
Hey!

46
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,238
Instead, I would recommend...

47
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,657
this Beetle 07.

48
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,618
It’s pretty heavy and expensive

49
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,954
but it can translate over 200 languages

50
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,831
from places all around the globe.

51
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,873
Wait, Really?

52
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,501
-Hey, get this one and I’ll get one, too! 
-[Gon] Yeah!

53
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,461
Two of these beauties, please!

54
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,588
Yes sir, that’ll be 400,000.

55
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,132
[screams] Four hundred--

56
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,758
That’s highway robbery!

57
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,469
[Gon] Thanks, Leorio!

58
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,307
[Leorio] 
Sure, but a 110,580 Jenny apiece?

59
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,394
And that’s a fair price for a new model 
in this market!

60
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,979
[Killua] Still, you overdid it.

61
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,649
I’ve never seen anyone get applause 
for buying a cell phone before.

62
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,735
-[applause] 
-[Leorio whistling]

63
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,195
[Gon] But you really saved us.

64
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,781
[Leorio] That was just a taste 
of what I’m capable of.

65
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,119
The real deals don’t really start rolling 
until after the seller asks you to leave.

66
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,496
[overconfident laughter]

67
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,666
He doesn’t really strike me 
as the auction-going type.

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,751
No kidding.

69
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,503
So. How you coming along?

70
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,588
What do you mean?

71
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,257
You’ve both been training 
and getting stronger, haven’t you?

72
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,633
[Killua snorts]

73
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,010
What?

74
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:23,305
You gave the badge 
back to Hisoka at Heavens Arena?!

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,683
Not to mention you were good enough 
to reach the 200th floor…

76
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,644
Just how strong have you gotten?

77
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,564
[Gon] Hey. Did you learn Nen, Leorio?

78
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,150
You better believe I did.

79
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,526
That’s awesome!

80
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,819
Seriously?

81
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,446
Why the hell would I lie about that?

82
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,199
It’s building up a shroud of aura,

83
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,701
making your own life force even stronger!

84
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,703
[disappointed groan]

85
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,747
That’s Ten, actually.

86
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,750
One of the four major principles 
for learning Nen.

87
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,294
What?! Are you saying there’s more to it?

88
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,713
I figured it’d be something like that.

89
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,051
[Leorio] Greed Island? 
What’s that?

90
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,053
A legendary game.

91
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,430
[Gon] We're trying to get a copy 
at the auction.

92
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,766
But why would you even want one?

93
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,476
I think the game

94
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,103
might have a clue in it 
that’ll help me find my dad.

95
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,482
Huh? A clue hidden in some video game?

96
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,691
Why d’you think that?

97
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,152
[Gon] It’s... kind of a long story.

98
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,112
[Killua] Anyway, the problem’s the cost.

99
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,405
How much is it?

100
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,491
[Killua] The lowest starting bid...

101
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,285
is 8.9 billion.

102
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,954
Did you say billion?!

103
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,580
And how much do you have?

104
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,915
[sheepish chuckle]

105
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,252
After some bad investments 
we’re down to... five million.

106
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,629
Okay, guys, listen up.

107
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,923
This event is being held at Southernbees,

108
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,675
the world’s finest auction house,

109
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,344
so that much money 
won’t even cover the entry fee.

110
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,346
But the acquisition rank for the game

111
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,640
was listed as “easy” 
on the Hunter website.

112
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,724
Really?

113
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,810
[Gon] Because to get your hands on a copy,

114
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,270
all you need is money.

115
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,065
[laughs] It’s like I always say, 
money makes the world go round!

116
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,441
-[Killua] Well... 
-[both] Hm?

117
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,360
All that really means...

118
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,946
is that a real treasure 
can’t just be purchased.

119
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,366
If you can’t get one, 
and pretty easily, too,

120
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,076
you’re not much of a Hunter.

121
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,452
Right, you guys?

122
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,871
[miffed grunts]

123
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,874
[Leorio snorts] 
I don’t need you to tell me that.

124
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,252
First things first, 
we need some seed money.

125
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,296
Something to get the ball rolling.

126
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,591
Let’s search for ways 
we can make fast cash in Yorknew!

127
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,592
[Gon] Yeah!

128
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,511
[Killua] Simple and stupid.

129
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,221
He must be an Enhancer, too.

130
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,224
[Milluki] Dammit. What’s wrong?!

131
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,603
I created a complete duplicate 
of the program.

132
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,897
So why aren’t any events being triggered?

133
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,818
Did Kil trick me?

134
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,112
No. No, there’s no way!

135
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,239
He doesn’t have the skills 
to forge a game

136
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,284
and he’s definitely not stupid enough 
to double cross me!

137
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,745
So, either he was tricked too,

138
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,622
or this is the real deal!

139
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,582
I have to know.

140
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,084
I’ll find out its secret, 
whatever it takes…

141
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,629
no matter what the cost!

142
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,966
I’ve got 12.7 billion left.

143
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,761
And I’m gonna need 
at least twice that amount

144
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,387
to guarantee a winning bid.

145
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,266
Dad! I want to make a deal.

146
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,311
Lend me 15 billion 
and I’ll kill 15 people.

147
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,605
Got it. Bye.

148
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,316
[Blimp] Autopilot engaged 
to Lingon Airport.

149
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,071
[Milluki] I think I was 
about ten years old…

150
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,990
the last time I left the house.

151
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,786
[Leorio] Huh? Swap?

152
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,412
[Gon] What does that mean?

153
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,623
[computer] “Swap meet:

154
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,417
A gathering for the auction 
and barter of objects.”

155
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,503
See also: Conditional Auction.

156
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,213
Conditional auction?

157
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,882
[computer] “Conditional auction:

158
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:50,136
An exchange in which the seller 
specifies a non-monetary condition

159
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,224
and hands the item over to the first buyer 
who satisfies that condition.

160
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,518
-Conditions, huh? 
-What does that mean?

161
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,727
All right...

162
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,021
I think I get it.

163
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,357
So, there’s another kind of auctioning!

164
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,858
[cackling]

165
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,862
[Dalzollene] At 9:00 tonight, 
the mummy of Princess Corco

166
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,323
will be sold off 
at the Underground Auction.

167
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,618
Ivlenkov, Tocino and Baise,

168
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,079
you’ll be responsible for the bidding.

169
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,248
[Basho] Are three people gonna be enough?

170
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,959
[Dalzollene] Buyers can only enter 
in groups of three.

171
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,837
Weapons, communication, 
and recording devices

172
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,505
are all strictly forbidden.

173
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,842
The Mafia that runs 
the Underground Auction

174
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,301
also handles security,

175
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,178
so there’s rarely any trouble.

176
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,099
All it takes is one miscalculated move

177
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,185
and then every Mafia member in the world

178
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,353
becomes your enemy.

179
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,982
This auction is built 
on a foundation of trust.

180
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,608
And that’s the reason

181
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,319
you won’t see 
any surveillance cameras on-site.

182
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,196
The one unspoken rule

183
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,366
is that any grudges 
are to be checked at the door.

184
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,454
And so, if anything does happen,

185
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,873
your word is of utmost importance.

186
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,416
There are no courts here,

187
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,669
but it will hold the same weight 
as sworn testimony.

188
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,548
It’s crucial that each one of you 
makes a glowing impression.

189
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,676
Don’t cause minor disturbances 
for any reason.

190
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,679
Speak to no one outside of this group.

191
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,140
And... The rest of us?

192
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,186
[Dalzollene] Basho and Linssen will be 
covering the rear entrance.

193
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,148
Kurapika and Melody 
will take the front entrance.

194
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,735
Squala and I will guard the girl.

195
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,320
And so...

196
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,655
the mission will now begin.

197
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,623
[Leorio] Step right up, folks!

198
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,375
Let’s have a little 
conditional auctioning fun!

199
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,086
Here’s what’s up for bid!

200
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,880
A diamond worth three million!

201
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,675
Bought today 
with a certificate of authenticity!

202
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,011
Arm wrestling decides the winner!

203
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,431
First person to beat this boy walks off 
with the diamond!

204
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,600
Entry fee is ten thousand!

205
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,604
All right. The auction starts now!

206
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,773
-I want in on that! 
-Me, too!

207
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,066
[man] Same here!

208
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,526
[Leorio] No pushing, people!

209
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,860
Form a line.

210
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,198
Adjust your strength to match 
that of your opponent.

211
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,617
And pretend to struggle 
every now and then.

212
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,037
-Okay, you’re up first! 
-[gasps]

213
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,373
[Leorio] The entry fee in advance, please.

214
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,375
Here ya go. Ten thousand.

215
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,585
Thank you, sir. Now step right up!

216
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,170
[grunts]

217
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,798
[Leorio] All right, clasp hands.

218
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,094
Just do what I told you.

219
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,595
[Gon grunts]

220
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,930
And remember...

221
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,640
you get one round!

222
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,269
Ready... Go!

223
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,938
[both straining]

224
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,653
[Leorio] Uh-oh!

225
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,988
-Can he do it? 
-[Gon straining]

226
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,531
You’re almost there.

227
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,158
Don’t give up now!

228
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,787
[fake straining]

229
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,457
[roaring]

230
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,586
[straining]

231
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,802
Oh! That was a close one!

232
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,263
Ah, dammit! I lost to a little kid!

233
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,807
And who will be our next contender?

234
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,768
Ready... and go!

235
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,563
[crowd cheering and hooting]

236
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,814
[Killua] I get it.

237
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,693
So, this is conditional auctioning.

238
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,112
But to reach 8.9 billion,

239
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:40,366
we’ll need 889,999 wins.

240
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,410
[man] Ah, damn.

241
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,912
Another loser!

242
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,580
So, who’s up next?

243
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,708
You lose!

244
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,169
[murmuring]

245
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,795
[onlooker 1] He's beaten 150 people!

246
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,797
[onlooker 2] 
He’s gotta be running out of steam.

247
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,675
[onlooker 3] 
He looks tired and he’s sweating bullets.

248
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,969
[onlooker 4] 
Don’t lose before I get my turn!

249
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,848
[Gon] I feel bad for tricking everybody.

250
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,476
Making so much money this easily...

251
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,437
I’m breaking out in a cold sweat 
just thinking about it!

252
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,148
Okay! So, who’s up next?

253
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,735
Look at that!

254
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,154
We have our first female challenger!

255
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,948
[onlooker 1] All right! Get him, girl!

256
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,076
[onlooker 2] And try to take it easy 
on the little lady, muscle boy!

257
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,495
So, tell us where you’re from!

258
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,497
All business, I see...

259
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,167
-I look forward to our match. 
-[Gon] Oh. Yeah, same here.

260
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:35,797
[gasps]

261
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,718
Ready, and... go!

262
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,972
[Gon and girl straining]

263
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,644
[Gon straining severely]

264
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,281
[straining]

265
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,125
Oh! So close! Better luck next time!

266
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,876
Yeah, good effort, girl!

267
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,503
Thank you for the opportunity.

268
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,839
Oh. You’re welcome. Any time.

269
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,300
[sighs] What a pity.

270
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,512
Was that... full power?

271
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,638
Yeah.

272
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,557
I wonder who she is...

273
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,144
[Killua] 
World champion arm wrestler, maybe?

274
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,771
[Franklin] Well?

275
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,189
[girl] I lost.

276
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,482
He’s tough.

277
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,401
[Feitan] That little brat?

278
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,987
I sort of wanted that diamond.

279
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,197
Then you shoulda used your left hand.

280
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,326
[Feitan] Yeah, why didn’t you use 
your stronger arm?

281
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,994
Oh. Because...

282
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,246
he extended his right hand first...

283
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,332
I think I’d like to challenge him again.

284
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,250
[Feitan] There is no time.

285
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,668
We have a job to do.

286
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,003
[Franklin] He’s right.

287
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,589
Besides, buying and bidding’s 
not our style.

288
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,674
We’re thieves, remember?

289
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,594
[Feitan] If we want something, we take it.

290
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,554
[Neon] No way!

291
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,306
I'm going!

292
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,266
-[bawling] 
-[grunts]

293
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,102
[Dalzollene] Hear that, Sir? 
I’m at a loss here!

294
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,801
[Dalzollene] Yes, sir.

295
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,302
Her tantrum--

296
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,805
Her crying exhausted her.

297
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,641
That’s right, she’s fast asleep now, sir.

298
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,602
But there’s simply no telling 
what we’re all in for

299
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,312
when she finally wakes up again.

300
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,274
I vow to obtain the items 
she wants, but...

301
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,068
she’s set 
on participating in the bidding herself.

302
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,363
She’s bound to be disappointed 
when she wakes up to find

303
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,866
that she missed her only chance 
at doing so.

304
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,701
[Nostrade] Very well.

305
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,911
I’ll adjust my schedule and head over.

306
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,541
For now, focus on getting 
the mummy of that princess,

307
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,501
so we can improve her mood again.

308
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,670
[Dalzollene] Understood, sir.

309
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,256
[Dalzollene sighs]

310
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,549
[dialing number]

311
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,343
Well? How are things with you?

312
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,596
[Melody] All clear.

313
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,056
There’s Nothing from the outside.

314
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,100
Yes, sir.

315
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,186
We’ll call you if anything new happens.

316
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,812
[siren wailing]

317
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,939
[Melody] 
They’re being quite thorough, aren’t they?

318
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,610
No one is allowed 
within 500 meters of the auction house,

319
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,613
except for approved 
Mafia security personnel.

320
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,823
[Kurapika] If they didn't do that,

321
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,242
the perimeter 
would be crawling with thugs,

322
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,331
which would practically be an announcement 
that sinister deeds are taking place.

323
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,124
[Melody] Guess so.

324
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,586
[Kurapika] I wonder...

325
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,506
will the Phantom Troupe really show up?

326
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,137
[gasps]

327
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,725
[Melody] 
That’s the same sound I heard earlier.

328
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,684
Hmm?

329
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,895
Just so you know,

330
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,565
I happened to see you 
as you were leaving the Hunter agency.

331
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,365
I heard it when you walked past me.

332
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,825
Your heart played a melody of wrath.

333
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,120
Mind if I ask you a question?

334
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,413
[Kurapika] Go ahead.

335
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,416
-Scarlet Eyes. 
-[light gasp]

336
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:23,918
Exactly...

337
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,504
what do they mean to you?

338
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,174
[siren wailing]

339
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,176
Why do you ask?

340
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,263
There’s no reason in particular.

341
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,265
Just curious.

342
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,810
When you saw the image on the data card,

343
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,522
your heartbeat was even more fearsome 
than it was then.

344
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,068
It played a melody of boundless fury.

345
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,284
I guess there’s no point in lying.

346
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,371
I am a member of the Kurta Clan.

347
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,082
Our eyes are normally brown,

348
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,127
but they burn a bright crimson 
when we’re agitated.

349
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,131
So, I wear black contact lenses 
to escape detection.

350
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,802
I seek the eyes 
that were stolen from my brethren.

351
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,554
And whatever it takes...

352
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,889
I will return their eyes to them.

353
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,727
[Melody] Hmm...

354
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,188
Will you tell Dalzollene about me?

355
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,108
No, I won’t.

356
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,152
Because you’d kill me if I did.

357
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,070
You’re very perceptive.

358
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,323
A heartbeat’s always honest.

359
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,492
When you first began confessing,

360
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,202
and told me your true nature,

361
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,164
your heartbeat was as calm as it was icy.

362
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,083
The heartbeat of one who is prepared...

363
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,752
to kill if need be.

364
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,007
Your heart says you hold no grudges

365
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,967
but that I was fair game if I talked.

366
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,471
[Kurapika] Why did you take this job?

367
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,640
[Melody] Why would you ask?

368
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,309
You know that I’ll probably lie to you.

369
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,438
Your eyes will tell me if you do.

370
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,403
[Melody] I’m also a Pro Hunter.

371
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,822
A Music Hunter, I suppose.

372
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,910
I seek a certain sheet music.

373
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,750
[Kurapika] You aren't lying,

374
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,919
but you left out crucial details.

375
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,128
[Melody giggles]

376
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,673
[Melody] Let’s say you’re right 
and leave it at that.

377
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,554
It’s the Sonata of Darkness.

378
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,098
That’s what I’m after.

379
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,938
It is said to be composed 
by the devil himself.

380
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:53,609
There are solo parts for the piano, 
violin, flute, and harp.

381
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,113
If a human plays 
or even listens to the piece,

382
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,240
they will be horribly cursed.

383
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,036
Isn’t that just an urban legend?

384
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,331
I doubt that anything like that 
could truly exist.

385
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,834
[wind rustles]

386
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,924
[Kurapika gasps]

387
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,931
The only solo I heard was the flute solo.

388
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,309
One movement turned me 
into what you see now.

389
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,520
My friend who played it died,

390
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,772
and her whole body turned to this.

391
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,400
Just a single movement

392
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,402
from someone who had given warnings

393
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,447
never to play it under any circumstances.

394
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,073
That day...

395
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,409
we were drunk and giddy.

396
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,871
My body was destroyed,

397
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,039
but I gained this ability in return.

398
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,002
I wish to restore my body 
to the way it was.

399
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,379
I’m willing to do anything.

400
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,259
I don’t want anyone else 
to suffer the same fate as me.

401
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,762
That’s why I want to find the score

402
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,054
and destroy it.

403
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,850
You asked me why I took this job.

404
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,144
The answer is I was hoping

405
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,521
one devil would know another.

406
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,190
[sighs]

407
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,151
Looks like it’s time.

408
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,279
The Underworld Auction is about to begin.

409
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,660
It’s almost time.

410
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,664
It is.

411
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,547
[narrator] The Phantom Troupe prepares 
to bare its fangs.

412
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:43,135
And soon Kurapika, now a bodyguard 
for the Nostrade family,

413
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,971
must decide on how to deal with them.

414
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,851
[theme song playing]

415
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:57,668
[Gon] Coming up:

416
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,003
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

417
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,337
[both] Hunterpedia!

418
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,047
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

419
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,591
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

420
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,217
Today, we're introducing Basho!

421
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,095
He writes a lot of haiku, 
his homeland’s poetry.

422
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,638
-Let me do one! 
-[gasps]

423
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,683
“This segment 
is a test of heart and soul.”

424
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,642
You’re way off!

425
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,152
[Gon] Next time: 
“A x Shocking x Tragedy”.

426
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,696
-Shocking! 
-[Killua] Shocking?

427
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,531
[Gon and Killua] It’s a Shocker!
