are you satisfied now?

Netero: Prayer is
an action of the heart.

172
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:21,702
Formed properly from within,
it becomes a wish,

would be her final attack,

engulfing the target gently,
yet firmly in a tender clasp.

its murderous intent

such a strong impact on killua

that he changed his direction.

The entirety of netero’s aura

was transformed into a light
much like a dazzling star,

The ecology of the chimera ant

This is a feat

can never hope to match.
