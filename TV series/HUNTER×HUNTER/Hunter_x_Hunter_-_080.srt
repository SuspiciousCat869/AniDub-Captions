00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:22,283
Gyro spent the first
12 years of his life

10
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,518
inside a construction camp.

11
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:28,522
Before he had even spoken
his first words,

12
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:32,492
he had already learned
to lay bricks and mix concrete.

13
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,262
His father
forced him to slave away

14
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,666
until gyro finally killed him
and made his escape.

15
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:47,541
His father was a quiet man
who raised gyro by himself.

16
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,013
After work, he would
drink cheap liquor alone

17
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,748
until he went to bed.

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,585
It was incredibly rare
for him to talk to gyro,

19
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,322
who slept on the upper bunk.

20
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,325
It was for that reason

21
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:08,696
he barely knew how to speak
before he was seven years old.

22
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,766
When gyro returned from work,

23
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,435
he was not permitted
to leave his bed,

24
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,373
the only exception
being trips to the restroom.

25
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:23,076
He was allowed to relieve
himself just twice a day

26
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,579
and only before 9 P.M.

27
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:29,616
The rotting wood of
the bed frame would creak loudly

28
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,219
whenever he would turn
in his sleep.

29
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,588
- ( Creaking )
- His father hated that sound.

30
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:42,062
Once, that noise caused
his father to beat him severely,

31
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:47,367
and after that, gyro learned to
sleep without moving a muscle.

32
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,072
He also learned
to hold his bladder at night

33
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,075
and kept an empty liquor bottle
by his bedside

34
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,378
for when he simply
couldn’t hold it in any longer.

35
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:04,185
"Don’t make trouble for others,"
his father said.

36
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:07,455
As a matter of fact,
that was the one lesson

37
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,789
that his quiet father
taught him.

38
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:15,595
From a very young age, gyro
did his best to adhere to it,

39
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,299
learning from his mistakes.

40
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:24,238
His father had never bought him
anything, not even a toy,

41
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:28,408
so this lesson
was his one and only gift.

42
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,845
Inside his small,
troubled world,

43
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,216
his father
was essentially a god,

44
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:39,153
and no matter how cruel
his father could be,

45
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:42,322
gyro continued
to idolize the man,

46
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:46,594
believing that deep down,
his father truly needed him,

47
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,430
a belief stemming
from two facts.

48
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,799
When gyro was five,

49
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:56,136
he suffered a terrible fever
that nearly killed him.

50
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,472
His father stayed up all night,

51
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,508
replacing his towels
with fresh ones.

52
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,781
The other reason was that his
father had never at any point

53
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:11,851
ordered him to leave,
not even once.

54
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:17,858
And these two facts filled
gyro’s young heart with pride.

55
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,493
Boy: You idiot!

56
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,195
You know why your dad
hasn’t kicked you out yet?

Narrator: Though he had
previously kept that possibility

59

locked away deep in his mind,

60
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:33,274
when the older youth
brought it to light so harshly,

61
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,943
something in gyro snapped.

62
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:40,747
Boiling with regret that he had
revealed his precious secrets,

63
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,284
he was furious with himself.

64
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:47,421
His pride gravely wounded,
a feeling of rage overcame him,

65
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,956
and he attacked the youth.

66
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,557
( Spoon clatters )

67
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,828
The youth had made a habit
of mocking the timid boy,

68
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,465
so when the boy fought back,
he went mad with anger,

69
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:00,468
to the point where
not even knocking gyro out

70
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,570
would satisfy him.

71
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:06,540
He stomped on the boy’s face
spat on him,

72
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:10,544
and then he uttered
the finishing blow.

73

a neighbor who took care of you!
