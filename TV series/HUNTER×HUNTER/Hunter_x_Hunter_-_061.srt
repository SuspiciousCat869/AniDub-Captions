Gon: We’ve only
been playing for a few hours,

164
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,389
and there’s already a fatality.

165
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:46,092
The corpse is real.
He really is dead.

166
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,829
This doesn’t seem
like a game at all.

167
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,064
We really are
risking our lives here.

168
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,800
( Both gasp )

169
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,802
Gon: He vanished?

170
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:59,773
Killua: He went back
to the real world. Game over.

171
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,408
Gon: Hey, killua,

172
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,844
do you think that the magic
that guy used on you earlier...

173
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,847
Killua: I don’t know.

174
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,849
Player: Don’t worry.

175
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,052
There are no spells in this game
that are anything like that.

176
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,153
Gon: Spell, sir?

177
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,889
Player: Like you said,

178
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,725
it’s something akin to magic.

179
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,296
Player: One thing’s for certain,

180
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,997
he died
from another player’s nen.

181
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,699
Gon: Really?

182
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,667
Killua: Does that mean
the players here

183
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,169
are trying to kill each other?

184
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:30,871
Gon: Why would they do that?

185
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,639
Player: It’s player hunting.

186
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,108
Killua: "Player hunting"?

187
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,310
Player: I can explain
everything to you later.

188
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,645
Anyway, you two want to team up?

189
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,916
I know of a surefire way
we can clear this game.

190
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:45,119
If you’re interested,
follow me.

191
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,754
Meet the rest.

192
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:47,921
They’re waiting up ahead.

193
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,824
Gon: What now?

194
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:52,093
Killua: Well, sounds suspicious,

195
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,829
and we’re already off
to a pretty bad start.

196
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,966
Player: Not to be rude,
but on your way here,

197
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,969
didn’t another player
use an attack spell on you?

198
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,238
Killua: Have you been
spying on both of us?

199
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,305
Tell me the truth.

200
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,341
Player: Sure, and not just me.

201
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,943
Lots of people around here
keep an eye

202
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,779
on brand-new players
at the starting point.

203
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,114
If you come with me,
i’ll explain why

204
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:17,350
and tell you all about
the spell that was cast on you.

205
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,253
Killua: You’re sure
being pretty generous.

206
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,922
There’s gotta be a catch
in there somewhere.

207
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,757
Player: We don’t have a choice.

208
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,626
Once you realize
how hard this game is,

209
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,897
not to mention how foul
and frightening it could be,

210
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,298
i’m willing to bet

211
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,768
you’ll be a lot more happy
to accept our offer.

212
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:39,139
And you’re newbies, so you could
definitely use the information.

213
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:42,877
On your first time playing here,
take all the help you can get.

214
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,346
Killua: What makes you think
it’s our first time?

215
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,183
We could be returning players,
even veterans for all you know.

216
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,386
Player: Book.

217
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,656
That jump is all I need

218
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,125
to prove that you’re
both beginners.

219
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,395
An experienced player would have
reacted much differently to that

220
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,630
by summoning his own binder,

221
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,267
because you need spell cards
to defend yourself.

222
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,136
Gon: That means
the spell cast on killua...

223
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,271
Killua: Can’t be stopped
without a card.

224
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:13,374
Player: Even when
you’re not carrying any cards,

225
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,376
you should still summon
your binder.

226
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,778
It’s an important bluff.

227
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:18,812
Book.

228
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,150
Gon: So how do we obtain
our own spell cards?

229
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,186
Player: Well, the easiest way
is to travel to masadora,

230
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,354
the city of magic.

231
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,622
Gon: Masadora?

232
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,223
Attacker: Return on!

233
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,025
Masadora!

234
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,861
Gon: Hey, you wanna go?

235
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:37,030
I’m a little bit worried
about the spell on you.

236
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,633
Come on!

237
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,836
( Killua groans ) Okay.

238
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,239
( Crowd murmuring )

239
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,979
Player: Is this everyone?

240
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,850
Player #2: Yeah. Everybody else
turned me down flat.

241
00:11:56,884 --> 00:12:00,254
Player #3: Fine.
Then let’s begin.

242
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,055
♪

243
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,059
Player #1: Just now yet another
player was found murdered.

244
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:08,829
He arrived here at the same time
as the rest of you did.

245
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,797
His stomach exploded.

246
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,100
It was the bomber again.

247
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,701
Gon: Who?

248
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,204
Player #3: His victims
aren’t killed by spells.

249
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,840
There isn’t a spell in this game

250
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,709
that’s capable
of injuring someone,

251
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,111
so don’t worry.

252
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,979
No matter what happens,

253
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,015
you won’t be harmed or killed

254
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,017
by any spell
that’s been cast on you.

255
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,819
Player #1: There are
40 different spells in all.

256
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,790
The one that was cast on you
earlier was an inspection spell,

257
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,693
so it has to be
either trace or cling.

258
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,194
Player #3: In short,

259
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,363
once the enemy uses
one of these on you

260
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,132
he will instantly know

261
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,634
everything there is
to know about you.

262
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:50,237
Killua: I get it.
So that’s why...

263
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,141
Player #3:
Some people choose to wait

264
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,109
for new players
by the starting point.

265
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:59,647
That way, they could cast
a spell on them quite easily.

266
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,983
As soon as a player
obtains a valuable card,

267
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,951
they’ll show up and steal it.

268
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,654
In some cases,
they just kill their target.

269
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,990
Puhat:
Like the guy who just died?

270
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,726
Well, it won’t be
that easy to kill me.

271
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,996
Player #3: No, he was
killed by someone else,

272
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,300
by a radical type of player
who hunts his opposition.

273
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,203
The man who died

274
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:25,206
was killed
by someone called the bomber.

275
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,208
Gon: Bomber.

276
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,944
Player #4: In this game,
there are only three ways

277
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,813
that a player can acquire
item cards they can use.

278
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,014
Know what they are?

279
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,616
Gon: Hmm. Find them yourself!

280
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,219
Player #5: You can also trade
for them with other players.

281
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:41,889
Killua: Or simply steal them
from other players.

282
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,825
Player #4: Yes. Those are
the three possible ways.

283
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,394
However, the number of players

284
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,229
stealing from others
has increased.

285
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,965
♪

286
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,234
That’s because of the card’s
acquisition difficulty

287
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:56,036
and conversion limit.

288
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,139
Players who can’t obtain
cards themselves

289
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,909
often choose to take them
from others.

290
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:05,612
If those players resist,
they’re killed.

291
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,149
Their ring disappears,
and the cards are lost,

292
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,851
but it increases
the conversion limit

293
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,786
for that type of card.

294
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,356
If you kill a player,

295
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,591
you can’t take his cards.

296
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:18,859
That rule was put in place

297
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,995
to prevent players
from killing each other.

298
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,599
Player #1: But lately
it’s been backfiring.

299
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,835
It’s been over 10 years since
this game was first released.

300
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,305
If no one can find
a way to beat it,

301
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,006
the killing will only continue.

302
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,210
That’s why all of us are all
trying to end this mess!

303
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,612
We need more allies
to clear the game!

304
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,213
That’s where you come in.

305
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,817
Puhat: How do you
plan to obtain cards?

306
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:47,621
One, find them,
two, trade for ’em,

307
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,256
three, steal ’em.

308
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,924
Which are you gonna do?

309
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,827
Player #1: Steal them.

310
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,130
Player #5: I have to assume
we’ll be using all three,

311
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,032
but that’ll be
the primary method.

312
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:01,235
Puhat: Hold on.
So you’re still gonna use force?

313
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:05,005
Player #1: No! We refuse to use
violence to achieve our goal.

314
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,673
- Player #5: Spells.
- Players: Hmm?

315
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,976
Player #5: You just
use spells. Correct?

316
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,178
- Player #1: That’s right.
- ( Puhat scoffs )

317
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:14,915
Player #1: There are spells that
exist for taking others’ cards,

318
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,651
as well as cards
that defend against them.

319
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,986
We plan to monopolize
those spell cards.

320
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,624
We’re going to use the very same
card conversion limit

321
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,592
that’s been frustrating us.

322
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,962
It’s the only way
to clear the game.

323
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,264
Player #3:
I’ve met a lot of players,

324
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,766
and they’ve all reached
the same conclusion.

325
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,703
Every card you find will be
taken from you eventually.

326
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:39,106
Player #4: Because that’s
what the game is based on,

327
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,008
taking cards from each other.

328
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,277
Player #6:
We take cards from others

329
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,914
while mitigating our own risk
of losing cards.

330

Puhat: You’re leaving out
something important, aren’t you?

331
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:53,721
How you gonna split the reward
money once you clear the game?

332
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,089
Player #6: Good point.

333

all of you guys, didn’t he?

when you found us?

335
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,329
Player #6: Yeah. You see,

336
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:05,098
Mr. Battera hired all of us
to play the game, too.

337
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,968
Player #1: That means
the reward will be 50 billion.

338
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,270
We’ll split it
between everyone who helps us.

339
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:13,107
Player #4: We have 53 players.

340
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,010
Two months to collect
the remaining spell cards,

341
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:18,279
one to get the cards we need--

342
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,881
three months to finish.

343
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,617
Player #3: Of course,
if you decide to join us,

344
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,286
we’ll remove any spells
that were cast on you.

345
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,690
Puhat: I’m in.

346
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,760
Can’t say I like the idea
of splitting the 50 billion,

347
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:35,596
but I do like the idea

348
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,698
of clearing the game
in three months.

349
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,366
Player #3: What about you?

350
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,368
Player #5: I have a question.

351
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:45,105
So if I get
an ss rank card on my own,

352
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,906
what’s my cut, roughly?

353
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,909
Player #1: Ss?
For one of that rank,

354
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:52,746
it’s about 500 million.

355
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,714
Player #5: Okay. I’m in.

356

What about you, kid? You in?

358
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,323
Killua: For what?

359
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:04,825
Gon: Count me out.

Well, you guys heard the boss.

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,068

♪

367
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:26,280
Player #1: First we’ll need you
to exit the game

368
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:29,082
so the spells placed on you
can be removed.

i’ll need for you
to give them to me now.

Player #5: Why’s that?

375
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,231
Player #3:
When you leave the game,

376
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,166
the cards
left in your free slots

377
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,069
disappear completely.

378
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,236
Puhat: Yeah, but your data
automatically saves

379
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,874
when cards are put into or taken
out of the specified slots.

380
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,309
Player #3: That’s true,
but your data disappears

381
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,779
if you don’t return
within 10 days.

382

Player #1: And if you don’t
return to the game before then,

383
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,217
unfortunately we’ll have
to assume that you gave up.

384

A friend is joining us.

Player #7: We don’t know
if anyone’s watching.

00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,629
Let’s begin.

389

First off,

Killua: Hey! Wait up, gon!

391
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,239
You wanna tell me
what that was all about?

( Gon sighs )

393
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:30,678
Sorry, killua,

394
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,147
but I guess I just
couldn’t take it anymore.

395
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,150
Killua: Okay, but I still don’t
get why you’re apologizing.

396
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,819
Gon: Because you’re gonna be
stuck with that spell

397
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,854
for a while,
and it’s all my fault.

398
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,823
Killua: Okay. I get it now.

399
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,358
Look, it’s no big deal.

400
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,294
Gon: It is! You’re playing
this game ’cause of me.

401
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,996
You’re only here
to help me find my dad.

402
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:52,766
Killua: You’re wrong.

403
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,835
I’m playing this game,
because...

404
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,772
So anyway, why’d you get so mad?

405
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:02,008
Gon: It’s because they said
mean stuff about ging’s game,

406
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,745
how it’s all based
on killing and stealing cards,

407
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:07,114
and I guess
it really ticked me off.

408
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:11,852
I want to do what ging said
to do and just enjoy the game.

409
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:15,589
When I first got here,
I knew it wouldn’t be easy,

410
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,592
but I wasn’t afraid,
because I thought--

411
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,594
well, I figured all the players

412
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,130
genuinely enjoyed the game,
you know?

413
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,565
People actually die here,

414
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,001
but the game, it’s not scary.

415
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:30,004
It’s that players
hurt each other

416
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:31,939
all over getting some cards.

417
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,174
That’s the really scary part.

418
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,144
Killua: Really?
I think it makes sense.

419
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,146
Gon: Hey, you really mean that?

420
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,149
Killua: It’s dangerous,
but it’s just meant for hunters.

421
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,183
Gon: Still...

422
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:44,919
Killua: Killing is wrong, sure.

423
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:46,654
No argument on that part.

424
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,290
But what if two players
each put forth a card

425
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:52,259
and the one who wins
a battle with defined rules

426
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,693
gets to keep both?

427
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,962

428

00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:58,031
When that guy cast a spell on me

and those guys
start their strategy,

the rules of the game.

00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,974
it kinda feels
like they’re chickening out.

all right?
