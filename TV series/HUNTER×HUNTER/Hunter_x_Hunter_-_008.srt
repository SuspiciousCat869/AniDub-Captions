the mysterious unknown.

The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words...

7
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:27,945
are called...

8

-Gotcha! You just used your right hand! 
-I did.

15
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:19,181
[giggles] I did it! Yeah!

23
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,837
[Beans] I sincerely apologize 
for the long wait.

24
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,841
The airship will be arriving 
at its destination shortly.

[Gon gasps]

26
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,554
[Gon] Is this where the next test 
is gonna be held?

27
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,019
-[man 1] What is this place? 
-[man 2] There's nothing here.

28
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,729
[Beans clears throat]

29
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,525
Everyone, this is the site 
of the Hunter Exam's Third Phase.

30
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,028
You'll be competing here 
at the top of the Trick Tower.

31
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,655
Did you say Trick Tower?

32
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,782
[Beans] In order to pass this phase,

33
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,243
you must reach the base 
of the tower alive.

34
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,246
The time limit is 72 hours.

35
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,042
And with that, 
the Exam's Third Phase will now begin.

36
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,003
-Good luck to each and every one of you.

[grunts]

43
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,155
[Gon] Whoa!

44
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,366
Now what? Are we supposed to climb down?

45
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,869
Well, I hope not. That would be suicide.

46
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,164
[Number 86 chuckles] Sure, for most guys.

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,922
[grunts] For an expert rock climber 
like me, this is gonna be a piece of cake.

48
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,966
Oh, wow!

49
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,801
Look at how fast he's going!

50
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,721
[chuckles] By the look of things,

51
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,183
I'm about to be the first one 
to pass the Third Phase.

52
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,476
Huh?

No! Stop! Go away!

56
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,663
Help me!

57
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,212
Uh, so, I guess we can't climb down, 
not this way at least.

58
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,088
Yeah.

59
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,775
-What's up? 
-There are fewer people around.

60
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,734
What?

61
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,070
[Kurapika] I count 23.

62
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,573
So nearly half the applicants 
have already found an exit.

63
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,077
No way! When did that happen?

64
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,287
We're missing something, but what is it?

65
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,248
There must be hidden doors 
up here somewhere

66
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,375
that lead to the lower floors 
of the tower.

67
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,086
Kurapika! Leorio!

68
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,005
What is it, Gon?

69
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,050
Look at this. We found a trap door. 
Check it out!

70
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,343
[stone scraping]

71
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,678
[gasping]

72
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,889
I see, so the only way 
that we can reach the lower levels

73
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,434
-is by turning over these stones. 
-Okay, good job!

74
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,353
Now what do you say we head on down?

75
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,730
Okay, but I'm sort of confused.

76
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,899
Why? What is there to be confused about?

77
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,278
There's one, and another, and another,

78
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,239
and another one right over there. 
There's a lot of them.

79
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,699
That many?

80
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,828
Five hidden doors 
located in the same area.

81
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,957
Sounds a bit suspicious. 
No doubt a few of them are traps.

82
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:18,587
From what I can tell, each of these 
trap doors can only be used one time.

83
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,754
[Leorio] Seriously?

84
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,133
[Killua] 
We saw somebody fall through one earlier,

85
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,428
but when we tried to open it, 
it wouldn't budge an inch.

86
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,848
Judging by the door's size,

87
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,475
only one applicant can go through it 
at a time.

88
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,896
Which means only one person 
can use each door.

89
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,190
It's beginning to look like 
we're all gonna have to split up.

90
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,361
We decided that we'll each pick a door, 
and see how it goes.

91
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,655
And no hard feelings 
if one of them's a trap.

92
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,908
How about you guys? 
What are you gonna do?

93
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,328
Works for me. Seems like luck 
is part of the game or something.

94
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,372
No objection here. That settles it.

95
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,630
[Leorio] On the count of three, we all 
hop in at exactly the same time, okay?

96
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,382
[Gon] I guess that means 
this is goodbye for now, guys.

97
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,509
We'll meet up at the base of the tower.

98
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,304
Let's do this. One...

99
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,723
-Two... 
-[all] Three.

100
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,016
[Leorio yelps]

101

[yelps and groans]

103
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,900
[groans] Huh?

104
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,151
[all gasp]

105
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,905
[Leorio] Wait, what?

106
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,283
[both chuckle]

107
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,703
-That was certainly a brief farewell. 
-No kidding!

108
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,081
I don't think any of us expected 
all those hidden doors

109
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,208
to lead us all to the same room.

110
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,542
Huh?

111
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,885
[Gon] Hey, look at this! 
"The five who drop into this chamber

112
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,764
must find their way down together 
by consensus of the majority.

113
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,224
Wait, five?

114
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,893
Look! They even left us five wrist timers.

115
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,813
[Killua] With buttons marked X and O.

116
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:05,318
Do you think it's possible that we won't 
be able to leave this room at all

117
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,405
until someone else drops in 
and joins us down here?

118
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,281
[Lippo over speaker] Very good!

119
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,574
Who's there?

120
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,577
[Lippo] My name is Lippo. 
I'm the prison warden here,

121
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,872
not to mention, your examiner 
for the Third Phase of the Exam.

122
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,874
Did he say prison warden?

123
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,087
We've gone to the trouble of preparing 
multiple routes through the Tower,

124
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,757
and the one you've chosen 
is the path of majority rule.

125
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:33,138
If you want to pass, and I'm sure you do, 
co-operation is the essence of success.

126
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,225
One person acting selfishly could derail 
the entire group.

127
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,020
And of course, 
you won't be permitted to start

128
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,272
until you have five members present.

129
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,774
That's it, gentlemen. Best of luck!

130
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,655
[groans] We seriously can't start 
until somebody else shows up?

131
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,576
-So, what now? 
-[Kurapika] I guess we just have to wait.

00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,887
-[prisoner] You wanted to see us, Warden? 
-The test begins now.

135
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,389
So go, take your positions!

136
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,267
[prisoners] Yes, sir.

137
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,610
[Leorio] Oh, come on!

138
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,488
We've been sitting here for two hours.

139
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,990
What if everybody else 
already found their way down?

140
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,784
What are we supposed to do, huh?

141
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,370
We can't be the only ones stuck 
at the top, we'll look like total idiots!

142
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,791
[Kurapika] 
Calm down, Leorio. Complaining won't help.

143
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,920
Calm down? What if nobody else shows up 
before we reach the end of our time limit?

144
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,838
Huh? [groans]

145
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,465
I can't just sit here--

146
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,634
-Shh! Be quiet. 
-Huh?

147
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,844
Do you hear that sound?

148
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,681
[tapping]

149
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,771

[Tonpa groans]

151
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,362
Wow! Good grief!

152
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,780
Mr. Tonpa!

153
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,950
-Oh, great. 
-Look who it is.

154
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,579
Okay.

155
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,831
[rumbling]

156
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,462
I see.

157
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:33,716
So the door must be programmed to appear 
once all five timers are put on.

158
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:38,346
[Gon] "At this door, select O to open, 
X not to open."

159
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:43,434
Using majority rule, already? All right! 
At least the answer is obvious.

160
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,229
[Leorio] What?

161
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,024
'Fess up! Which one of you jokers 
hit the X button?

162
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,362
[chuckles] That was me. Sorry about that. 
I guess I pressed the wrong button.

163
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:59,325
Stop screwing around, old man! 
What, are you blind or something?

164
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,911
I said it was just an honest mistake.

165
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,456
How in the hell do you press 
the wrong damn button, huh?

166
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,626
It doesn't matter. It's okay. 
The door's open now.

167
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,003
[Leorio] It does matter!

168
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,673
He pressed the wrong button on purpose. 
He's trying to sabotage us!

169
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,259
Let's go. 
We don't have time for petty bickering.

170
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,594
Yeah, he's right.

171
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,763
Let him keep pressing the wrong button 
if he wants to.

172
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,558
The rest of us will just have to press 
the right one.

173
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,520
Fine, I guess.

174
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,064
[sneers] All right, let's go.

175
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,609
[Leorio grunts angrily]

176
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,572
[Leorio] Seriously? I didn't think 
we'd get another question so soon.

177
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:42,148
[Gon] "Which way do you want to go? 
O for right, X for left."

178
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,496
[Leorio] Right?

179
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,333
Or left?

180
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,668
[timers beep]

181
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,131
[groans] Hey! 
Why would you wanna go right?

182
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,675
You always go left! What's wrong with you?

183
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,885
That's true.

184
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,598
As research has shown, people who are lost 
or find themselves at a crossroads

185
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,851
tend to choose to go to the left 
much more frequently than the right.

186
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,354
Y'know, I think I've heard that before.

187
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,774
Hold on a second. 
The numbers just don't add up!

188
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,193
Which direction did the two of you pick?

189
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,320
-Right. 
-Right.

190
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,864
Ugh. You little monsters...

191
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,661
Going right makes a lot of sense. 
The examiner will never see it coming.

192
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,956
If they've seen the same research 
that those two have,

193
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,375
I bet they made the left path way harder.

194
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,920
[growls] Ugh!

195
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,631
Okay, so we're both simple-minded. 
So what?

196
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,590
[Gon] "We?"

197
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,647
[Leorio gasps] Where the hell are we?

198
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,361
See that, over there?

199
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,536
[prisoner] The applicants are here. 
Unlock my handcuffs.

200
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,166
Here we go.

201
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,802
There, now let's get down to business.

202
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,690
HUNTER GLOSSARY

203
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:40,008
TONPA

204
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,489
[Leorio gulps]

205
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,159
[Lippo over speaker] 
Gentlemen, let me explain.

206
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,995
You've probably already noticed

207
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,415
that some of the prisoners of Trick Tower 
are standing before you.

208
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:53,875
They're prisoners?

209
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,085
[Lippo] Not just prisoners.

210
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,798
The Hunter Exam Committee has also 
officially hired them on as examiners.

211
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,845
In this phase, you'll be fighting 
against all five of them.

212
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,808
The fights will be one-on-one, 
with each person fighting only once.

213
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,645
Use any style you like. 
There will be no draws.

214
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,316
To be declared the victor, 
your opponent must admit defeat.

215
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,528
You can decide which of you will be 
the first contender.

216
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,405
And this is majority rule,

217
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,909
which means you have to secure three wins 
in order to pass.

218
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,244
The rules are simple.

219
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,331
[sighs] I'm getting real tired of this.

220
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,167
Meh, seems pretty straightforward to me.

221
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,962
Hmm, well, the fights themselves 
will be anything but.

222
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,008
For every hour 
the prisoners keep you occupied here,

223
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,303
their sentences will be reduced 
by one year.

224
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:52,225
In other words, their goal in this phase 
is to literally buy time.

225
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:56,229
I understand. We're on the clock, 
and if we don't reach the goal

226
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,565
of getting out of here in 72 hours, 
we fail.

227
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,820
So, as you're fighting, remember: 
time is of the essence.

228
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:09,898
Bendot- Robber and murderer 
Sentenced to 199 years in prison

229
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:12,495
Okay, I'm fighting whoever's first. 
Now, who's it gonna be?

230
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,957
Now what? 
He said to fight however we want,

231
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,584
so I'm guess that pretty much means 
anything goes.

232
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,004
Everybody, be careful. 
No telling what they'll try to pull.

233
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:26,259
Without knowing what's up their sleeves, 
there's far too much at stake.

234
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,011
-Given that, I'll-- 
-[Tonpa] No, I'll go!

235
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,014
Mr. Tonpa?

236
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,561
I'll be the guinea pig; see if I can 
figure out what they're up to.

237
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,063
Consider it an apology for earlier.

238
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,524
Hold on, you're serious?

239
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,608
Sure.

240
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:47,029
You guys don't trust me yet, and I know 
I've given you plenty of reasons not to.

241
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,741
If the score ends up being two to two, 
who do you want going in there

242
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,202
to break the tie? 'Cause it ain't me!

243
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,621
That actually makes sense.

244
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,999
Good, so it's settled then.

245
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,710
Tonpa, so you're...

246
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,003
Hmm.

247
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:28,946
Well, that was a surprise. 
Never thought he'd volunteer.

248
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,450
He didn't really strike me 
as the guinea pig type.

249
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,203
Do you guys think he'll be okay?

250
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,375
Now then, let's determine 
the method of combat.

251
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,795
My choice would be a battle to the death.

252
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,256
-[Tonpa gasps] 
-A death match?

253
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,051
They're gonna fight 'til one of them dies?

254
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,721
This is bad. 
Don't let him provoke you, Tonpa!

255
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,515
What do you say?

256
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,309
I accept.

257
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,978
To the death, then! Let's go!

258
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,147
-[all gasp] 
-Seriously?

259
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,108
You're a brave man, I'll give you that.

260
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,920
[all grunt]

261
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:34,095
[grunting]

262
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,223
T-- Tonpa!

263
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,643
Now, begin!

264
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,522
[roaring]

265
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,446
I give up!

266
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,614
Huh?

267
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,491
What?

268
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,249
Did he just say that he gives up?

269
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,877
Uh, maybe he meant "give me a sec"?

270
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,880
[prisoner] What did you just say?

271
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,593
I said I admit defeat. 
That means you win, right?

272
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,305
So, I give up. I lose! [laughs]

273
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,016
Wha-- wha-- what!

274
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,937
[prisoner chuckles]

275
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,317
All right. 
Guess the first round goes to me, then!

276
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,947
If we win another two rounds, that's it. 
You all fail the exam.

277
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,242
You can't advance and you can't turn back.

278
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,412
You'll be stuck here 
for the next 72 hours,

279
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,623
until the exam is over.

280
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,291
And if that happens,

281
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,712
our sentences will be reduced 
by a grand total of 72 years.

282
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,965
[cackles]

283
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,343
Oh, man, am I embarrassed!

284
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,012
He looked a hell of a lot tougher 
when I got up close.

285
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:02,266
Bastard! 
I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.

286
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,603
All you're good for is 
sabotaging the other applicants!

287
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,980
You're just a worthless piece of garbage!

288
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,776
It took you long enough. 
That's what I do every year,

289
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,987
and I'll keep doing it 
for as long as I can.

290
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,447
Wait, say what?

291
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,784
[Tonpa] I don't care about passing 
the Hunter Exam.

292
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,703
I'm in it for the thrills. 
Sorry to disappoint.

293
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,748
-[Leorio] The thrills? 
-[Tonpa] That's right.

294
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,751
The exam is a proving ground,

295
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,463
designed to crush the dreams 
of the young and over-confident.

296
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:36,967
And that moment when hope and ambition 
give way to absolute despair...

297
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,597
[chuckles] I get a kick out of that. 
The joy I feel is just exquisite.

298
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:46,143
Especially when I'm the one 
actively shattering the newbies' dreams.

299
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,437
There's nothing like that rush.

300
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,733
I've no desire to be a Hunter. 
Doesn't really interest me.

301
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,903
And I've already had enough fun 
for this year.

302
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,615
Besides, I usually stop 
at this point anyway.

303
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,118
-Bastard! 
-Leorio, stop!

304
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,244
Why?

305
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,874
We're wasting time fighting each other. 
That's exactly what they want.

306
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,751
[Leorio grunts]

307
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,089
Yeah, but if their goal was 
to kill as much time as possible,

308
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,967
then the move the old man made 
was actually the right one.

309
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,135
[Tonpa] Huh?

310
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:23,305
[Killua] That bald guy looks ex-military, 
probably a mercenary.

311
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,309
If you'd fought with him, 
he'd have started by crushing your larynx.

312
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,146
Pretty hard to give up 
if you can't even talk.

313
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:36,360
Then he'd have tortured you, without 
killing you, for as long as he liked.

314
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,488
Yep, I considered that possibility.

315
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,490
You look sick, old man.

316
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,577
Well, so much for that plan, I guess.

317
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:49,206
I was gonna take my sweet time 
torturing the guy until the clock ran out.

318
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,418
[Sedokan] 
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

319
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:56,909
Sedokan -Serial bomber 
Sentenced to 149 years in prison

320
00:20:57,034 --> 00:21:00,651
If we defeat two of the next four, 
then victory will be ours.

321
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,512
All right. We need to win three rounds.

322
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,182
It's the only way we'll be able 
to advance.

323
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,975
So, who wants to go next?

324
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,436
Me! I'll give it a try.

325
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,482
-Are you sure? 
-Yeah.

326
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,277
[Killua] Well, the next opponent 
doesn’t look too strong.

327
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,322
I wouldn’t let my guard down 
if I were you.

328
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,700
He’s still a hardened criminal. 
No telling what he’s capable of.

329
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,327
Yeah, I'll be careful.

330
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,462
[narrator] Tonpa’s actions have placed Gon 
and his friends at a serious disadvantage.

331
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,548
Their next opponent is Sedokan.

332
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:44,512
As for what exactly he plans to do 
in this match, it’s anybody’s guess.

333
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,226
At the start of the Third Phase 
of the Hunter Exam,

334
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,977
there were 40 applicants.

335
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:56,106
And now, with one eliminated, 
only 39 remain.

336
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,613
[theme music plays]

337
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,615
[Gon] Next time, 
"Beware of Prisoners".

338
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,491
Oh, and watch your back, okay?

339
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,368
[Kurapika] 
Be careful when you're out late.
