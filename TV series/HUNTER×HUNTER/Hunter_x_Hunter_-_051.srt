1
00:00:00,237 --> 00:00:01,627
[machines whirring]

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,345
Oh! This is the foundation I wanted!

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:16,433
And this lipstick, this spray-on manicure. 
Ooh! [giggles] And this wig is so cute!

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,728
[Melody] 
Um, boss? We really should get going soon.

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,856
[Neon] Just a second! 
I want this camisole too.

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,986
[sighing] All this shopping's 
gonna be the death of me.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,363
I agree.

8
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,283
[theme song playing]

9
00:01:57,574 --> 00:01:59,953
Is there anything else I should buy 
while we're here?

10
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,289
What about you, Eliza? 
Do you want anything?

11
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,666
Oh, no, I'm fine, thank you.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,711
[indistinct chatter]

13
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,839
[Neon] I'm going to the restroom.

14
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,801
Don't worry, just watch my stuff, okay?

15
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,058
What do you think? 
Will Kurapika be okay?

16
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,548
I certainly hope so.

17
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:26,104
My flute should have helped alleviate 
his fatigue, at least a little.

18
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,150
This assassination… 
How do you feel about it?

19
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,237
The Ten Dons will hire pros 
to handle the Troupe.

20
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,489
Sir?

21
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,410
And so, I want you 
to join the assassin team.

22
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:46,083
Judging by the pace of his heartbeat, 
he wasn't all that happy about it.

23
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,252
I don’t believe he wanted 
to join the assassin team.

24
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,754
Of course, he didn't.

25
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:55,175
But as you well know, 
Kurapika is extremely determined.

26
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,553
And he is willing to sacrifice everything

27
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:02,265
if it means that he's able 
to achieve his desired goal.

28
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,467
Not an easy road to walk. 
I couldn't live that way.

29
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,892
A life where you’re basically killing 
yourself? What’s the point?

30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,651
It's been a while. I hope she's all right.

31
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,196
Once we finish this job,

32
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,907
I'm cashing out and seeing the world 
on my bike.

33
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,159
That does sound delightful.

34
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,162
[Basho] Not enjoying life is a crime.

35
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,331
[Melody] There are many ways to live.

36
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,835
Not everyone has the same ideas 
about what's important.

37
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,129
[whimpering]

38
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,173
-[Basho] Huh? 
-[Melody] Something wrong?

39
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,175
The boss is gone!

40
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,885
-Wait, what? 
-[gasps]

41
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,847
[Neon] Daddy's a big liar!

42
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:46,476
He wasn't going to take me to the auction! 
And he promised and everything!

43
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,521
Fine, then, I'll just go by myself!

44
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,489
[knocking on door]

45
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,032
[Zenji] Come in.

46
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,493
[door opening]

47
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:11,501
[Zenji] One, two, three, four, five, six.

48
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,463
It looks like everyone is here.

49
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,506
[Mafioso] No, not yet.

50
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,301
What? I thought the team 
had eight members.

51
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,054
Nostrade is sending over 
one additional person.

52
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,058
Ugh! That brown-noser 
with the fake fortune-telling, eh?

53
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,283
[Zenji] 
Alright, we got everyone all together?

54
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,329
Your mission is to wipe out 
the Phantom Troupe.

55
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:52,083
When the auction kicks off again tonight, 
they may come out of hiding.

56
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,130
If they do, eliminate them 
any way you see fit.

57
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,884
So, all of us are going 
after the same target?

58
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,304
We should pick out some code names 
to use for each other.

59
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,349
Let's use colors. 
You can just call me "Blue."

60
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,267
I'll be Red.

61
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,853
It's like a game, isn't it?

62
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,022
Hmm? What about you?

63
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,107
-[Silva] Silva. 
-[Zeno] Zeno.

64
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,401
Zeno huh? What color's that?

65
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,946
[Zeno] We will both use our real names.

66
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,614
You will?

67
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:27,077
You're welcome to call me by my name, 
but I won't take orders.

68
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,538
We'll do this our own way.

69
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,084
Hold on. Silva and Zeno? 
Like, of the Zoldyck family?

70
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,752
[Kurapika gasps]

71
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,630
[Zeno] 
Let me know if you want someone killed.

72
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,884
You get 30 percent off 
for being in the same industry.

73
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,720
[all gasping]

74
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,182
[Kurapika] So, they're Killua's family.

75
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:53,103
We could use code names 
but does it matter?

76
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:57,399
He has a point. There's no rule 
that says we have to work together.

77
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,903
But we're talking about the Troupe, here. 
Attacking alone will be dangerous.

78
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,990
And you?

79
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,243
Sloppy teamwork will only serve 
to cause confusion.

80
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,911
I’ll be fine by myself.

81
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,915
[chuckles] It's five to four. 
There you go.

82
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,585
[Zenji] The auction begins at 9:00.

83
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,753
We'll escort you to the auction hall.

84
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,922
Wait here till it's time.

85
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,758
[door opening]

86
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,844
[Zenji] Hey, Nostrade.

87
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,221
How do you feel, my friend?

88
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,598
Not too bad, huh?

89
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,435
Not too bad, huh? 
You're a big shot now, aren't ya?

90
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:38,106
Not too long ago, you were just 
heading up a small country gang,

91
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,901
and now, you're acting 
like you're my equal.

92
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:43,737
I hear that you've been wringing 
your hands so much,

93
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,326
your skin's rubbed off. 
You sure you're okay? [cackles]

94
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,953
Jealousy among men is pathetic.

95
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,581
Bastard!

96
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,130
What the hell is this, you little punk? 
If you want a piece of me, go ahead!

97
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,007
[Nostrade] Kurapika, that's enough!

98
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:11,348
Get one thing straight. 
No one is impressed by you, do ya hear me?

99
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,146
[Nostrade] Many resent my success

100
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,690
because they're unaware 
of their own incompetence.

101
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:26,546
But I plan to continue my rise to the top 
using Neon's fortune-telling.

102
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,699
I'm depending on you too, Kurapika.

103
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,619
You will be rewarded generously, in time.

104
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,245
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,582
[whistle blowing]

106
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,671
[Kurapika] Are the police helping you?

107
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,382
[Nostrade] 60 percent of the votes

108
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,134
for the Yorknew City mayor's election 
were bought.

109
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,346
And the police chief 
is the mayor's lap dog.

110
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,100
Imposing traffic restrictions is simple.

111
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,268
[phone ringing]

112
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,771
Yes, hello?

113
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,607
[Melody] 
Kurapika, bad news. The boss ran away!

114
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,694
She changed clothes 
when she went to the restroom,

115
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,529
so she must have planned ahead.

116
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,824
Don't worry. I think I might know 
where she went.

117
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,159
Go back to the hotel and stand by.

118
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,122
-What now? 
-Your daughter has run away.

119
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,874
She what? [coughing]

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,626
She'll likely head to our destination.

121
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,628
[Nostrade] The auction?

122
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,463
[dialing number]

123
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:30,051
Hmm. Damn, she turned off her cellphone.

124
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,793
But Neon doesn't even have a pass 
to the auction.

125
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:35,598
They'll turn her away 
when she reaches the checkpoint.

126
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,018
This is Light Nostrade.

127
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,937
I need for you to get an order 
to the guards at the gate.

128
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:46,526
If a girl around 17 or 18 tries to enter 
without a pass, take her into custody.

129
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,944
Her description...

130
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,450
You're all set. 
Thanks, you can go ahead now.

131
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,747
Phew! I didn't know how to get 
through that gate, so...

132
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:00,665
Thanks a lot for the help.

133
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,043
Happy to be of service.

134
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,547
[Nostrade] Really? When was that?

135
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:09,674
[policeman] About five minutes ago.

136
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,885
Her hair and clothes 
were a little different,

137
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,803
but it was probably her.

138
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,722
[Nostrade] And she didn't have a pass?

139
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:20,101
To be perfectly honest, it didn't seem 
to me like she even knew she needed one.

140
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,063
She mentioned something about 
who her daddy was,

141
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,856
but then she just left.

142
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,193
Yes, she got into a taxi alone.

143
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,653
Right. Yes, sir.

144
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,239
That ought to do it.

145
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,493
[groans] Where could she have gone?

146
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,495
[Kurapika] I'll search for her.

147
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,416
Do you have a map of Yorknew city?

148
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,133
[Chrollo] 
I've hear you're a good fortune-teller.

149
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,218
[Neon] Huh?

150
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,345
[Chrollo] Someone told me once.

151
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,639
I can't recall who.

152
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,643
[Neon] I am good. Important people 
are always coming to me.

153
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,520
How accurate are you?

154
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,438
[Neon] They say I'm always right.

155
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,900
"They"? What do you mean? 
Shouldn't the fortune-teller know?

156
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:10,819
[Neon] My hand moves on its own.

157
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,612
Oh, impressive.

158
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,322
Would you tell me mine?

159
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,073
Okay. Just write down your name, 
your birthday and blood type,

160
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:19,661
and I'll take it from there.

161
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,667
Think this will work?

162
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:30,463
Let's see. 
Your name's really Chrollo Lucilfer?

163
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,634
-What kind of name is that? 
-Well, my friends just call me "Boss."

164
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,263
[giggles] Boss? Wow! 
That's even weirder!

165
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,558
Okay, here goes.

166
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,157
[Kurapika] It appears your daughter

167
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,118
is already in the Cemetery Building 
on the auction site.

168
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,662
She is? How is that possible?

169
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,873
Not sure, but we need to hurry.

170
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,214
There, all done.

171
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,883
Then, can I read it?

172
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,217
Yeah, sure.

173
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,888
My fortunes are kind of strange.

174
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,182
They're usually made up 
of four or five poems.

175
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,768
Each one corresponds 
to a week of that month,

176
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,647
so the first one might just be some stuff 
that happened already.

177
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,108
Huh...

178
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,116
[Chrollo] 
Forever set, a precious moon is lost.

179
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,162
The others mourn him with ceremony grand.

180
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,875
Rising up to heaven, 
the mighty moon of frost...

181
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,503
with a melody from the mourning band.

182
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,274
[Chrollo] It's amazing. And correct.

183
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,320
About this first one...

184
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,367
Don't tell me, please! Really, I never 
look at the fortunes I write.

185
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,868
Why not?

186
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,538
I just get the feeling they'll be a lot 
more accurate if I don't get involved.

187
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,333
Then, would you mind 
if I ask you a question?

188
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,876
Sure.

189
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:36,422
[Chrollo] This verse. It makes reference 
to a requiem for the dead.

190
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,842
Do you believe in the afterlife, Neon?

191
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,636
Hmm...

192
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,138
I guess I don't. Not really.

193
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,350
Fortunes are only written 
to help the living.

194
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,645
And in this case, that's you, Mr. Chrollo.

195
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,773
A requiem doesn’t help a dead person.

196
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,860
It comforts those who’re left behind. 
That’s what I think, anyway.

197
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,241
And you're probably right.

198
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,954
Let's go. The auction preview 
is about to start.

199
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,125
[Neon] 
What I said, I heard from someone else.

200
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,501
[Chrollo] What?

201
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,838
[Neon] A fortune teller on TV 
said it when I was little.

202
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,070
You know, about what I said before 
about how

203
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:22,719
the purpose of fortunes 
is to make the living people happy.

204
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,137
Oh.

205
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:30,059
And so, the fortune-teller tried really 
hard to give negative fortunes to people.

206
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,436
Negative?

207
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:35,481
You see, that way, people would make 
an effort to improve their lives.

208
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:37,431
and to avoid misfortune.

209
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,280
Back then, I can remember being 
really inspired about how true that was.

210
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,117
That's when I decided 
I would be a fortune-teller.

211
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,543
[Chrollo] 
Forever set, a precious moon is lost.

212
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,963
The others mourn him with ceremony grand.

213
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,759
Rising up to heaven, the mighty moon 
of frost...

214
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,179
with a melody from the mourning band.

215
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,474
Harvest barren, wine-spilled

216
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,019
lovers slumber 
beside the bloody Scarlet Eyes.

217
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,730
Though cut in half shall be your number,

218
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,317
'tis not lost wherein your advantage lies.

219
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:25,490
Amuse yourself with the entr’acte. 
Seek out new friends once in a bind.

220
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:31,913
Perhaps to the east, one can be tracked. 
The one most needed you're sure to find.

221
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:38,252
A few years later, that fortune-teller 
ended up getting arrested for fraud.

222
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,048
-Do you mean the Galactic Matron? 
-That's the one!

223
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,301
If memory serves, 
she didn't believe in the afterlife.

224
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,138
She didn't, and that's why I don't believe 
in it either.

225
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,474
[elevator dings]

226
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,727
[Chrollo] 
Personally, I believe we have a soul.

227
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,770
[Neon] Hmm?

228
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:00,066
See, that's the reason I wanted to fulfil 
my dead friends' wish.

229
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:01,984
It's what he would have wanted.

230
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,027
What wish?

231
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,281
To wreak havoc.

232
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,162
[Chrollo] Are you okay?

233
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,416
Call a doctor, quickly!

234
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,169
First floor. We're over 
by the north elevator.

235
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,880
Someone's sick. Call an ambulance.

236
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,592
We can't. There's no way they're gonna 
let an ambulance come in here.

237
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,803
Not if they don't have an auction pass 
on them.

238
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,432
You're kidding me. What if she dies? 
What happens then, huh?

239
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,226
She's the daughter 
of the Nostrade Family boss!

240
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,478
If she dies here, it's on your head, 
understand?

241
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,732
[sighs] Yeah, I heard ya. 
Some of the Ten Dons are big fans of hers.

242
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,570
We're on it. Just sit tight! 
Hey, call for an ambulance!

243
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,779
[man] Right!

244
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:51,033
Hey, tell me something. 
Can you rewind what' on this monitor?

245
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,743
Hmm? Sure.

246
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,922
[assassin] The swiftest chop. 
Anyone else would have missed it.

247
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,092
I've missed this excitement.

248
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,637
[chuckles] I've found my prey.

249
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:17,977
Mr. Nostrade, your daughter is resting 
in room 501 up on the fifth floor.

250
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,194
There's simply no way she could have 
gotten her hands on a pass.

251
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,528
How did she get in?

252
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,035
[Kurapika] Your daughter's picture 
is accessible on the Hunter website.

253
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,578
[Nostrade] What?

254
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,082
Most likely, someone located this picture 
of her on the website,

255
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,252
found her and brought her here soon after.

256
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,504
[Nostrade growls]

257
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,173
I'll find that scum and kill him!

258
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,549
[Kurapika] Calm down, sir.

259
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,720
I don't think capturing your daughter 
was their primary objective.

260
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,223
It's possible they used her as a hostage

261
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,391
in case they couldn't 
get into the building.

262
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,559
[Nostrade grunts]

263
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:02,480
It's dangerous here, 
so I've called Melody and Basho.

264
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,023
They'll be here soon.

265
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,275
Are you sure it's wise 
to leave it to them?

266
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,528
[Kurapika] 
You should stay with her too, sir.

267
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,488
[Nostrade] But... the auction!

268
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,281
-[Kurapika] There won't be one. 
-Hmm?

269
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,492
This will be a battlefield.

270
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,286
The auction is sure to be canceled again.

271
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,461
[assassin] A trail of blood...

272
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,630
dripped on purpose.

273
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,343
Enough to be detected, smelled, 
by one of the same breed.

274
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,223
We are the same, he and I.

275
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,100
We're predators.

276
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,603
Both addicted to killing.

277
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,735
[Chrollo] Don't worry. 
I don't use cheap traps.

278
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,866
One-on-one?

279
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,620
Sounds good.

280
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,998
[Feitan] I have a message.

281
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,876
The boss said come 
to the Cemetery Building and wreak havoc.

282
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,464
The Cemetery Building 
is not too far from here.

283
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,800
Where are the others?

284
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,052
[Feitan] Thinking the same thing as us.

285
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,139
Cleaning up the trash 
on the way to the building.

286
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,057
[Phinks] Okay, then let's go.

287
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,020
[Feitan] There's more. 
The boss added an unusual rule this time.

288
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,646
Oh, yeah? What?

289
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,482
[Chrollo] Make it a big show.

290
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,988
[orchestral music playing]

291
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,968
[Chrollo] 
Forever set, a precious moon is lost.

292
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,722
The others mourn him with ceremony grand.

293
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,769
Rising up to heaven, the mighty moon 
of frost...

294
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,314
with a melody from the mourning band.

295
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,820
Harvest barren, wine spilled,

296
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,574
lovers slumber 
beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.

297
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:23,913
Though cut in half your number, 
'tis not lost wherein your advantage lies.

298
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:30,670
Amuse yourself with the entr’acte. 
Seek new friends once in a bind.

299
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,550
Perhaps to the east, one can be tracked.

300
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,472
The one most needed... 
you’re sure to find.

301
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,524
[assassin laughing]

302
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,986
Why, huh? Tell me why! 
[laughs] Why?

303
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,867
Why am I alive? What's happening?

304
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,163
[Chrollo] This is an Indoor Fish.

305
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,126
A Nen fish that can only live 
in enclosed spaces.

306
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,504
A carnivore that prefers human flesh.

307
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,049
You don't bleed or feel pain 
as you're eaten.

308
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,220
You can't die until the Nen fish 
disappears.

309
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,725
[assassin laughing] Won't die?

310
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,198
[moans]

311
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,702
[wind howling]

312
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,622
[breathes deeply]

313
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,711
[orchestral music playing]

314
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,546
[machine gun firing]

315
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,050
Forever set, a precious moon is lost.

316
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,888
The others mourn him with ceremony grand.

317
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,602
Rising up to heaven, the mighty moon 
of frost...

318
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,314
with a melody from the mourning band.

319
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,700
Well, Uvo...

320
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,577
Can you hear it?

321
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,291
We dedicate this requiem to you.

322
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,797
[narrator] 
It was the beginning of a stormy night,

323
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,841
that while fierce and drenched with blood,

324
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,303
was somehow overwhelmingly sad.

325
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,264
[orchestral music continues]

326
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,875
-[Gon] Coming up, Gon... 
-[Killua]...and Killua's...

327
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,418
[both] Hunterpedia!

328
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,336
-I'm Gon! 
-And I'm Killua!

329
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,504
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

330
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,257
Today, we're introducing Phinks, 
a Troupe member.

331
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,800
And he's also an Enhancer.

332
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,344
He's strong enough to punch 
straight through a body.

333
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,513
And sometimes, he dresses 
in Egyptian clothing!

334
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,098
You're thinking of Sphinx!

335
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,771
[Gon] Next time, 
"Assault x and x Impact."

336
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,524
[Killua] Oh, Gon. 
Wherefore art thou, Gon?

337
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,569
[Gon] Killua, I'm Gon. 
That's wherefore.

338
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,029
[Killua] Wait, that's it?
