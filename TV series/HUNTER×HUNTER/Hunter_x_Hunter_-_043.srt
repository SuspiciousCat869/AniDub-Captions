1
00:00:00,857 --> 00:00:02,169
[Dalzollene] At nine tonight,

2
00:00:02,349 --> 00:00:03,921
the mummy of Princess Corco

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,964
will be sold off 
at the Underground Auction.

4
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:09,982
Ivlenkov, Tocino, and Baise.

5
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:11,918
You’ll be responsible for the bidding.

6
00:00:12,343 --> 00:00:14,014
And… The rest of us?

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,907
[Dalzollene] Basho and Linssen 
will be covering the rear entrance.

8
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:21,438
Kurapika and Melody 
will take the front entrance.

9
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:25,223
Squala and I will guard the girl.

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,027
And so...

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,652
the mission will now begin.

12
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:38,000
[theme song playing]

13
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:53,572
A x SHOCKING x TRAGEDY

14
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,845
[narrator] It has come to the attention 
of the Nostrade family

15
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:03,212
that someone plans 
to attack the Underground Auction

16
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,414
which is put on by the Mafia community.

17
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:10,678
Kurapika and all of the other bodyguards 
hired by the Nostrades

18
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:12,713
have begun their assignments.

19
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,503
Looks like everyone’s here.

20
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:38,033
Almost all of them are Mafia bosses.

21
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,716
We’ve got some real heavy hitters here.

22
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:43,472
[Baise] I'm surprised.

23
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:45,332
Yeah? Why is that?

24
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:47,339
Well, this is only an auction.

25
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,753
So, they could have sent proxies 
in their place.

26
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,341
Maybe it’s because they feel 
like their honor is on the line.

27
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,134
For each winning bid,

28
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,804
five per cent goes back 
into the Mafia community.

29
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,186
It’s kind of like a commission.

30
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:03,507
[Baise] I see. So, in that case…

31
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,143
does it act as a bribe?

32
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:06,978
Like the more money they bid,

33
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,853
the more they’ll get back in return?

34
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:09,898
[Tocino] Yeah.

35
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:13,207
The Mafia has to flex its 
financial muscle somehow or other,

36
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:15,292
and this way is pretty effective.

37
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:16,952
Oh, I get it.

38
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,866
It’s basically a chance for them 
to improve their standing.

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,868
Yeah, and as a result,

40
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,954
a few of the gangs 
have actually gone bankrupt,

41
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:26,570
overbidding themselves into oblivion.

42
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,008
It should be starting any minute now.

43
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,762
UNDERGROUND AUCTION

44
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:55,166
Uh…

45
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,044
I would like to welcome you 
to the Underground Auction.

46
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:03,207
Enough formalities.

47
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:06,188
Let’s just get down 
to the business at hand, shall we?

48
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:12,591
[all three gasp]

49
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,880
Time for you to die!

50
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:16,652
[dying groans]

51
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,435
DUAL MACHINE GUN: 
AMBIDEXTROUS AUTOMATIC WEAPONS

52
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:30,604
Get down!

53
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,731
Black Balloons…

54
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,079
Protect us!

55
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,780
ELEVEN ASSISTANTS: 
THANKLESS HEROES!

56
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:46,570
[gasps in shock]

57
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,420
Is he… using Nen bullets?

58
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,625
That means he’s an Emitter, too!

59
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,693
It won’t be long before those bullets 
penetrate my Nen barrier

60
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:57,506
and rip through my body.

61
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,439
Every one of ‘em packs a hell of a punch!

62
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,816
-This isn’t good! 
-[dying groans]

63
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,721
Run away!

64
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,845
Go and tell the boss that there--

65
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,140
Go, Baise! I’ll be right behi-- [groans]

66
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:25,655
[Baise] [terrified exhale]

67
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:29,042
[cackles]

68
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,610
[Franklin] That was a lot easier 
than I thought it would be.

69
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,302
[Feitan] I didn’t get to do anything.

70
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,700
It’s all yours, Shizuku.

71
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:07,909
Right.

72
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:10,161
Blinky? Let’s go.

73
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,153
[cackling]

74
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,919
Suck up all traces of the victims 
from the room.

75
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:20,297
Their blood, body parts,

76
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,465
and all of their personal possessions.

77
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,426
Get the chairs, too.

78
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,948
Her Nen ability...

79
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:42,986
is always fun to watch.

80
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,602
-Hey. 
-Hm?

81
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:46,620
[mafioso groaning in pain]

82
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:50,357
Someone is still alive.

83
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:55,763
[mafioso 1] Who-- 
who the hell are you people, anyway?

84
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:57,105
[groans]

85
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:58,482
It doesn’t matter.

86
00:06:58,774 --> 00:07:00,712
You’re all dead, do you hear me?

87
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:04,480
The community will destroy you for this.

88
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,302
You and your entire family!

89
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:09,109
They’ll torture you…

90
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,170
they’ll cut you up…

91
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,180
They’ll make you taste hell!

92
00:07:18,615 --> 00:07:19,694
[thud]

93
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:22,400
Family?

94
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:24,274
What's that?

95
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,124
[loud gulping]

96
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,937
[Melody] I can’t hear it very clearly,

97
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,709
but there’s a commotion going on 
inside the building.

98
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,170
[Kurapika] Something must have happened.

99
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,003
Contact the leader!

100
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:46,839
I understand.

101
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:49,344
I’ll call Linssen and Basho, too.

102
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,311
And I want the both of you to head inside.

103
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,850
[mafioso 2] Wait…

104
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:57,483
What?

105
00:07:58,108 --> 00:07:59,938
[mafioso 3] There’s no one here…

106
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,109
[mafioso 4] 
Where did they go? Search the place!

107
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,194
[mafioso 5] 
Hey, what happened to the merchandise?!

108
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,863
[mafioso 6] 
Get outta here! Head underground, now!

109
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,840
I’m inside,

110
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:15,902
and it appears that everyone 
in the auction house has disappeared.

111
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:16,888
[Dalzollene] What?

112
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:18,999
The whole place is in a state of panic.

113
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:21,131
It’s completely out of control.

114
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:25,010
The merchandise. 
What about the merchandise?

115
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,446
[Kurapika] Melody is heading 
to the underground safe.

116
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,900
[mafioso 7] It-- it’s empty!

117
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,556
[mafioso 8] The goods for today’s auction…

118
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,016
they’ve been stolen!

119
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,018
[mafioso 7] Who could’ve done this?

120
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,326
[mafioso 8] Damn it!

121
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,769
Where the hell did they go?!

122
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:42,706
[mafioso 9] 
Split up and look for ‘em, you idiot!

123
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,857
[mafioso 10] Let’s go!

124
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,359
Get the word out to every family! 
And quick!

125
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:50,928
[Dalzollene] Okay, understood.

126
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:54,659
We’re going to catch those thieves, 
no matter what it takes.

127
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,215
I’m on my way now.

128
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:59,831
Rendezvous with Linssen and Basho 
behind the building.

129
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,750
They’ll meet you in the Central Square.

130
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,728
-Squala. 
-Yes, sir.

131
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,602
[Dalzollene] Leave five dogs behind…

132
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:07,964
just in case.

133
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:09,132
Right.

134
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,230
[Dalzollene] Listen up!

135
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,926
Don’t take your eyes off the boss!

136
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:14,927
And don’t let anyone in the room 
until we’re back.

137
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,556
[both] Yes, sir.

138
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:19,317
[mafioso 11] All of the roads are sealed.

139
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,978
The only remaining escape route is by air!

140
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,821
If you see any suspicious aircraft, 
contact me immediately.

141
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:27,840
But make sure not to kill them!

142
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,519
The community has offered a large reward 
to the gang that finds the thieves.

143
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,209
Remember! 
You have to take them alive!

144
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:44,334
[Boss] No merchandise?

145
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,877
[Uvogin] None.

146
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:48,713
In fact, the vault was completely empty.

147
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:52,089
The auctioneer was the only one 
who knew the whole situation,

148
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:54,025
and according to him,

149
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,769
all of the items were taken 
to a new location a few hours ago.

150
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,438
It’s like...

151
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:03,016
they expected this to happen 
and were fully prepared for it.

152
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,393
Oh?

153
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:08,416
Don’t you think the timing 
is just a little too coincidental?

154
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,658
If you wanna know what I think…

155
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,254
we’ve got a Judas among us.

156
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,701
So, you're saying...

157
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,392
that one of us is a traitor?

158
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,430
[Boss] No.

159
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,141
There isn’t a traitor.

160
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:29,927
And if you ask me...

161
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:31,945
Judas was nothing of the sort.

162
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,134
It’s said that Judas betrayed Jesus 
for 30 pieces of silver.

163
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,604
But to betray all of us…

164
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:43,615
what would one ask of the Mafia?

165
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,537
Think about it.

166
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:51,943
What would the traitor gain 
by selling us out to them?

167
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,654
Money?

168
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,281
Fame?

169
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:57,646
Status?

170
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:02,987
Would that be enough to gratify any of us?

171
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,846
Or to slake our thirst in any way?

172
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:09,341
[pensive inhale] 
Nobody I’ve met is like that, no.

173
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,591
[Boss] Of course not.

174
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:14,554
And that’s not all that doesn’t add up.

175
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:15,842
It’s not?

176
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,317
If there was an informant,

177
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:21,055
the Mafia’s response 
was pitifully inadequate.

178
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,747
If they had known beforehand,

179
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:26,334
that Class-A bounties 
would appear at the auction

180
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:27,843
from out of nowhere,

181
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,296
they certainly would have 
bolstered their security.

182
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,094
The guests came unarmed

183
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,110
which tells me no one warned them.

184
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:39,579
I can’t argue with that.

185
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,328
And that is why I believe...

186
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,581
that while someone did tip them off,

187
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,833
it wasn’t terribly specific.

188
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,668
However...

189
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,213
someone high up in the Mafia community

190
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,362
believed that information.

191
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:00,684
Okay, I think I follow you.

192
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:04,263
But I don’t see how this information 
is getting from A to B.

193
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,699
Whatever.

194
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:08,895
So, what do you want us to do now?

195
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,012
When you spoke with the auctioneer,

196
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:14,823
did you ask where the merchandise 
was moved?

197
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:15,966
[Uvogin] I did,

198
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,248
but he kept insisting he didn’t know,

199
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:20,112
all the way up until he died.

200
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,742
And Feitan tortured him, so…

201
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:26,955
He had the worst luck of anyone today.

202
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:31,684
[Boss] Did you manage to get the names 
of anyone who might know?

203
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,659
Do you even have to ask?

204
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:38,121
The auction is run 
by the heads of the Mafia community.

205
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:43,018
Leaders of gangs in each 
of the ten districts around the world.

206
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:45,812
They’re called... the Ten Dons.

207
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:50,067
This is the one time of year 
that all ten gather in one place

208
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:52,586
to discuss business and issue orders…

209
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:55,889
orders which are carried out 
by a special force

210
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:57,527
called the Shadow Beasts.

211
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,904
The team is comprised of combatants

212
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:01,956
which are hand-picked by each Don.

213
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,689
The best of the best.

214
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,703
Ah, I see.

215
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,869
And since the Shadow Beasts

216
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:11,249
weren’t called upon 
to guard the auction house,

217
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:14,127
the theory that they 
didn’t know we were coming

218
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,109
has even more credibility.

219
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,723
[Uvogin] That does make sense.

220
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,014
[Boss] The question remains:

221
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,525
how did they move the merchandise?

222
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,638
That’s what I’m wondering.

223
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,517
I heard a single Shadow Beast member 
turned up at the vault.

224
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:36,196
The safe itself is 25 square meters

225
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:39,727
and it was packed full of items 
waiting to be auctioned off.

226
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:45,263
He walked in and then 
walked right back out, empty-handed.

227
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:48,291
The vault was completely bare.

228
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,928
It was a guy in sunglasses 
who called himself the Owl.

229
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:58,046
He must have a Nen Ability 
quite similar to Shizuku’s.

230
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,586
[Uvogin] Probably.

231
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:00,673
But surely,

232
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:04,677
once 500 people disappeared, 
they had to realize…

233
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:09,140
that they’re dealing with Nen users.

234
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,201
We can take them, can’t we?

235
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,258
[Boss] Of course.

236
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:17,287
Put on a show for the pursuers.

237
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:20,777
A disturbance big enough 
to draw out the Shadow Beasts.

238
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,562
[Uvogin chuckling excitedly] 
I can hardly wait!

239
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,581
[mafioso 12] It’s them! 
They’re in a hot air balloon!

240
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,460
[mafioso 13] Looks like It’s headed 
for the Gordeau Desert! We're in pursuit!

241
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,327
[leader 1] A hot air balloon? 
Not an airship?

242
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:41,870
[leader 2] That’s impossible!

243
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,008
Then what happened 
to the hundreds of guests?

244
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:46,886
[leader 3] You know I’m starting to think, 
maybe we’re not dealing

245
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,470
with an ordinary band 
of armed thugs after all…

246
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,520
Huh?

247
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,681
[leader 2] Get the Ten Dons on the phone!

248
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,959
Ask them to dispatch 
the Shadow Beasts!

249
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:56,259
Go!

250
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,318
They’re moving. 
Head for the Gordeau Desert.

251
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,403
Okay!

252
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,255
Roger that.

253
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,303
[mafioso 14] Get down here right now

254
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:34,748
and we’ll even let you decide 
whether we drown you or bury you!

255
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:36,999
[amused laugh]

256
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,186
Just look at the reception 
we’re getting, huh?

257
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:42,024
I’m not gonna have to clean 
all this up, am I?

258
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,651
[Feitan] They’re not worth it.

259
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,694
[Uvogin] Hey!

260
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,018
You guys can stay out of this.

261
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:49,379
I’ll take care of ‘em myself!

262
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:53,925
[mafioso 15] Wait!

263
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,232
Are you the ones 
who kidnapped all of our guests?

264
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,303
Yeah.

265
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:12,513
Well, you sure have a lot of guts,

266
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,229
I’ll give you that much.

267
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:16,601
Now which one of you is the leader?

268
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,583
[silly chuckling]

269
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,106
You punk!

270
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:28,801
[gasps]

271
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:32,548
[throaty chuckling]

272
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:33,949
[terrified groan]

273
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,792
[growling]

274
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,317
[roars]

275
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:57,305
[Nobunaga] His philosophy is simple:

276
00:16:57,605 --> 00:17:00,458
Be stronger than anyone or anything.

277
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,052
Nothing more.

278
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,922
It’d take a heck of a lot more 
than an ordinary gun

279
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:08,325
to leave even a small scratch on him.

280
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:10,702
[Feitan] Physically, he’s the strongest.

281
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,139
[Franklin] It’s like watching a gorilla 
stomping ants.

282
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,393
[Nobunaga] They just keep coming, huh?

283
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:21,780
Don’t those guys realize 
they’re only gonna end up dead?

284
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,960
You know, just watching isn’t much fun.

285
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,586
Does anyone want to play cards?

286
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,727
-I do. 
-Count me in.

287
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,729
Look!

288
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:34,083
I see 'em.

289
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:42,969
[Uvogin sighs disappointedly]

290
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:47,850
This won’t even get me warmed up 
before the Shadow Beasts get here.

291
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:59,468
[groans] Ow…

292
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,846
A rifle?

293
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:04,873
That is so annoying.

294
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:08,879
Trying to take me out from afar, huh?

295
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:11,395
[gasps]

296
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:14,748
[short grunt of pain]

297
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:20,922
Oh yeah! That was a perfect shot!

298
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:22,557
[leader 4] That's enough!

299
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,378
Don’t flatter yourself, you monster.

300
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:27,940
You’re not all that tough.

301
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,632
This super-bazooka is powerful enough

302
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:32,400
to take out a tank.

303
00:18:33,402 --> 00:18:35,429
I’m about to blow you to bits!

304
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:38,306
That… hurt my feelings.

305
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:42,654
See I don’t like being compared 
to some measly little tank.

306
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,332
You’re dead!

307
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,631
Did I get him?

308
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,979
-[shocked gulp] 
-[gasps]

309
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:06,020
Well, whaddya know? 
That actually kinda hurt.

310
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:08,002
[terrified shouts]

311
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:13,942
[derisive snort] 
You think I’m gonna let you get away?!

312
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:18,532
[Kurapika] 
It appears that the enemy can use Nen.

313
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,760
And he’s incredibly powerful.

314
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,915
The men who got here first are all dead.

315
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,351
Firearms are useless against him.

316
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,595
That’s impossible…

317
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,214
Take a good look and see for yourself.

318
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:38,199
His aura’s simply unbelievable.

319
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,453
As is the body count.

320
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,432
It’s insane.

321
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:47,267
Just what is he, anyway?

322
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,304
Don’t know.

323
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:51,629
But he’s tearing through all those people 
like scraps of paper!

324
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:52,981
Look, just forget it!

325
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,156
No way I’m trying to capture that!

326
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:56,946
He’s got a point there.

327
00:19:57,156 --> 00:19:58,447
If we can beat him,

328
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,871
I don’t see how.

329
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:02,640
-I agree. 
-[Squala] Huh?

330
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:05,710
However, we still have our mission

331
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,915
and we can’t just walk away now.

332
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:09,180
But still…!

333
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:10,380
Hold on!

334
00:20:11,598 --> 00:20:13,668
I can’t tell where it’s coming from

335
00:20:14,318 --> 00:20:16,090
but I hear another heartbeat.

336
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:27,532
[both gasp]

337
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,863
I am the Shadow Beast, Worm.

338
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,775
Which family do you belong to?

339
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,336
[Dalzollene] We’re bodyguards.

340
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,772
We’ve been hired by the Nostrade family.

341
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:45,619
I understand.

342
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,278
It seems that you can use Nen a bit

343
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:49,788
but don’t bother.

344
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,311
[Shadow Beast] 
These are no ordinary thugs.

345
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,756
To them, killing’s a part 
of their daily routine.

346
00:20:57,231 --> 00:21:00,432
You could say 
that they’re professional killers.

347
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,472
And as pros ourselves, we’ll handle it.

348
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:08,768
My name’s Rabid Dog.

349
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:10,392
And mine is Leech.

350
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:12,977
You, uh... can call me Porcupine.

351
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:18,068
Sit back and leave this job 
to the Shadow Beasts.

352
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,338
It’s them…

353
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:24,992
the Shadow Beasts!

354
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:30,095
[narrator] The Mafia community 
has unleashed the dreaded Shadow Beasts

355
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,655
upon the bandits who attacked the auction.

356
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:36,635
And Kurapika has yet to realize 
that these bandits,

357
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,461
they will soon meet in battle

358
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,166
are, in fact... the Phantom Troupe.

359
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,595
[theme song playing]

360
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,542
[Gon] Coming up:

361
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:53,017
-Gon... 
-[Killua] ...and Killua’s…

362
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,623
[both] Hunterpedia!

363
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:56,296
-I’m Gon! 
-I’m Killua!

364
00:22:56,371 --> 00:22:57,715
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

365
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:59,422
Today, we're introducing Baise!

366
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:01,505
Her ability’s Instant Lover.

367
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,007
She pretends she’s into a guy,

368
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,800
-then she goes in for a kiss! 
-[smack]

369
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,366
So, all you men better be careful!

370
00:23:06,477 --> 00:23:07,728
[both] Smooch!

371
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,874
[Gon] Next time: 
"Buildup x to a x Fierce Battle"!

372
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:17,319
So, uh… 
Do bananas count as a snack?

373
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,312
[Killua] What about chocolate? 
Is that a snack?

374
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:21,147
[Gon] Yeah, it’s always been a snack!
