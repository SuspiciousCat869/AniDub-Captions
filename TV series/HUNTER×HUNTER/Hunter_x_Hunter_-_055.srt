1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,754
Did you sell out Uvo?

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,589
Answer me!

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,508
[thunder crashing]

4
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,680
[Nobunaga] I'll take that as a yes.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,307
Move!

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,185
Now, hold on a minute. 
Let's hear what he has to say.

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,395
Are you kidding? 
What's there to say?

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,482
Just calm down, alright? 
Remember what the boss said.

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,527
There are ways we can avoid the events 
that are predicted in the fortune.

10
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,030
Hisoka, explain to us 
what happened this week.

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,074
[Hisoka] I cannot.

12
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,158
Huh?

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:37,996
Sorry, but all that I can tell you 
is that the first poem was accurate.

14
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,749
Nothing more, I'm afraid.

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,628
-Do you hear that? Move! 
-Wait. Not just yet.

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,672
Hisoka, why can't you explain?

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,968
Because telling you would amount 
to saying what I cannot.

18
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,678
So, I say nothing.

19
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,389
But it's not that I won't tell,

20
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,684
it's that I can't say more 
than I already have.

21
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,437
If you won't accept that answer,

22
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,482
then for the sake of defending myself...

23
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,986
I have no other choice but to fight.

24
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,281
[theme music playing]

25
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,862
ALLIES x AND x LIES

26
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,406
[narrator] After seeing his fortune,

27
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,451
Nobunaga suspects Hisoka 
has betrayed them,

28
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,244
and draws his sword.

29
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,755
[scoffs] Forget it. 
You're way too much of a pain to fight.

30
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,384
Yeah right! Like that would stop me!

31
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,011
[gasps]

32
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,888
What?

33
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,391
[Chrollo] Nobunaga.

34
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,228
-Be quiet a moment. 
-Huh?

35
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,649
-Did the boss just do that? 
-Probably.

36
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,278
Hisoka, I have some questions for you.

37
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,989
Answer them if you can.

38
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,744
In the fortune, tell me, 
what does "secrets" mean?

39
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,705
[Hisoka] The Troupe members' powers.

40
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,873
[Chrollo] How many of them?

41
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,335
Seven. No, excuse me, eight.

42
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:35,090
You and Uvogin, Shizuku, Machi, Franklin,

43
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,051
Pakunoda, Shalnark and I make eight.

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,724
Hmm. You only learned 
of Kortopi's ability yesterday?

45
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,517
[Hisoka] That's correct.

46
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,770
-What's the chain-user's ability? 
-Can't say.

47
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,898
-Can you say what he looks like? 
-I cannot.

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,818
And what is your relationship to him?

49
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,361
I can't tell you.

50
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,615
I understand.

51
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,620
BANDIT'S SECRET

52
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:12,753
The red-eyed customer is the chain user, 
who possesses no fewer than two abilities.

53
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,298
The one that he used to capture Uvogin,

54
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:20,385
and the other is one 
that restricts Hisoka's actions.

55
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:25,390
The "sword of law," the phrase mentioned 
in the second poem of the fortune

56
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,435
forces a person to obey a set of rules.

57
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,897
Such as "don't lie to me."

58
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,441
Or "do not reveal anything about me."

59
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,151
Something of that nature.

60
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,154
And it would also stand to reason

61
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,866
that he planted something 
that's inside of Hisoka's body.

62
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,159
[chuckles]

63
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,289
The poem starts by mentioning 
a trade of sorts,

64
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,876
but the second half just describes 
what the customer took.

65
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,797
And this would seem to suggest 
that the sword of law

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,757
was used to attack Hisoka.

67
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,595
In other words, Hisoka was forced 
to betray us against his will.

68
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,765
[Hisoka] Oh, so good.

69
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:12,270
If the sword can curb Hisoka's speech, 
it must be quite powerful indeed.

70
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,107
[Hisoka] Yes, I knew you were brilliant.

71
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,487
I'm definitely going to enjoy... 
killing you.

72
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,948
Now, let's all review what we know.

73
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,408
First off, the enemy uses chains.

74
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:29,162
A Manipulator would be using 
actual physical chains in battle.

75
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:33,208
If he's a Conjurer, then he took down Uvo 
by using Nen chains.

76
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,669
So is there a difference 
between those two?

77
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,923
[Shalnark] Yes, a big one. 
A Conjurer can appear to be empty-handed.

78
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,217
That's a huge advantage.

79
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,677
I see.

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,513
Conjurers have to do lots 
of visual training,

81
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,724
but once they have, they can make 
their weapons appear at will.

82
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,728
But our real problem at the moment 
is what's restricting Hisoka.

83
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,357
[Franklin] A sword of law must involve 
rules he has to follow.

84
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,987
[Shalnark] Yes, he's probably forced 
to follow the orders Chrollo talked about.

85
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,865
He's likely barred 
from attacking the chain user, as well.

86
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,534
And he would probably die 
if he broke his promise.

87
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,913
[Hisoka chuckling] How fun.

88
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,500
There's no sword of law 
anywhere in my body.

89
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,504
That fortune was my own creation.

90
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,926
I only revealed the abilities 
of two members, not eight.

91
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:30,765
It was a risky gamble, one that would 
have turned the entire Troupe against me

92
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,934
had the boss not figured that out.

93
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,022
All this to keep the spiders 
in Yorknew City,

94
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,858
so I can fight the boss.

95
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:46,323
If they were to leave now, 
there's no telling when I'd see him again.

96
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,996
But then what is Hisoka's second poem 
supposed to mean?

97
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,958
It says "The 11-legged spider 
longs for home.

98
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,669
Five more legs shall break 
before it's done.

99
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:04,758
But from your shelter do not roam, 
for of those five, you shall be one."

100
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:10,639
Our hideout. That's the temporary shelter. 
If Hisoka leaves here, he'll die.

101
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,141
What about the longing for home?

102
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,018
It means that we're homesick.

103
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,438
[Shalnark] But if we do go back home, 
then half of us won't survive.

104
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,148
Okay, I get it.

105
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:24,986
Uvo, Hisoka, Shizuku, Pakunoda 
and Shalnark.

106
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,072
One more makes half the members.

107
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,825
Did the fortune predict any other deaths?

108
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,870
It has to be Feitan, Kortopi or me.

109
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,248
We didn't have all the data we needed 
to get our fortunes told.

110
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,168
I'm staying right here for the time being.

111
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,463
There's are things that I still wish to do 
before I die.

112
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,466
I won't be leaving our shelter.

113
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,345
Well, boss, what now?

114
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,973
[Phinks] Leave or stay?

115
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,734
[Chrollo] Let's stay.

116
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,070
[Killua] No way.

117
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,573
Wait, but why not? You were the one 
who wanted to go and capture

118
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,242
the Phantom Troupe in the first place.

119
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,995
Yeah, well that was back when it wouldn't 
have been pointless.

120
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,705
But why is it pointless?

121
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,915
'Cause there's no reward money anymore,

122
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,918
so you would be taking 
a huge risk for absolutely nothing.

123
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,256
Maybe so, but it'd be worth it to finally 
capture the Phantom Troupe, wouldn't it?

124
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,259
You really need to take a hard look 
at your priorities.

125
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,846
Do you even remember why we're here? 
Well, do you?

126
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,640
-For Greed Island. 
-Exactly!

127
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,685
The Southern Piece auction 
starts in two days,

128
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,271
so we need to make a whole lot 
of money before then.

129
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,607
Actually, I have a great idea 
about how we can get the game.

130
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,609
You've got a plan, fill me in.

131
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,155
Hmm. It's a secret right now!

132
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,658
[groaning] Stop being such a little tease 
and spit it out!

133
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,661
I can't breathe! You're gonna kill me!

134
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,623
Anyway, I'll figure out something 
for the game, but for now,

135
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,167
we should keep trailing the Troupe.

136
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,378
Do you really have a plan 
to get Greed Island?

137
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,715
Yeah, but it isn't guaranteed to work 
or anything.

138
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,551
Well, okay then, how likely is it to work?

139
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,929
Like, what's the probability of success?

140
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,807
Uh, maybe 70 percent.

141
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,353
-Seventy? 
-I mean, maybe more like 60.

142
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,941
[Killua] So, it's probably 50-50.

143
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,652
But still, I guess that’s a lot better

144
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,655
than trying to earn six billion Jenny 
in two days.

145
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,783
[Killua] Okay, fine.

146
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,993
I'll let you be in charge of Greed Island,

147
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,455
but it'd be stupid to try to deal 
with the Troupe on our own.

148
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:44,042
We'll need Kurapika's help. 
We can't do this without him.

149
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,293
Hmm.

150
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,172
[Melody] Where are you off to, boss?

151
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,967
I'm going shopping. 
I told you that earlier, didn't I?

152
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,347
[Melody] Basho and I will accompany you. 
You okay here, Squala?

153
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:58,973
No problem.

154
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,184
[Squala] That was close!

155
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,020
[Melody] 
Guard those Scarlet Eyes well, alright?

156
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,982
Sure. As long as these guys are here, 
I should be fine.

157
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,735
[dogs whining]

158
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,737
[Melody] Okay, I'm off.

159
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,156
[Squala] Yeah, I'll see you later.

160
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,123
[footsteps approaching]

161
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,374
How did it go?

162
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,501
I couldn't get a straight answer.

163
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:31,589
I asked the community for any updates 
regarding the auction today, but no luck.

164
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,801
You should go back there and tell them 
the Troupe is still alive!

165
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,178
That ought to make them 
change their minds.

166
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,223
I'm afraid that still 
won't change anything.

167
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,810
The Mafia wants to avoid any friction 
with Meteor City.

168
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,939
I think it's safe to assume that their war 
on the Phantom Troupe is over.

169
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,399
Really?

170
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,902
But that wasn't the information 
I was hoping to find.

171
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,657
My only real concern is whether 
the auction will proceed as planned.

172
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,618
Are you thinking of intercepting them?

173
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,580
That's insane!

174
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,167
How do you think you're gonna do that 
without the Mafia's help, huh?

175
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,752
You have it all wrong, Leorio.

176
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,173
I'm not counting on the Mafia. 
Far from it.

177
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,799
[gasps]

178
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,094
[Gon] 
Hey, Kurapika, let us help you, okay?

179
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,472
We'll do anything. 
Just tell us what you need.

180
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,266
[Killua] Come on, say no.

181
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,270
-But the reward was rescinded. 
-[Gon] I know.

182
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,940
I still want to stop the Troupe. 
I haven't changed my mind about that.

183
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,360
[Killua] Turn him down. 
Turn him down!

184
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,946
You'd be risking your lives.

185
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,241
[Killua] 
Great. Throw a little fuel on the fire.

186
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,331
Right. Then let's discuss it.

187
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,415
Okay.

188
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,666
[Killua] He agreed?

189
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,879
First, we're gonna need someone 
to watch their base

190
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,088
and to provide updates.

191
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,924
Yeah, I can do that.

192
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,551
[Kurapika] We only want the woman 
called Pakunoda.

193
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,012
-You can ignore the others. 
-Okay.

194
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,056
Be incredibly careful.

195
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,558
Oh, don't worry. I won't push my luck.

196
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,645
I'm also going to need a driver 
to accompany me.

197
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,897
Leorio, can I count on you?

198
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,733
[spluttering] Yeah.

199
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,943
It'll be fine.

200
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,111
You'll be totally safe 
if you're with Kurapika.

201
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,988
[Leorio] Oh, knock it off, Killua.

202
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,200
You're making it sound like I'm terrified 
or something, and I'm totally not!

203
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,952
Okay, what about me?

204
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,955
[Kurapika] Create a diversion 
that will draw their focus.

205
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,956
Got it.

206
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,251
Hey, wait a minute! 
That job sounds way too dangerous.

207
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,212
You really expect Gon 
to face the Troupe members again?

208
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,047
[Kurapika] Depends on our strategy.

209
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,591
I'm listening. What kind of strategy?

210
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,551
A simple one, actually.

211
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,720
While the enemy is busy dealing with Gon,

212
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,723
I'll capture Pakunoda 
and quietly make my escape.

213
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,226
That plan sounds a little shaky to me.

214
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,561
[Kurapika] 
Perhaps, but there are too many variables

215
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,605
to devise anything more concrete.

216
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,401
Now, as for Gon's strategy, 
I'll let him decide that.

217
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,903
Just hold their attention 
for at least half a second,

218
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,571
a full second if possible.

219
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,490
A full second, if I can?

220
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,491
[Kurapika] Yes.

221
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,954
[Gon] 
Keep their attention for a whole second?

222
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,748
Can I do that?

223
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,001
[Kurapika] Gon.

224
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,753
You're the key to this plan. 
Can you handle it?

225
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,048
I'm not really sure. I need time to think.

226
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,801
We have six hours.

227
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,762
If the auction proceeds as scheduled...

228
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,266
the spiders will make their move 
before then.

229
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:35,231
Hey, you never let us help you before. 
Why start now?

230
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:40,862
Because the risk I'm taking has grown. 
I must eliminate Pakunoda immediately.

231
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,947
No matter the cost.

232
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,325
[Killua gasps] Wow.

233
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,245
[Leorio] So, this is why Kurapika 
seems so different.

234
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,956
His resolve's gotten even stronger.

235
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,834
Kurapika.

236
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,795
Could you use your Nen dagger on me?

237
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,798
-[gasps] 
-What are you talking about?

238
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,051
Yeah, weren't you listening?

239
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,429
If Kurapika attacks someone who's not 
a Spider, he'll die!

240
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,722
Keep your voice down!

241
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:12,352
Then I don't get it. Kurapika has 
a Nen dagger in his chest, doesn't he?

242
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,686
[gasping]

243
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,898
I mean, since he's not a member 
of the Phantom Troupe...

244
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,905
What I'm about to say 
will make the risk I face even greater.

245
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,991
Okay.

246
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,953
Let's go, Killua.

247
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,595
The answer to your question is yes. 
It's possible.

248
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,934
Each of my five chains has a separate 
and unique function.

249
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,313
And two of them are to be used 
solely against the Spiders.

250
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,691
This one is Chain Jail.

251
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,445
It restrains the target and forces them 
into a state of Zetsu.

252
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,490
This is for capturing Spiders.

253
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,413
This one is called Judgment Chain.

254
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:19,127
I stab the target's heart with this dagger 
and declare a binding rule.

255
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,547
Break that rule and you die.

256
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,429
As you're aware, there's a Nen dagger 
residing in my own heart, as well.

257
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,475
At first, I planned to use it on myself 
on the condition that I would die

258
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,895
if I ever used my chains 
against anyone outside the Troupe.

259
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,065
But then I realized 
I had missed something.

260
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:45,069
What if attacking myself meant breaking 
the very rule I had set?

261
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,738
[thunder crashing]

262
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,661
It was possible I would be an exception,

263
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,289
but there was no way for me 
to know for sure.

264
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,583
So, I adjusted the rule further.

265
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,588
I will only use my Chain Jail 
against the Phantom Troupe.

266
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,009
That means I can use Judgment Chain 
on anyone I choose.

267
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,513
But that chain has a condition too.

268
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,390
But what kind of condition?

269
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,395
[Kurapika] This chain can only be used 
when my eyes are scarlet.

270
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,148
Hey, wait. You can change them yourself?

271
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,275
It took practice.

272
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,737
It was a while before I could turn them 
scarlet at will.

273
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,994
I mastered the power in my middle finger 
by vowing never to release the chain

274
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,746
and to always risk death.

275
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:41,042
The one in my little finger was resolved 
by my unique nature.

276
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,463
When my eyes turn scarlet 
is when I become a Specialist.

277
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,801
And I gain the ability to use 
any power I've learned at full strength.

278
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,182
I'm not sure what all that means,

279
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,185
but what about your Nen dagger? 
You can use it on me, can't you?

280
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,687
Yes.

281
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,483
Go ahead. Set whatever rule you want.

282
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,112
You're dedicated. I appreciate that.

283
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,158
Just curious. Can you make three 
of those daggers?

284
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,035
You can just cancel it, right?

285
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,412
Erase the rule as soon 
as the mission's over?

286
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,956
Killua! Leorio!

287
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,708
Killua and I had a little talk.

288
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,796
-And since we're working together... 
-[Killua] We should risk together.

289
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,631
[Killua and Leorio] What do you say?

290
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,094
The answer to both is yes.

291
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,681
But all three of you 
are making a big mistake.

292
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,726
I want you to know, 
I never had any intention

293
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,436
of using my dagger on you guys.

294
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:47,233
Well, then why did you put yourself 
in danger by telling us your secret?

295
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,068
[Kurapika] I wanted to thank you, Gon.

296
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,072
No, I wanted to thank all of you 
for your resolve.

297
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,452
And if one of you ends up 
revealing my secret, which I doubt,

298
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,788
I still won't regret a thing.

299
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,587
I have been blessed with good friends.

300
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,845
That's not fair, Kurapika.

301
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,431
Because the pressure of risking my life

302
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,933
isn't nearly as bad 
as letting down a friend.

303
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,061
That was my goal from the beginning.

304
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,648
Oh, okay! I get it now! [laughing]

305
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,775
[Kurapika chuckling]

306
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,861
[Killua] That is so not funny!

307
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:34,614
Alright.

308
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,576
Well, I'm heading out. 
There's no time to waste.

309
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,995
Be real careful out there, Killua!

310
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,581
Yeah. You just leave it to me.

311
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,669
[thunder rumbling]

312
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,551
[Shizuku] In the chamber 
of treasure ill-gotten,

313
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,220
there is no choice but endless sleep.

314
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:04,644
Your greatest fear should solitude be, 
lest upon your lonesome form he creep.

315
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,565
[Pakunoda] 
On a day dark and poorly lit,

316
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,235
a simple choice: betrayal or pride.

317
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,364
In a cramped room, you must face it.

318
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,575
For the reaper lingers at your side.

319
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:27,583
[Shalnark] Even one call do not make. 
When needed most, it won't connect.

320
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,045
To answer your phone, another mistake.

321
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,131
One time in three, 
the reaper calls collect.

322
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,885
Now, let's split up into groups.

323
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,763
That's how we'll operate 
for the next week.

324
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,724
Make absolutely sure you're never alone.

325
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,770
Shizuku, Pakunoda and Machi.

326
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,357
Kortopi, Phinks and Feitan.

327
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,069
Nobunaga and Shalnark are with me.

328
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,824
Bonolenov, Franklin 
and Hisoka will stay here.

329
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,410
Hey, boss, just so you know...

330
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,621
Some little kids, 
they know about this place.

331
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,706
[Chrollo] Kids?

332
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,709
Well, they don't have anything 
to do with the chain user,

333
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,586
but I can't help but be 
a little bit worried.

334
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,463
Oh, yeah, I totally forgot!

335
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,466
Hey boss, I think we ought to recruit 
these kids.

336
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,262
[Machi] Whoa, hold on. That wasn't 
why I mentioned them, Nobunaga.

337
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,639
What do you mean?

338
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,854
[Chrollo] I see. 
They do sound rather interesting.

339
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:34,692
But from what you've told me, 
it doesn't sound like they'll join us.

340
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,778
Then we'll change their minds. 
It's worth meeting them, at least.

341
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,156
[Machi] No, boss, don't listen to him.

342
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,492
Alright, Machi, what is the source 
of your concern?

343
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,620
It's... just a hunch.

344
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,416
A hunch? Your instincts are too reliable 
to ignore.

345
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,837
It could be there's something important 
about those kids.

346
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,509
Let's make more dummy hideouts 
just to be safe.

347
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,012
Kortopi, can you make me ten more?

348
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,097
I can make 50.

349
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:09,018
And the second anyone enters 
one of the fakes, I'll know.

350
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,439
See, my copies act as my En, too.

351
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,616
[Killua] Something's not right. 
Am I in the wrong place?

352
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,826
No, that's impossible.

353
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,204
No way!

354
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,749
There weren't this many buildings before!

355
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,709
[thunder crashing]

356
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:46,096
[narrator] As rain falls, the operation 
to capture Pakunoda begins.

357
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,017
[theme music playing]

358
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,460
-[Gon] Coming up, Gon... 
-[Killua] And Killua's...

359
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,879
[both] Hunterpedia!

360
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,881
-I'm Gon! 
-I'm Killua!

361
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,132
[both] And this is our Hunterpedia!

362
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,385
Today, we're introducing Feitan, 
another Troupe member.

363
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,512
His hobby is torture, 
which is pretty awesome.

364
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,973
[darkly] And he's interested 
in Greed Island too.

365
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,808
That's a pretty terrible impression.

366
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,858
[Gon] Next time: 
"Beloved and Beleaguered."

367
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,318
-[Killua] Shepherd. 
-[Gon] Woof!

368
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,986
-[Killua] Maltese. 
-[Gon] Woof!

369
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,738
-[Killua] Pomeranian. 
-[Gon] Woof!

370
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,489
-[Killua] Gon. 
-[Gon] Hi!
