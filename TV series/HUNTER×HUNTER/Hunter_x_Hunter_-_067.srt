162
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,495
You wanna go back home?

163
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,598
I think we can help you.

♪

165
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,177
Okay, now we’ve got
four specified-slot cards

166
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,512
for three leaves.

167
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:29,016
Killua: Yeah, making a total
of 54 types in all.

168
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,918
All: Score!

169
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,088
Bisky: All right,
all of the cards

170
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,192
that wouldn’t fit in our binders
have reverted into items.

171
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,060
Killua: Looks like
we’re running out

172
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,595
of free slots pretty fast.

173
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,330
We should probably organize ’em.

174
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:47,934
We’ve got 135 free slots
between the three of us,

175
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,938
so we should each
leave five slots free.

176
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,373
Gon: How about you keep
the spell cards, killua?

177
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,643
Killua: Bisky needs
a few defensive ones.

178
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,145
Bisky: Hold on!
I have to use spell cards?

179
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,647
No way.
Those are far too confusing.

180
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,650
Killua: Then study!
What the hell?!

181
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,252
Okay.

Book.

183
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,589
So up to this point,

184
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,058
we’ve been deliberately
avoiding the other players.

185
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,561
But now there are
certain cards we really need,

186
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,330
so we’ll
have to take some risks.

( Gon grunts )

188
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,034
Bisky: Well, I suggest
we get all that we can ourselves

189
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,269
and then actively negotiate

190
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,571
with other players
we meet on the way.

191
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,273
That sound good to you?

192

199
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,486
It’s just a transformed fake.

200

i’m really sorry about that.

( Chuckling )
Here’s the real one.

202
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,695
Killua: You can’t trust
any of these guys, huh?

203
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,597
We’d better stay
on the defensive.

204
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,500
Bisky: No joke. We’re lucky
he has that necklace.

205
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,435
It certainly comes in handy.

206
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,372
Gon: Okay, I got a question.

207
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,408
This necklace is supposed to be
able to remove curses, right?

208
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,144
Killua: From spell cards,
but not any others.

209
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:06,414
Gon: Oh.
Guess it won’t work, then.

210

Killua: What,
you have an idea, gon?

211
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,384
Gon: I was just wondering
if maybe a curse

212
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,388
was behind the disease those
villagers were suffering from.

213
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,622
Killua: What villagers?

214
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,459

I remember those guys.

The ones who took
all your money, right?

216
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,332
I doubt that would work,
because they’re not cards.

217
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,466
Killua: Right.

218
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,070
But still,
it might be worth a shot.

Could you and I meet in person?
I really have to talk to you.

Gon: About what?

241
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,270
Kazsule: A team is close
to clearing the game...

242
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,739
( All gasp )

243
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:42,309
Kazsule: A three-man team
led by someone named genthru.

244
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,643
Gon: Genthru.

245
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,351
Kazsule: Thanks for taking
the time to come out, everyone.

246
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,153
As I mentioned via contact,

247
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:57,358
team genthru is getting very
close to completing the game.

248
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:01,762
I just checked the ranking, and
they’re currently at 96 types.

249
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,665
We have to come up
with a strategy, and now.

250
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,167
- Killua: I’ve got a question.
- Kazsule: Yeah?

251
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,869
Killua: How exactly
do you check the rankings?

252
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,270
- Kazsule: Oh, well--
- asta: Great!

253
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,772
You don’t even know
how to do that?

254
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:15,242
We don’t have time to explain
the whole game to them,

255
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,477
so just cut to the chase,
all right?

256
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,380
Kazsule: There’s no need
to be mean.

257
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,482
All of us are here
to exchange information.

258
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,617
Player #8: He’s right, asta.
You never know.

259
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,486
These kids just might have
a bit of intel you don’t.

260
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,489
( Asta laughs )
That’s impossible.

261
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,457
They’re rank amateurs
who don’t even know

262
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,792
how to use the trade shop.
Don’t make me laugh.

263
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,528
Kazsule: In the trade shop,

264
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,630
you can look
at the official rankings

265
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,499
of who has the most cards,
which can be really useful.

266
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,335
And if you pay a fee,

267
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,271
then they’ll even tell you
which specific cards they have.

268
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,139
Asta: But just
because you can get

269
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,908
a player’s name
from the ranking,

270
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,844
doesn’t mean you can use
contact or fluoroscopy.

271
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,381
You gotta meet ’em
for that. Heh.

272
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,683
Do you feel a little smarter
now, little boy?

273
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,519
( Boys groan )

274
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,220
Player #8: Thing is, if we know

275
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,523
all of the members on the team,
we can determine

276
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,159
exactly how many cards
they have between them.

277
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,528
Kazsule: And team genthru
is only missing

278
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,532
numbers zero, two, nine,
and 75 in all.

279
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,834
Gon: 75, huh?

280
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,502
Kazsule: There’s
a well-accepted theory

281
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:17,905
that number zero
only appears in an event

282
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,706
after the other 99
are collected,

283
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,442
so they only need three.

284
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,344
What we’re proposing is this--

285
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:26,447
we find one of those
three types before they do

286
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,648
and monopolize it,

287
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,850
preventing them
from clearing the game.

288
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:30,951
Asta: Really? That’s it?

289
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,819
I figured we could at least

290
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,955
inundate them with spell cards
or something.

291
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,656
Kazsule: We’ve learned that they

292
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,358
already obtained
a paladin’s necklace,

293
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:41,295
so Levy is the only spell
that might work,

294
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,763
and they can block it,

295
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,765
if certain conditions
are met, anyway.

296
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,867
Player #8:
Let’s assume that genthru

297
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,303
is willing to reveal the fact
that they have 96 types,

298
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,974
because they’ve got all their
pages protected with fortress.

299
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,809
- Gon: It’s possible.
- Bisky: Hmm.

300
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:59,213
Killua: And genthru was hoarding
a bunch of spell cards,

301
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,882
him and the other guys
who tried to recruit us,

302
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,784
so it makes a lot of sense.

303
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,386
Asta: Well, we could always
take their cards by force.

304
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,856
Yabibi: Would you be
willing to lead the attack?

305
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,624
Who knows what other abilities

306
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,793
that three-man team
has to offer?

307
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,996
Kazsule: The most practical plan

308
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,732
is to find a card type
to monopolize.

309
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,600
No objections, I assume?

310
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,704
Then let’s get down to business.

311
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,373
We’re gonna need
everyone here working together.

312
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,441
Asta: All that
sounds good to me,

313
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,510
but these new members
are a problem.

314
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,012
Kazsule: Hold on, asta.

315
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,813
Each team satisfies
the prerequisite.

316
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,417
All of them hold
more than 50 cards,

317
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:40,020
just like you insisted
to begin with.

318
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,622
Asta: Yeah, maybe so,
but I also insisted

319
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,526
that they had to be people
who could contribute, right?

320
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,295
I fail to see how
either of these little kids

321
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,664
are gonna contribute anything.

322
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,633
Killua: The only one here
not contributing so far is you.

323
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,936
Asta: Well, at least
you’re a big talker,

324
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,271
but i’m still not sure
you can be useful,

325
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,706
so let’s see some proof.

326
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,009
Gon: We know
team genthru’s abilities.

327
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,311
Killua: And there are
three cards they’re missing.

328
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,645
We have one of ’em.

329
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,349
( Scoffs ) Still got a problem?

330
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,352
Asta: That’s good enough for me.

331
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,888
So these abilities,
what are they, exactly?

332
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,556
Killua: Hold on.

333
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,459
Let’s see some proof
that you can be useful to us,

334
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:19,760
because I doubt it.

335
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:22,729
Asta: 71 types
of specified-slot cards.

336
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:25,699
That’s a hell of a lot more
than you have.

337
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,001
How ’bout I give you an a-rank

338
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,371
in return
for a little information?

339
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,573
Is that good enough?

340
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:33,841
Killua: No, it isn’t.

341
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,577
We can get those ourselves,
no big deal.

342
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,712
If you want us
to tell you anything,

343
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,848
you can give us two s-rank cards
or equally valuable information.

344
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,785
Asta: Don’t press your luck,
you damn little brat.

345
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,053
Hear that, everyone?

346
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,322
These kids won’t be any help.

347
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,425
They want two s-rank cards
from each team.

348
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,093
10 cards? Really?

349
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,895
Killua: Don’t be stupid.
I just meant your team.

350
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,564
Asta: Huh?

351
00:14:57,598 --> 00:14:59,800
Killua: I’m fine giving
information to the others.

352
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,803
They can decide what
they want to give us in return.

353
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,072
But you, you guys get nothing

354
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,040
unless you give me
what I asked for!

355
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,075
( Asta groans )

356
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,810
Should’ve known a stupid brat

357
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,812
would dwell
on that silly argument.

358
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,780
Kazsule: Would both of you
knock it off?

359
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:15,716
Don’t waste our time
fighting with each other!

360
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,518
Both: Well, I haven’t agreed
to team up with them yet!

361
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:21,021
Player #9: Asta, it’s fine.
Just give ’em two cards.

362
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,523
Player #10: He’s right.
We’ve gotta move past this.

363
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:24,925
Asta: Look,
I don’t have a problem

364
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,126
with giving them cards!

365
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,661
It doesn’t make
a difference to me!

366
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,529
He’s the one
trying to pick a fight!

367
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,365
Killua: No,
you’re picking a fight!

368
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,634
Come on, guys.
Let’s get out of here.

369
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,702
I don’t wanna team up
with these losers.

370
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,938
Bisky: I know how you feel.
It’s frustrating.

371
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,906
Gon: It’s just that,
given the circumstances...

372
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,941
( Killua growls )

373
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,547
Gon: Okay, what we’ve been
able to figure out so far

374
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,949
is that genthru’s abilities
are countdown and little flower,

375
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,784
and that means that you’re all

376
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,952
gonna want to keep
a safe distance from him.

377
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,555
Asta: Ah, crap. Bastard got me.

378
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,025
Hanse: Same here, back when
we were making a deal.

379
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,760
Player #11: Me, too.

380
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,696
Bisky: Seems to me like a bunch
of them might be victims.

381
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,863
Killua: Yeah.

382
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:06,466
Asta: Is there
a way to disable it?

383
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,103
Gon: Yep. Sure is.
You have to touch genthru

384
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,438
and say, "I caught the bomber."

385
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,006
Killua: Dummy!
Why’d you say that?!

386
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,143
We could have milked
a lot more cards out of ’em.

387
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,679
Gon: Because it would have
just started another fight.

388
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:20,080
The bombs can’t be armed

389
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,649
until genthru explains
how his ability works to you.

390
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:25,085
That’s why, as long
as you stay away from him,

391
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,653
you should be fine.

392
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,458
Asta: Did you boys know

393
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,093
that there are two ways
to cast your spells?

394
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,160
( Gon grunts ) I did.

395
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,530
Asta: A spell card is used up

396
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,199
the moment you say the words
and cast it...

397
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,869
Asta: But there is a way
you can keep reusing it.

398
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:43,537
( Both gasp )

399
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,106
Asta: You know how a list
of the players you’ve met

400
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,609
appears as soon as you put
a peek card into your binder?

401
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:52,579
Try this. Remove the card
without pressing "enter."

402
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:55,516
You’ll notice that
the spell card isn’t used up,

403
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:58,118
so you can keep reusing it.

404
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,686
Killua: I’ve never tried that.
Have you?

405
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,721
Gon: Nope.

406
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,825
Asta: If you buy at the same
trade shop over 50 times,

407
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,063
then you can buy all b-rank
specified-slot cards there.

408
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,132
If you become
a regular customer,

409
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,535
they’ll start bringing it up.

410
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:17,571
Do you have
a duplicate X-ray goggle card?

411
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,574
Beauty magnet emerald?
Maybe wonder pond?

412
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,744
So what do you think?

413
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,746
That satisfy you two?

414
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,482
’cause i’ll give you
another card if it doesn’t.

415
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,584
Gon: No, that’s fine! Thank you!

416
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,752
Goreinu:
Guess i’m up next, then.

417
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:35,956
Goreinu.
Very nice to meet you.

418
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,026
Gon: That was fantastic,
everybody!

419
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,495
We learned lots from you guys,
so thank you!

420
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,763
Kazsule: The question now

421
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,599
is which card
we should try to monopolize.

422
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:49,636
Killua: The number 75 we have
is probably impossible.

423
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,173
Each team
can only get one of them,

424
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:54,275
and the limit
on that card is 20.

425
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:56,010
That’s way too high.

426
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:58,546
Player #11:
You guys have a number 75?

427
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,081
Player #12:
That’s really impressive.

428
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,749
Kazsule: List on! Number 75.

429
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,757
Five other teams each have one,
so a monopoly is impossible.

430
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,293
Asta: And the other two?

431
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:14,595
Hanse: List on! Number nine!

432
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:16,897
Player #12:
And list on! Number two!

433
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,532
Hanse: No good.

434
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,600
There are three teams
that already have a number nine.

435
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:24,071
Player #12: But nobody has
number two, strip of beach yet.

436
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,906
It just might work!

437
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,008
Player #10:
Guidepost on. Number two.

438
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:31,912
I know where to find it,
soufrabi.

439
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,547
Hanse: I’ve been there.

440
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,948
Goreinu: I have
an accompany card.

441
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:36,584
Kazsule: All right,
then let’s go!

442
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,886
Accompany on! To soufrabi!

443
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:44,291
( Waves crashing )

444
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,326
Gon: So this is soufrabi, huh?

445
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,829
Goreinu: It’s a pretty big city.

446
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,864
Kazsule: Let’s head in
and get info.

447
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,001
( Overlapping chatter )

448
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:57,838
Killua: We’ll start at the edge
and work inward.

449
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,639
Some npcs don’t wanna talk,

450
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:02,576
so that’s why you gotta visit
them multiple times. Got it?

451
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,643
Both: Yeah!

452
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,045
- Goreinu: Hey!
- All: Huh?

453
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,814
Goreinu: Seems they found
someone with information.

454
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:08,849
All: That fast?!

455
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,251
( Electricity crackles )

456
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:13,721
Woman: The pirates
run this entire town,

457
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:15,256
every last inch of it.

458
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,658
You see,
there’s this local legend

459
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:20,594
about an underwater cave
called poseidon’s cavern

460
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,863
that’s supposed to be
around here somewhere.

461
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:26,867
The strip of beach
is the entrance to it.

462
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,203
Not too many years ago,
15 pirates came to this town,

463
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:33,240
because they’d heard about
the legend and that this cave

464
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:37,744
also contained an unbelievable
amount of treasure inside,

465
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:40,881
razor and his 14 devils.

466
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,683
The poor fishermen
were all tortured and killed.

467
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,723
Then the pirates
murdered anybody

468
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,992
who knew anything
about the strip of beach.

469
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,393
( Sighs )

470
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:55,930
If you can get rid
of the pirates,

I promise i’ll tell you
everything I know.

00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,635
Hanse:
When we visited this place

473
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:05,338
a few months ago,
we couldn’t find a single clue.

474
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,041
Player #8: Well, some info
isn’t always available.

475
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:11,278
Maybe you can only get it
this time of year?

476
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:14,748
Player #10: Facing down razor
and his 14 devils, huh?

477
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,316
It’s entirely possible
that the event

478
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,053
can only be triggered
by the right number of players.

479
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:20,154
Player #8: Huh?

480
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:21,922
Player #10:
There are 15 pirates,

481
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,391
and it just so happens
there are 15 of us.

482
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:27,193
Kazsule: So what are you saying?
That the event won’t start

483
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,362
unless you have
a party of 15 or more?

484
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,331
Player #13: But I don’t get it.

485
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,701
How would an in-game character
know about that?

486
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:34,969
Killua: With accompany.

487
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:37,238
Player #10: Yes.
15 or more people

488
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:39,006
must reach soufrabi
with accompany.

489
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,676
I’m willing to bet that that
is the trigger for this event.

490
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,844
Goreinu: Whoa.
That’s pretty brutal.

491
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:45,846
Killua: What is?

492
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:48,081
Goreinu: Uh, nothing.

493
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:51,685
Kazsule: Right.
To the pirate’s base!

Narrator: Gon and his friends

497
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,301
encounter
some unsavory-looking pirates.

498
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,437
Their mission is clear.

499
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,138
But will the 15 allies

500
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:15,208
be able to obtain
the strip of beach card?
