[narrator] After learning the reason 
for Killua’s disqualification,

17
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:23,560
Gon was furious with Gittarrackur 
or rather, with Killua's brother, Illumi.

18
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,792
Apologize to Killua!

19
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,590
Sorry? But what for?

20
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,302
-You don't know what you did wrong? 
-[Illumi] No.

21
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,391
You’re not qualified 
to be his big brother.

22
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,228
I didn’t know I had to qualify.

25
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,293
[Illumi] This boy...

26
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,426
[Gon] Don't even bother apologizing. 
Just take me to see Killua.

27
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,886
And what will you do?

28
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,638
[Gon] It's obvious!

29
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,849
I'll bring him back!

30
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,979
From the sound of it, you must think 
I kidnapped my little brother.

31
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,941
But he walked out of here 
of his own free will.

32
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,153
He left, but not by free will.

33
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:01,283
You guys were manipulating him. 
That's the same thing as kidnapping!

34
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,171
We were just discussing 
that very subject, Gon.

35
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,884
In fact, Kurapika and Leorio have both 
lodged complaints.

36
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:23,388
The committee has been reviewing 
the fairness of Killua's disqualification.

37
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:28,310
You saw it yourself. Both during and since 
his match with the man called Gitarrackur,

38
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,853
Killua behaved strangely.

39
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,940
I believe that there is only reason 
that Killua committed murder.

40
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,358
He was hypnotized.

41
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,654
It’s generally considered impossible 
to use hypnosis

42
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,615
to direct someone to do such a thing,

43
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:46,077
however, assassins raised Killua 
and murder was commonplace,

44
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,581
so it's natural that he would lack 
the proper ethical restraint.

45
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:55,879
It's worth noting that the attack happened 
during my match with Bodoro.

46
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:01,301
So, it's possible Killua intended 
to aid my cause.

47
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:07,140
Which means if you're going to disqualify 
anyone, it should be me!

48
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,270
Whatever the case, it's obvious 
that Killua was not in full control

49
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,730
of his actions at the time.

50
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,983
Thus, he should not 
have been disqualified!

51
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:22,739
That is nothing more than speculation. 
There's no concrete proof.

52
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,243
From what we saw, 
there were no clear indications

53
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,370
he was ordered to commit murder.

54
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:33,625
And regarding the hypnotism, I would have 
to question that claim, as well.

55
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,045
I will agree that the incident occurred

56
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,091
once the battle between Leorio 
and Bodoro had gotten underway.

57
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:46,096
At that point, both fighters were evenly 
matched, all things considered.

58
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,890
While Bodoro certainly had 
more experience,

59
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,018
it was clear that Leorio 
had the definite edge

60
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,646
when it came to raw ability in combat.

61
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,651
Given that it was a fair fight, 
there was no need for Killua to interfere.

62
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,777
[scoffs]

63
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,697
And speaking of weird things happening...

64
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,409
why don't we talk about 
when you fought with Hisoka?

65
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,746
Mind telling us what it was 
he said to you?

66
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,417
Neither of you looked tired.

67
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,838
But Hisoka whispered something to you, 
then surrendered.

68
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,133
Weird, right?

69
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,428
I'd understand if he whispered something 
and you surrendered,

70
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,931
like with Hanzo and me, 
or Bodoro and Hisoka.

71
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,434
We were under a lot of pressure.

72
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,353
Instead, the opposite happened,

73
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,774
which makes me wonder if the two of you 
struck some sort of bargain.

74
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,528
If you want to talk about things 
that don't make sense,

75
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,948
then your victory fit the bill perfectly.

76
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,622
You don’t have anything to hide, right? 
So what did he say? Enlighten us.

77
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,750
I have no such obligation.

78
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,503
Maybe you don't, 
but I think you owe it to us.

79
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,505
I don't.

80
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,258
You may find my victory suspect,

81
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,219
but I would say the same 
of victory by default.

82
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,847
[growls] What?

83
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,479
[Gon] This is pointless.

84
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,689
[Hanzo] Come on.

85
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,735
Let's just get this over with 
so we can all go home.

86
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,864
Look here, pal.

87
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,241
This is completely pointless!

88
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,499
Why argue about whether somebody 
should have passed?

89
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,671
If you’re not satisfied that you made it, 
you can keep working until you are.

90
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:47,467
If Killua wants to retake the Hunter Exam, 
then I know he'll pass!

91
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,221
He didn't this time, and it is what it is.

92
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,851
But still, if you've been forcing Killua 
to murder people

93
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,354
against his will, this whole time...

94
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,774
I will never forgive you.

95
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,277
Never forgive me?

96
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,155
So, what will you do?

97
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,535
I won't do anything. 
But after I go rescue Killua,

98
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,787
I'll never let you see him again!

99
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,872
Hmm...

100
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,970
[clears throat]

101
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,473
Alright, gentlemen. Let's continue.

102
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,684
Gon's absolutely right.

103
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,938
It’s up to each of you to decide 
whether you’re worthy of your license.

104
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,817
Now, you’re all perfectly welcome 
to complain about the results

105
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,695
as much as you like, 
but our minds are made up.

106
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,616
Killua has been disqualified 
from this year's Hunter Exam,

107
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,952
while the rest of you have passed.

108
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,130
Alright then, I shall continue 
with the orientation.

109
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,594
Now, the cards that we’ve passed out 
are your Hunter licenses.

110
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,932
This card will allow you 
to enter 90 percent of the countries

111
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,894
that limit immigration, 
as well as grant you access

112
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,314
to 75 percent of restricted areas 
in the world.

113
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,357
Amazing.

114
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:31,571
You may use 95 percent of public 
facilities at absolutely no cost,

115
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,575
and banks will treat you 
as if you were a top-rated company.

116
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,747
You can sell it for enough money 
to last seven lifetimes,

117
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,876
or you can keep it for a life 
of guaranteed comfort.

118
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,132
Please be very careful. You wouldn’t 
want it to be misplaced or stolen.

119
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,510
You won't get a replacement.

120
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,890
According to our estimates, 
as many as one in five Hunters

121
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,644
somehow manage to lose their card 
within a year of receiving it.

122
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,856
Your very first challenge 
as a licensed Hunter

123
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,734
is to protect your card at all costs.

124
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,695
From here on out, it's your show.

125
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:17,200
Believe in yourselves, and keep working 
to make your dreams come true.

126
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,832
Well, then we can now certify 
all seven applicants present

127
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,542

I can understand your concern 
for his future.

Uh-huh.

156
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,413
However, that makes him 
all the more dangerous.

00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,091
Gon is mine. Do not forget that.

159
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,386
Leave him be or suffer the consequences.

160
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,554
I'm aware of that.

161
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,350
I haven't known you long, 
but I know your tastes.

162
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,061
So, Hisoka...

163
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,814
what are you going to do now?

164
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,400
Wait patiently...

165
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,528
[shudders]

166
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,325
until the fruit becomes ripe enough 
for me to pluck.

167
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,164
[Leorio] Kukuroo Mountain, huh? 
Never heard of it.

168
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,542
Do you know where it is, Kurapika?

169
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,503
-Hey, Kurapika! 
-Huh?

170
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,506
Oh, what's that?

171
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,468
Pay attention! 
Illumi mentioned Kukuroo Mountain.

172
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,470
Do you have any idea where it is?

173
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:29,183
No, I'm afraid I don't, 
but we can just go look it up online.

174
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,395
Hey!

175
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,106
Oh! Hey, Hanzo!

176
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,734
[Hanzo] I'm heading home.

177
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,237
We all went through a lot in a short time 
but I had a lot of fun.

178
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,613
[Gon] Yeah, me too.

179
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,575
If you ever visit my country, 
just let me know.

180
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,953
I’ll give you a real tour, 
no tourist traps!

181
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,581
Later!

182
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,541
Bye! See you!

183
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,838
CLOUD HIDDEN NINJA HANZO

184
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,008
That certainly is one big, 
self-assured ninja!

185
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,384
-[Pokkle] Hey. 
-[all] Huh?

186
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,098
I’m really sorry about getting 
so worked up back there.

187
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,644
Please, I was no better. 
I hope you’ll forgive me.

188
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:18,316
No, I only got mad because deep down, 
I knew you were right.

189
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,904
I was just taking out my frustration 
at winning by default.

190
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,031
But I'm over that.

191
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,159
I passed, so I might as well 
make the best of it, right?

192
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,121
The question is what am I gonna do next?

193
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,207
[Kurapika] Yes, you're right.

194
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,378
I’ve decided that I’ll travel the world, 
discover new species

195
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:42,590
and as a licensed Exotic Game Hunter, 
learn everything I can.

196
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,719
-Exotic Game Hunter? 
-Oh, hey, what's that thing?

197
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,054
[Pokkle] What, this?

198
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,848
You use it to find 
all kinds of information.

199
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,602
Is there anything you wanna know? 
I can look it up for you.

200
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,858
Oh, there is! Think you can look up 
a Hunter named Ging? Ging Freecss.

201
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,487
[Pokkle] Sure, hold on just a second.

202
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,328
What's Satotz doing?

203
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,833
[Pokkle] I'm curious. 
So, who is this Ging guy, anyway?

204
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:17,959
[Gon] Huh?

205
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,130
‘Cause everything that’s related to him 
is behind a tight security system.

206
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,507
You need a whole bunch of codes 
to access it.

207
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,344
I think he must have friends 
on the national level.

208
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,639
Really? Forget it, then.

209
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,477
Did you hear that? It sounds like your dad 
is someone really special.

210
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,770
[Gon chuckles]

211
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,232
[Pokkle] Okay, let me know 
if anything comes up.

212
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,526
This is my e-mail address.

213
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,363
-See you around! 
-Bye, Pokkle!

214
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,578
We should have asked him 
to look up Kukuroo Mountain.

215
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,121
Yeah, I guess you're right.

216
00:15:55,288 --> 00:16:00,168
Well, we are all Hunters now. 
Chairman Netero made that much clear.

217
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:04,380
And it’s probably not the best idea to let 
other Hunters know what you’re doing.

218
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,091
-Better to look it up ourselves. 
-[all chuckle]

219
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,634
[Satotz] Gon.

220
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,973
Mr. Satotz!

221
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,978
It appears that you forgot something.

222
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,023
Oh, that's right. Thanks a lot!

223
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,817
Also, do you have a brief moment?

224
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,822
-We'll be waiting for you in the lobby. 
-[Gon] Okay!

225
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,957
Forgive me, I couldn't help 
but overhear your conversation.

226
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,045
As it happens, I specialize 
in ancient ruins,

227
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,088
restoration and preservation.

228
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,468
At first, I was fixated on the glory 
of new discoveries.

229
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:56,057
But after watching a certain Hunter, 
I became quite ashamed of myself.

230
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,065
That Hunter of which I speak 
would discover ruins,

231
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,693
then spend his own money 
to completely restore them.

232
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,864
He took steps to preserve the sites 
for future generations,

233
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,619
ensuring that people from every walk 
of life would be able to enjoy them.

234
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,997
His dedication was impressive.

235
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,501
I'd say more impressive than the ruins 
themselves.

236
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,630
His work was documented in manuals,

237
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,801
manuals which are now used 
in restorations throughout the world.

238
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,179
The name of this Hunter, Gon...

239
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:40,893
is none other than Ging Freecss, 
the man whom you were just asking about.

240
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,854
[gasps]

241
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:50,695
I wanted so desperately to meet him, 
I did a bit of investigating, myself.

242
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,073
However, the man is an enigma,

243
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,618
and I was never able 
to unearth a single thing about him.

244
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,870
Really? That figures.

245
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,333
My goal is to become a Hunter, 
just like him.

246
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,338
And my dream is to thank him 
in person, one day.

247
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,799
Mm.

248
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,678
That's all I had to say.

249
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,764
My apologies for interrupting you.

250
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,184
It's fine. 
Thanks for everything, Mr. Satotz.

251
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,895
-Well, bye! 
-Oh, and Gon.

252
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,273
Hmm?

253
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,820
It's nothing. 
Just take care of yourself.

254
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:37,575
Yeah! You do the same. 
Goodbye!

255
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,837
-First, let's look up Kukuroo Mountain. 
-Right.

256
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,759
Kukuroo Mountain. 
There. Here it is.

257
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,930
"Kukuroo Mountain, in the Dentora Region 
of the Republic of Padokea

258
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,725
is 3,722 meters high."

259
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,935
The Republic of Padokea?

260
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,563
Never heard of the place. 
So, where is it?

261
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,857
Hold on. I'll bring up a map.

262
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,904
This is the Republic of Padokea.

263
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,574
It appears to be a stable country, 
so we should be fine.

264
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,743
This country's open to tourists.

265
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,787
That's where Killua is?

266
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:27,166
It'll take three days to reach by airship. 
When do you think we should leave?

267
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,628
-Today! Right now! 
-All right! I'm with Gon.

268
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,838
Got it. I'll order the tickets, then.

269
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,056
TAXI

270
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,393
What's going on? 
Feels like we've been stuck here forever.

271
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,854
This is bad. At this rate, we'll be late 
for our flight.

272
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,566
[Leorio] Hey, pops! Do something!

273
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,195
[driver] Nothing I can do about traffic. 
And it's the only road.

274
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,571
In that case...

275
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,824
[theme music playing]

276
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,541
[Gon] Yay!

277
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,344
Hey, Gon! Do you realize 
how far away the airport is?

278
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,681
Sure! But I want to go rescue Killua,

279
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,975
and I didn't want to wait around 
another second!

280
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,979
-[Kurapika chuckles] 
-Fine, you win.

281
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,527
[chuckles] Running like this 
kind of reminds me of the Hunter Exam.

282
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,487
[Gon] I know, right!

283
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,909
This is a heck of a lot easier 
than the Hunter Exam was!

284
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,245
[Leorio] Oh, yeah.

285
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,914
You got that right.

286
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,755
[Gon] All right! 
Race you guys to the airport!

287
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,260
Ready, set, go!

288
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,640
[narrator] Gon and his friends set off 
for the Republic of Padokea.

289
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:12,438
Their destination is Kukuroo Mountain, 
where they hope to find Killua's home.

290
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,532
[Menchi] Satotz.

291
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,744
[Satotz] Oh, Menchi and Buhara.

292
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,998
Is it just me or was that 
a really close call?

293
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,210
[Satotz] [chuckles] You saw that, did you?

294
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,465
That boy's a mystery. 
I feel most compelled to help him.

295
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,553
I almost nearly let it slip that...

296
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:51,268
the real Hunter Exam isn't over 
just yet.

297
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,653
[theme music plays]

298
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,362
[Gon] Next time, 
"A Dangerous Watchdog."

299
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,781
-[Gon] Doggy, go, fetch! 
-[Leorio] That's it.

300
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,159
-[Gon] Doggie, roll over! 
-[Leorio] Oh, yeah!
