it is possible

that was used for entry,

one can only enter and exit

this countermove,

We’ll talk inside.

320
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,673
Reinforcements have arrived,
a lobster and a wolf.

321
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,141
Morel: Are they strong?

322
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,410
Knov: Knowing that
would make this easier.

323
00:17:56,443 --> 00:18:00,013
They’re trying to find out
the same thing about us.

324
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:02,249
Morel: A stalemate, huh?

325
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,986
Our goal is to buy time,
so it all works out.

326
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:09,523
Knov: I think it’s because
I took out this one here.

327
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:14,194
Those dragonflies were acting
as surveillance cameras.

328
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:16,630
Leol: Flutter, come in!

329
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:19,232
Bloster: I don’t think
he’s gonna show up.

330
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,335
Welfin: Time for
a change of plans.

331
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:24,404
without flutter,
we can’t locate the enemy.

332
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,340
( Leol growls ) Damn it.

333
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:29,610
he lets me down
right when I really need him.

334
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:32,146
Should I call it off? No.

335
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,315
I can’t ever lose face
in front of pitou.

336
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,551
welfin: Well,
we’re gonna head back, then.

337
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,520
Leol: Wait. Hold on a second.
It’s fine.

338
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,556
I think I can handle it.

339
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:46,160
( Cash register rings )

340
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,362
Welfin: Now hang on.
Is that your ability?

341
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,464
Leol: I can use it
to scout around,

342
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,366
but let’s just
keep that between us.

343
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,701
at least
you’re both trustworthy.

344
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:58,372
Idiots. As if i’d
tell you the truth.

345
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,474
narrator:
This is leol’s rental pod.

346
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,477
It’s a device that allows him
to temporarily borrow

347
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,480
his targets’ abilities
by putting them in his debt.

348
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:09,483
However there are two conditions
which must be met

349
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,752
before he can
put it into action.

350
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:13,787
First, he must have
seen the ability

351
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,189
or at the very least
know its name.

352
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:19,827
Second, he must Grant
the target a favor

353
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,396
and confirm by saying,
"you owe me,"

354
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:25,632
or, "this isn’t free,"
something along those lines,

355
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,502
and the target
must respond affirmatively,

356
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:29,669
fulfilling the conditions.

357
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:30,671
Leol: Got it!

358
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,573
Narrator: Once fulfilled,

359
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:35,809
the data is automatically saved
into the dispenser

360
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:40,181
with the name, ability,
and number of rentals recorded.

361
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:42,450
However, if the target dies,

362
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,418
the data
will be deleted instantly.

363
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,120
Leol: Flutter’s fine.

364
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,155
( Welfin chuckles )

365
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,623
Leol: He’s not responding,

366
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,360
because he’s either unconscious
or too far away.

367
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,229
Narrator: A rental
can be used for one hour.

368
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,498
During the rental period,

369
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,767
the target cannot use
the borrowed power.

370
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,469
Leol: He’s still alive, anyway.

371
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,739
looks like
we can stay in touch.

372
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,340
We’ll start once flutter’s
satellite dragonflies

373
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,843
confirm they’ve found
the suit with glasses.

374
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,880
Bloster: All right. We’ll keep
the weaklings at a distance

375
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:14,715
while you deal with that one.

376
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:16,783
Welfin: You gonna be
okay on your own?

377
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:22,189
Leol: I wouldn’t give you a job
you can’t handle by yourselves.

378
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:27,194
Besides, I don’t want
you two to see my ability.

379
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:31,465
I’ll do whatever it takes
to complete this mission.

380
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,400
Okay.

381
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,369
I can’t waste
any more time here,

382
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,806
not until I make
the king owe me one.

383
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,575
Narrator: Taking the ticket

384
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,644
and ripping it up
activates the ability.

385
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:48,849
Leol: They’re here.

386
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:51,618
Time to start scouting.

387
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:56,323
( Thunder rumbling )

388
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,858
King: I don’t like it.

389
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:02,662
During our matches, my rhythm
is the one being disrupted,

390
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:04,665
not hers.

391
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:10,671
By all rights, this should be
an unbearable indignity,

392
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:15,576
and yet, although I
find myself frustrated,

393
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,245
I enjoy it at the same time.

394

395
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,282
What I don’t understand...

396
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:23,951
Is why.
