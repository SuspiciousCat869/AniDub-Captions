Evil haunts.

Uncharted frontiers.

The mysterious unknown.

The people who are captivated 
by the magic in those words...

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,153
are called...

11
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,032
Hunters!

It's so delightful. I love that look.

15
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,836
[Gon] But I've got to say, it was actually 
pretty exciting back there.

16
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,004
Huh?

17
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,215
[Gon] I was so scared that all I wanted 
to do was run away,

18
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,717
but I couldn't.

19
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,553
'Cause I was excited at the same time!

20

Looks like we made it in time.

24
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,827
But where's Leorio?

25
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,543
There he is.

26
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,384
Man, that stings! 
How the hell did I get beat up so badly?

[both gasp]

28
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,471
[Leorio] My memory's so hazy, 
I can't remember.

29
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,349
We probably shouldn't tell him 
what happened.

30
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,475
You're right.

[Gon] Killua!

33
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,356
I was starting to think 
you weren't gonna make it here.

34
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,566
Or that you didn't make it at all.

35
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,611
I just followed the trail 
of Leorio's cologne.

36
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,239
You tracked his scent? That's how?

37
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,575
Man, Gon! 
You really are weird, aren't you?

38
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,245
[Satotz] Excellent work, everyone!

39
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,916
The Second Phase will take place here, 
in the Visca Forest Park.

40
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,671
So, I shall now take my leave. 
I wish you all the very best of luck.

[gates rumbling]

[Menchi] Will all the applicants 
who passed the First Phase please enter?

43
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,530
Welcome, all!

44
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,450
I'm Menchi, your examiner 
for the Second Phase.

45
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,453
And likewise, I'm Buhara.

-[man] What was that noise?

48
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,965
Sounds to me like you're getting hungry.

49
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,259
Not just hungry, I'm famished!

50
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,429
Well, there you have it. 
The Second Phase...

51
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,018
will be cooking!

52
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,895
-Wait... we're cooking? 
-Huh?

53
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:35,192
What do you mean, we're cooking? 
We came here to take the Hunter Exam.

54
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,443
[Menchi] That's right.

55
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,446
The Second Phase of the exam 
will be preparing a meal

56
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,114
that'll satisfy our palates.

57
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,909
[man] Why do we have to cook?

58
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,371
Don't you know? It's simple really, 
because we're Gourmet Hunters!

59
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,084
Huh? [laughs]

60
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,962
-[crowd laughing] 
-[Todo] Talk about a let down!

61
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,756
You hear that? They're Gourmet Hunters!

62
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,674
[laughing continues]

63
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,259
[Menchi sighs]

64
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,763
[Satotz] 
Gourmet Hunters, Menchi and Buhara.

65
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,809
Their selection as examiners 
could prove quite problematic.

66
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:14,314
Only 50 applicants left. 
But, depending on the task,

67
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,943
it's possible that fewer than ten 
will pass the Second Phase.

68
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,070
[laughing continues]

69
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,908
So, you're both Gourmet Hunters. 
And what exactly do you want us to make?

70
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,286
Buhara?

71
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,000
Today's required ingredient will be pork.

72
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,878
[man] Pork? You mean like pig meat?

73
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,924
[Buhara] Feel free to use meat from any 
species of pig in Visca Forest.

74
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,762
As you see, you'll use these cooking 
facilities to prep your pork dishes.

75
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,684
To pass the exam, you must create a dish 
to satisfy our discriminating palates.

76
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:56,356
But we won't be evaluating taste alone. 
So take this seriously. Is that clear?

77
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,861
When we've both eaten our fill, 
this portion of the exam will be over.

78
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,614
Okay, enough talk. 
Let's just get to it, alright?

79
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,117

[hurried footsteps]

83
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:22,090
[Menchi] Any species of pig, huh? 
You've got a real mean streak, don't you?

84
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,926
[Buhara] Well, you did say 
I got to pick the ingredient.

85
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,179
There's only one species of pig 
in Visca Forest,

86
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,681
but you already knew that.

87
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,851
Hmm. I hope nobody gets killed!

88
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,854

Hey! Piggy!

90
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,362
[Leorio] We gotta catch a pig 
and cook it, huh?

91
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,823
Man, this is way easier than 
the First Phase

92
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,825
I just hope it's that simple.

93

-[Gon] I found them. 
-Huh?

98
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,049
[Leorio] Pigs!

99
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,722
They're all... chewing on bones.

100
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,975
Don't tell me... they're carnivores?

101

[Buhara] The Great Stamp!

108
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,173
The most ferocious pig in the whole world.

109
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,094
They use their large, sturdy snouts 
to send their predators flying.

110
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,972
You've got to move really quick

111
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,599
unless you want to end up the main course 
for their dinner.

112
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,768
[roars]

113
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,896

Huh, that's it! Their foreheads 
are their weak spots.

121
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,865
I see. that makes sense.

122
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,452
They developed tough snouts 
to protect their delicate foreheads.

123
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,672
Huh? Oh!

124
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,015
-[chuckles] 
-Look at that! They sure caught a lot.

125
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:29,611
[Satotz] Hmm. This is an exceptional batch 
of applicants, indeed.

126
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,157
But the hard part is yet to come.

127
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,119
[Todo] Now, eat the pig 
and send me to the next phase.

128
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,164
Okay, time to judge.

129
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,375

00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,511
The pork's overcooked.

133
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,639
It's way too tough. 
It totally ruins the flavor.

134
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,726
-Come on! You haven't even tried it! 
-I don't have to! It's obvious.

00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,353
[grunts angrily]

136
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,107
There, I hope you enjoy it.

[buzzer sounds]

139
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,986
[gasps] But why?

140
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,864
Charred and dry on the outside, 
raw on the inside.

141
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,699
Your fire was way too hot.

142
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,285

[buzzer sounds]

146
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,877
[Menchi] Honestly! They're all just 
roasting the entire pig,

147
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,004
like it's the only thing 
they know how to do.

148
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,632
None of them have made any effort at all!

149
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,719
[Leorio] Not one applicant has passed yet.

150
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,099
And Menchi has yet to take 
a single bite of anyone's entry.

151
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:46,729
Seriously? Can't anyone out there make 
something that'll satisfy my taste buds.

152
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,024
That's it! 
The Second Phase is a cooking test,

153
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,570
but they're judging us 
based on originality and observation.

154
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,363
Oh, I see.

155
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,615
[Buhara laughs gleefully]

156
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,034
Tell me how much you love it.

157
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,204
Is this supposed to be a kid's meal?

158
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,167
Okay, mine is next.

159
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,460
It's just like the last one!

160
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,008
The next entry's mine, ready to be judged.

161
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,721
Well, finally, something that resembles 
an actual dish.

162
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,017
[Kurapika] The challenge is to utilize 
the facilities and ingredients provided

163
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,811
to highlight the main feature: the pork.

164
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,023
In short, the taste is insignificant.

165
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,192
[Menchi] Gross!

166
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,819
[gasps]

167
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,823
Presentation is important, 
but not at the expense of the flavor.

168
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,534
You're basically no better 
than Number 403.

169
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,496
-[buzzer sounds] 
-[sneers] Better luck next time.

170
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,166
No better than 403, huh?

171
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:54,005
[chuckles] That was so much food. 
I couldn't take another bite.

172
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,758
Yeah, I'm pretty stuffed, myself.

173
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:01,763
So, none of you passed to the next phase. 
Exam's over!

174
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,640
[crowd gasps]

175
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,685
[Satotz] Just as I feared, 
she's reverted to her bad habits.

176
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,441
[Beans] What should we do now, Chairman?

177
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,569
[Chairman] I suppose I have no choice.

178
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,948
It's time for a little outing.

179
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,704
HUNTER GLOSSARY

180
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,959
MENCHI

181
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,337
-[man 1] Nobody passed? 
-[man 2] Seriously?

182
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,506
[man 3] Does she really mean that?

183
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,883
[man 4] Wait, so the exam's over?

184
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,052
[man 5] You gotta be kidding!

185
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,684
This is unacceptable. 
Do ya hear me? I will not accept this!

186
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,520
[Menchi] Say what you want, 
but you still failed.

187
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,107
[Todo] Shut the hell up! 
You asked for pork and we gave it to you.

188
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,566
We risked our lives--

189
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,320
Your challenge was to prepare a pork dish 
that both examiners would find delicious,

190
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,532
and none of you even came close 
to succeeding.

191
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,285
You all did pretty much 
the exact same thing.

192
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,079
I mean, it's like you didn't even try 
to figure it out.

193
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,747
And when it looked like you had tried,

194
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,834
it was just fancy plating 
with no flavor to back it up

195
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,795
It's clear that none of you 
took this seriously.

196
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,508
Yeah, but come on, pork? No matter how 
you cook it, it's still just pork.

197
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:24,804
You wanna say that one more time? 
If I hear any more crap from you,

198
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,057
I'll shove my arm up your ass, 
and knock your teeth out! Got it?

199
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,640
[Buhara] Menchi’s temper is getting 
the best of her again.

200
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,377
but I guess it's no surprise.

201
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:35,227
-There're only a few chefs in the world... 
-...you wouldn't know gourmet cuisine...

202
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,606
-...who are good enough to satisfy her. 
-You sorry excuse for a human.

203
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:39,081
I dare you to say it one more time!

204
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,864
So, as I was saying, 
not a single one of you has the guts

205
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,366
to cook anything remotely new 
or innovative.

206
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,952
Hey! Shut up! 
I'm not here because I'm trying

207
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,788
to be some gourmet cook, 
but a Hunter!

208
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,832
[crowd] That's right. You tell her!

209
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,209
[Todo] 
My goal is to become a Blacklist Hunter,

210
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,546
and no stupid Gourmet Hunter 
is gonna tell me I can't.

211
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,425
Then it's too bad that a stupid 
Gourmet Hunter is your examiner.

212
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,011
Well, better luck next year, I guess.

213
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,182
Huh? Why, you... Don't mess with me!

214
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,814
[Menchi] Buhara, please don't interfere.

215
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,652
I'm sorry, but it kinda looked like you 
were gonna kill him if I didn't step in.

216
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,280
[chuckling] Probably.

217
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,241
Let's get this straight.

218
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,370
We frequently venture into the dens 
of ferocious beats,

219
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,580
in search of the finest ingredients.

220
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,168
And every Hunter is proficient 
in at least some form of martial art.

221
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,671
You lack focus, and the will 
to experiment with new things.

222
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,134
And that alone disqualifies you all 
from becoming Hunters.

223
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,813
[Chairman] Well, that said, 
it seems a bit excessive

224
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,065
to fail every single applicant.

225
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,112
[man] 
The symbol of the Hunter's Association!

226
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,823
It must be someone 
from the exam committee.

227
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,325
[crowd grunting]

228
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,161
[coughing and spluttering]

229
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,847
[man] Hey, wait. Who's the old man?

230
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,811
He is the Head of the Exam Committee, 
and he's responsible for the Hunter Exam.

231
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,063
Chairman Netero.

232
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,359
Oh, I just work behind the scenes. 
It's not all that impressive.

233
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:47,572
I only intervene in the exams 
when little issues like this one pop up.

234
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,741
-Now, dear Menchi. 
-Sir.

235
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,580
It's come to my attention that you've 
chosen to fail all this year's applicants,

236
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,709
the reason being, as I understand it, 
their general reluctance

237
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,545
-to challenge the unknown. 
-[Menchi] No.

238
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,091
I'm sorry, sir, but I snapped 
when a candidate insulted Gourmet Hunters.

239
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,345
And I'm afraid I made the exam 
harder than necessary.

240
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,098
I see, but it seems you're aware

241
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,642
that this exam 
was completely unacceptable.

242
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,771
Yes. It's just that I get so emotional 
when food is involved.

243
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,815
I'm not suited for this position.

244
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,695
So, I must resign as examiner. 
Please let them retake the Second Phase.

245
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:32,867
Sadly, I can't imagine where we'd begin 
to find an examiner on such short notice.

246
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,036
My deepest apologies, sir.

247
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,622
Hold on, I have an idea.

248
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,458
You continue serving as examiner,

249
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,086
but you yourself must participate 
alongside this year's applicants,

250
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,547
in completing 
whatever challenge you chose.

251
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,882
[gasps]

252
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,760
[Chairman] 
Well, what do you say? Sound reasonable?

253
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,555
Surely that would make the applicants 
more comfortable with the results.

254
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,058
I suppose you're right.

255
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,102
And I have just the thing 
for the new challenge.

256
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,188
We'll all be making boiled eggs!

257
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,024
-[man] Boiled eggs? 
-[indistinct chatter]

258
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,443
[Menchi] Chairman, since I see 
you brought your airship,

259
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,321
would you mind taking us all 
to Split Mountain?

260
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,117
[Chairman] Split Mountain? 
Oh, I see. Yes, of course!

261
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,796
This is it. 
Take a look at what's down there.

262
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,674
[man] What is that?

263
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:34,095
-A spider-eagle's web. 
-They built their webs way down there?

264
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,721
[earth rumbling]

265
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,431
[gasps]

266
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,268
Look past the web to what's underneath.

267
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,397
-[Killua] Hey, those are-- 
-[Menchi] Those are the spider-eagle eggs.

268
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,234
[Chairman] Spider-eagles build their webs 
in deep ravines like this one.

269
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,028
It helps protect their eggs 
from predators.

270
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:56,200
That's what makes these eggs one of 
the most difficult ingredients to obtain.

271
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,663
Also, the eggs are commonly known 
as "Dream Eggs."

272
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,792
-Hey, wait a minute. Do you mean-- 
-[Menchi] You bet I do.

273
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,793
Huh?

274
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,552
[all gasping]

275
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:19,932
[exhales]

276
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,270
Even if she grabs a few eggs, 
how's she gonna climb back up?

277
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,525
[all gasp]

278
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,536
[Leorio] Hey! She jumped down!

279
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,205
Is she trying to get herself killed?

280
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,832
No, she's not.

281
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,925
[gasping]

282
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,510
That looks so fun.

283
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,306
This ravine has updrafts 
that are crucial to the spider-eagle.

284
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,893
Once they hatch, the wind currents 
help guide their newborn chicks

285
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,519
as they fly up to safety.

286
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,398
There! Now I just need to boil it 
and I'll be set!

287
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,651
You gotta be kidding!

288
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:15,529
You mean, you really expect us 
to jump down there? That's crazy!

289
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,742
[Gon] I've been waiting 
for something like this! [laughs]

290
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,827
[whooping]

291
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,871
Alright, I'm in.

292
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,419
Wait, I still haven't finished 
explaining everything.

293
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,344
[man laughs] Later!

294
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,472
-What are we waiting for? 
-Hold on! Don't let go yet.

295
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,724
-Why? What's wrong? 
-No wind.

296
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,560
-The updrafts don't happen all the time. 
-Huh?

297
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,397
[man screaming]

298
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,774
When do you think 
the next one comes along?

299
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,359
Any minute now.

300
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,536
Oh, crap! What the...?

301
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,622
It appears the web isn't strong enough 
to support all this weight.

302
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,499
Gon, can we go yet?

303
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,296
Damn! I can't wait any longer.

304
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,635
[men screaming]

305
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,431
It's about to snap!

306
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:24,890
Okay, now!

307
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,414
[chuckles]

308
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,668
What about you guys? 
I'm guessing you quit?

309
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,713
[Chairman] Conceding takes courage, too.

310
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,808
Unbelievable! This is way better 
than what they sell in the store.

311
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,562
[munching]

312
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,815
I can see why 
they're called Dream Eggs.

00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,568
[Gon] Hey! Mr. Todo!

314
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,321
The egg's really good. 
Do you wanna try it?

315
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,160
It's delicious.

316
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,704
[Menchi] The joy of discovering 
something delicious.

317
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,499
And now, you know what it feels like.

318
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,960
That feeling is 
what we risk our lives for.

319
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,672
I lost fair and square.

320
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,091
Next year, I'll be back.

321
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,514
[narrator] The applicants have learned 
a valuable lesson.

322
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,599
Whether Blacklist or Gourmet,

323
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,560
no one comes by 
the title of Hunter easily.

324
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,939
It requires a staggering amount 
of determination.

325
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,401
Only 42 candidates remain.

326
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,614

327
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,616
[Gon] Next time, 
"Showdown on the Airship."

328
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,910
Hey! Use soap when you wash your hands!

329
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,328
Right!
