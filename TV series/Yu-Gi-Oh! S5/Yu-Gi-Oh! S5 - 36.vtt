TO UNLOCKING THE DARKNESS

IS TO RETURN
THE 7 MILLENNIUM ITEMS
TO THIS STONE,

BUT APPARENTLY,
THERE'S ANOTHER ELEMENT,

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:13.213
AN EIGHTH KEY,

00:09:13.213 --> 00:09:16.920
THE IDENTITY OF WHICH EXISTS
ONLY IN THE PHARAOH'S MIND.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.727
UNFORTUNATELY, HIS MAJESTY
WIPED HIS OWN MEMORY CLEAN.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.700
SO NOW NOT EVEN HE
KNOWS THE ANSWER.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.337
WAIT. THAT'S IT.

00:09:25.337 --> 00:09:27.274
IT WAS IN FRONT OF ME
THE WHOLE TIME.

00:09:27.274 --> 00:09:32.718
THE EIGHTH KEY.

00:09:32.718 --> 00:09:35.090

FROM THAT TABLET.

I HAVE A FEELING HE'S SOMEWHERE
ALONG THIS RIVER, YUGI.

A GUY NEEDS FOOD

DO NOT DO A CANNONBALL.

I KNOW I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE AN ELITE SPELL-CASTER.

00:10:49.734 --> 00:10:52.640

A LITTLE MORE PRACTICE.

00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:57.917

00:11:11.844 --> 00:11:13.181
LET'S GO.

00:11:13.181 --> 00:11:15.619
FROM RIVER, LAKE, SEA, OR POND,

00:11:15.619 --> 00:11:18.825

UH, HUH? OW!

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:28.811
OHH, I GUESS IT'S BACK
TO THE SPELL BOOK.

00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:33.153
HOW AM I S'POSTA DO THIS WITHOUT
MASTER MAHAD TO GUIDE ME?

00:11:34.757 --> 00:11:37.496
HELLO? MA'AM?

CAN YOU SEE US?

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.200
I DOUBT IT,
GUYS.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.140
ME, TOO.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.712
HUH? PHARAOH!

00:11:45.712 --> 00:11:47.315
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, MY KING?

00:11:47.315 --> 00:11:48.550
YOU SHRUNK,

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.554
AND YOU'RE DRESSED
IN STRANGE CLOTHING.

00:11:50.554 --> 00:11:52.158
ACTUALLY,
YOU ALL ARE.

00:11:52.158 --> 00:11:53.493
I LOVE
THIS OUTFIT.

00:11:53.493 --> 00:11:55.497
GUESS IT'S
SAFE TO ASSUME
SHE SEES US.

00:11:55.497 --> 00:11:57.903
SHE MUST BE
LIKE BOBASA.

00:11:57.903 --> 00:11:59.772
Bobasa: WHOO HOO!
HUH?
HUH?

00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:02.511
BOBASA HAS BEEN
A VERY BUSY MAN, MY FRIENDS.

00:12:02.511 --> 00:12:04.148
WHILE YOU WERE
MAKING SMALL TALK,

00:12:04.148 --> 00:12:06.653
I WAS CATCHING
BIG FISH.

00:12:06.653 --> 00:12:08.523
YOU'RE S'POSTA
BE SEARCHIN'
FOR DA PHARAOH,

00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:10.627
NOT FOR LUNCH.

00:12:10.627 --> 00:12:13.065
LOOK.
I FOUND A CLUE. SEE?

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:16.339
HEY, DAT LOOKS JUST LIKE
THE PHARAOH'S CAPE.

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:18.175
WHERE'D YOU GET DAT?

00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:20.681
IT WAS FLOATING
IN THE NILE
NEXT TO MY LUNCH.

00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:22.050
YEAH. WELL, THERE
WOULDN'T HAPPEN

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.954
TO HAVE BEEN A PERSON
ATTACHED TO IT,
WAS THERE?

00:12:23.954 --> 00:12:26.526
NO, BUT THERE WERE SOME
YUMMY FISH NEXT TO IT.

00:12:26.526 --> 00:12:28.830
WILL YOU STOP THINKIN'
WITH YOUR STOMACH
FOR ONCE?

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.133
Yugi:
THE IMPORTANT
THING IS,

00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:31.736
WE FOUND
SOMETHING OF
THE PHARAOH'S.

00:12:31.736 --> 00:12:33.406
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:36.145
THAT MEANS HE
MUST BE AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:38.282
SO LET'S
FIND HIM.
YEAH.

00:12:38.282 --> 00:12:39.852
IF YOU'RE
NOT THE PHARAOH,

00:12:39.852 --> 00:12:41.522
THEN THIS MUST MEAN
THAT THE KING
IS MISSING.

00:12:41.522 --> 00:12:43.459
All: WE JUST SAID THAT.

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:46.098
SOMETIMES IT TAKES
ME A LITTLE WHILE
TO CATCH ON.

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:48.469
Yugi: WILL YOU HELP US
LOOK FOR HIM?

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:51.608
I'M ASSUMING
YOU AND THE PHARAOH
ARE FRIENDS, AREN'T YOU?

00:12:51.608 --> 00:12:54.181
ACTUALLY, HE'S
MY CLOSEST FRIEND.

00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:56.785
YEAH. ME, TOO,
THE POOR GUY,

00:12:56.785 --> 00:12:59.057
BUT I KNOW THAT WE'RE
GONNA FIND HIM SOON.

00:12:59.057 --> 00:13:00.460
YOU'RE HIS FRIEND?

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.662
MM-HMM.

00:13:01.662 --> 00:13:03.632
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
WE ALL ARE.

00:13:03.632 --> 00:13:06.572
THE 4 OF US HAVE BEEN PALS
WITH THE PHARAOH FOR YEARS.

00:13:06.572 --> 00:13:08.141
THEN WHY DON'T
I KNOW YOU?

00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:10.245
IT'S A PRETTY
LONG STORY.

00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:12.282
YOU CAN TELL ME ALL
ABOUT IT ON THE WAY.

ARE A LOT OF THINGS,

00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:20.833
BUT FRIENDLY
IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.906
SO YOU 5 PROMISE
YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH
THE PHARAOH, RIGHT?

00:13:25.242 --> 00:13:30.887

NO SIGN OF HIS MAJESTY.

WE CAN DO, SIR.

00:13:59.343 --> 00:14:00.946
WE CAN'T STOP.

00:14:00.946 --> 00:14:03.116
HE IS OUT THERE,
AND WE SHALL FIND HIM.

WHAT WE CANNOT.

OH, PHARAOH,
HOW 'BOUT A HISTORY LESSON

ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

00:14:44.766 --> 00:14:48.440
HE DESTROYED MY VILLAGE
WHEN HE FASHIONED
THE 7 MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.346
IN A SELFISH ATTEMPT TO FURTHER
HIS OWN POWER.

00:14:51.346 --> 00:14:53.517

TO LIE TO EVERYONE

00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:57.525
ABOUT HOW HE PLANNED
TO USE THE ITEMS TO RESTORE
PEACE AND HARMONY.

00:14:57.525 --> 00:14:59.361
OF COURSE, I KNEW BETTER
THAN TO BE FOOLED

BY A RUTHLESS
DICTATOR LIKE HIM.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.304
ALL YOUR KING REALLY
DESIRED WAS POWER.

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:06.475

COULD HIS WORDS BE TRUE?

IN ORDER TO CREATE
THE 7 MILLENNIUM ITEMS,

00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:20.636
OR DID HE RULE JUSTLY
AND RESTORE PEACE TO EGYPT?

I WISH I REMEMBERED
MORE ABOUT HIM.

CAME BEFORE.

00:17:37.436 --> 00:17:39.941
EGYPTIAN GODS,
HEAR ME.

00:17:39.941 --> 00:17:42.579
I HAVE COMMITTED
A CRIME BEYOND ATONEMENT,

00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:44.718
AND FOR THIS,
I AM TRULY SORRY.

00:17:44.718 --> 00:17:47.689
BY BRINGING THE 7 MILLENNIUM
ITEMS INTO THIS WORLD,

00:17:47.689 --> 00:17:50.362
I HAVE DESTROYED
THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS.

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:54.303
I BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THESE ACTIONS.

00:17:54.303 --> 00:17:57.209
PLEASE SPARE MY SON.

00:17:57.209 --> 00:18:00.281
DO NOT PUNISH HIM FOR
THE MISDEEDS OF HIS FATHER.

00:18:00.281 --> 00:18:02.419
ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT, DAD?

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:07.396
WHY IS IT
YOU'RE CRYING?

00:18:07.396 --> 00:18:11.937
AAH!

00:18:11.937 --> 00:18:13.508
OH! OHH!

00:18:13.508 --> 00:18:16.414
MY SON, FEAR NOT.

00:18:16.414 --> 00:18:19.753
YOU ARE SAFE NOW.

00:18:19.753 --> 00:18:21.891
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
YES. I REMEMBER NOW.

00:18:21.891 --> 00:18:24.630
MY FATHER SURRENDERED
HIS OWN SAFETY

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:29.472
TO ENSURE MINE.

00:18:29.472 --> 00:18:31.476
WHO'S THERE?

00:18:31.476 --> 00:18:34.415
I AM HE WHO
IS KNOWN AS HASAN.

00:18:34.415 --> 00:18:38.190
I HAVE COME TO WARN YOU
OF AN IMPENDING DANGER,
PHARAOH.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.029
ZORC THE DARK ONE
WILL SOON AWAKEN.

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:42.431
WHO IS ZORC?

00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:45.337
THE EMBODIMENT
OF PURE DARKNESS.

00:18:45.337 --> 00:18:49.712
PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT I CAN DO TO STOP HIM.

00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:55.457
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,
YOU WILL KNOW.

00:18:55.457 --> 00:18:58.130
I MUST WARN THE OTHERS.

00:19:03.406 --> 00:19:07.848
I SHALL PROTECT ALL THAT
MY FATHER STRUGGLED TO BUILD.

00:19:07.848 --> 00:19:09.952
Boy: HA HA!
WE DID IT, DAD.

00:19:09.952 --> 00:19:11.623
YES. NOW PULL.

00:19:11.623 --> 00:19:13.225
RIGHT.

00:19:13.225 --> 00:19:14.862
UH!
WAAH.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:18.570
WELL DONE,
MY BOY.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.373
Yugi: THAT WAS SO COOL.

00:19:20.373 --> 00:19:22.678
I'VE NEVER MET
A REAL MAGICIAN BEFORE.

00:19:22.678 --> 00:19:25.216
WELL, I'M
REALLY ONLY
HALF A MAGICIAN,

00:19:25.216 --> 00:19:28.222
CONSIDERING ONLY
HALF OF MY SPELLS
ACTUALLY WORK.

00:19:28.222 --> 00:19:30.126
UH...

00:19:30.126 --> 00:19:31.963
YA KNOW, BACK
WHERE I COME FROM,

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:34.434
THERE'S THIS CARD GAME
CALLED "DUEL MONSTERS."

00:19:34.434 --> 00:19:36.104
I'M SURE YOU'VE
NEVER HEARD OF IT,

00:19:36.104 --> 00:19:38.676
BUT THERE'S
THIS CHARACTER IN THE GAME
THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU.

00:19:38.676 --> 00:19:40.479
SO YOU'RE SAYING
I'M A CHARACTER?

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.550
UH, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.321
UH, HER NAME
IS DARK MAGICIAN GIRL,

00:19:44.321 --> 00:19:45.957
AND SHE'S REALLY POWERFUL,

00:19:45.957 --> 00:19:47.861
AND I BET IF YOU KEEP
PRACTICING YOUR SPELLS,

00:19:47.861 --> 00:19:50.399
YOU CAN BE JUST AS STRONG
AS SHE IS.

00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:53.104
BY THE WAY, YOU NEVER
TOLD US YOUR NAME.

00:19:53.104 --> 00:19:54.908
IT WAS MANA,

00:19:54.908 --> 00:19:57.380
BUT NOW I'M THINKING
ABOUT CHANGING IT,

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.851
YA KNOW, TO DARK
MAGICIAN GIRL.

00:19:59.851 --> 00:20:01.889
WHATTA
YOU GUYS THINK?

00:20:01.889 --> 00:20:04.393
PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE
TO PRACTICE YOUR SPELL-CASTING

00:20:04.393 --> 00:20:07.266
BY CONJURING UP
AN ENORMOUS SARDINE SANDWICH,

00:20:07.266 --> 00:20:09.036
HOLD THE PICKLES,
OF COURSE.

00:20:09.036 --> 00:20:10.940
HUH?
EH!

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.311
HEY, WHY DONCHA
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE
GOIN', YA BIG OAF?

00:20:13.311 --> 00:20:15.181
NEXT TIME, USE
YOUR BRAKE LIGHTS.

00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:18.822
HUH? WAIT A SEC.
ISN'T THAT--

00:20:18.822 --> 00:20:20.292
All: PHARAOH!

00:20:20.292 --> 00:20:21.929
HUH? HUH?

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:23.933
YOO HOO!

00:20:23.933 --> 00:20:25.735
Yami-Yugi:
YUGI? IS THAT YOU?

00:20:25.735 --> 00:20:27.472
YOU BET IT IS,
PHARAOH.

00:20:27.472 --> 00:20:30.245
HEY, LONG TIME NO SEE,
YOU KING OF EGYPT, YOU.

00:20:30.245 --> 00:20:31.380
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.555
HI, PHARAOH.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:20:35.555 --> 00:20:37.869
COME ON. WHAT'RE WE
STANDING HERE FOR?

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:40.272
YEAH! ALL RIGHT!

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:41.873
OH, IT'S SO GREAT
TO SEE YOU.

00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:43.008
PHARAOH!

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:44.009
HA HA! YEAH!

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:45.010
YEAH!

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.078
ALL RIGHT!

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:47.746
IT'S SO GREAT
TO SEE YOU.
