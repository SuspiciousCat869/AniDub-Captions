00:10:37.702 --> 00:10:42.745
NO!

00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:44.649
I'M SORRY.

00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:47.955
BUT THOSE ARE THE RULES
OF THE SHADOW GAME.

00:10:47.955 --> 00:10:50.426
YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT!

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.971
I'D SUGGEST
TAKING MY ADVICE

00:10:56.971 --> 00:10:59.142
IF YOU WANNA MAKE IT
OUT OF THIS TOMB.

00:10:59.142 --> 00:11:01.714
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:06.557
YE SHALL NOW BE JUDGED BY
THE CREATURES OF THE STONE.

00:11:06.557 --> 00:11:09.663
ONLY THE PURE OF HEART...
ARE PERMITTED TO PASS.

00:11:09.663 --> 00:11:13.872
ALL OTHERS WILL LOSE THEIR SOULS
TO THE DARKNESS.

00:11:13.872 --> 00:11:17.345
WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE
ALL THIS ANCIENT
GIBBERISH!?

00:11:17.345 --> 00:11:19.784
WHAT CHOICE
DO YOU HAVE?

00:11:19.784 --> 00:11:22.355
LOOK AT THAT.

00:11:22.355 --> 00:11:27.432
IT MUST BE THE
PHARAOH'S TREASURE!

00:11:27.432 --> 00:11:30.171
AND BASED ON THESE TRAPS
I'M SURE IT'S VALUABLE!

00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:31.673
GO ON.

00:11:31.673 --> 00:11:35.916
YOUR MOVE.

00:11:35.916 --> 00:11:38.955
Grandpa:
I FELT A STRANGE SENSATION.

00:11:38.955 --> 00:11:42.930
IT WAS AS IF THERE WAS ANOTHER
PRESENCE IN THE ROOM.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.499
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?!

00:11:44.499 --> 00:11:45.969
GO AND GET IT!

00:11:45.969 --> 00:11:47.438
ONE MUSTN'T BE
TOO HASTY.

00:11:47.438 --> 00:11:50.511
WE'RE DEALING WITH
A POWERFUL FORCE HERE.

00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:55.054
Grandpa:
NOW I KNEW MY GUIDE WAS
BLINDED BY HIS OWN GREED...

00:11:55.054 --> 00:11:59.095
BUT WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS JUST
HOW FAR HE WAS WILLING TO GO.

00:12:06.243 --> 00:12:08.948
THANKS FOR DOING ALL
THE WORK DOCTOR MUTO...

00:12:08.948 --> 00:12:10.751
BUT I CAN TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:12.555
YOU SNAKE!

00:12:12.555 --> 00:12:15.594
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME
I HAVE A PRIZE TO CLAIM.

00:12:19.903 --> 00:12:22.575
I'LL NEVER WANT
FOR ANYTHING AGAIN.

00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:33.263
ALL THIS TALK OF CREATURES
AND SHADOW GAMES IS NONSENSE!

00:12:36.636 --> 00:12:38.841
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

00:12:46.623 --> 00:12:48.627
I CAN'T HOLD ON.

00:12:48.627 --> 00:12:51.066
I WAS...SO CLOSE.

00:13:02.722 --> 00:13:07.231
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

00:13:07.231 --> 00:13:11.339
Grandpa:
WHEN I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
SOMETHING FELT DIFFERENT.

00:13:11.339 --> 00:13:15.848
IT WAS AS IF THE DARKNESS
HAD SOMEHOW LIFTED.

00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.762
IS ANYONE HERE?

00:13:22.762 --> 00:13:25.201
Grandpa:
AND THAT'S WHEN IT HAPPENED.

00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:29.209
THAT ARTIFACT SEEMED TO BE
CALLING OUT TO ME.

00:13:35.454 --> 00:13:37.859
I'LL ALWAYS KEEP THIS SAFE.

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:40.531
Grandpa:
AND I ALWAYS DID.

00:13:40.531 --> 00:13:42.702
AND NOW THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
IS YOURS.

00:13:42.702 --> 00:13:44.204
WOW GRANDPA!

00:13:44.204 --> 00:13:45.741
YOU REALLY DID ALL THAT!?

00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:47.645
HA HA HA!

00:13:47.645 --> 00:13:50.484
I MIGHT'VE EXAGGERATED
JUST A BIT.

00:13:50.484 --> 00:13:51.853
NOW TELL ME...

00:13:51.853 --> 00:13:54.325
DOES THIS
SUDDEN INTEREST
IN MY OLD ADVENTURES

00:13:54.325 --> 00:13:56.730
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH TOMORROW'S TRIP?

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.268
OF COURSE.

00:13:59.268 --> 00:14:03.343
BEFORE I HEAD OFF
TO EGYPT

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:06.917
THEY MAY HAVE MOVED
THAT STONE TABLET BACK
TO WHERE IT CAME FROM...

00:14:06.917 --> 00:14:09.722
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA
STOP ME FROM SEEING IT.

00:14:09.722 --> 00:14:13.062
AND THIS TIME, WHEN I HOLD UP
THE THREE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS,

00:14:13.062 --> 00:14:16.569
THE PHARAOH'S LOST MEMORIES
ARE GONNA BE RELEASED!

00:14:16.569 --> 00:14:19.308
GRAMPS...I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU STILL REMEMBER

00:14:19.308 --> 00:14:22.013
WHERE THE PHARAOH'S TOMB
WAS, DO YOU?

00:14:22.013 --> 00:14:24.652
CAN'T SAY THAT I DO.

00:14:24.652 --> 00:14:28.259
I HIRED THOSE TWO GUIDES
TO FIND IT FOR ME,
REMEMBER?

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:31.198
THE VALLEY OF THE KINGS
IS BIGGER THAN
YOU THINK.

00:14:31.198 --> 00:14:33.704
AND MOST OF THOSE CAVES
LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME.

00:14:33.704 --> 00:14:35.239
OH WELL.

00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:37.344
IT'S JUST THAT I WAS LOOKING
FORWARD TO SEEING THE SPOT

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:39.449
WHERE YOU FOUND
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:40.851
NOT A CHANCE!

00:14:40.851 --> 00:14:42.888
STAY OUT OF THAT PLACE!

00:14:42.888 --> 00:14:44.659
BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND...

00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:47.732
MAY I HAVE ONE LAST LOOK
AT THOSE EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS?

00:14:47.732 --> 00:14:49.267
AGAIN?!

00:14:49.267 --> 00:14:50.637
IT'S LIKE YOUR FIFTH TIME.

00:14:50.637 --> 00:14:53.476
BUT THE THOUGHT OF
BEING WITHOUT THEM
FOR SO LONG...

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:56.015
IT MAKES ME...
SO SAD.

00:14:56.015 --> 00:14:57.985
OKAY, OKAY.

00:14:57.985 --> 00:15:01.593
THANK YOU.

00:15:01.593 --> 00:15:03.563
AHH...

00:15:03.563 --> 00:15:05.400
HOW DO I LOVE THEE!?

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.337
LET ME COUNT
THE WAYS!

00:15:07.337 --> 00:15:09.508
ALRIGHT THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:11.412
CAN'T YOU JUST
LEAVE THEM WITH ME?

00:15:11.412 --> 00:15:13.215
PLEASE!
BE A PAL!

00:15:13.215 --> 00:15:14.719
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THEM!

00:15:14.719 --> 00:15:16.756
YOU CAN TRUST ME YUGI!

00:15:16.756 --> 00:15:17.958
OH!

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.595
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT!

00:15:19.595 --> 00:15:21.432
FIDDLESTICKS.

00:15:21.432 --> 00:15:23.637
THE PHARAOH NEEDS
THESE THREE CARDS!

00:15:23.637 --> 00:15:26.041
WITHOUT THEM HE'LL
NEVER BE ABLE TO UNLOCK

00:15:26.041 --> 00:15:27.878
ALL THE MYSTERIES
OF HIS PAST!

00:15:27.878 --> 00:15:30.483
SORRY YUGI.

00:15:30.483 --> 00:15:33.622
THIS IS WHAT
THE PHARAOH'S
BEEN WAITING FOR.

00:15:33.622 --> 00:15:36.963
IT'S WHY
HE SAVED ME.

00:15:36.963 --> 00:15:40.269
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU.

00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:44.712
FOR SOME REASON WHEN
THE PHARAOH'S SPIRIT WAS
SEALED AWAY IN THAT TOMB,

00:15:44.712 --> 00:15:46.482
HIS MEMORY WAS WIPED CLEAN.

00:15:46.482 --> 00:15:48.619
SO HE WAITED FOR
FIVE THOUSAND YEARS

00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:52.293
UNTIL FATE BROUGHT HIM TO YUGI.

00:15:52.293 --> 00:15:55.233
LISTEN...YOU'RE
THE ONE PERSON WITH
THE POWER TO HELP HIM

00:15:55.233 --> 00:15:57.938
REGAIN EVERYTHING
HE LOST.

00:15:57.938 --> 00:16:00.243
YUGI.

00:16:00.243 --> 00:16:02.480
HE WHO HOLDS
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.684
HOLDS THE LEGACY
OF THE PHARAOH.

00:16:04.684 --> 00:16:07.758
AND BELIEVE ME THAT'S
NO SMALL TASK.

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:08.760
I KNOW.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.896
GOOD.

00:16:09.896 --> 00:16:11.331
MY ADVENTURE'S DONE...

00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:13.435
HOWEVER YOURS
HAS JUST BEGUN.

00:16:13.435 --> 00:16:15.006
YUGI...
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE

00:16:15.006 --> 00:16:17.744
I WANT YOU TO KEEP
IN MIND OUT THERE.

00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:19.514
WHAT IS IT GRANDPA?

00:16:19.514 --> 00:16:20.851
LOOK.

00:16:20.851 --> 00:16:23.355
TREAT EVERY CHALLENGE
YOU FACE LIKE A GAME.

00:16:23.355 --> 00:16:25.526
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS AND
YOU'LL COME OUT ON TOP.

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.030
OKAY.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.833
PLAYING GAMES IS
WHAT I DO BEST.

00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:32.807
AH, A BOY
AFTER MY OWN HEART.

00:16:32.807 --> 00:16:34.311
ALL RIGHT.

00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:35.713
GET SOME REST.

00:16:35.713 --> 00:16:37.283
YOU'VE GOT A BIG DAY
AHEAD OF YOU.

00:16:37.283 --> 00:16:38.920
NIGHT GRAMPS.

00:17:03.599 --> 00:17:06.739
IS EVERYTHING ALRIGHT YUGI?

00:17:06.739 --> 00:17:09.912
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT
WHAT GRANDPA SAID.

00:17:09.912 --> 00:17:12.317
YOU KNOW, ABOUT FATE
BRINGING THE TWO OF US
TOGETHER.

00:17:12.317 --> 00:17:15.723
HE SAID
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO COULD HELP YOU.

00:17:15.723 --> 00:17:17.259
THAT'S TRUE.

00:17:17.259 --> 00:17:19.063
BUT EVER SINCE WE MET

00:17:19.063 --> 00:17:21.167
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE
HELPED ME MUCH MORE
THAN I'VE HELPED YOU.

00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:23.171
I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT.

00:17:23.171 --> 00:17:25.042
BEFORE YOU CAME
INTO MY LIFE...

00:17:25.042 --> 00:17:27.212
I SPENT ALL MY TIME
ALONE.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:31.254
I BARELY SPOKE
TO ANYONE.

00:17:31.254 --> 00:17:34.628
BUT THE MINUTE I PUT
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
TOGETHER

00:17:34.628 --> 00:17:36.498
MY ENTIRE LIFE CHANGED!

00:17:36.498 --> 00:17:40.473
YU-GI-OH!

00:17:40.473 --> 00:17:42.811
YOU GAVE ME
THE CONFIDENCE I NEEDED

00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:45.650
TO BE MYSELF...
AND TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:51.194
FRIENDS THAT I'LL HAVE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!

00:17:51.194 --> 00:17:53.899
AND THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:17:53.899 --> 00:17:56.572
I WOULDN'T BE
THE DUELIST I AM
WITHOUT YOU.

00:17:56.572 --> 00:17:58.643
FACE IT...
TEAMING UP WITH YOU

00:17:58.643 --> 00:18:01.882
IS THE BEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED
TO ME IN MY WHOLE LIFE!

00:18:01.882 --> 00:18:03.385
THANK YOU.

00:18:03.385 --> 00:18:04.888
NO THANK YOU.

00:18:04.888 --> 00:18:07.393
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I'D BE WITHOUT YOU.

00:18:07.393 --> 00:18:10.399
I JUST HOPE I CAN
RETURN THE FAVOR.

00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:12.804
BUT YOU ALREADY HAVE.

00:18:12.804 --> 00:18:16.912
I WAS ALONE FOR NEARLY
FIVE THOUSAND YEARS
UNTIL THE DAY WE MET.

00:18:16.912 --> 00:18:20.820
AND THEN YOUR FRIENDS
BECAME MY FRIENDS TOO.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.857
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT
THAT WAY.

00:18:22.857 --> 00:18:24.393
WELL IT'S TRUE.

00:18:24.393 --> 00:18:26.431
BESIDES, YOU'RE ABOUT
TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME

00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:28.836
THAT I COULD NEVER DO
ON MY OWN--

00:18:28.836 --> 00:18:31.340
REGAIN MY MEMORY
AND UNLOCK THE MYSTERIES

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.911
OF MY PAST!

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:35.348
WELL IT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO.

00:18:35.348 --> 00:18:40.325
WE MAKE AN EXCELLENT TEAM.

00:18:40.325 --> 00:18:43.098
THIS IS IT REX!

00:18:43.098 --> 00:18:46.972
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS'LL
FINALLY BE IN THE HANDS OF
SOMEONE WHO DESERVES 'EM!

00:18:46.972 --> 00:18:48.441
AH HA!

00:18:48.441 --> 00:18:50.579
SO YOU DO ADMIT
THOSE CARDS BELONG
WITH ME!

00:18:50.579 --> 00:18:53.585
DREAM ON!

00:18:53.585 --> 00:18:55.155
OH NO!

00:18:55.155 --> 00:18:56.457
GO!
HE'S AWAKE!

00:18:56.457 --> 00:18:58.561
RUN FOR IT!

00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:00.298
Yugi: STOP!

00:19:00.298 --> 00:19:02.871
COME ON!

00:19:02.871 --> 00:19:06.344
COME BACK!

00:19:06.344 --> 00:19:09.350
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS!

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.822
IF THAT BAG FALLS INTO
THE WRONG HANDS,

00:19:11.822 --> 00:19:13.859
THE WHOLE WORLD
COULD BE IN DANGER!

00:19:20.272 --> 00:19:22.309
THAT WAS A JOKE!

00:19:22.309 --> 00:19:27.085
I GOTTA HAVE A LOOK
AT THESE THINGS!

00:19:27.085 --> 00:19:28.388
HEY! WAIT A SEC!

00:19:28.388 --> 00:19:31.027
THOSE AREN'T
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:19:40.545 --> 00:19:42.049
HA HA HA!

00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:43.318
WHO'S THERE?!

00:19:43.318 --> 00:19:46.757
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG
HAS IT?

00:19:46.757 --> 00:19:48.228
I KNOW YOU!

00:19:48.228 --> 00:19:50.465
YOU USED TO TAG ALONG
WITH YUGI RIGHT?

00:19:50.465 --> 00:19:52.169
LISTEN PAL.

00:19:52.169 --> 00:19:54.607
YOU BETTER NOT BE
AFTER THOSE GOD CARDS!
