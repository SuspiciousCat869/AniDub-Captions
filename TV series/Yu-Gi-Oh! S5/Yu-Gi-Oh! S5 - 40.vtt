00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:19.389
VALLEY OF THE KINGS?

00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:20.858
Yugi: WAIT A SEC.

00:16:20.858 --> 00:16:24.030
GRAMPS TOLD ME THAT'S WHERE
THE PHARAOH'S TOMB IS.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.199
AND IN THE OLD DAYS,

00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:26.401
A PHARAOH'S TOMB
WAS BUILT

00:16:26.401 --> 00:16:28.638
WHILE HE WAS STILL
RULING EGYPT!

00:16:28.638 --> 00:16:30.107
SO THAT MEANS
THE PHARAOH'S NAME

00:16:30.107 --> 00:16:31.877
MUST HAVE ALREADY
BEEN CARVED

00:16:31.877 --> 00:16:34.683
SOMEWHERE ON HIS
FUTURE TOMB, GUYS!

00:16:40.726 --> 00:16:44.600
[THINKING]
NOW TO DESTROY THAT NAME
BEFORE THEY LAY EYES ON IT.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.004
THANKS FOR
EVERYTHING, BOBASA.

00:16:47.004 --> 00:16:48.139
NO, THANK YOU

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:49.709
FOR FEEDING ME
THOSE GRAPES!

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:51.713
SINCE THEN,
I HAVEN'T BEEN
HUNGRY AT ALL,

00:16:51.713 --> 00:16:54.451
WHICH IS A SENSATION
I'VE NEVER FELT!

00:16:54.451 --> 00:16:55.753
HEY, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT,

00:16:55.753 --> 00:16:57.856
I'M NOT HUNGRY
ANYMORE, EITHER.

00:16:57.856 --> 00:16:59.526
YA KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:16:59.526 --> 00:17:01.663
ACTUALLY,
I COULD USE A BITE.

00:17:01.663 --> 00:17:05.570
IT'S BEEN ONE MYSTERY
AFTER ANOTHER
SINCE WE GOT HERE.

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.039
AND YOU'RE
THE BIGGEST
MYSTERY!

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:09.510
WELL, I FINALLY KNOW
WHY I WAS PUT HERE--

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.879
FOR YOU.

00:17:10.879 --> 00:17:12.650
WHATTA YA MEAN?

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.354
THERE IS MORE
TO THIS ADVENTURE
THAN MEETS THE EYE !

00:17:15.354 --> 00:17:17.424
SO REMEMBER,
LIFE IS LIKE A GAME,

00:17:17.424 --> 00:17:21.097
AND SOMETIMES HELPING OTHERS
IS THEY KEY TO WINNING IT ALL!

00:17:21.097 --> 00:17:23.201
HA HA HA!

00:17:23.201 --> 00:17:24.771
WHAT DA HECK
DOES DAT MEAN?!

00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:26.173
BYE BYE.

00:17:26.173 --> 00:17:28.544
TIME FOR ME TO GO!

00:17:28.544 --> 00:17:30.013
HOLD ON!

00:17:30.013 --> 00:17:31.015
BOBASA!?

00:17:31.015 --> 00:17:32.251
COME BACK!

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:33.253
HE'S GONE.

00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:34.254
BOBASA!

00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:38.595
All: BOBASA!

00:17:38.595 --> 00:17:41.767
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:41.767 --> 00:17:43.537
IMPRESSIVE.

00:17:43.537 --> 00:17:44.940
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.376
YOUR FRIENDS
ARE DOING MUCH BETTER

00:17:46.376 --> 00:17:48.512
THAN I HAD EVER EXPECTED.

00:17:48.512 --> 00:17:51.418
IN FACT, THEY'RE CLOSE
TO UNCOVERING
YOUR ANCIENT NAME.

00:17:51.418 --> 00:17:52.887
HOW DO YOU KNOW?!

00:17:52.887 --> 00:17:55.157
YOU SAID THEY'RE NOT
A PART OF THIS!

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:57.695
YOU'VE BEEN
SPYING ON THEM,
HAVEN'T YOU!?

00:17:57.695 --> 00:17:59.232
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN!

00:17:59.232 --> 00:18:02.003
OF COURSE NOT.

00:18:02.003 --> 00:18:04.140
NOT THAT IT MATTERS,
RIGHT?

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.580
AFTER ALL,
THE COUNTDOWN
TO MY VICTORY IS ON.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.917
THE RESURRECTION OF ZORC
IS NEAR!

00:18:09.917 --> 00:18:12.655
AND SINCE WE'RE
APPROACHING THE CLIMAX...

00:18:12.655 --> 00:18:14.091
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME

00:18:14.091 --> 00:18:17.230
I ADDED ANOTHER LITTLE TWIST
TO THIS GAME OF OURS.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:24.109
[YELLING]

00:18:24.109 --> 00:18:26.279
THESE SIDES ARE UNEVEN.

00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:27.983
BUT I'M ABOUT
TO CHANGE THAT.

00:18:27.983 --> 00:18:31.622
WHAT SORT OF
WICKED SCHEME
ARE YOU UP TO, BAKURA!?

00:18:31.622 --> 00:18:33.859
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW,
PHARAOH!

00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:35.863
AFTER ALL,
I'M SIMPLY USING A TACTIC

00:18:35.863 --> 00:18:39.102
I LEARNED FROM YOU
EARLIER ON IN THE GAME.

00:18:39.102 --> 00:18:40.571
AND WHAT'S THAT!?

00:18:40.571 --> 00:18:43.811
REMEMBER WHEN
YOU WERE DRAINED
OF ALL YOUR STRENGTH?

00:18:43.811 --> 00:18:46.014
SO YOUR FRIEND
GAVE YOU A BOOST?

00:18:46.014 --> 00:18:48.786
WE'VE COME TOO FAR
TO TURN BACK NOW.

00:18:48.786 --> 00:18:51.291
YOU AND I
ARE A TEAM, REMEMBER?

00:18:51.291 --> 00:18:52.893
[THINKING]
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

00:18:52.893 --> 00:18:55.698
I CAN FEEL MY ENERGY
RETURNING.

00:18:55.698 --> 00:18:58.970
I FORGOT HOW STRONG
MY BOND WITH YUGI
TRULY IS.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.141
[GRUNT]

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:04.380
ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T
THINK OF IT
AT THE TIME, PHARAOH...

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.083
TWO CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME!

00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:07.085
[GASP]

00:19:07.085 --> 00:19:08.321
NO.

00:19:08.321 --> 00:19:10.624
I'M GOING TO BRING BACK
A FORMER PAWN OF MINE.

00:19:10.624 --> 00:19:13.463
HOWEVER,
FIRST I SHALL NEED
TO BORROW SOME STRENGTH

00:19:13.463 --> 00:19:15.833
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:17.937
SO I CALL...KAIBA!

00:19:17.937 --> 00:19:19.173
[GASP]

00:19:19.173 --> 00:19:23.781
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

00:19:23.781 --> 00:19:25.317
WHAT'S GOING ON!?

00:19:25.317 --> 00:19:27.220
AAH!

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.528
[LAUGHTER]

[SHOUTING]

00:19:38.641 --> 00:19:43.650
[SHOUTING]

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.785
HOLD ON.

00:19:44.785 --> 00:19:46.988
THIS PLACE LOOKS FAMILIAR.

00:19:46.988 --> 00:19:51.397
BUT I'M NOT SURE WHY.

00:19:51.397 --> 00:19:52.799
YOU SHALL SEE,

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:55.604
JUST AS SOON
AS I BORROW YOUR SOUL!

00:19:55.604 --> 00:19:57.775
HA HA HA!

00:19:57.775 --> 00:20:00.513
WHOA! WHOA!

00:20:00.513 --> 00:20:04.587
[YELLING]

00:20:04.587 --> 00:20:05.655
I MUST...

00:20:05.655 --> 00:20:07.391
JOIN MY FATHER NOW.

00:20:07.391 --> 00:20:08.961
YES, MY SON!

00:20:24.488 --> 00:20:25.490
[LAUGHING]

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.397
NO!

00:20:29.397 --> 00:20:30.566
I MUST SAY,

00:20:30.566 --> 00:20:32.502
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK
IN THE GAME AGAIN.

00:20:32.502 --> 00:20:34.506
AND IT APPEARS
I'M JUST IN TIME--

00:20:34.506 --> 00:20:37.311
TO WITNESS
THE GRAND FINALE, THAT IS,

00:20:37.311 --> 00:20:38.747
FEATURING
ZORC THE DARK ONE

00:20:38.747 --> 00:20:41.184
IN HIS LONG-AWAITED RETURN!

00:20:41.184 --> 00:20:44.184
AND THE PHARAOH
IN HIS FAREWELL PERFORMANCE!
