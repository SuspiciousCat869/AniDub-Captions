GANDORA,

00:07:53.623 --> 00:07:59.135
DESTROY HIS DARK
MAGICIAN WITH
BOUNDLESS GIGARAYS!

00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:01.439
I REVEAL MY TRAP!

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.546
DARK ILLUSION!

00:08:04.546 --> 00:08:07.953
[GASPS]

00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:11.660
[GRUNTING]

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.497
MY DARK ILLUSION
TRAP CARD

00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:15.368
SHALL PROTECT
MY DARK MAGICIAN

00:08:15.368 --> 00:08:16.604
FROM ALL
MONSTER EFFECTS

00:08:16.604 --> 00:08:18.274
FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE TURN!

00:08:18.274 --> 00:08:19.576
NO WAY.

00:08:19.576 --> 00:08:20.712
EVEN WITH GANDORA,

00:08:20.712 --> 00:08:22.683
I COULDN'T DEFEAT
HIS DARK MAGICIAN.

00:08:22.683 --> 00:08:23.885
YUGI...

00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:25.889
DUE TO THE EFFECT
OF MY DARK ILLUSION,

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:28.695
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DRAW
ONE CARD FROM YOUR DECK.

00:08:28.695 --> 00:08:33.672
SO, GO AHEAD AND DRAW.

00:08:33.672 --> 00:08:36.077
I PLACE THESE TWO
CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:08:36.077 --> 00:08:38.482
AND THAT ENDS MY TURN!

00:08:38.482 --> 00:08:42.390
NOW YUGI'S BACK TO
HAVING NO MONSTERS
TO PROTECT HIM!

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.793
I HATE TO
SAY IT, GUYS,

00:08:43.793 --> 00:08:45.897
BUT I THINK
IT'S REALLY
OVER THIS TIME!

00:08:45.897 --> 00:08:46.966
HUH?

00:08:46.966 --> 00:08:49.037
NOT NECESSARILY,
MOKUBA.

00:08:49.037 --> 00:08:51.274
THE WAY THIS DUEL'S
BEEN GOING SO FAR,

00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:55.250
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.886
IT'S MY MOVE.

00:08:56.886 --> 00:08:58.156
ALL RIGHT...

00:08:58.156 --> 00:09:01.662
DARK MAGICIAN, ATTACK HIS
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:09:01.662 --> 00:09:02.899
[SCREAMING]

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:05.203
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP!

00:09:05.203 --> 00:09:06.639
MAGICIAN'S CIRCLE!

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:07.775
[SCREAMS]

00:09:07.775 --> 00:09:10.013
WHENEVER YOU ATTACK
ME WITH A SPELL-CASTER,

00:09:10.013 --> 00:09:12.117
I CAN ACTIVATE
THIS TRAP CARD.

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:14.689
AND IT GIVES ME THE POWER
TO AUTOMATICALLY SUMMON

00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:16.827
A SPELLCASTER
FROM MY DECK!

00:09:16.827 --> 00:09:19.064
[THINKING]
THAT'S THE PERFECT
CARD TO USE

00:09:19.064 --> 00:09:20.701
AGAINST MY
DARK MAGICIAN.

00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:23.640
I KNEW YUGI WAS PREPARED
FOR MY STRATEGY!

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.578
SO, NOW I SUMMON...

00:09:25.578 --> 00:09:30.756
MY SILENT MAGICIAN!

00:09:30.756 --> 00:09:32.960
NICE MOVE,
BUT YOUR TRAP CARD

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.966
ALLOWS ME TO PLAY
A MONSTER AS WELL.

00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:41.444
SO, NOW I SUMMON
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:09:41.444 --> 00:09:45.920
AW, MAN, TWO
DARK MAGICIANS?!

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.091
NOW, MY DARK MAGICIAN...

00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:49.193
ATTACK!

00:09:49.193 --> 00:09:53.836
DESTROY HIS MONSTER
AND END THIS DUEL!

00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:56.374
AS SOON AS HIS DARK
MAGICIAN ATTACKS,

00:09:56.374 --> 00:09:57.777
THE PHARAOH WINS!

00:09:57.777 --> 00:09:59.079
THIS CAN'T
BE THE END!

00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:00.483
[GASPS]

00:10:00.483 --> 00:10:01.718
[SCREAMING]

00:10:01.718 --> 00:10:03.021
[GROANS]

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:09.226
[SCREAMING]

00:10:09.226 --> 00:10:10.930
[GASPS]

00:10:13.235 --> 00:10:15.206
[THINKING]
I'M NOT DONE
YET, PHARAOH!

00:10:15.206 --> 00:10:17.009
IF YOU'RE SPIRIT'S
EVER GONNA BE FREE,

00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:18.913
I HAVE TO WIN
THIS DUEL!

00:10:18.913 --> 00:10:21.351
I ACTIVATE MY
MAGIC CARD--

00:10:21.351 --> 00:10:25.894
SPELL TEXTBOOK!

00:10:25.894 --> 00:10:28.834
NOW BY DISCARDING EVERY
CARD IN MY HAND...

00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:31.371
I CAN DRAW ONE
FROM MY DECK!

00:10:31.371 --> 00:10:34.445
AND IF IT'S A MAGIC CARD,
I CAN USE IT RIGHT AWAY!

00:10:34.445 --> 00:10:36.516
SINCE MY HAND'S EMPTY...

00:10:36.516 --> 00:10:38.753
I HAVE NOTING TO DISCARD.

00:10:38.753 --> 00:10:40.491
[THINKING]
THE CARD I'M ABOUT TO DRAW

00:10:40.491 --> 00:10:43.497
WILL DETERMINE
THE PHARAOH'S DESTINY.

00:10:47.204 --> 00:10:49.141
NOW I ACTIVATE THIS!

00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:50.678
CARD OF SANCTITY!

00:10:50.678 --> 00:10:52.147
SO, WE BOTH HAVE TO DRAW

00:10:52.147 --> 00:10:58.194
UNTIL WE'RE EACH HOLDING
6 CARDS IN OUR HAND!

00:10:58.194 --> 00:10:59.730
THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.669
NEXT I ACTIVATE MY
MAGICIAN'S SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:11:02.669 --> 00:11:04.239
WITH EVERY CARD YOU DRAW,

00:11:04.239 --> 00:11:06.010
MY SILENT MAGICIAN'S
ATTACK STRENGTH

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.214
INCREASES BY 500 POINTS!

00:11:08.214 --> 00:11:09.283
[GASPS]

00:11:09.283 --> 00:11:11.387
AND I JUST PICKED UP
5 NEW CARDS!

00:11:11.387 --> 00:11:12.422
EXACTLY!

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.892
SO, MY SILENT MAGICIAN

00:11:13.892 --> 00:11:16.965
NOW HAS 3,500
ATTACK POINTS!

00:11:16.965 --> 00:11:18.569
NOW, BACK TO THE DUEL.

00:11:18.569 --> 00:11:19.904
I BELIEVE YOUR
DARK MAGICIAN

00:11:19.904 --> 00:11:22.810
WAS ABOUT TO ATTACK?

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.149
Seto: HE'S ONLY GOT
700 LIFE POINTS,

00:11:25.149 --> 00:11:27.153
SO AS SOON AS HIS
MAGICIAN ATTACKS,

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:28.823
THE PHARAOH LOSES!

00:11:28.823 --> 00:11:34.267
[SCREAMING]

00:11:34.267 --> 00:11:38.175
NOW I ACTIVATE
MY MAGIC CARD!

00:11:38.175 --> 00:11:40.112
MAGICIANS UNITE!

00:11:40.112 --> 00:11:42.517
THIS ALLOWS ME TO JOIN
MY TWO MAGICIANS TOGETHER

00:11:42.517 --> 00:11:45.857
AS ONE SPELLCASTER
WITH 3,000 POINTS!

00:11:49.798 --> 00:11:51.035
[BOTH SCREAMING]

00:11:51.035 --> 00:11:56.145
Yugi: THAT'S
STILL NOT ENOUGH!

00:11:56.145 --> 00:11:58.784
[GRUNTING]

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:00.388
[SCREAMING]

00:12:07.235 --> 00:12:09.139
VERY IMPRESSIVE, YUGI.

00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:10.341
ALTHOUGH I WAS
ABLE TO SAVE

00:12:10.341 --> 00:12:12.178
MY LIFE POINTS
FROM DESTRUCTION,

00:12:12.178 --> 00:12:15.451
YOUR MAGICIAN SUCCEEDED
IN DEFEATING BOTH OF MINE.

00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:18.792
NOW, WE EACH HAVE 200
LIFE POINTS LEFT.

00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:20.361
SO THE END IS NEAR.

00:12:20.361 --> 00:12:23.334
THIS WILL BE MY FINAL TURN.

00:12:23.334 --> 00:12:25.372
YOU HAVE FOUGHT BRAVELY.

00:12:25.372 --> 00:12:26.574
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,

00:12:26.574 --> 00:12:29.613
THIS DUEL WILL CONCLUDE
WITH MY VICTORY.

00:12:29.613 --> 00:12:31.317
THANK YOU, YUGI.

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:33.588
I KNOW YOU TRIED
EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER

00:12:33.588 --> 00:12:35.459
TO SET ME FREE.

00:12:35.459 --> 00:12:37.797
I ACTIVATE THIS.

00:12:37.797 --> 00:12:40.670
THE MAGIC CARD
MONSTER REBORN!

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.306
AND, NOW...

00:12:42.306 --> 00:12:46.315
I SHALL RESURRECT
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:52.827
[ROARS]

00:12:52.827 --> 00:12:54.464
OH, MAN!

00:12:54.464 --> 00:12:56.702
HE JUST BROUGHT BACK
AN EGYPTIAN GOD!

00:12:56.702 --> 00:12:59.074
SLIFER'S ATTACK
POINTS ARE DETERMINED

00:12:59.074 --> 00:13:01.411
BY THE NUMBER OF
CARDS IN MY HAND.

00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:03.082
AND SINCE I'M HOLDING 4,

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:05.153
HE NOW HAS 4,000 POINTS!

00:13:05.153 --> 00:13:08.426
[ROARS]

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:10.764
[THINKING]
MY SPIRIT SHALL
REMAIN IN THIS WORLD.

00:13:10.764 --> 00:13:14.105
I GUESS YUGI AND I WEREN'T
DESTINED TO SEPARATE.

00:13:14.105 --> 00:13:16.609
[THINKING]
IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULD HAVE SUMMONED

00:13:16.609 --> 00:13:18.647
AN EGYPTIAN GOD
ALSO, PHARAOH.

00:13:18.647 --> 00:13:20.284
AND THAT'S WHY
I WAS PREPARED

00:13:20.284 --> 00:13:23.858
FOR THIS VERY MOMENT!

00:13:23.858 --> 00:13:24.860
HUH?!

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.266
WHAT'S THIS?!

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.505
THE CARD I HID
INSIDE THAT BOX

00:13:30.505 --> 00:13:32.742
IS THE SAME CARD
YOU JUST PLAYED!

00:13:37.619 --> 00:13:40.124
Joey: WAIT, BUT
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:13:40.124 --> 00:13:45.435
THERE'S ONLY ONE SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON CARD!

00:13:45.435 --> 00:13:49.309
THE CARD I BURIED
WAS MONSTER REBORN!

00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:50.713
[GASPS]

00:13:50.713 --> 00:13:52.917
AND SINCE THE MAGIC
CARD YOU JUST PLAYED

00:13:52.917 --> 00:13:53.986
IS THE SAME ONE

00:13:53.986 --> 00:13:55.856
THAT I PLACED IN
MY GOLD SARCOPHAGUS,

00:13:55.856 --> 00:13:58.128
THE EFFECT OF YOUR
CARD IS NEGATED!

00:13:58.128 --> 00:13:59.899
WHICH MEANS YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:01.869
GOES BACK TO
THE GRAVEYARD!

00:14:01.869 --> 00:14:06.344
SO, THIS DUEL
IS STILL ON!

00:14:06.344 --> 00:14:07.948
Mokuba: NO WAY!

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:10.754
HE JUST DEFEATED SLIFER
FOR THE SECOND TIME!

00:14:10.754 --> 00:14:12.958
OF ALL THE CARDS
TO PUT IN THAT BOX,

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.762
HOW DID YUGI KNOW
WHICH ONE TO PICK?!

00:14:14.762 --> 00:14:16.198
WHAT'D YOU EXPECT--

00:14:16.198 --> 00:14:17.901
HE'S THE KING
OF GAMES, DUDE!

00:14:17.901 --> 00:14:20.707
Tea: HE MUST'VE HAD THIS
PLANNED FROM THE BEGINNING.

00:14:20.707 --> 00:14:23.513
I GUESS AFTER
SPENDING SO MUCH TIME
WITH THE PHARAOH,

00:14:23.513 --> 00:14:26.185
YUGI KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT HE WOULD PLAY.

00:14:26.185 --> 00:14:29.325
[THINKING]
THIS WAS THE GREATEST
DUEL OF MY LIFE.

00:14:29.325 --> 00:14:32.832
IT'S BEEN AN HONOR, YUGI.

00:14:32.832 --> 00:14:34.234
GO ON.

00:14:34.234 --> 00:14:36.640
YOU'RE MOVE.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.109
Duke: I DON'T GET IT.

00:14:38.109 --> 00:14:39.779
WHAT'S YUGI
WAITING FOR?

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:43.153
ALL HE HAS TO DO IS ATTACK
AND THE DUEL IS OVER.

00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:44.289
THAT'S JUST IT.

00:14:44.289 --> 00:14:45.658
ONCE THE MATCH
COMES TO AN END,

00:14:45.658 --> 00:14:47.362
THE PHARAOH WILL
BE RELEASED.

00:14:47.362 --> 00:14:49.065
AND WE'LL NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

00:14:49.065 --> 00:14:51.336
[SOBBING SOFTLY]

00:14:51.336 --> 00:14:53.641
[THINKING]
IT'S ALL RIGHT, YUGI.

00:14:53.641 --> 00:14:55.311
PROCEED.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.549
ALL RIGHT,
SILENT MAGICIAN!

00:14:57.549 --> 00:15:00.255
ATTACK HIS LIFE
POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:15:03.061 --> 00:15:04.563
[GRUNTS]

00:15:13.469 --> 00:15:15.406
Duke: WAIT!

00:15:15.406 --> 00:15:16.876
SO, DID YUGI
WIN THE DUEL!?

00:15:16.876 --> 00:15:20.116
Tea: IF THIS ATTACK IS
SUCCESSFUL, THEN, YES.

00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:26.930
[GRUNTING]

00:15:35.414 --> 00:15:41.393
[SOBBING]

00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:47.171
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:15:47.171 --> 00:15:50.578
WELL DONE.

00:15:50.578 --> 00:15:51.847
YUGI...

00:15:51.847 --> 00:15:54.620
A CHAMPION DOESN'T
BELONG ON HIS KNEES.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.894
YOU ACHIEVED A GREAT
VICTORY FOR US BOTH.

00:15:57.894 --> 00:16:00.532
I WAS FOCUSING SO HARD
ON PLAYING THE GAME...

00:16:00.532 --> 00:16:02.502
THAT I FORGOT...

00:16:02.502 --> 00:16:05.141
WHAT WINNING THIS DUEL
WOULD ACTUALLY MEAN.

00:16:05.141 --> 00:16:07.413
BY DEFEATING YOU,
I'VE SENT YOU AWAY.

00:16:07.413 --> 00:16:08.749
FOR GOOD.

NO, YOU HAVE OPENED
THE DOOR FOR ME.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.122
THANKS TO YOU,

00:16:12.122 --> 00:16:15.229

BE AT REST ONCE AGAIN.

I'LL BE BACK
WHERE I BELONG.

FATE BROUGHT THE TWO OF
US TOGETHER FOR A REASON.

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:22.643
AND WE'VE FULFILLED
OUR DESTINY.

00:16:22.643 --> 00:16:24.782
WE'VE PROTECTED MANKIND

FROM THE RETURN OF
THE SHADOW GAMES.

TREMENDOUSLY ALONG THE WAY.

00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:31.896
I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

00:16:31.896 --> 00:16:35.035
YOU DO REALIZE WE'LL NEVER
TRULY BE APART, RIGHT?

HUH?

YOU'VE GIVEN ME

AND THE COURAGE
I'VE GIVEN YOU

00:16:40.247 --> 00:16:41.950
WILL REMAIN WITH US.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.956

BIND US TOGETHER.

I KNOW WALKING
THROUGH THAT DOOR

00:17:55.734 --> 00:17:58.272
MEANS YOUR SPIRIT
WILL FINALLY BE FREE...

AND IT'S ALL
FOR THE BEST...

WE WERE ALL JUST
GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

BE HAPPY FOR YOU...

HARD TO DO THAT

WHEN YOU'RE LOSING
YOUR BEST FRIEND

00:18:16.209 --> 00:18:17.479
AND YOU JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:18:17.479 --> 00:18:19.950
WHY IT HAS TO
BE THAT WAY!

WHAT'S GOING ON.

BE HARD TO LEAVE...
