THIS SHADOW GAME
IS THE CROSSROADS OF TIME

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.376
WHERE THE PAST
AND THE FUTURE MEET,

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:11.550
AND BEFORE IT'S THROUGH,
I'LL HAVE DESTROYED BOTH.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.322
BEHOLD THE ALMIGHTY ZORC.

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:19.599
NOW TO WIPE YOUR KINGDOM
OFF THE MAP.

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.307
YOUR PHARAOH FRIEND MUST BE
KNEE-DEEP IN DARKNESS BY NOW,

00:00:23.307 --> 00:00:26.513
AND THE ONLY THING THAT CAN
SAVE HIM IS LOCKED DOWN HERE.

TAKE THIS.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.459
YOU FOUND MY PUZZLE.

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:35.799
Zorc: PHARAOH,
OPPOSING ME IS FUTILE.

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:38.872
I AM THE EMBODIMENT

CAN ILLUMINATE

BE TRAPPED FOR ETERNITY.

I WOULDN'T GET
MY HOPES UP, BAKURA.

AND WHY NOT?

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:17.140
THANKS TO
THE SPECIAL EFFECT
OF MY CURSED TWIN DOLLS,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.013
EVERY CARD THAT WAS SENT
TO MY FORMER GRAVEYARD

00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:22.685
WAS JUST RELEASED
ONTO THE FIELD,

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:24.689
BUT YOU,
ON THE OTHER HAND...

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.030
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
YOU'VE SEEN BETTER DUELS.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.869
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T
BRING OUT THE PHARAOH
TO SAVE YOU.

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.775
MAYBE NOT,
BUT I CAN SAVE HIM,

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:37.315
JUST AS SOON AS I
BEAT BAKURA AND GET
OUTTA THIS PLACE.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:40.255
NOW THAT MY TWINS
ARE FINISHED,

00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:41.958
WHY DON'T YOU GO?

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.230
HA! I WAS HOPING
YOU'D SAY THAT.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.567
NOT SO FAST.

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:48.772
I'M AFRAID YOU JUST
TRIGGERED THE SPECIAL EFFECT

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:50.977
OF MY NECRO SOLDIER.

00:02:50.977 --> 00:02:53.181
AS LONG AS HE REMAINS
ON THE FIELD,

00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:54.985
EVERY TIME
YOUR TURN BEGINS,

00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:59.961
MY NECRO ARMY
INCREASES BY ONE...

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:03.269
AND SINCE THIS ABILITY
APPLIES TO MY NEW SOLDIER,
AS WELL,

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.910
I NOW HAVE
AN ARMY OF 3.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.446
AS YOU WERE.

00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:11.786
Tea: HOW'S YUGI SUPPOSED TO BEAT
AN ARMY OF LITTLE ZOMBIE FREAKS?

00:03:11.786 --> 00:03:15.193
ACTUALLY, SINCE
EACH OF HIS SOLDIERS
HAS ZERO POINTS,

00:03:15.193 --> 00:03:17.898
IT SHOULDN'T
BE TOO TOUGH.

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.368
HERE GOES.

00:03:19.368 --> 00:03:20.737
FIRST,
MY SILENT SWORDSMAN

00:03:20.737 --> 00:03:23.643
JUMPS TO LEVEL 5
WITH 3,500 POINTS,

00:03:23.643 --> 00:03:25.447
BUT THAT'S
JUST THE BEGINNING.

00:03:25.447 --> 00:03:27.384
TO ACCOMPANY
MY SILENT SWORDSMAN,

00:03:27.384 --> 00:03:32.696
I'LL SUMMON MY
SILENT MAGICIAN.

00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:36.704
NOW, MARSHMALLON,
SILENT SWORDSMAN,
AND SILENT MAGICIAN,

00:03:36.704 --> 00:03:39.676
ATTACK ALL 3 OF HIS
NECRO SOLDIERS.

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:41.113
A'RIGHT.

00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:44.253
ONCE BAKURA'S TROOP
OF NECRO-TWERPS
IS GONE, YUGI WINS.

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:52.637
YAAH!

00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:55.175
Yami-Bakura:
HA HA HA!

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:56.311
Yugi: NO WAY.

00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:57.914
BUT WHY DID
MY SWORDSMAN STOP?

00:03:57.914 --> 00:03:59.717
IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

00:03:59.717 --> 00:04:01.187
[CHUCKLES]

00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:03.358
OF COURSE IT DOES.

00:04:03.358 --> 00:04:05.697
I PLAYED MY
NARROW CORRIDOR TRAP.

00:04:05.697 --> 00:04:06.766
HUH?

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:08.503
YEAH, AND WHAT
DOES DAT DO?

00:04:08.503 --> 00:04:10.807
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED,
WHEELER.

00:04:10.807 --> 00:04:12.711
THIS HANDY TRAP CARD
PREVENTS YOUR FRIEND

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:16.118
FROM ATTACKING
WITH MORE THAN TWO MONSTERS
IN ANY GIVEN TURN,

00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:19.358
AND MIGHT I REMIND YOU,
MY GRAVEYARD IS GONE.

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:21.462
SO THE SOLDIERS
YOU JUST DESTROYED

00:04:21.462 --> 00:04:25.003
SHALL RETURN
TO THE FIELD AS SPIRITS.

00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:28.242
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
IF MY PHANTOM MONSTERS

00:04:28.242 --> 00:04:31.650
STICK AROUND
TO WATCH ME WIN.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.691
WHAT I WANNA KNOW IS,
WHAT'S HE PLANNING TO DO
WITH ALL THOSE MONSTERS?

00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:38.263
I'LL TAKE OVER
FROM HERE.

00:04:38.263 --> 00:04:41.203
OH, DID I MENTION
MY MAGICIAN'S
SPECIAL ABILITY?

00:04:41.203 --> 00:04:43.240
WHEN YOU DRAW, HE
JUMPS UP ONE LEVEL

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.681
AND GAINS
500 POINTS.

00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:49.152
SHOULD I
BE IMPRESSED?

00:04:49.152 --> 00:04:54.563
AH, JUST THE CARD
I WAS HOPING TO SEE.

00:04:54.563 --> 00:04:58.071
THE TIME HAS COME
TO REVEAL MY TRUE STRATEGY.

00:04:58.071 --> 00:05:00.342
TRUE STRATEGY?

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:03.081
YES. IS THERE
AN ECHO IN HERE?

00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:06.822
BEHOLD MY COUNTERBALANCE
MAGIC CARD.

00:05:06.822 --> 00:05:08.592
WHAT DOES THAT DO?

00:05:08.592 --> 00:05:11.632
AS LONG AS THIS CARD
REMAINS ON THE FIELD,

00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:14.404
EACH OF US MUST TRANSFER
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CARDS

00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:16.442
FROM OUR DECK
TO OUR GRAVEYARD

00:05:16.442 --> 00:05:18.412
AT THE END OF OUR TURN.

00:05:18.412 --> 00:05:20.584
HOW MANY, YOU ASK?

00:05:20.584 --> 00:05:22.755
YOU MUST DISCARD
AS MANY CARDS

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:25.427
AS THERE ARE MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD.

00:05:25.427 --> 00:05:29.402
OF COURSE, THAT INCLUDES
MY PHANTOM MONSTERS.

00:05:29.402 --> 00:05:31.706
OH, NO WAY.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.176
THEN WE'D BE
THROWING OUT

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:35.682
PRACTICALLY
OUR ENTIRE DECK.

00:05:35.682 --> 00:05:38.654
BUT WHY WOULD
YOU PLAY A CARD THAT
PUTS YOU AT RISK, ALSO?

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:40.257
IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:42.629
HA HA HA!

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:45.135
TO WORK, IT REQUIRES
A GRAVEYARD,

00:05:45.135 --> 00:05:47.072
AND I DON'T HAVE ONE.

00:05:47.072 --> 00:05:49.710
GUESS THAT MEANS
I CAN'T PARTICIPATE.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.050
I FEEL SO LEFT OUT.
SO YOU'RE IN THIS ALONE.

DRAINS YOUR DECK.

YOUR PLAN ALL ALONG.

00:06:00.566 --> 00:06:04.440

TO GET RID OF MY CARDS.

TURNS LEFT.

EVERY ONE OF THEM

00:06:37.174 --> 00:06:42.252

IN YOUR NEXT MOVE.

00:06:47.997 --> 00:06:52.673
SO I SEE NO NEED TO DRAG
THE SUSPENSE OUT ANY LONGER.

00:06:52.673 --> 00:06:54.844

ARE NO MATCH FOR ZORC.

SINCE HE AND I
ARE ONE AND THE SAME.

00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:06.803
FINALLY,
WINGED DRAGON OF RA,

00:10:06.803 --> 00:10:10.010
MAY YOUR ETERNAL LIGHT
BANISH THE DARKNESS.

00:10:19.497 --> 00:10:23.505
[ROARING]

00:10:23.505 --> 00:10:24.673
NOW, MY FRIENDS,

00:10:24.673 --> 00:10:27.179
COMBINE YOUR STRENGTH
AND END THIS.

00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:30.553
FIST OF FURY,
THUNDERFORCE ATTACK

00:10:30.553 --> 00:10:33.191
AND BLAZE
CANNON BLAST.

00:10:45.283 --> 00:10:47.020
FINISH HIM OFF.

00:10:53.467 --> 00:10:56.573
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.978
INCREDIBLE.

00:10:58.978 --> 00:11:01.416
EGYPT IS SAVED.

00:11:01.416 --> 00:11:03.955
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.025
LONG LIVE
THE PHAROAH!

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.641
IT'S OVER.
WE'RE SAVED.

00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:15.445
LET'S HOPE SO.

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:30.740
Man: LOOK.
THE DARKNESS HAS LIFTED.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.911
FINALLY.
ZORC IS GONE.

00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:34.548
ALL HAIL
THE EGYPTIAN GODS.

00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:36.050
WE'RE FREE!

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.787
YOU DID IT,
PHARAOH.

00:11:37.787 --> 00:11:38.789
WE DID.

00:11:38.789 --> 00:11:40.259
[RUMBLING]

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:43.834
ZORC.

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:44.902
HE'S BACK!

00:11:44.902 --> 00:11:50.881
CAN IT BE?

00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:52.351
OH, NO.
DON'T DO IT!

00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:55.124
THE SUN.

00:11:55.124 --> 00:11:56.926
WHAT'S HE DOING?

00:11:56.926 --> 00:12:00.300
HE'S COVERING EGYPT
IN COMPLETE DARKNESS.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.749
SOMEHOW THAT THING
JUST CAUSED A SOLAR ECLIPSE.

00:12:07.749 --> 00:12:11.190
EGYPTIAN GODS,
ATTACK BEFORE THE LIGHT IS GONE.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.993
PLEASE, HURRY!

00:12:22.613 --> 00:12:28.559
AS THE DARKNESS SPREADS,
MY STRENGTH GROWS.

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:31.531
THE LIGHT.
IT'S ALMOST GONE.

00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:34.972
OHH!

00:12:34.972 --> 00:12:37.845
RA AND SLIFER, ATTACK.

00:12:45.961 --> 00:12:47.865
WITHOUT THE SUN'S RAYS,

00:12:47.865 --> 00:12:50.403
YOU ARE POWERLESS
AGAINST ME.

00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:54.645
NOW PREPARE TO BE CONSUMED
BY THE DARKNESS.

00:13:02.829 --> 00:13:04.933
OH!
OH, NO!

00:13:04.933 --> 00:13:07.004
THIS CANNOT BE!

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:16.423
THE EGYPTIAN GODS.
HE BEAT THEM, BUT HOW?

00:13:16.423 --> 00:13:18.962
THIS CAN'T BE.
THAT WAS OUR LAST HOPE.

00:13:18.962 --> 00:13:21.166
WE LOST.
THAT'S NUTS.

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:27.079
NO ONE DEFEATS
THOSE MONSTERS.

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:28.848
THERE IS NOTHING
LEFT TO DO.

00:13:28.848 --> 00:13:30.419
NOW ALL HOPE
IS LOST.

00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:32.958
HA HA HA!

00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.699
YOUR EGYPTIAN GODS ARE SHADOWS
OF THEIR FORMER SELVES.

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:40.506
LET THEM CRUMBLE
ALONG WITH YOUR HOPE.

00:13:40.506 --> 00:13:43.679
RAAH!

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:45.817
UH! UHH...

00:13:45.817 --> 00:13:48.522
PHARAOH, NO.

00:13:48.522 --> 00:13:51.328
REMEMBER,
YOU LOSE A CARD

00:13:51.328 --> 00:13:53.366
FOR EVERY MONSTER
ON THE FIELD,

00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:55.103
AND SO FAR,
THERE ARE 10.

00:13:55.103 --> 00:13:57.240
OH, YEAH?
NOT FOR LONG.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.777
FIRST,
MY SILENT SWORDSMAN

00:13:58.777 --> 00:14:02.351
INCREASES ONE LEVEL
AND 500 POINTS.

00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:03.754
HOLD ON.

00:14:03.754 --> 00:14:06.393
YOUR MONSTERS
AREN'T THE ONLY ONES
WHO CAN DO TRICKS.

00:14:06.393 --> 00:14:11.937
NECRO MANNEQUIN, SHOW YUGI
YOUR NEWEST TALENT.

00:14:11.937 --> 00:14:15.545
NOW THERE'S A TOTAL
OF 11 MONSTERS ON THE FIELD.

00:14:15.545 --> 00:14:18.584
HOW'S YUGI
SUPPOSED TO GET RID
OF ALL THOSE MONSTERS?

00:14:18.584 --> 00:14:20.688
I MEAN, DIDN'T BAKURA
PLAY SOME CARD

00:14:20.688 --> 00:14:23.161
THAT LIMITS YUGI'S
ATTACKS OR SOMETHING?

00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:26.233
RIGHT YOU ARE.
NARROW CORRIDOR,
TO BE EXACT,

00:14:26.233 --> 00:14:29.239
AND IT LIMITS YUGI
TO TWO ATTACKS PER TURN.

00:14:29.239 --> 00:14:31.377
PLUS, THANKS
TO MY NECRO TWINS,

00:14:31.377 --> 00:14:33.081
WHATEVER MONSTERS
HE DESTROYS

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.419
WILL RETURN TO THE FIELD
AS PHANTOMS.

00:14:35.419 --> 00:14:37.290
WE'LL SEE.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.994
FIRST, MY SWORDSMAN
WILL ATTACK
YOUR NECRO SOLDIER

00:14:39.994 --> 00:14:42.100
WITH SILENT
SWORD SLASH.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.237
AND THEN I'M SENDING
MY SILENT MAGICIAN

00:14:44.237 --> 00:14:46.208
TO DESTROY YOUR
NECRO MANNEQUIN.

00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:51.419
NOW GO.

00:14:51.419 --> 00:14:54.291
NOT BAD,
BUT YOUR TURN IS OVER,

00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:56.629
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:59.335
11 CARDS GO
TO YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:14:59.335 --> 00:15:01.772
NOW IF MY MATH IS CORRECT,

00:15:01.772 --> 00:15:04.311
THAT LEAVES 17 CARDS
IN YOUR DECK,

00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:07.785
AND ONCE THEY'RE
ALL GONE, GAME OVER.

00:15:07.785 --> 00:15:10.391
HOWEVER, MY TWINS
WILL MAKE SURE YOUR TURN

00:15:10.391 --> 00:15:12.127
DOESN'T END
ON A SOUR NOTE

00:15:12.127 --> 00:15:14.866
BY GIVING YOU
2,200 EXTRA LIFE POINTS.

00:15:14.866 --> 00:15:16.703
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

00:15:16.703 --> 00:15:18.841
AND WHY ARE YOU
SO CHIPPER?

00:15:18.841 --> 00:15:21.446
WELL, FOR ONE,
MY MAGICIAN
JUST GOT STRONGER.

00:15:21.446 --> 00:15:26.558
IT'S GOING TO TAKE MUCH MORE
THAN THAT TO SAVE YOU NOW.

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:28.929
I JUST SUMMONED
MY NECRO WALL.

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:30.966
THIS LETS ME INCREASE
MY MONSTER ARMY

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:32.636
BY ADDING
NECRO WALL TOKENS

00:15:32.636 --> 00:15:35.409
EQUAL TO THE NUMBER
OF ZOMBIES ON THE FIELD,

00:15:35.409 --> 00:15:38.048
WHICH GIVES ME TWO
EXTRA MONSTERS.

00:15:38.048 --> 00:15:39.851
HE CAN'T.
HE DID.

00:15:39.851 --> 00:15:42.189
NOW SAY HELLO TO
THE TWO NEWEST ADDITIONS

00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:44.828
TO MY EVER-GROWING
COLLECTION OF MONSTERS--

00:15:44.828 --> 00:15:46.665
NECRO WALL
TOKEN NUMBER ONE

00:15:46.665 --> 00:15:49.003
AND NECRO WALL TOKEN
NUMBER TWO.

00:15:49.003 --> 00:15:51.442
THAT GIVES ME
A GRAND TOTAL OF 14.

00:15:51.442 --> 00:15:53.646
NOW MAKE
YOUR FINAL MOVE.

00:15:53.646 --> 00:15:55.918
THIS DUEL IS NOT
OVER YET, BAKURA.

00:15:55.918 --> 00:15:58.623
FIRST, MY SWORDSMAN
GETS A BOOST.

00:15:58.623 --> 00:16:01.161
NOW GET READY FOR
ANOTHER DOUBLE ATTACK.

00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:03.667
SILENT SWORDSMAN,
ATTACK HIS WALL
TOKEN NUMBER ONE

00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:06.640
AND, SILENT MAGICIAN,
ATTACK TOKEN NUMBER TWO.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.055
VERY IMPRESSIVE, YUGI.

00:16:14.055 --> 00:16:16.994
UNFORTUNATELY,
SINCE YOU'VE USED UP
YOUR TWO-ATTACK LIMIT,

00:16:16.994 --> 00:16:18.898
YOU'RE TURN IS OVER.

00:16:18.898 --> 00:16:20.568
THAT MAY BE TRUE,

00:16:20.568 --> 00:16:24.343
BUT I CAN STILL
ACTIVATE MY ARIA
FROM BEYOND MAGIC CARD.

00:16:24.343 --> 00:16:26.414
IT ALLOWS ME TO CHOOSE
ANY MAGIC CARD

00:16:26.414 --> 00:16:30.121
THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN
REMOVED FROM THE GAME
AND RE-ACTIVATE IT,

00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:32.192
AND I CHOOSE
ONE OF YOURS--

00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:36.000
SPIRIT SWORD
OF SEALING--

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.402
AND I'M USING IT

00:16:37.402 --> 00:16:39.507
TO IMPRISON ONE
OF MY OWN MONSTERS--

00:16:39.507 --> 00:16:41.745
MY SILENT SWORDSMAN.

00:16:46.788 --> 00:16:49.294
IS IT ME, OR DID HE JUST
HARPOON HIS BEST CARD?

00:16:49.294 --> 00:16:50.596
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

00:16:50.596 --> 00:16:52.500
BAKURA HAS A FIELD
FULL OF MONSTERS,

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.471
AND YUGI
TARGETS HIS OWN?

00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.208
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:16:56.208 --> 00:16:57.678
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

00:16:57.678 --> 00:17:00.751
NOW THEN, DISCARD
11 CARDS.

00:17:05.253 --> 00:17:07.258
Yami-Bakura: YOU MAY GAIN
A FEW LIFE POINTS,

00:17:07.258 --> 00:17:09.863
BUT YOU LOSE
MOST OF YOUR DECK.

00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:14.606
JUST ONE MORE TURN,

00:17:14.606 --> 00:17:17.045
AND ALL OF YOUR CARDS
WILL BE GONE...

00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:18.280
HA HA HA!

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.425
AND VICTORY
WILL BE MINE.

00:17:23.425 --> 00:17:27.800
YOU KNOW, I PROBABLY
COULD END MY TURN RIGHT NOW,

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.706
FORCING YOU
TO DISCARD THE REST
OF YOUR DECK IMMEDIATELY,

00:17:30.706 --> 00:17:34.347
BUT I THINK
WATCHING YOU SQUIRM
WOULD BE MUCH MORE FUN.

00:17:34.347 --> 00:17:38.021
SO INSTEAD, I'LL SUMMON
MY NECRO JAR IN ATTACK MODE.

00:17:38.021 --> 00:17:41.962
NOW ATTACK
HIS SILENT MAGICIAN.

00:17:41.962 --> 00:17:43.266
BUT WHY?

00:17:43.266 --> 00:17:44.768
YEAH. DOESN'T
YUGI'S MONSTER

00:17:44.768 --> 00:17:50.680
HAVE MORE ATTACK POINTS
THAN BAKURA'S?

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.921
YOU JUST GAVE UP ALMOST
ALL OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:17:53.921 --> 00:17:55.658
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.595
GOOD QUESTION.

00:17:57.595 --> 00:18:00.568
IT WAS ALL A PART
OF MY MASTER PLAN.

00:18:00.568 --> 00:18:02.839
YOU SEE, THANKS
TO MY NECRO JAR,

00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:06.981
YOU MUST DISCARD
ONE CARD FOR EVERY
300 POINTS I JUST LOST,

00:18:06.981 --> 00:18:10.054
AND SINCE MY DAMAGE
WAS 1,400,

00:18:10.054 --> 00:18:14.028
YOU LOSE 4 CARDS
FROM YOUR DECK.

00:18:14.028 --> 00:18:16.501
SO OFF TO THE GRAVEYARD
THEY GO.

00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:17.936
WAIT A SECOND.

00:18:17.936 --> 00:18:23.848
DAT'S GONNA LEAVE YUGI
WITH ONLY ONE CARD LEFT.

00:18:23.848 --> 00:18:26.788
AND SO THE END IS HERE--

00:18:26.788 --> 00:18:28.658
NOT ONLY THE END
OF OUR DUEL,

00:18:28.658 --> 00:18:31.063
BUT THE END OF THE WORLD
AS WE KNOW IT.

00:18:31.063 --> 00:18:32.967
WHY, WITH YOU TRAPPED
IN THE SHADOW REALM,

00:18:32.967 --> 00:18:35.138
THE PHARAOH WILL
NEVER DEFEAT ZORC.

00:18:35.138 --> 00:18:38.111
NOW LET'S REVIEW,
SHALL WE?

00:18:38.111 --> 00:18:41.218
12 MONSTERS REMAIN
ON THE FIELD,

00:18:41.218 --> 00:18:43.756
AND YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CARD
LEFT IN YOUR DECK,

00:18:43.756 --> 00:18:45.693
AND AS WE ALL KNOW,

00:18:45.693 --> 00:18:48.365
WHEN YOU RUN
OUT OF CARDS, YOU LOSE.

00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:49.635
OHH.
RRGH.

00:18:49.635 --> 00:18:51.238
I KNEW IT
ALL ALONG.

00:18:51.238 --> 00:18:53.877
WITHOUT THE PHARAOH,
YOU'RE NOTHING.

00:18:53.877 --> 00:18:55.914
HE'S THE KING OF GAMES.

00:18:55.914 --> 00:18:57.751
YOU'RE JUST
A FRIGHTENED CHILD.

00:18:57.751 --> 00:18:59.488
HA HA HA!

00:18:59.488 --> 00:19:02.595
YUGI, DON'T LISTEN
TO A WORD THIS CREEP SAYS.

00:19:02.595 --> 00:19:03.865
YOU CAN DO THIS.

00:19:03.865 --> 00:19:05.300
TEA IS RIGHT, PAL.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.273
HE'S JUST TRYIN'
TA PSYCHE YOU OUT.
THAT'S ALL.

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:11.647
I'M THE ONLY ONE
BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

00:19:11.647 --> 00:19:14.720
THINK ABOUT
EVERY IMPORTANT DUEL
YOU'VE EVER FOUGHT.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.490
WHO WAS DOING
ALL THE WORK?

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.162
THE PHARAOH,
THAT'S WHO.

00:19:19.162 --> 00:19:23.204
MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:27.680
OHH!

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.020
UHH...UGH...

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.227
YUGI, I CAN'T
DO THIS WITHOUT YOU.

00:19:34.227 --> 00:19:36.464
PLEASE, HELP ME.

00:19:36.464 --> 00:19:40.339
THE FUTURE OF MANKIND
DEPENDS ON IT.

00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:43.578
THE PHARAOH
NEEDS ME...

00:19:43.578 --> 00:19:45.917
AND THIS DUEL
IS STILL ON.

00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:48.823
I HAVE ONE CARD LEFT,
AND THAT'S ALL I NEED.

00:19:48.823 --> 00:19:50.260
DAT'S
THE SPIRIT.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.529
NOW WIN.

[CHUCKLES]

00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:56.940
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
TO DO WITH ONE CARD?

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.180
I SACRIFICE MY MARSHMALLON
AND MY SILENT MAGICIAN

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.084
SO I CAN SUMMON THIS--

00:20:02.084 --> 00:20:04.689
GANDORA THE DRAGON
OF DESTRUCTION.

00:20:04.689 --> 00:20:06.660
NOT THAT.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.332
UHH...UGH!

00:20:09.332 --> 00:20:11.136
[ROARS]

00:20:11.136 --> 00:20:13.240
BAKURA, THE GAME
IS NOT OVER

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.977
'TIL THE LAST CARD
IS PLAYED,

00:20:14.977 --> 00:20:18.384
AND MY LAST CARD
IS THE ONE WITH
THE POWER TO STOP YOU.

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:19.653
BUT HOW?

00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:21.323
I HAVE A FIELD
FULL OF MONSTERS,

00:20:21.323 --> 00:20:27.269
AND YOU ONLY HAVE ONE.

00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:31.878
GANDORA, ACTIVATE
YOUR SPECIAL ABILITY--

00:20:31.878 --> 00:20:36.087
BOUNDLESS GIGARAYS.

00:20:36.087 --> 00:20:39.060
AAH! AAH!

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.090
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
