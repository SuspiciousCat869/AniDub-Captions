00:18:38.854 --> 00:18:40.723
IS THE OTHER ONE'S WEAKNESS!

00:18:40.723 --> 00:18:43.360
I SEE. SO WE MAKE
THESE TWO FIGHT!

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.696
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN!

00:18:44.696 --> 00:18:45.863
THEN LET'S DO THIS!

00:18:45.863 --> 00:18:46.864
READY?

00:18:46.864 --> 00:18:47.866
READY!
READY!

00:18:47.866 --> 00:18:48.867
ATTACK!

00:18:48.867 --> 00:18:55.209
GO!

00:18:55.209 --> 00:18:56.544
PULL BACK!

00:19:07.225 --> 00:19:08.626
IT WORKED!

00:19:15.102 --> 00:19:16.103
TEA!

00:19:16.103 --> 00:19:17.271
HEY, GRANDPA!

00:19:17.271 --> 00:19:18.606
HEY, GUYS.

00:19:18.606 --> 00:19:19.708
Yugi: YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

00:19:19.708 --> 00:19:22.511
THANKS TO YOU BOYS.

00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:24.781
ALL FOR ONE
AND ONE FOR ALL!

00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:26.250
WELL PUT.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.934
Joey: NOT ANOTHER
EGYPTIAN TABLET!

00:19:39.934 --> 00:19:41.569
HEY, GRAMPS.

00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:43.606
AREN'T YOU THE ONE
WHO ALWAYS KNOWS HOW
TO READ THIS JUNK?

00:19:43.606 --> 00:19:45.675
LET'S SEE.

00:19:45.675 --> 00:19:47.778
BEFORE THE SHADOWS
BLANKET THE LAND,

00:19:47.778 --> 00:19:49.680
GO TO THE FORTRESS OF FEAR.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.683
LOCATE THE PLACE
WHERE THE SPIRIT SLEEPS

00:19:51.683 --> 00:19:53.786
AND THE PATHWAY
YOU SEEK WILL APPEAR.

00:19:53.786 --> 00:19:55.522
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

00:19:55.522 --> 00:19:57.090
YOU'RE ASKIN' US!?

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.194
WELL, IT SAID,
"BEFORE THE SHADOWS
BLANKET THE LAND."

00:20:00.194 --> 00:20:02.230
I BET THAT
MEANS SUNSET!

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.967
NOW IF ONLY WE COULD
FIGURE OUT WHAT IT
MEANS BY THE PHRASE

00:20:04.967 --> 00:20:06.836
"THE PLACE WHERE
THE SPIRIT SLEEPS."

00:20:06.836 --> 00:20:09.006
WELL...MAYBE IT'S
SOME KIND OF A CASKET.

00:20:09.006 --> 00:20:11.876
YES, BUT WHAT ABOUT
THIS "FORTRESS OF FEAR?"

00:20:11.876 --> 00:20:15.948
WELL, LET'S THINK.

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:18.118
LOOK!

00:20:18.118 --> 00:20:19.853
Yugi: THAT HOUSE.

00:20:19.853 --> 00:20:22.924
YA THINK THAT'S
THE PLACE?

00:20:22.924 --> 00:20:27.230
IF THAT'S TRUE THEN
WE FIND THIS FORTRESS
BEFORE THE SUN SETS!

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.135
HOPEFULLY THE PATHWAY
MENTIONED ON THE TABLET
MEANS THE PASSAGE HOME!

00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:33.805
BUT DAT BUILDING
DOESN'T LOOK TOO CLOSE.

00:20:33.805 --> 00:20:35.640
JOEY'S RIGHT.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.077
AND IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE SUNSET.

00:20:38.077 --> 00:20:40.794
COME ON, WE'VE GOTTEN WAY
TOO FAR IN THIS GAME

00:20:40.794 --> 00:20:45.599
TO START DOUBTING
OURSELVES NOW.

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:48.702
NOW, LET'S FIND THAT FORTRESS
SO WE CAN GO HOME!
