Zigfried:
MY DEAR FRIEND HERR KAIBA

00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:08.070
IS THROWING ANOTHER TOURNAMENT,
IS HE?

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.041
HOW CHARMING.

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:13.213
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE
RUNNING SMOOTHLY.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:16.853
I WOULD'VE EXPECTED MY LITTLE
HACKER FRIEND TO STRIKE AGAIN
BY NOW.

00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:20.058
UNLESS HE'S ALREADY
IN KAIBA LAND!

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:23.063
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE ON TO ME
BY NOW, HEIR KAIBA.

00:00:23.063 --> 00:00:25.267
PERHAPS YOU JUST NEED
A LITTLE HINT.

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:26.870
IT'S SHOW TIME!

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.906
AH! THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:30.108
AH!

00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:32.513
MR. KAIBA!

00:00:32.513 --> 00:00:34.850
THE ENTIRE UNITY
SYSTEM IS DOWN!

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.722
WE'VE COMPLETED
OUR INVESTIGATION
OF MR. ZIGFRIED LLOYD.

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:39.658
AND YOUR ASSUMPTIONS
WERE CORRECT, SIR.

00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:43.065

Roland:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

00:01:48.878 --> 00:01:53.786
THE KC GRAND CHAMPIONSHIP
IS PROUD TO PRESENT

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:59.196
TWO DUELISTS WHO HAVE
RIDDEN THE WAVE OF VICTORY
ALL THE WAY TO THE FINALS!

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:04.071
FIRST, THE DEBONAIR
BILLIONAIRE--ZIGFRIED LLOYD!

00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:08.579
HE'LL FACE THE ROOKIE WHO'S
ONE TOUGH COOKIE--LEON WILSON!

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.021
THE WINNER OF THIS BOUT
IS BOUND TO MAKE A SPLASH

00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:19.164
WHEN HE FACES YUGI MUTO
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP CROWN!

00:02:23.304 --> 00:02:25.608
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS.

00:02:25.608 --> 00:02:28.112
HISTORY COULD BE MADE
IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS

00:02:28.112 --> 00:02:32.152
IF THIS COVETED TITLE CHANGES
HANDS HERE IN THE KAIBA DOME!!

00:02:36.193 --> 00:02:38.096
NOW WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:43.773
LET THE KC GRAND CHAMPIONSHIP
FINALS BEGIN!

00:02:43.773 --> 00:02:48.214
FOR THOSE ABOUT TO DUEL,
WE SALUTE YOU!

00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:56.194
WHAT'S HE
DOIN' HERE!?

00:02:56.194 --> 00:02:57.864
JUST DROPPING BY?

00:02:57.864 --> 00:02:59.333
YEAH, BUT WHY!?

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:04.409
SETO
WASN'T SCHEDULED
TO BE HERE!

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.914
WHAT AN UNEXPECTED TREAT!

00:03:07.914 --> 00:03:13.657
YOU'RE MINE, ZIGFRIED.

00:03:13.657 --> 00:03:15.828
STOP THE DUEL!

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:19.435
AS PRESIDENT OF KAIBACORP
I DECLARE THIS MATCH INVALID!

00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:20.703
COME ON!

00:03:20.703 --> 00:03:22.640
GIMME A BREAK!

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.311
HE CAN'T RIP US OFF
LIKE DAT!

00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:26.313
I THINK
HE JUST DID.

00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:28.283
INVALID?

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.620
I DON'T GET IT.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.726
AS THE RESULT
OF A DISQUALIFICATION,

00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:36.897
THE WINNER OF THIS DUEL
IS LEON WILSON!

00:03:36.897 --> 00:03:38.768
WHAT!? I WON?!

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:41.405
ANY PARTICULAR
REASON FOR THIS?

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:43.275
HUMOR ME.

00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:44.978
YOU BROKE YOUR
TOURNAMENT CONTRACT!

00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:48.752
BY ENTERING THE EVENT
UNDER A FALSE NAME!

00:03:48.752 --> 00:03:50.821
ZIGFRIED LLOYD.

00:03:50.821 --> 00:03:51.823
OR SHOULD I SAY
"ZIGFRIED VON SCHROEDER!"

00:03:51.823 --> 00:03:54.328
OF THE SCHROEDER
CORPORATION!

00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:55.930
IS HE SERIOUS?

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.299
SCHROEDER CORP!?

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.806
WASN'T THAT AN OLD GAMING
COMPANY OR SOMETHING?

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.007
ACTUALLY IT STILL IS...

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:05.080
YOU JUST DON'T HEAR MUCH
ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.315
ONCE KAIBACORP
BECAME NUMBER ONE,

00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:08.252
EVERYONE SORTA FORGOT
ABOUT THE SCHROEDERS.

00:04:08.252 --> 00:04:10.656
[COLLECTIVE GASP]

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:13.094
SO, YOU THINK ZIGFRIED
JOINED TO GET REVENGE?

00:04:13.094 --> 00:04:16.833
I NEVER TRUSTED YOU
FROM THE GET-GO, ZIGFRIED.

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:21.107
AND MY INSTINCTS
ARE NEVER WRONG.

00:04:21.107 --> 00:04:23.244
IT ALL MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

00:04:23.244 --> 00:04:27.251
KAIBACORP'S BIGGEST RIVAL JOINS
THE TOURNAMENT, AND SUDDENLY
EVERYTHING GOES HAYWIRE.

00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:29.154
COINCIDENCE?

00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:30.156
I THINK NOT!

00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:34.163
UH-OH.

00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:37.669
AH! AH!

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.010
BUT SINCE I'M A NICE GUY,
I WON'T HAVE YOU ARRESTED
FOR TRESPASSING AND FRAUD.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.352
UNDER ONE CONDITION:
YOU GET OUT OF MY LIFE!

00:04:47.352 --> 00:04:50.023
AND TAKE YOUR BAD HAIR
WITH YOU!

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:55.233
AND MARK MY WORDS--
IF YOUR OVERPRICED SHOES
STEP ANYWHERE NEAR ME AGAIN,

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:57.170
I'LL DESTROY WHAT'S LEFT
OF YOUR PATHETIC COMPANY!

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.744
HA HA HA!

00:05:01.744 --> 00:05:06.720
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
FINALLY BEEN EXPOSED TO
THE PUBLIC FOR WHAT YOU ARE:

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.689
A COMPLETE COWARD!

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:09.992
GRR...

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:13.765
THE TRUTH IS YOU'RE AFRAID
OF MY SUPERIOR SKILLS.

00:05:13.765 --> 00:05:16.904
SO YOU'RE HIDING
BEHIND A TECHNICALITY
INSTEAD OF FACING ME.

00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:19.208
AND NOW THE WHOLE WORLD
KNOWS IT!

00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:25.114
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR THROWING ME OUT,
HERR KAIBA.

00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:28.253
YOU KNOW THAT IF I
WON THIS TOURNAMENT

00:05:28.253 --> 00:05:30.223
AND BECAME
THE WORLD CHAMPION,

00:05:30.223 --> 00:05:32.995
YOU WOULD NEVER WIN
THAT TITLE BACK!

00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:37.034
I'M THROWING YOU OUT
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE YOU.

00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:39.438
NOT 'CAUSE I'M SCARED OF YOU.

00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:43.279
YOU KNOW, I PROMISED
MYSELF I WOULDN'T DUEL
IN THIS TOURNAMENT.

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:46.617
BUT SINCE I HAVE THE CHANCE
TO EMBARRASS YOU,

00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:49.389
THOSE PLANS HAVE CHANGED!

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.893
KAIBA'S GONNA
DUEL ZIGFRIED!

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:54.031
WELL, THERE'S NEVER
A DULL MOMENT.

00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:57.570
FINE. BUT IF I WIN,
I GET TO STAY.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.378
AND IF YOU LOSE,
YOU DISAPPEAR, NEVER
TO BE HEARD FROM AGAIN!

00:06:02.378 --> 00:06:04.248
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

00:06:04.248 --> 00:06:05.985
YEAH, WELL I DO!

00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:08.622
SETO'S GONNA BLAST 'IM
TO THE MINOR LEAGUES!

00:06:08.622 --> 00:06:10.058
HERE, HOLD THIS.

00:06:10.058 --> 00:06:11.461
YES, SIR.

00:06:11.461 --> 00:06:17.171
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE
TOO LONG.

00:06:17.171 --> 00:06:19.742
LAST CHANCE.

00:06:19.742 --> 00:06:21.111
YOU SURE YOU WANNA
GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:22.145
ABSOLUTELY.

00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:25.218
HOW COULD I EVER
PASS THIS UP?

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.323
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
I GET TO DESTROY
MY ARCH-RIVAL

00:06:28.323 --> 00:06:31.629
IN FRONT OF
THE ENTIRE WORLD!

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:34.200
BUT WHO SHOULD
GO FIRST?

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.645
I GUESS THERE'S ONLY
ONE FAIR WAY TO DECIDE.

00:06:40.645 --> 00:06:42.581
ALRIGHT, ZIGFRIED.

00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:44.485
YOUR CALL.

00:06:44.485 --> 00:06:46.087
I THINK I'LL GO
WITH HEADS.

00:06:46.087 --> 00:06:47.523
AHHHH.

00:06:47.523 --> 00:06:49.559
HURRAY FOR ME.

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:53.133
BUT I THINK
I'LL LET YOU
GO FIRST, HERR KAIBA.

00:06:53.133 --> 00:06:54.435
THANKS.

00:06:54.435 --> 00:06:56.571
I NEVER KNEW
YOU WERE SO KIND.

00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:57.573
I GUESS I'LL HAFTA
RETURN THE FAVOR.

00:06:57.573 --> 00:07:00.178
THERE'S NO NEED.

00:07:00.178 --> 00:07:02.582
I INSIST.

00:07:02.582 --> 00:07:05.521
Roland: ALRIGHT, THERE'S BEEN
A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS!

00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:11.764
NOW YOUR TOURNAMENT HOST SETO
KAIBA WILL FACE-OFF AGAINST
ZIGFRIED VON SCHROEDER!

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:33.268
SETO, TIME TA SHOW
THIS CIRCUS FREAK
WHO'S BOSS!

00:07:33.268 --> 00:07:34.471
HOW'S IT GOIN',
GUYS?

00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:35.573
HEY, LEON!

00:07:35.573 --> 00:07:37.142
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

00:07:37.142 --> 00:07:40.114
I MEAN AM I GONNA DUEL AGAINST
YOU OR AGAINST ZIGFRIED?

00:07:40.114 --> 00:07:42.050
WELL, I GUESS
IT ALL DEPENDS

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.488
ON HOW WELL KAIBA DOES
IN THIS NEXT DUEL.

00:07:44.488 --> 00:07:47.459
I HOPE HE WINS.

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:48.528
I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT IT,

00:07:48.528 --> 00:07:51.566
'CAUSE I'M SURE
NO MATTER WHO WINS,

00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:54.271
YOU'LL GET YOUR
CHANCE TO DUEL YUGI
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP!

00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:55.975
UNLESS OF COURSE
YOU WANNA GIVE ME

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.412
YOUR SPACE
IN THE TOURNAMENT.

00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:00.282
I THINK I'LL PASS.

00:08:00.282 --> 00:08:02.719
YA KNOW, AS MUCH
AS I CAN'T STAND KAIBA,

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:07.795
ANYONE'S BETTER
THAN THAT PINK-HAIRED
SIDESHOW FREAK ZIGFRIED.

00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:11.134
DITTO.

00:08:11.134 --> 00:08:15.608
Roland: THE GRAND CHAMPIONSHIP
BONUS MATCH IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

00:08:15.608 --> 00:08:22.053
AND MY MOST DEVASTATING FLOWER
IS ABOUT TO BLOSSOM, HERR KAIBA.

00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:25.459
Roland:
COMPETITORS TAKE YOUR MARKS
AND READY YOUR DECKS!

00:08:25.459 --> 00:08:29.732
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
YOU'RE AFTER ZIGFRIED,

00:08:29.732 --> 00:08:31.636
BUT I DO KNOW
IT ALL ENDS HERE.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:34.374
LET'S DUEL!

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:44.725
NOW TO KICK THINGS OFF
WITH A BANG, GO!

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:50.602
X-HEAD CANNON
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:50.602 --> 00:08:55.144
NEXT I'LL PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:08:55.144 --> 00:08:56.813
YOU SOUND SO CONFIDENT.

00:08:56.813 --> 00:09:00.252
BUT I'M AFRAID THOSE LITTLE
MECHANICAL TOYS OF YOURS

00:09:00.252 --> 00:09:03.324
ARE NOTHING BUT
INSIGNIFICANT SEEDLINGS

00:09:03.324 --> 00:09:06.530
THAT ARE
ABOUT TO BE UPROOTED BY
MY RAGING WILDFLOWERS!

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.432
ARE YOU DONE?

00:09:08.432 --> 00:09:11.672
THESE PEOPLE CAME HERE
TO SEE A DUEL, NOT
A BAD POETRY READING!

00:09:11.672 --> 00:09:13.208
SO LET'S MOVE ON!

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:15.111
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:09:15.111 --> 00:09:17.682
THE TRUE BEAUTY OF
MY MAIDENS OF MAYHEM

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:21.122
CAN BEST BE APPRECIATED
IF I SIMPLY CALL THEM
TO THE FIELD!

00:09:21.122 --> 00:09:22.290
SO WITNESS
POETRY IN MOTION

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.362
AS I PLAY RIDE OF
THE VALKYRIES!!!

00:09:25.362 --> 00:09:29.168
THIS ALLOWS ME TO
SUMMON EVERY VALKYRIE
IN MY HAND!

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:30.404
ALREADY!?

00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:32.908
GIVE A BIG KAIBA
LAND WELCOME

00:09:32.908 --> 00:09:36.381
TO VALKYRIE ZWEITE,
VALKYRIE ERSTE,
AND VALKYRIE DRITTE.

00:09:43.193 --> 00:09:46.265
THANKS TO MY VALKYRIE
ZWEITE'S SPECIAL EFFECT,

00:09:46.265 --> 00:09:48.736
YOUR CANNON GOES STRAIGHT
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:09:48.736 --> 00:09:50.539
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:54.846
NEXT MY VALKYRIE ERSTE
REMOVES YOUR CANNON
FROM THE GAME FOR GOOD

00:09:54.846 --> 00:09:58.786
AND GAINS THE EQUIVALENT
OF ITS ATTACK STRENGTH!

00:09:58.786 --> 00:10:02.760
AND FINALLY MY VALKYRIE
DRITTE'S SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.232
FOR EACH OPPOSING
MONSTER REMOVED
FROM THE GAME,

00:10:06.232 --> 00:10:08.670
HER STRENGTH INCREASES
BY ONE HUNDRED!

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.339
HE SUMMONED 3 MONSTERS
AT ONCE!

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:14.413
AND KAIBA'S LIFE POINTS
ARE DEFENSELESS!

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:16.484
SO IF ZIGFRIED ATTACKS
WITH ALL THREE VALKYRIES,

00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:18.520
THE DUEL'S DONE!!

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.190
C'MON, BRO!

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.325
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
REACHED THE FINALE

00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:25.432
BEFORE WE EVEN BEGUN.
AUF WIEDERSSEN!

00:10:25.432 --> 00:10:27.536
VALKYRIE ZWEITE!

00:10:27.536 --> 00:10:30.808
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY WITH
GALLOPING GASH!

00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:40.254
I ACTIVATE
MY FACEDOWN CARD!

00:10:40.254 --> 00:10:42.591
GO NEGATE ATTACK!

00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:44.795
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
OUT OF LUCK.

00:10:44.795 --> 00:10:46.464
AND YOU'RE VALKYRIE'S
OUT OF STEAM.

00:10:46.464 --> 00:10:48.000
[HORSE NEIGHS]

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.269
AWESOME!

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:51.840
THANKS TO KAIBA'S CARD
ZIGFRIED'S TURN IS OVER!

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.745
SO HIS THREE VALKYRIES
GO BACK TO HIS DECK!

00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:58.885
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, ZIGFRIED?

00:10:58.885 --> 00:11:01.123
CALL OFF YOUR PONIES!

00:11:01.123 --> 00:11:03.994
THEIR MOMENT IN
THE SPOTLIGHT IS OVER!

00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:07.133
HA HA HA!

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:10.973
THANKS TO THIS CARD,
THEY'VE ADDED A
SECOND PERFORMANCE!

00:11:10.973 --> 00:11:12.642
OH, NO!

00:11:12.642 --> 00:11:13.978
OH, YES!

00:11:13.978 --> 00:11:15.949
TIME FOR AN ENCORE!

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:18.720
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SIT BACK AND ENJOY
THE SHOW!

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.722
VALKYRIE ZWEITE!

00:11:19.722 --> 00:11:22.159
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:23.161
UH!

00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:25.899
HE'S CHEATING!

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:28.170
YEAH, THOSE VALKYRIES
SHOULD'VE RETURNED
TO ZIGFRIED'S DECK!

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.175
HEY, WATCH OUT!

00:11:31.175 --> 00:11:32.277
WHATTA YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING!?

00:11:32.277 --> 00:11:35.282
WINNING OF COURSE!

00:11:35.282 --> 00:11:36.618
YOU SEE, MISCHIEF
OF THE TIME GODDESS

00:11:36.618 --> 00:11:39.589
ALLOWS ME TO SKIP
YOUR TURN!

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:41.860
THEN I CAN PICK UP
WHERE I LEFT OFF!

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.197
WIPING OUT THE REMAINDER
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:11:44.197 --> 00:11:45.633
SO LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

00:11:45.633 --> 00:11:49.840
AH!

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.075
SETO! NO!

00:11:51.075 --> 00:11:52.679
NOT SO FAST!

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:55.216
I REVEAL MY
MAGICAL TRICK MIRROR.

00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:57.787
HERE'S THE DEAL.

00:11:57.787 --> 00:12:01.294
IT ACTIVATES A MAGIC CARD
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD!

00:12:01.294 --> 00:12:04.165
AND I CHOOSE MISCHIEF
OF THE TIME GODDESS.

00:12:04.165 --> 00:12:05.401
NOT THAT!

00:12:05.401 --> 00:12:08.806
LET'S SEE HOW
YOU LIKE IT!

00:12:08.806 --> 00:12:10.710
NOW YOUR TURN
IS SKIPPED!

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.215
[CROWD ROARS]

00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:15.885
HE JUST BOUGHT HIMSELF
A SECOND CHANCE.

00:12:15.885 --> 00:12:18.824
DON'T SCREW THIS UP,
RICH BOY.

00:12:18.824 --> 00:12:21.596
IF YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD
WIN THIS DUEL IN ONE TURN,

00:12:21.596 --> 00:12:23.732
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHO
YOU'RE UP AGAINST!

00:12:23.732 --> 00:12:26.370
I'VE COME A LONG WAY
SINCE WE WERE KIDS, ZIGFRIED,

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.639
SO CHECK THIS OUT!

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:31.011
I SUMMON Z-METAL TANK
TO THE FIELD!

00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:34.751
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:36.755
AND NEXT I'LL SUMMON
MY CLONE DRAGON CARD!

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.570
IT BECOMES AN EXACT DUPLICATE
OF THE MONSTER I JUST PLAYED.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.774
WHICH GIVES ME TWO TANKS!

00:12:54.552 --> 00:12:56.322
THAT ENDS MY TURN!

00:12:56.322 --> 00:12:58.927
[CROWD ROARS]

00:12:58.927 --> 00:13:00.863
WHAT A DUEL!

00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:04.069
THE ACTION HASN'T STOPPED
SINCE KAIBA MADE
HIS FIRST MOVE!

00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:07.641
UNFORTUNATELY MOST
OF THE ACTION'S BEEN
AT KAIBA'S EXPENSE!

00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:09.946
AND IT'S GONNA
GET WORSE.

00:13:09.946 --> 00:13:13.418
CAUSE ZIGFRIED'S VALKYRIES
ARE STILL ON THE FIELD!

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.422
DO YOU PLAN TO DO
SOMETHING BESIDES STALL?

00:13:15.422 --> 00:13:17.058
BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY

00:13:17.058 --> 00:13:20.063
YOU'RE
BECOMING SOMETHING
OF A NUISANCE TO ME.

00:13:20.063 --> 00:13:24.070
WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE
GOING TO LOSE, SO WHY
NOT GET IT OVER WITH?

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.308
THAT WAY I CAN WIN
AND STILL MAKE MY
EIGHT O'CLOCK MASSAGE.

00:13:27.308 --> 00:13:29.379
YOU NAUSEATE ME.

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:31.850
NOW JUST MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.153
NOW YOU'RE MAKING SENSE.

00:13:34.153 --> 00:13:38.762
NEXT I ACTIVATE
MY VALKYRIE'S EMBRACE!

00:13:38.762 --> 00:13:44.038
THEN I SWITCH
MY VALKYRIE DRITTE
TO DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:44.038 --> 00:13:46.341
OH!

00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:48.112
BY ACTIVATING
MY MAGIC CARD

00:13:48.112 --> 00:13:50.115
AND THEN SWITCHING ONE
VALKYRIE TO DEFENSE MODE

00:13:50.115 --> 00:13:56.693
I WAS ABLE TO REMOVE
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
FROM THE GAME.

00:13:56.693 --> 00:14:00.400
AND SINCE ANOTHER
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
LEFT THE GAME,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.467
VALKYRIE DRITTE'S
ATTACK STRENGTH GOES UP

00:14:01.467 --> 00:14:05.374
BY ANOTHER
HUNDRED POINTS!

00:14:05.374 --> 00:14:08.012
NOW VALKYRIE ERSTE
ATTACK HIS CLONE DRAGON!

00:14:08.012 --> 00:14:09.815
YA!

00:14:13.722 --> 00:14:16.293
VALKYRIE ZWEITE
END THIS DUEL!

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:18.163
AH!

00:14:18.163 --> 00:14:19.766
AH!

00:14:19.766 --> 00:14:21.302
SETO!!!!

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.929
YA!

00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:28.498
AH!

00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:34.175
THIS IS BAD, GUYS!

00:14:34.175 --> 00:14:36.078
HE LOST ALMOST HALF
HIS POINTS!

00:14:36.078 --> 00:14:38.515
YEAH, AND THERE'S
MORE WHERE DAT
CAME FROM.

00:14:38.515 --> 00:14:41.053
HUH. THAT'S ALL?

00:14:41.053 --> 00:14:42.189
PLEASE!

00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:44.058
TRUST ME, YOU'RE NOT
FOOLING ANYONE.

00:14:44.058 --> 00:14:47.030
THE WHOLE WORLD
CAN SENSE YOUR FEAR.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.303
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M AFRAID OF?

00:14:50.303 --> 00:14:52.439
YOUR FEROCIOUS
GALLOPING GIRL SCOUTS?

00:14:52.439 --> 00:14:58.249
LET'S SEE HOW THEY HOLD UP
AGAINST MY PITCH-DARK DRAGON!

00:14:58.249 --> 00:15:02.524
THEN I PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:15:02.524 --> 00:15:03.525
VERY WELL!

00:15:03.525 --> 00:15:06.096
LET'S SEE.

00:15:06.096 --> 00:15:09.303
I SWITCH
MY VALKYRIE DRITTE
INTO ATTACK MODE!

00:15:09.303 --> 00:15:11.272
[HORSE NEIGHS]

00:15:11.272 --> 00:15:13.309
AND NOW,
GO, VALKYRIE ZWEITE!

00:15:13.309 --> 00:15:16.682
HA!

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:18.418
OH, MAN.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.622
EVERY SINGLE TIME
KAIBA SUMMONS A MONSTER,

00:15:20.622 --> 00:15:22.558
IT GETS CRUSHED!

00:15:22.558 --> 00:15:24.529
JUST HOLD ON
A SECOND, GUYS.

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:26.265
LET'S NOT
LOSE HOPE YET.

00:15:26.265 --> 00:15:28.234
REVEAL FACEDOWN CARD!

00:15:28.234 --> 00:15:29.570
FLAT LEVEL 4!

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.407
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:

00:15:31.407 --> 00:15:33.977
NOW THAT MY DRAGON
IS GONE,

00:15:33.977 --> 00:15:36.950
EACH OF US IS ABLE TO CHOOSE
A FOUR-STAR MONSTER
FROM OUR DECK

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.155
AND SUMMON IT DIRECTLY
TO THE FIELD!

00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:45.331
AND I CHOOSE
MY Y-DRAGON HEAD!

00:15:45.331 --> 00:15:48.203
AND I THINK I SHALL
SUMMON ANOTHER VALKYRIE
TO JOIN US.

00:15:48.203 --> 00:15:51.408
OF COURSE SHE GETS
AN IMMEDIATE POWER BOOST

00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:55.983
SINCE TWO OF YOUR
MONSTERS HAVE BEEN
REMOVED FROM PLAY!

00:15:55.983 --> 00:15:57.586
HOW KIND OF YOU
TO INVITE

00:15:57.586 --> 00:15:59.455
ANOTHER ONE
OF MY FRIENDS
TO THE SOIREE!

00:15:59.455 --> 00:16:01.926
THAT MAKES FOUR!!

00:16:01.926 --> 00:16:04.163
WELL, THE PARTY'S OVER!

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:07.436
FIRST I ACTIVATE MY POT
OF GREED MAGIC CARD!

00:16:07.436 --> 00:16:10.007
THAT LETS ME DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS!

00:16:10.007 --> 00:16:13.179
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
MY DIMENSION FUSION!

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:15.483
NOW ONCE I GIVE UP
TWO THOUSAND OF MY LIFE POINTS,

00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:21.160
I'M ABLE TO BRING BACK
MY X-HEAD CANNON
AND MY Z-METAL TANK!

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.062
NO! NOT THOSE!

00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:25.934
NOW HE'LL BE ABLE TO
COMBINE THEM TOGETHER!

00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:28.172
BUT HE PAID
TWO THOUSAND POINTS!

00:16:28.172 --> 00:16:30.074
IT WASN'T WORTH IT!

00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:34.148
NEXT I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
SOUL ABSORPTION!

00:16:34.148 --> 00:16:37.020
THIS GIVES ME AN ADDITIONAL
FIVE HUNDRED LIFE POINTS

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.893
EACH TIME A CARD IS
REMOVED FROM THE GAME.

00:16:40.893 --> 00:16:42.229
[COLLECTIVE GASP]

00:16:42.229 --> 00:16:45.067
SO I'LL REMOVE
MY X-HEAD CANNON,

00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:47.572
MY Y-DRAGON HEAD,
AND MY Z-METAL TANK

00:16:47.572 --> 00:16:51.045
IN ORDER TO PLAY THIS CARD--
XYZ DRAGON CANNON!

00:16:58.691 --> 00:17:00.895
NOT ONLY WAS HE
ABLE TO SUMMON

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.466
A REALLY
POWERFUL MONSTER
TO THE FIELD,

00:17:03.466 --> 00:17:06.104
HE WAS ALSO ABLE
TO GAIN BACK

00:17:06.104 --> 00:17:07.773
FIFTEEN HUNDRED
LIFE POINTS!

00:17:07.773 --> 00:17:11.145
THIS COULD BE JUST
THE BREAK KAIBA NEEDED
TO MAKE HIS COMEBACK!

00:17:11.145 --> 00:17:13.083
LET'S HOPE SO.

00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:14.418
GRR...

00:17:14.418 --> 00:17:15.787
ALRIGHT, ZIGFRIED!

00:17:15.787 --> 00:17:18.258
IT'S TIME TO GET RID
OF YOUR LITTLE FRIEND,

00:17:18.258 --> 00:17:20.729
ALONG WITH THE HORSE
SHE RODE IN ON!

00:17:20.729 --> 00:17:23.634
DRAGON CANNON ATTACK!

00:17:23.634 --> 00:17:25.236
AAH!

00:17:25.236 --> 00:17:26.673
UH!

00:17:26.673 --> 00:17:29.243
WAY TA GO, SETO!

00:17:29.243 --> 00:17:30.646
NICE MOVE.

00:17:30.646 --> 00:17:31.648
HE TOTALLY CAUGHT
ZIGFRIED OFF GUARD!

00:17:31.648 --> 00:17:34.386
THAT'S MY BRO!

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:35.621
ALWAYS
ONE STEP AHEAD!

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:37.257
ONE STEP AHEAD?

00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:39.528
BUT I SWORE THAT WOULD
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:17:39.528 --> 00:17:42.333
NICE WORK!

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:45.371
THANKS TO HIM,
THE GAMING INDUSTRY
WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.

00:17:45.371 --> 00:17:47.609
SETO KAIBA'S
A GENIUS!

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:48.610
NO!

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.948
I'M TOO LATE!

00:17:50.948 --> 00:17:51.950
UNBELIEVABLE!

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:58.461
THAT KID'S
GONNA BE FAMOUS!

00:17:58.461 --> 00:18:00.664
OH, WAIT.

00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:02.167
YOU CAN'T.

00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:05.406
THAT IDEA BELONGS
TO ME.

00:18:05.406 --> 00:18:11.116
HE'S BEAT ME
TO THE PUNCH
FOR THE LAST TIME!

00:18:11.116 --> 00:18:13.252
KAIBA'S NOT OUTTA
TROUBLE YET.

00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:14.521
AND NOW IT'S
ZIGFRIED'S TURN AGAIN.

00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:17.126
HMMM?

00:18:17.126 --> 00:18:18.829
HOW TO DESTROY YOU?

00:18:18.829 --> 00:18:21.701
I THINK
NIBELUNG'S TREASURE
IS A GOOD START!

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:23.504
HOLD ON A SEC!

00:18:23.504 --> 00:18:27.444
ISN'T THAT THE
SAME CARD HE USED
TO DO YOU IN!?

00:18:27.444 --> 00:18:29.014
THAT'S IT.

00:18:29.014 --> 00:18:31.183
AND IT'S NOT
A FOND MEMORY!

00:18:31.183 --> 00:18:34.023
THIS LETS ME PLAY
NIBELUNG'S RING

00:18:34.023 --> 00:18:35.190
AND SINCE
I'M FEELING GENEROUS,

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.029
I'LL GIVE IT TO
YOUR DRAGON CANNON.

00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:41.035
I ALSO GET TO DRAW
FIVE NEW CARDS.

00:18:41.035 --> 00:18:44.040
AND MY RING
STOPS YOUR MONSTER
FROM ATTACKING ME!

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.747
SO MUCH FOR YOUR
BIG, BAD DRAGON CANNON
SAVING THE DAY.

00:18:48.747 --> 00:18:51.018
AND IT GETS WORSE, GUYS.

00:18:51.018 --> 00:18:53.656
NEXT KAIBA HAS TO DRAW TWO CARDS
FROM HIS DECK.

00:18:53.656 --> 00:18:56.628
AND IF EITHER ONE
IS A MONSTER CARD,

00:18:56.628 --> 00:18:58.230
HE HASTA REMOVE IT
FROM THE GAME!

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.571
NOW I SACRIFICE
MY VALKYRIE DRITTE!

00:19:02.571 --> 00:19:07.213
THAT LETS ME CALL
FORTH THE INSTRUMENT
OF YOUR DESTRUCTION!

00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:13.690
[COLLECTIVE GASP]

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.360
WHAT'S THAT?!?

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.199
WHY, IT'S MY
FORTUNE CHARIOT!

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:21.204
AND IT'S COME
TO CART YOU AWAY
INTO OBLIVION!

00:19:21.204 --> 00:19:26.178
HA HA HA!

00:19:26.178 --> 00:19:28.382
[HORSE NEIGHS]

00:19:28.382 --> 00:19:31.121
NOW THAT MY VALKYRIE ZWEITE
HAS TAKEN THE DRIVER'S SEAT,

00:19:31.121 --> 00:19:33.391
THE REAL FUN CAN BEGIN!

00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:36.497
BY REDUCING MY MONSTER'S
STRENGTH FOR ONE TURN,

00:19:36.497 --> 00:19:41.639
FORTUNE CHARIOT ALLOWS
HER CERTAIN, SHALL WE
SAY, PRIVILEGES?

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:46.147
FOR INSTANCE,
MY VALKYRIE CAN
BYPASS YOUR DRAGON

00:19:46.147 --> 00:19:47.516
AND ATTACK
YOU DIRECTLY!

00:19:47.516 --> 00:19:49.418
OH, MAN!

00:19:49.418 --> 00:19:53.526
NOW VALKYRIE ZWEITE--
ATTACK HERR KAIBA'S
LIFE POINTS!

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:58.268
[HORSE NEIGHS]

00:19:58.268 --> 00:19:59.670
SETO! NO!

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.339
AH!

00:20:01.339 --> 00:20:07.416
ARGH!

00:20:07.416 --> 00:20:09.420
HANG IN THERE!

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.192
AS A RULE,
I USUALLY REFRAIN

00:20:12.192 --> 00:20:13.761
FROM KICKING A MAN
WHILE HE'S DOWN,

00:20:13.761 --> 00:20:15.698
BUT FOR YOU
I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION!

00:20:15.698 --> 00:20:19.839
SO GO, MYSTICAL
SPACE TYPHOON!

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:23.778
NEXT I'LL PLAY THIS
AND END MY TURN.

00:20:23.778 --> 00:20:26.683
DID YOU SEE
WHAT I DID THERE?

00:20:26.683 --> 00:20:29.421
SINCE I JUST DESTROYED
YOUR SOUL ABSORPTION
MAGIC CARD,

00:20:29.421 --> 00:20:32.827
YOU CAN'T REPLENISH
YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:20:32.827 --> 00:20:35.699
AND AS LONG AS
MY FORTUNE CHARIOT
IS IN PLAY,

00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:38.036
I CAN
CONTINUE TO CHIP AWAY
AT YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:39.739
UNTIL YOU HAVE NOTHING!

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:45.781
NOW WHO'S ONE STEP
AHEAD, HERR KAIBA!?
