00:00:00.557 --> 00:00:03.564
Narrator:
PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH!"...

00:00:03.564 --> 00:00:04.968
[THINKING]
THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME IN MY LIFE

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:06.672
THAT I HAVE HOPED FOR
MY OPPONENT'S VICTORY,

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.643
BUT IN ORDER
FOR THIS DUEL

00:00:08.643 --> 00:00:11.616
TO TRULY TEST OUR
READINESS TO SEPARATE,

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:14.857
I MUST FIGHT
WITH ALL MY STRENGTH.

00:00:14.857 --> 00:00:18.165
BEHOLD THE 3
EGYPTIAN GODS.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:21.305
SILENT SWORDSMAN,
IT'S TIME TO ATTACK.

00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:23.009
DESTROY OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.381
WITH SILENT SWORD SLASH.

00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:27.385
NOT SO FAST, YUGI.

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:30.092
BEHOLD MY MIRROR FORCE.

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:32.797
UH! UH...UH...

00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:35.203
THAT WAS
A VALIANT EFFORT .

00:00:35.203 --> 00:00:38.176
IF ONLY YOU HAD PREDICTED
MY FACEDOWN CARD.

00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:39.513
I DID,

00:00:39.513 --> 00:00:42.085
AND THAT'S WHY
THIS DUEL IS NOT DONE.

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:45.092
AS SOON AS YOUR
MIRROR FORCE TRAP CARD
WAS ACTIVATED,

00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:48.600
I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE
THE CARD COMBINATION
THAT I NEEDED.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.110
PHARAOH, IT'S ABOUT TIME
I ELIMINATED THOSE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

THEN STOP TALKING ABOUT IT
AND DO IT ALREADY.

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:05.240
DO YOU REALLY THINK
WHAT YUGI SAID IS TRUE?

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.145
DOES HE HAVE SOME SORTA
CARD COMBINATION

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:12.924
THAT CAN DESTROY
THE 3 EGYPTIAN GODS?

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.126
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:02:14.126 --> 00:02:16.565
LET'S SEE THIS PLAN
OF YOURS.

00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:18.069
WITH PLEASURE.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.577
FIRST, I'LL PLAY
MY MAGNET REVERSE
MAGIC CARD.

00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:23.214
THIS ALLOWS ME
TO CHOOSE ANY ROCK

00:02:23.214 --> 00:02:25.720
OR MACHINE MONSTER THAT
WAS DESTROYED THIS TURN

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.097
AND BRING IT
BACK TO THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:32.268
SO I'VE CHOSEN
MY VALKYRION,

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:34.005
AND SINCE I'VE
SUMMONED A MONSTER,

00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:36.778
SLIFER'S SPECIAL EFFECT
ACTIVATES.

00:02:36.778 --> 00:02:42.624
SO GIMME
YOUR BEST SHOT.

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:46.066
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
THANKS TO MY TRAP CARD,

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:49.173
SLIFER'S BLAST
IS REDIRECTED
TO YOUR OBELISK.

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.888
RGH! HE'S GONE.

00:02:55.888 --> 00:02:58.460
ONE DOWN,
TWO MORE TO GO.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.572
NOW, VALKYRION,
SEPARATE.

00:03:03.572 --> 00:03:05.644
BUT WHY WOULD
HE DO THAT?

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:08.316
'CAUSE EVERY TIME YUGI
GETS A NEW MONSTER,

00:03:08.316 --> 00:03:11.190
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON
IS FORCED TO STRIKE IT.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.009
TOO BAD,

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:22.515
BUT ONCE AGAIN,
MY TRAP CARD KICKS IN.

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:25.254
SO NOW SLIFER'S
BLAST BACKFIRES.

00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:37.282
UH! UHH...

00:03:37.282 --> 00:03:38.785
WHOA! NO WAY.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:41.425
I GUESS YUGI REALLY DID
HAVE A PLAN, AFTER ALL.

00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:43.228
DID YOU SEE DAT?

00:03:43.228 --> 00:03:45.166
HE BEAT
THE EGYPTIAN GODS?

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:46.804
IN ONE MOVE?

00:03:46.804 --> 00:03:50.344
AND I NEVER
EXPECTED ANY LESS
FROM YA, YUGE.

00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:52.215
♪ HE DID IT,
HE DID IT ♪

00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:54.721
♪ HE'S BETTER
THAN THE PHARAOH ♪

00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:56.392
NO OFFENSE,
OF COURSE.

00:03:56.392 --> 00:03:58.029
Yugi: THE FUNNY THING
ABOUT IT IS,

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.566
THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD'VE DESTROYED
THOSE MONSTERS

00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:02.305
WITHOUT YOUR HELP,
PHARAOH.

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:03.708
YA SEE, ALL THE BATTLES
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER

00:04:04.543 --> 00:04:06.147
TAUGHT ME SOMETHING.

00:04:06.147 --> 00:04:08.419
DEFEATING SOMEONE
WHO WIELDS A STRONG FORCE

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.659
OFTEN MEANS USING
THAT VERY FORCE AGAINST THEM.

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.768
SO I KNEW THE ONLY WAY I COULD
TAKE DOWN YOUR 3 EGYPTIAN GODS

00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:19.277
WAS TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO ATTACK THEM
WITH THEIR OWN POWER.

00:04:19.277 --> 00:04:20.279
SO THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I JUST DID,

00:04:21.114 --> 00:04:23.520
AND THE REST IS HISTORY.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.622
Yami-Yugi:
EXCELLENT WORK, YUGI.

00:04:25.457 --> 00:04:26.960
BY TRUSTING
YOUR INSTINCTS,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.101
YOU WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH
THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE.

00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:33.609
YOU DESTROYED
THE MOST POWERFUL CREATURES
IN DUEL MONSTERS,

00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:35.848
BUT REMEMBER,

00:04:35.848 --> 00:04:37.150
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU'VE WON THE GAME.

00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:40.592
TRUE, NOT YET, ANYWAY.

00:04:40.592 --> 00:04:43.331
SO IN THE MEANTIME,
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:45.770
ALL RIGHT,
BUT I SHOULD WARN YOU.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.008
I HAVE PLENTY
OF TRICKS LEFT,

00:04:48.008 --> 00:04:49.044
AND I'LL START
WITH THIS--

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.886
MY POLYMERIZATION
MAGIC CARD,

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:55.458
AND I'LL USE IT
TO MERGE MY GAZELLE

00:04:55.458 --> 00:04:57.597
AND MY BERFOMET TOGETHER

00:04:57.597 --> 00:05:02.775
TO FORM CHIMERA
THE FLYING MYTHICAL BEAST.

00:05:02.775 --> 00:05:04.312
OH!

00:05:04.312 --> 00:05:06.049
NO WAY.

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:07.285
WHAT A COMEBACK.

00:05:07.285 --> 00:05:08.455
THAT'S THE STRONGEST
MONSTER ON THE FIELD.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.960
NOW, CHIMERA,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.599
ATTACK ALPHA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR.

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.943
PULVERIZING POUNCE.

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:19.747
OH! UH UH!

00:05:19.747 --> 00:05:23.589
UHH...

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.462
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE DOWN
TO TWO MONSTERS NOW.

00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:27.831
Mokuba: IMPRESSIVE.

00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:30.037
EVEN THOUGH HE LOST
HIS 3 BEST CARDS,

00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:31.306
THE PHARAOH
BOUNCED RIGHT BACK,

00:05:31.306 --> 00:05:32.542
AND NOW HE'S GOT
THE UPPER HAND AGAIN.

00:05:33.377 --> 00:05:35.149
NO, NOT QUITE.

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:36.686
WHATTAYA MEAN?

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:38.656
YUGI MAY HAVE
FEWER LIFE POINTS,

00:05:38.656 --> 00:05:41.596
BUT HE MANAGED
TO COME UP WITH
AN UNPRECEDENTED STRATEGY

00:05:41.596 --> 00:05:43.868
TO DEFEAT
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:05:43.868 --> 00:05:46.240
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.946
I CAN SEE NOW THAT
I WAS WRONG, MOKUBA.

00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:50.883
HE IS THE KING OF GAMES.

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:52.888
HUH? YOU MEAN THAT?

00:05:52.888 --> 00:05:54.158
SAY WHAT?

00:05:54.158 --> 00:05:55.662
AM I GOIN' NUTS,

00:05:55.662 --> 00:05:58.568
OR DID KAIBA
JUST ADMIT DAT
HE WAS WRONG?

00:05:58.568 --> 00:06:01.341
WHERE WAS I?
OH, YEAH.

00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:05.082
I WAS ABOUT TO SACRIFICE
MY BETA AND GAMMA WARRIORS

00:06:05.082 --> 00:06:07.254
IN ORDER
TO BRING OUT THIS--

00:06:07.254 --> 00:06:13.568
BUSTER BLADER.

00:06:13.568 --> 00:06:15.874
THIS DUEL IS QUITE
A CLOSE RACE.

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:17.544
JUST WHEN I THINK
THE PHARAOH IS BACK
IN THE LEAD AGAIN,

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:20.384
YUGI SPEEDS AHEAD.

00:06:20.384 --> 00:06:21.954
BUT ONLY ONE
THING COUNTS--

00:06:21.954 --> 00:06:23.992
CROSSING
THE FINISH LINE
FIRST,

00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:26.330
AND MY MONEY
IS ON YUGI.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.736
OK. IT'S GO TIME.

00:06:28.736 --> 00:06:31.108
NOW, BUSTER BLADER, ATTACK.

00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:33.046
DESTROY HIS CHIMERA.

00:06:46.142 --> 00:06:47.579
WELL DONE, YUGI,

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:51.154
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
NOT WELL ENOUGH.

00:06:51.154 --> 00:06:54.126
YOU JUST TRIGGERED
CHIMERA'S SPECIAL EFFECT.

00:06:54.126 --> 00:06:56.800
SO NOW I CAN BRING BACK
ONE OF THE TWO MONSTERS

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.205
I MERGED TOGETHER
TO FORM CHIMERA,

00:06:59.205 --> 00:07:01.310
AND I CHOOSE THIS ONE--

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.481
THE MIGHTY BERFOMET.

00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:06.421
SHOW YOURSELF,
MY BEAST,

00:07:06.421 --> 00:07:09.795
AND I'M AFRAID THERE'S PLENTY
MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:17.474
SO LET'S SEE
WHAT ELSE YOU'VE
GOT, PHARAOH.

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:18.877
VERY WELL.

00:07:18.877 --> 00:07:20.648
YOUR BUSTER BLADER
MAY BE POWERFUL,

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.519
BUT IT'S NOT
INDESTRUCTIBLE.

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:26.261
NOW SAY HELLO
TO MY NEW FRIEND.

00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:28.399
I SACRIFICE BERFOMET

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:34.246
TO SUMMON
BEAST OF GILFER.

00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:38.589
THEN I SHALL PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:39.992
THE PHARAOH
HAS LOST IT.

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:41.329
HE JUST SUMMONED
A MONSTER TO DA FIELD

00:07:42.164 --> 00:07:43.768
THAT'S WEAKER
THAN YUGI'S,

00:07:43.768 --> 00:07:47.242
UNLESS HE WANTS YUGI
TO DESTROY HIS MONSTER

00:07:47.242 --> 00:07:51.050
SO THE PHARAOH CAN
TURN AROUND AND ACTIVATE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.556
[THINKING]
JOEY HAS GOT A POINT THERE,

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.795
BUT THAT'S A RISK
I'M GONNA HAFTA TAKE

00:07:55.795 --> 00:07:57.832
BECAUSE IT COULD BE
EVEN MORE DANGEROUS

00:07:57.832 --> 00:08:01.574
TO LET THE PHARAOH KEEP
THAT MONSTER ON THE FIELD.

00:08:01.574 --> 00:08:03.879
ALL RIGHT.
MY MOVE.

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.583
I'LL PLACE
THIS FACE DOWN,

00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:09.592
AND THEN I'LL SEND
YOUR GILFER ON A ONE-WAY
TRIP TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:08:09.592 --> 00:08:11.229
SO HERE GOES.

00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:12.934
BUSTER BLADER,

00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:15.004
DRAGON SWORD ATTACK.

00:08:20.852 --> 00:08:22.388
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE
JUST ACTIVATED

00:08:22.388 --> 00:08:25.328
MY BEAST OF GILFER'S
SPECIAL EFFECT.

00:08:25.328 --> 00:08:27.098
WHENEVER IT'S SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:08:27.098 --> 00:08:28.568
IT DECREASES
THE ATTACK STRENGTH

00:08:28.568 --> 00:08:32.010
OF ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
BY 500 POINTS.

00:08:37.723 --> 00:08:40.095
I GUESS
I'LL END MY TURN.

00:08:40.095 --> 00:08:41.865
I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT SAY THAT.

00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:43.937
NOW I PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN,

00:08:43.937 --> 00:08:45.574
AND THEN I'LL
ACTIVATE A MAGIC CARD

00:08:45.574 --> 00:08:48.280
KNOWN AS AWAKENING
FROM BEYOND.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.716
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:08:49.716 --> 00:08:52.322
MY OPPONENT EARNS THE RIGHT
TO DRAW TWO CARDS,

00:08:52.322 --> 00:08:54.761
AND IN EXCHANGE, I EARN
THE RIGHT TO TRANSFER

00:08:54.761 --> 00:08:58.036
ONE MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
TO MY HAND.

00:08:58.036 --> 00:09:03.480
NOW GO AHEAD AND DRAW
YOUR CARDS, YUGI.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.051
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

00:09:05.051 --> 00:09:08.559
SO ONE OF MY MONSTERS
RETURNS TO THE GAME.

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:09.595
[THINKING] YEAH,
BUT WHICH ONE?

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.368
BESIDES
THE EGYPTIAN GODS,

00:09:12.368 --> 00:09:16.142
WHAT'S THE MOST
POWERFUL MONSTER
IN HIS GRAVEYARD?

00:09:16.142 --> 00:09:18.381
BEST OF LUCK, YUGI.

00:09:18.381 --> 00:09:19.951
NOW...

00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:22.691
I'LL START BY DISCARDING
ONE CARD FROM MY HAND

00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:26.467
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
A MONSTER KNOWN
AS THE TRICKY.

00:09:26.467 --> 00:09:30.174
[THINKING] BUT
BRINGING BACK THE TRICKY
WOULD BE POINTLESS.

00:09:30.174 --> 00:09:32.914
FIRST OF ALL,
THE PHARAOH WOULD
HAVE TO REMOVE A CARD

00:09:32.914 --> 00:09:34.183
FROM HIS HAND
IN ORDER TO SUMMON IT,

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:37.257
AND EVEN IF HE DID,

00:09:37.257 --> 00:09:40.932
IT STILL WOULDN'T BE
STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFEAT
MY BUSTER BLADER.

00:09:40.932 --> 00:09:42.403
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:09:42.403 --> 00:09:44.040
TRYING TO GUESS
WHAT MONSTER
I BROUGHT BACK?

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.311
YOU WON'T.

00:09:46.311 --> 00:09:47.747
YOU SEE, YUGI,

00:09:47.747 --> 00:09:50.454
IT'S A MONSTER
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD,

00:09:50.454 --> 00:09:53.795
AND NOW I SHALL SUMMON
THIS CREATURE TO THE FIELD

00:09:53.795 --> 00:09:55.900
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.839
SWIFT GAIA THE FIERCE KNIGHT,
COME FORTH.

00:09:58.839 --> 00:10:03.984
HOW'D DAT GET
IN HIS GRAVEYARD?

00:10:03.984 --> 00:10:06.490
[ROARS]

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.929
Yami-Yugi: AND ALTHOUGH
IT'S A LEVEL-7 MONSTER,

00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:10.834
IT CAN BE SUMMONED
WITHOUT A SACRIFICE

00:10:10.834 --> 00:10:13.840
BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY CARD
LEFT IN MY HAND.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.210
HOLD ON.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.680
I NEVER
SENT THAT CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:10:17.515 --> 00:10:20.121
YES. THAT'S TRUE,
BUT I DID

00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:23.896
AT THE VERY START
OF OUR DUEL.

00:10:23.896 --> 00:10:26.301
BEFORE I SUMMONED
MY FIRST MONSTER,

00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:30.745
I GOT RID OF A CARD
IN MY HAND.

00:10:30.745 --> 00:10:32.249
WAIT A SEC.

00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:34.119
ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU SENT GAIA
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:37.059
ALL THE WAY
BACK THEN?

00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:38.630
BUT WHY WOULD
YOU THROW AWAY
SUCH A POWERFUL CARD

00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:41.904
SO EARLY
IN THE DUEL?

00:10:41.904 --> 00:10:44.042
I WAS PREPARING
FOR THIS.

00:10:44.042 --> 00:10:45.712
I HAVE KNOWN
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:47.449
THAT WE WOULD GET
TO THIS POINT.

00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:48.853
WHAT?

00:10:48.853 --> 00:10:49.988
BUT HOW COULD YOU
HAVE PREDICTED THAT?

00:10:50.824 --> 00:10:52.829
IT WAS SIMPLE.

00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:55.234
FROM THE MOMENT I CHOSE
THE CARDS IN MY DECK,

00:10:55.234 --> 00:10:58.508
I KNEW THE COURSE THAT
THIS DUEL WOULD TAKE,

00:10:58.508 --> 00:11:03.185
FOR ALTHOUGH I HELD
THE 3 MOST POWERFUL
MONSTERS IN EXISTENCE,

00:11:03.185 --> 00:11:06.659
I KNEW THAT I NEEDED MORE.

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:09.800
YUGI, WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.673
I KNEW YOU WOULD DEFEAT
THE EGYPTIAN GODS.

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:14.644
[ALL GASP]

00:11:14.644 --> 00:11:16.281
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:11:16.281 --> 00:11:19.388
THERE'S NO WAY
HE COULD'VE KNOWN HOW
ALL THIS WOULD GO DOWN.

00:11:19.388 --> 00:11:23.297
YUGI, DESTROYING
THE 3 EGYPTIAN GODS

00:11:23.297 --> 00:11:26.137
WAS MERELY THE FIRST STEP
OF THIS RITUAL.

00:11:26.137 --> 00:11:27.908
NOW THAT THEY'RE GONE,

00:11:27.908 --> 00:11:32.451
THE TRUE TEST OF OUR
READINESS TO SEPARATE
FROM ONE ANOTHER CAN BEGIN.

00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:34.924
SO IF YOU'RE READY
TO LIVE ON YOUR OWN,

00:11:34.924 --> 00:11:37.529
THEN PROVE IT TO ME
BY WINNING THIS DUEL.

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:39.066
AND NOW, GAIA,

00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:40.904
ANNIHILATE
HIS BUSTER BLADER

00:11:40.904 --> 00:11:46.817
WITH SPIRAL LANCE
THRUST ATTACK.

00:11:46.817 --> 00:11:48.587
[THINKING] YUGI,
THERE IS ONLY ONE SOUL

00:11:48.587 --> 00:11:49.657
WITH THE POWER
TO SAVE THE PHARAOH,

00:11:50.492 --> 00:11:52.330
AND THAT IS YOU.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.900
ONLY BY DEFEATING HIM

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.441
CAN YOU RELEASE HIS SPIRIT
TO ITS FINAL RESTING PLACE.

00:11:57.441 --> 00:11:59.779
PLEASE BE STRONG.

00:12:10.902 --> 00:12:12.272
UH!

00:12:12.272 --> 00:12:16.882
UH...UH...

00:12:16.882 --> 00:12:18.419
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:19.788
LET'S HOPE SO.

00:12:19.788 --> 00:12:22.295
YOU JUST ACTIVATED
MY FACEDOWN CARD--

00:12:22.295 --> 00:12:23.731
SOUL ROPE.

00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:25.134
IT LETS ME SUMMON
A MONSTER FROM MY DECK

00:12:25.969 --> 00:12:28.275
TO REPLACE THE ONE
I JUST LOST,

00:12:28.275 --> 00:12:30.813
AS LONG AS I GIVE UP
1,000 POINTS.

00:12:30.813 --> 00:12:34.021
SO NOW LET'S SEE WHICH
CARD I SHOULD CHOOSE.

00:12:34.021 --> 00:12:35.424
AH. AHA.

00:12:35.424 --> 00:12:36.927
I PLAY THIS--

00:12:36.927 --> 00:12:39.199
WITCH OF
THE BLACK FOREST,

00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:43.309
AND I'M PUTTING HER
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:12:43.309 --> 00:12:46.382
BUT, YUGI, THAT'S HARDLY
ENOUGH TO PROTECT YOU.

00:12:46.382 --> 00:12:50.325
Bakura: WHY WOULD HE GIVE UP
1,000 POINTS JUST TO PLAY THAT?

00:12:50.325 --> 00:12:51.761
I DUNNO.

00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:53.030
IT SEEMS LIKE
HE MIGHT BE GETTING
DESPERATE OUT THERE.

00:12:53.866 --> 00:12:55.402
NO JOKE.

00:12:55.402 --> 00:12:58.276
I GUESS YUGI JUST REALIZED
THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN WIN.

00:12:58.276 --> 00:13:00.113
NOT A CHANCE.

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:03.621
I'M SURE
THIS IS ALL PART
OF YUGI'S STRATEGY.

00:13:03.621 --> 00:13:06.260
HE SUMMONED THAT
WITCH FOR A REASON.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.733
I KNOW,
TO SACRIFICE IT.

00:13:08.733 --> 00:13:11.506
OF COURSE,
TO PLAY SOMETHING
STRONGER.

00:13:11.506 --> 00:13:15.315
I'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE.
WATCH THIS.

00:13:15.315 --> 00:13:21.662
I'M TRADING IN MY WITCH
FOR MY SUMMONED SKULL.

00:13:21.662 --> 00:13:25.872
COME ON OUT,
OLD PAL.

00:13:25.872 --> 00:13:29.414
AND WHENEVER MY WITCH
OF THE BLACK FOREST
GOES TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:13:29.414 --> 00:13:32.754
I CAN TRANSFER A MONSTER
FROM MY DECK TO MY HAND,

00:13:32.754 --> 00:13:35.493
AND I CHOOSE MY OLD PAL
MARSHMALLON.

00:13:35.493 --> 00:13:36.863
WELL DONE.

00:13:36.863 --> 00:13:40.304
THERE'S A MOVE
I DIDN'T EXPECT.

00:13:40.304 --> 00:13:41.674
Tea: WHOA.

00:13:41.674 --> 00:13:44.313
TWO OF YUGI'S STRONGEST MONSTERS
FACE TO FACE IN BATTLE.

00:13:44.313 --> 00:13:46.618
THE WHOLE THING IS
PRETTY BIZARRE ISN'T IT?

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.790
Tristan: YOU THINK
IT'S WEIRD FOR US?

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.468
JUST THINK ABOUT HOW
THE PHARAOH AND YUGI
MUST FEEL.

00:13:53.468 --> 00:13:55.639
HERE WE GO,
SUMMONED SKULL.

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:57.777
ATTACK HIS
FIERCE KNIGHT NOW.

00:13:57.777 --> 00:13:59.447
LIGHTNING STRIKE.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.268
WAAH!

00:14:08.268 --> 00:14:14.314
UGH! AAH!

00:14:14.314 --> 00:14:16.921
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE WIDE OPEN,

00:14:16.921 --> 00:14:19.426
BUT LUCKILY FOR YOU,
MY MOVE IS OVER.

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:21.264
OHH...

00:14:21.264 --> 00:14:24.404
[THINKING] THIS DUEL COULD BE
THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGE
I'VE EVER FACED.

00:14:24.404 --> 00:14:25.607
EVER SINCE I WAS REBORN
INTO THIS WORLD,

00:14:26.442 --> 00:14:28.713
YUGI HAS BEEN BEHIND ME

00:14:28.713 --> 00:14:31.220
SUPPORTING ME,
GIVING ME STRENGTH,

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.496
BUT NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
HE'S FACING ME AS AN OPPONENT,

00:14:35.496 --> 00:14:39.405
AND I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT YUGI
FEELS THE SAME WAY I DO,

00:14:39.405 --> 00:14:42.010
STARING INTO THE FACE
OF HIS CLOSEST FRIEND

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.619
AND GREATEST RIVAL,
BUT LIKE YUGI,

00:14:45.619 --> 00:14:48.458
I NEED TO FIGHT HARDER
THAN I'VE EVER FOUGHT BEFORE

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:51.498
AND DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO WIN THIS BATTLE.

00:14:51.498 --> 00:14:53.370
IT'S MY MOVE,

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.040
AND THE CARD THAT
I'M ABOUT TO DRAW

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.412
IS THE EXACT ONE
THAT I NEED,

00:14:57.412 --> 00:15:00.353
AND NOW, ALMIGHTY
BIG SHIELD GARDNA,

00:15:00.353 --> 00:15:03.492
COME FORTH.

00:15:03.492 --> 00:15:09.740
LET'S SEE
IF I WAS CORRECT.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.876
ALL RIGHT.
NOW I'VE SEEN IT ALL.

00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:13.348
THAT'S NUTS.

00:15:13.348 --> 00:15:15.854
HOW COULD HE
HAVE KNOWN WHAT CARD
HE WAS GONNA DRAW?

00:15:15.854 --> 00:15:17.224
I SUPPOSE
THAT'S WHAT
THEY MEAN

00:15:17.224 --> 00:15:18.594
BY "LUCK OF
THE DRAW."

00:15:18.594 --> 00:15:19.829
NOT QUITE.

00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:22.001
THAT MOVE HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH LUCK.

00:15:22.001 --> 00:15:26.044
TRUTH IS, HE KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT CARD
HE WAS ABOUT TO DRAW.

00:15:26.044 --> 00:15:27.247
WHAT?

00:15:27.247 --> 00:15:28.549
BUT THEIR DECKS WERE
SHUFFLED, RIGHT?

00:15:28.549 --> 00:15:30.286
CAN HE SEE
THE FUTURE?

00:15:30.286 --> 00:15:31.523
'CAUSE
IF HE CAN,

00:15:31.523 --> 00:15:32.692
I'D SAY THAT
QUALIFIES

00:15:32.692 --> 00:15:34.262
AS AN UNFAIR
ADVANTAGE.

00:15:34.262 --> 00:15:35.932
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:15:35.932 --> 00:15:39.441
YOU SEE, THE PHARAOH
DIDN'T PREDICT WHAT
HIS NEXT CARD WOULD BE.

00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:41.479
HIS WILLPOWER
MADE IT SO.

00:15:41.479 --> 00:15:44.585
IT APPEARS THE PHARAOH'S
DETERMINATION WAS SO STRONG,

00:15:44.585 --> 00:15:47.559
HE ACTUALLY INFLUENCED FATE
WITH HIS OWN WILL.

00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:48.829
[BOTH GASP]

00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:50.532
THAT'S INSANE.

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:51.836
SINCE WHEN CAN FATE
BE CONTROLLED?

00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:54.208
Joey: LOOK, TEA.

00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:55.376
IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING
FROM HANGIN' OUT
WITH YUGI,

00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:59.319
IT'S DAT NOTHING
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:15:59.319 --> 00:16:01.357
I BELIEVE
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:16:01.357 --> 00:16:03.896
SOUNDS GOOD TA ME.

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:06.803
I'LL START BY ACTIVATING
POT OF GREED,

00:16:06.803 --> 00:16:08.205
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:16:08.205 --> 00:16:10.144
I GET TO DRAW
TWO NEW CARDS,

00:16:10.144 --> 00:16:14.186
AND THEN I SUMMON
MY WATAPON.

00:16:14.186 --> 00:16:16.157
DON'T BLINK.
YOU JUST MIGHT
MISS 'IM

00:16:16.157 --> 00:16:21.068
'CAUSE I'VE SACRIFICED
HIM TO PLAY THIS--

00:16:21.068 --> 00:16:23.941
CURSE OF DRAGON.

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:24.977
YUGI'S MOVING UP
IN THE WORLD.

00:16:25.813 --> 00:16:28.185
HE'S GOT TWO
POWERHOUSES NOW.

00:16:28.185 --> 00:16:32.194
Yugi: NOW,
SUMMONED SKULL,
ATTACK.

00:16:32.194 --> 00:16:34.164
YUGI'S MONSTER
IS TOO WEAK.

00:16:34.164 --> 00:16:38.708
SO WHY
WOULD HE ATTACK?

00:16:38.708 --> 00:16:40.011
Joey: TRUST ME.
HE KNOWS WHAT
HE'S DOING.

00:16:40.847 --> 00:16:43.117
OH, LET'S HOPE SO.

00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:50.200
SAY WHAT?

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.537
TOLD YA IT
WAS ALL GOOD.

00:16:51.537 --> 00:16:53.942
YA SEE, BY ATTACKING
BIG SHIELD GARDNA,

00:16:53.942 --> 00:16:57.551
YUGI SWITCHED IT
INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:16:57.551 --> 00:16:59.588
NOW IT'S MY DRAGON'S TURN.

00:16:59.588 --> 00:17:02.428
ATTACK HIS BIG SHIELD GARDNA.

00:17:07.807 --> 00:17:09.378
RRGH!

00:17:09.378 --> 00:17:12.350
Yugi: NOW YOUR LAST LINE
OF DEFENSE IS GONE.

00:17:17.617 --> 00:17:19.221
Joey: YUGI'S HAVIN' DA TIME
OF HIS LIFE UP THERE,

00:17:20.056 --> 00:17:21.593
AND WHO COULD BLAME 'IM?

00:17:21.593 --> 00:17:25.735
IF HE WINS, DAT MEANS HE'S READY
TO FACE THE WORLD ON HIS OWN.

00:17:25.735 --> 00:17:28.242
AND THE PHARAOH WILL
FINALLY BE FREE.

00:17:28.242 --> 00:17:30.412
HMM...

00:17:30.412 --> 00:17:32.384
[SOBBING]

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.221
WHAT'S UP TEA?

00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:36.059
I CAN'T
WATCH ANYMORE.

00:17:36.059 --> 00:17:38.498
IF THE PHARAOH LOSES,

00:17:38.498 --> 00:17:39.834
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
WE'LL EVER SEE HIM.

00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:42.072
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

00:17:42.072 --> 00:17:44.578
BUT I'M NOT READY
TO SAY GOODBYE YET.

00:17:44.578 --> 00:17:46.315
PLEASE MAKE THEM STOP.

00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:49.022
TEA, THIS ISN'T EASY
FOR ANY OF US,

00:17:49.022 --> 00:17:51.193
BUT THAT DUEL
HAS TO GO ON.

00:17:51.193 --> 00:17:52.964
PLUS, YOU KNOW
AS WELL AS I DO,

00:17:52.964 --> 00:17:54.301
WE COULDN'T STOP
THIS THING IF WE TRIED.

00:17:55.136 --> 00:17:57.474
I GUESS SO,
BUT REMIND ME WHY?

00:17:57.474 --> 00:17:58.910
HERE'S THE DEAL.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.247
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED
SINCE THOSE TWO MET

00:18:01.082 --> 00:18:02.185
HAS BEEN LEADING
UP TO THIS.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.657
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

00:18:04.657 --> 00:18:07.698
EVERY SINGLE DUEL
THAT YUGI AND THE PHARAOH
EVER FACED TOGETHER

00:18:07.698 --> 00:18:09.668
WAS PREPARING THEM
FOR THIS ONE.

00:18:09.668 --> 00:18:11.907
EVERY ENEMY THEY
EVER STARED DOWN,

00:18:11.907 --> 00:18:13.877
EVERY STRATEGY
THEY EVER PLANNED,

00:18:13.877 --> 00:18:15.849
AND EVERY FRIEND
THEY EVER SAVED

00:18:15.849 --> 00:18:17.753
HELPED SHAPE
WHO THEY ARE TODAY,

00:18:17.753 --> 00:18:21.595
AND NOW THEY NEED THIS TEST
TO SEE HOW FAR THEY'VE COME.

00:18:21.595 --> 00:18:23.533
BUT WHY?

00:18:23.533 --> 00:18:25.003
'CAUSE WHEN
THEY FIRST MET,

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:26.774
THESE GUYS
HAD A LOT TO LEARN,

00:18:26.774 --> 00:18:27.943
AND THEY NEEDED
EACH OTHER TO GET BY,

00:18:28.778 --> 00:18:30.315
BUT HOPEFULLY BY NOW,

00:18:30.315 --> 00:18:31.985
THEY'RE BOTH READY TO
MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.257
TRUST ME, TEA.

00:18:34.257 --> 00:18:35.460
THIS DUEL IS REALLY
ALL FOR THE BEST,

00:18:36.295 --> 00:18:38.166
AND AS TOUGH
AS IT MAY SEEM,

00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:39.636
WE NEED TO SUPPORT
THOSE TWO GUYS ALL THE WAY.

00:18:40.471 --> 00:18:41.775
[SNIFFLE]

00:18:41.775 --> 00:18:44.180
FINE.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.884
[THINKING] I CAN SENSE
THE PRESENCE

00:18:45.884 --> 00:18:48.056
OF AN OLD FRIEND
IN MY DECK,

00:18:48.056 --> 00:18:50.428
AND IT'S TIME FOR US
TO REUNITE.

00:18:50.428 --> 00:18:52.398
I MAY BE DEFENSELESS NOW,

00:18:52.398 --> 00:18:55.071
BUT THAT'S
ALL ABOUT TO CHANGE.

00:18:55.071 --> 00:18:56.507
MY MOVE,

00:18:56.507 --> 00:18:59.081
AND NOW I ACTIVATE
A MAGIC CARD

00:18:59.081 --> 00:19:03.557
KNOWN AS
DARK MAGIC CURTAIN.

00:19:03.557 --> 00:19:06.029
NEXT, I SHALL GIVE UP
HALF MY LIFE POINTS

00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:07.299
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
MY GREATEST CREATURE

00:19:08.134 --> 00:19:10.372
AND MOST FAITHFUL SERVANT.

00:19:10.372 --> 00:19:13.245
COME FORTH,
DARK MAGICIAN.

00:19:22.299 --> 00:19:24.738
I WAS AFRAID
HE'D DO THAT.

00:19:24.738 --> 00:19:28.413
NOW YUGI IS FORCED
TO FIGHT AGAINST
HIS FAVORITE MONSTER.

00:19:28.413 --> 00:19:30.551
WELL, I'M GLAD
I STUCK AROUND.

00:19:30.551 --> 00:19:31.988
I'M NOT DONE YET.

00:19:31.988 --> 00:19:33.258
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
MY FACEDOWN CARD--

00:19:34.093 --> 00:19:35.897
BOOK OF SECRET ARTS,

00:19:35.897 --> 00:19:37.500
WHICH RAISES
THE ATTACK STRENGTH
OF MY DARK MAGICIAN

00:19:38.335 --> 00:19:43.514
BY 300 POINTS.

00:19:43.514 --> 00:19:45.753
NOW,
DARK MAGICIAN,

00:19:45.753 --> 00:19:50.095
DESTROY HIS SUMMONED SKULL
WITH DARK MAGIC ATTACK.

00:19:57.579 --> 00:19:58.982
RRGH!

00:19:58.982 --> 00:20:02.089
UH!

00:20:02.089 --> 00:20:03.526
NICE WORK.

00:20:03.526 --> 00:20:06.700
MY KING, I HAVE JOURNEYED
5,000 YEARS

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.442
ACROSS TIME AND SPACE
TO SERVE YOU IN THIS BATTLE.

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:11.979
OH.

00:20:11.979 --> 00:20:13.749
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

00:20:13.749 --> 00:20:16.689
UH, NO.
JUST NERVES, I GUESS.

00:20:16.689 --> 00:20:19.228
[THINKING] DARK MAGICIAN,

00:20:19.228 --> 00:20:22.202
YOUR ARRIVAL HAS SPARKED
A STRANGE VISION,

00:20:22.202 --> 00:20:26.645
BUT WHAT ARE THESE MEMORIES
OF OLD THAT HAUNT ME?

00:20:26.645 --> 00:20:30.320
YUGI, THIS IS THE STRONGEST
MONSTER I HAVE LEFT,

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.362
AND YOU KNOW HIM
QUITE WELL.

00:20:34.362 --> 00:20:36.398
SO IF YOU INTEND
TO DEFEAT ME TODAY,

00:20:36.398 --> 00:20:42.137
YOU MUST FIRST DEFEAT
MY DARK MAGICIAN.

00:20:42.137 --> 00:20:44.673
[THINKING]
IF I WANNA SAVE
MY CLOSEST FRIEND,

00:20:44.673 --> 00:20:47.842
I'M GONNA HAFTA DESTROY
MY MOST TRUSTED MONSTER.
