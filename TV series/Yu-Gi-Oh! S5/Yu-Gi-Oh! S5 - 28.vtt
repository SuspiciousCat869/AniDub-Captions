THESE TWO DELINQUENTS
RECEIVED EXACTLY
WHAT THEY DESERVED, YUGI.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.410
THEY TOOK POSSESSION
OF SOMETHING

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.212
THAT DIDN'T BELONG
TO THEM,

00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:19.584
SO I BANISHED THEIR SOULS
TO THE SHADOW REALM,

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:23.258
AND I'D SAY THE PUNISHMENT
FIT THE CRIME.

YOU SENT THEM
TO THE SHADOW REALM?

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.332
YOU SHOULD BE SHOWING
A LITTLE MORE GRATITUDE.

00:02:28.332 --> 00:02:34.041
AFTER ALL,
I'VE RETURNED
YOUR BELONGINGS.

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:36.211
WELL, MOST OF THEM.

00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.215
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

00:02:38.215 --> 00:02:39.617
TAKE A LOOK.

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:41.787
THERE WAS ONE ITEM
IN YOUR BAG OF TRICKS

THAT I'M NOT QUITE READY
TO PART WITH.

00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:47.196

IT DID BELONG TO ME
AT ONE TIME.

00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:48.264
GIVE IT BACK.

00:02:48.264 --> 00:02:50.601
THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS
BELONG TOGETHER.

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:52.671
EVENTUALLY,
THEY WILL BE.

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:55.876
IN THE MEANTIME,
WHY DON'T YOU CONCENTRATE ON
GATHERING THE OTHER ITEMS

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:57.712
INSTEAD OF PESTERING ME?

00:02:57.712 --> 00:02:59.281
AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,

00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:01.452
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE MILLENNIUM RING.

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:03.121
WE MAY NOT
BE FOND EACH OTHER,

00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:05.859
BUT WE DO SHARE
A COMMON GOAL.

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.765
WE BOTH WANT
ALL 7 ITEMS RETURNED TO
THEIR RESTING PLACE,

00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:13.137
UNITED ONCE AGAIN
WITHIN THE MILLENNIUM STONE,

00:03:13.137 --> 00:03:16.142
JUST AS THEY WERE
SO LONG AGO.

00:03:16.142 --> 00:03:19.146
I DON'T TRUST YOU,
AND I NEVER WILL.

00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:20.849
I'M COLLECTING
THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.023
SO I CAN HELP THE
PHARAOH SAVE THE WORLD
FROM DESTRUCTION.

00:03:25.023 --> 00:03:28.529
AND I GATHER YOU THINK
THAT I HAVE
A DIFFERENT GOAL IN MIND?

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.298
BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU WISH.

00:03:30.298 --> 00:03:32.635
BUT REMEMBER,
I KNOW THINGS ABOUT THE PAST

00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:35.406
THAT YOUR PHARAOH FRIEND
SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN.

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:36.475
OH YEAH?

00:03:36.475 --> 00:03:38.545
AND WHAT KINDS OF
THINGS ARE THOSE?

00:03:38.545 --> 00:03:42.050
I KNOW THAT WHEN
THE 7 MILLENNIUM ITEMS
ARE RETURNED TO THE STONE

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.922
A DOORWAY
TO THE SPIRIT WORLD
WILL OPEN.

00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:46.424
THE SPIRIT WORLD?

00:03:46.424 --> 00:03:47.893
IF THAT EXISTS,

00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:50.330
IT COULD BE WHERE
THE SPIRIT OF
THE PHARAOH BELONGS.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.500
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
WHEN THIS DOORWAY OPENS,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.404
THE PHARAOH WILL BE
SET FREE?

00:03:54.404 --> 00:03:56.140
YOU'RE CATCHING ON.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.209
SO DON'T YOU WANT
TO HELP YOUR FRIEND?

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.580
AFTER ALL,
HIS SPIRIT'S BEEN TRAPPED
IN THAT PUZZLE

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.416
FOR 5,000 YEARS.

00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:04.920

00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:15.738
AH, PHARAOH,
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS HONOR?

00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:19.009
DID YOU COME HERE
SO WE CAN BURY THE HATCHET
AND JOIN FORCES?

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.746
YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN THAT.

00:04:20.746 --> 00:04:22.682
I KNOW WHY YOU HATE ME,

00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:24.685
BECAUSE WHEN
YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT,

00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:27.255
YOU AND I ARE MORE ALIKE
THAN YOU'D CARE TO ADMIT.

00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:29.259
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, PHARAOH?

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.730
WE ARE NOTHING ALIKE.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.901
WE'RE BOTH
5,000-YEAR-OLD SPRITS,
AREN'T WE?

THE BODY OF
AN INNOCENT CIVILIAN?

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.414
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS
I REMEMBER MY PAST.

00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:46.420
ALL YOUR MIND CONTAINS
IS AN ENDLESS LABYRINTH
OF QUESTIONS.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.026
YOUR WHOLE LIFE
IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PUZZLE
WRAPPED IN A GAME,

00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:52.363
AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW
THE SOLUTION.

00:04:52.363 --> 00:04:55.769
IT'S QUITE IRONIC,
ACTUALLY.

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:59.541
THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN SOLVE THAT GAME
IS BY PLAYING A GAME.

00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:02.011
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH,

00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:04.849
BUT I'LL DO WHATEVER
I HAVE TO.

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.622
GAME OR NO GAME,
I WILL UNLOCK MY MIND.

00:05:08.622 --> 00:05:10.592

THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS MAGIC, RIGHT?

00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:15.385
AND ALL OF THOSE
ANCIENT VISIONS
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING,

00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:17.722

00:07:17.722 --> 00:07:20.060

ON THE FUTURE?

I DON'T WASTE MY TIME
WORRYING ABOUT THE PAST.

00:07:29.307 --> 00:07:33.348
THAT ATTITUDE OF YOURS

YOUR ANCIENT HERITAGE,

00:07:45.934 --> 00:07:50.008
YOU'LL LONG TO RETURN
TO YOUR ROOTS.

00:07:50.008 --> 00:07:51.977
LET THE GAME COMMENCE.

00:07:51.977 --> 00:07:53.513
MY MOVE.

00:07:53.513 --> 00:07:56.685
FIRST I'LL PLAY
POLYMERIZATION,

00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:03.763
FUSING MY EARL AND MY KNIGHT
TO FORM THE DUKE OF DEMISE.

00:08:03.763 --> 00:08:06.601
BUT THE RULES FORBID ME
TO ATTACK YOU.

00:08:06.601 --> 00:08:09.706
I SUPPOSE YOU GOT OFF EASY
THIS TIME, KAIBA.

00:08:09.706 --> 00:08:11.175
PLEASE.

00:08:11.175 --> 00:08:13.211
IT'LL TAKE A LOT MORE
THAN A ROTTING CARCASS
WITH A SWORD

00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:14.714
TO INTIMIDATE ME.

00:08:14.714 --> 00:08:16.951
NOW WATCH HOW IT'S DONE.

00:08:16.951 --> 00:08:22.994
I SUMMON MY VORSE RAIDER
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:08:22.994 --> 00:08:26.366
SORRY, BUT IT SEEMS
YOUR MONSTER'S
A FEW POINTS SHORT.

00:08:26.366 --> 00:08:27.935
I'M NOT DONE.

00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:30.205
NEXT,
I'LL ACTIVATE THIS.

00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:31.841
IT'S MY SHRINK CARD,

00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:37.784
AND IT CUTS
YOUR CORPSE'S
ATTACK POINTS IN HALF.

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:39.954
VORSE RAIDER,
ATTACK NOW!

00:08:46.031 --> 00:08:49.136
MY ATTACK
MAY NOT HAVE DESTROYED
YOUR MONSTER,

00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:53.876
BUT IT DID REMOVE
900 OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:08:53.876 --> 00:08:55.545
AND YOU THINK
THAT WORRIES ME?

00:08:55.545 --> 00:08:58.150
I WOULDN'T BE LAUGHING
IF I WERE YOU.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.053
AND WHY IS THAT?

00:09:00.053 --> 00:09:01.522
WELL, FOR ONE,

00:09:01.522 --> 00:09:03.959
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE
ANOTHER 500
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:06.630
THANKS TO YOUR FRIEND
THE DUKE OF DEMISE.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.967
IS THAT REASON
ENOUGH FOR YOU?

00:09:08.967 --> 00:09:13.041
NO, BECAUSE I HAVE SOMETHING
FAR WORSE IN STORE.

00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:18.716
FIRST I'LL SACRIFICE
MY DUKE IN ORDER TO SUMMON
MY DIABOUND KERNEL.

00:09:18.716 --> 00:09:22.155
THEN I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
SPIRIT ILLUSION.

00:09:22.155 --> 00:09:24.492
IT CREATES WHAT'S KNOWN
AS A DOPPELGANGER,

00:09:24.492 --> 00:09:26.662
AN EXACT DUPLICATE
OF MY MONSTER,

00:09:26.662 --> 00:09:30.769
COMPLETE WITH ALL THE POWER
OF THE ORIGINAL.

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:34.909
WOW, SO NOW YOU'VE GOT
TWO USELESS MONSTERS.

00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:36.745
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

00:09:36.745 --> 00:09:41.519
GO, DOPPELGANGER DIABOUND.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:45.092
DID I FORGET TO MENTION
MY DOPPELGANGER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY?

00:09:45.092 --> 00:09:46.661
WHENEVER IT STRIKES,

00:09:46.661 --> 00:09:49.499
YOUR MONSTER AUTOMATICALLY
LOSES ATTACK POINTS

00:09:49.499 --> 00:09:54.407
EQUAL TO THOSE
OF MY DOPPELGANGER.

00:09:54.407 --> 00:10:00.349
THAT LEAVES
YOUR VORSE RAIDER IN QUITE
A COMPROMISING POSITION.

00:10:00.349 --> 00:10:03.354
NOW, DIABOUND KERNEL,
ATTACK!

00:10:09.297 --> 00:10:11.434
NEXT, I'LL PLACE
THIS FACE DOWN.

00:10:11.434 --> 00:10:12.936
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:10:12.936 --> 00:10:15.006
NO MORE MR. NICE GUY.

00:10:15.006 --> 00:10:19.780
I PLAY THIS,
LORD OF DRAGONS!

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.085
IT'S JUST AS I PLANNED.

00:10:22.085 --> 00:10:25.089
AS LONG
AS MY LORD OF DRAGONS
IS ON THE FIELD,

00:10:25.089 --> 00:10:28.762
ANY DRAGON I PLAY
IS SAFE FROM ALL MAGIC
AND TRAP CARDS.

00:10:28.762 --> 00:10:34.337
THEREFORE,
I ACTIVATE THE FLUTE
OF SUMMONING DRAGON.

00:10:34.337 --> 00:10:36.741
WHEN BOTH OF THESE CARDS
ARE ON THE FIELD,

00:10:36.741 --> 00:10:41.850
I CAN SUMMON
ANY TWO DRAGONS
FROM MY HAND.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.351
Yami-Bakura, voice-over:
EXCELLENT.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.689
ACTUALLY,
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,

00:10:45.689 --> 00:10:48.193
THERE'S ONLY ONE DRAGON
THAT I NEED--

00:10:48.193 --> 00:10:52.099
MY BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:10:52.099 --> 00:10:54.870
Yami-Bakura, voice-over:
THAT'S JUST THE CARD
I HOPED YOU'D PLAY.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.410
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR A LITTLE STROLL
DOWN MEMORY LANE.

00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:08.191
Kaiba, voice-over:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:12.832
WHAT HAS HE DONE TO YOU,
KISARA?

00:11:12.832 --> 00:11:16.238
IN THE NAME OF THE PHARAOH,
I WILL SAVE THEE.

00:11:19.978 --> 00:11:21.145
OH, NO.

00:11:21.145 --> 00:11:22.848
IT'S THAT VISION AGAIN!

00:11:33.786 --> 00:11:36.290
MY MIND'S PLAYING TRICKS
ON ME AGAIN,

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.296
JUST LIKE WHEN
I DUELED AGAINST YUGI.

00:11:40.296 --> 00:11:42.867
NEITHER OF OUR GOD CARDS
WILL GIVE UP!

00:11:42.867 --> 00:11:43.936
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:46.439
IT MUST BE
A HOLOGRAPHIC MALFUNCTION!

00:12:03.734 --> 00:12:05.804
THIS CAN'T BE REAL!

00:12:12.548 --> 00:12:15.720
MY MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
TRANSPORTED US
TO ANOTHER PLACE--

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.556
PERHAPS ANOTHER TIME.

00:12:17.556 --> 00:12:19.792
WHAT? BUT HOW?

00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:22.297
THIS HASTA BE SOME
KIND OF AN ILLUSION.

00:12:22.297 --> 00:12:27.872
WE WERE JUST IN
THE MIDDLE OF A DUEL.

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:31.044
SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS PLACE SEEMS
FAMILIAR TO ME.

00:12:31.044 --> 00:12:34.182
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE
THAT WE'RE IN
ANCIENT EGYPT?

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:42.896
Kaiba, voice-over:
I'M NOT FALLING
FOR THAT NONSENSE.

00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:46.535
WHATEVER HAPPENED
IN THE PAST HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:48.839
KAIBA, SOMETHING WRONG?

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:53.146
ARE YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT?

00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:55.650
I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.422
NOW LET'S
GET BACK TO THE DUEL,
SHALL WE?

00:12:58.422 --> 00:13:01.760
ALL RIGHT, BLUE EYES,
DESTROY HIS DIABOUND!

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.431
WHITE LIGHTNING ATTACK!

00:13:04.431 --> 00:13:06.000
NOT SO FAST.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.607
I ACTIVATE
MY SPIRIT SHIELD!

00:13:10.607 --> 00:13:12.077
NO WAY!

00:13:12.077 --> 00:13:13.913
I'M AFRAID SO.

00:13:13.913 --> 00:13:17.752
THANKS TO MY SHIELD,
YOUR ATTACK DIDN'T GET
ANYWHERE NEAR MY DIABOUND,

00:13:17.752 --> 00:13:21.459
AND ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS EXTRACT ONE MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:23.528
AND REMOVE IT FROM PLAY.

00:13:23.528 --> 00:13:26.934
SO AS LONG
AS I CAN KEEP A FRESH SUPPLY
OF CREATURES IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:13:26.934 --> 00:13:28.903
YOUR ATTACKS ARE USELESS.

00:13:28.903 --> 00:13:32.175
IN SIMPLER TERMS,
MY LIFE POINTS
ARE UNTOUCHABLE.

00:13:32.175 --> 00:13:35.414
YEAH, MAYBE FOR NOW,
BUT THAT WON'T LAST.

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:38.919
I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:41.791
Yami-Bakura, voice-over:
SOON THE POWER OF KAIBA'S
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON

00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:45.430
WILL REST IN MY HANDS.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.871
I'LL BEGIN MY TURN
BY ACTIVATING THE MAGIC CARD
POT OF GREED.

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:53.877
THAT ALLOWS ME
TO DRAW TWO MORE CARDS
FROM MY DECK,

00:13:53.877 --> 00:13:56.548
AND ONE OF THEM
HAPPENS TO BE
GRIEF TABLET.

00:14:01.356 --> 00:14:05.162
WHAT'D YOU DO
TO MY MONSTER?

00:14:05.162 --> 00:14:07.866
YOUR LORD OF DRAGONS,
ALONG WITH ALL OF ITS POWERS,

00:14:07.866 --> 00:14:11.205
HAS BEEN SEALED AWAY
IN THAT STONE TABLET,

00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:13.642
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO SET IT FREE.

00:14:13.642 --> 00:14:15.611
YOU MUST SHATTER THE STONE.

00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:18.216
HOWEVER,
ONCE MY GRIEF TABLET
IS DESTROYED,

00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:21.053
YOU'LL RECEIVE
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:14:21.053 --> 00:14:25.060
NOW, MY DOPPELGANGER,
WEAKEN HIS DRAGON.

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:32.840
MY BLUE-EYES!

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.143
ALL RIGHT, DIABOUND,
ATTACK.

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:40.151
I ACTIVATE
ATTACK GUIDANCE ARMOR.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.731
FINE.

00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:50.367
YOU'RE SAFE FOR NOW.

00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:53.906
I'LL END MY TURN
BY PLACING TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:14:53.906 --> 00:14:57.813
IT'S ALL OVER FOR YOU.

00:14:57.813 --> 00:15:01.385
Yami-Bakura, voice-over:
I CAN SENSE YOUR FEAR, KAIBA.

00:15:01.385 --> 00:15:02.419
Kaiba, voice-over:
YOU'RE GONNA PAY

00:15:02.419 --> 00:15:04.724
FOR WHAT YOU DID
TO MOKUBA, YOU RAT.

00:15:04.724 --> 00:15:08.096
NO ONE MESSES
WITH THE KAIBA FAMILY
AND GETS AWAY WITH IT.

00:15:08.096 --> 00:15:12.537
IT'S TIME TO TURN
THIS DUEL AROUND BY
PLAYING CARD OF DEMISE.

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:15.107
IT LETS ME DRAW
4 CARDS,

00:15:15.107 --> 00:15:18.879
AND AFTER 5 TURNS
MY HAND GOES
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:22.218
ARE YOU FORGETTING
ABOUT MY SPIRIT SHIELD?

00:15:22.218 --> 00:15:24.956
NOTHING YOU DRAW
CAN DAMAGE ME.

00:15:24.956 --> 00:15:27.394
I'M AFRAID
I'M GONNA HAFTA
DISAGREE.

00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:30.131
NOW I ACTIVATE
SOUL RELEASE.

00:15:30.131 --> 00:15:32.468
YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,
DON'T YOU?

00:15:32.468 --> 00:15:36.107
I CAN REMOVE
UP TO 5 CARDS FROM
YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:15:36.107 --> 00:15:38.544
AND WITHOUT
YOUR MONSTERS
TO FUEL ITS POWER

00:15:38.544 --> 00:15:41.182
YOUR SPIRIT SHIELD
IS DESTROYED.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.659
NEXT,
I'LL USE SILENT DOOM

00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:50.496
TO BRING BACK A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:15:50.496 --> 00:15:54.570
AND I CHOOSE
VORSE RAIDER.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.176
THEN I'LL SACRIFICE
VORSE RAIDER
AND MY BLUE EYES.

00:15:58.176 --> 00:15:59.345
Kaiba, voice-over:
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:01.548
I CAN GET MY DRAGON'S
STRENGTH BACK.

00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:08.158
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON,
RETURN!

00:16:08.158 --> 00:16:09.694
SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

00:16:09.694 --> 00:16:11.731
THE MIGHTY BLUE-EYES
HAS BEEN REBORN

00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:13.935
AND I'M SUPPOSED
TO RUN IN FEAR?

00:16:13.935 --> 00:16:16.171
YOU WILL,
WHEN HE ATTACKS YOUR
LITTLE SNAKE-BOY

00:16:16.171 --> 00:16:17.707
WITH WHITE LIGHTNING!

00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:25.754
NOT BAD,

00:16:25.754 --> 00:16:29.326
BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH
TO DEFEAT ME, KAIBA.

00:16:29.326 --> 00:16:32.398
I ACTIVATE
MY MIRROR TABLET
TRAP CARD.

00:16:32.398 --> 00:16:34.768
THEN I ACTIVATE
MY REBIRTH TABLET,

00:16:34.768 --> 00:16:37.739
SO SAY HELLO
TO AN OLD FRIEND.

00:16:41.045 --> 00:16:42.814
WHAT?

00:16:42.814 --> 00:16:46.887
MY REBIRTH TABLET
WAS ACTIVATED AS SOON AS
MY DIABOUND WAS DESTROYED.

00:16:46.887 --> 00:16:50.960
THAT ALLOWED ME
TO IMMEDIATELY BRING HIM
BACK THE FIELD.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.331
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

00:16:59.207 --> 00:17:02.679
AFTER YOU SACRIFICED
YOUR BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON,

00:17:02.679 --> 00:17:06.853
MY MIRROR TABLET
WAS ABLE TO ABSORB HALF
ITS ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:06.853 --> 00:17:09.790
THEN THEY WERE
GRACIOUSLY DONATED
TO MY DIABOUND,

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.196
MAKING HIM THE STRONGEST
MONSTER ON THE FIELD.

00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:19.304
SAY FAREWELL
TO YOUR BLUE-EYES.

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.607
DIABOUND,
DESTROY HIM NOW!

00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:30.322
SORRY, BUT NO DICE.

00:17:30.322 --> 00:17:34.595
I ACTIVATE
MONSTER REBORN.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:37.333
BLUE-EYES IS BACK!

00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:38.768
Yami-Bakura, voice-over:
OH, IF HE ONLY KNEW

00:17:38.768 --> 00:17:41.706
WHAT MY DIABOUND
HAS JUST ACCOMPLISHED.

00:17:41.706 --> 00:17:43.943
BY DESTROYING HIS BLUE-EYES,

00:17:43.943 --> 00:17:47.215
IT WAS ABLE TO DUPLICATE
AND ABSORB ITS ATTACK POWER.

00:17:47.215 --> 00:17:49.552
I'D SAY MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

00:17:53.926 --> 00:17:56.831
OH, WELL,
I GUESS YOU'RE IN LUCK.

00:17:56.831 --> 00:18:01.104
YOU SEE, KAIBA,
I HAVE SOME OTHER BUSINESS
TO ATTEND TO.

00:18:01.104 --> 00:18:02.172
YOU'RE JOKING!

00:18:02.172 --> 00:18:04.342
YOU'RE LEAVING
IN THE MIDDLE OF A DUEL?

00:18:04.342 --> 00:18:06.312
TRUST ME,
I'LL RETURN SOON ENOUGH

00:18:06.312 --> 00:18:08.015
TO FINISH
WHAT I'VE STARTED.

00:18:08.015 --> 00:18:11.755
IN THE MEANTIME,
TAKE THIS.

00:18:11.755 --> 00:18:16.461
HOLD ON,
DIDN'T THIS BELONG
TO PEGASUS?

00:18:16.461 --> 00:18:17.864
WHY, YES.

00:18:17.864 --> 00:18:21.002
I BELIEVE HE ONCE USED IT
TO CAPTURE YOUR SOUL.

00:18:25.443 --> 00:18:27.613
THE MILLENNIUM EYE.

00:18:27.613 --> 00:18:29.749
EXCELLENT MEMORY, KAIBA.

00:18:29.749 --> 00:18:33.289
IT'S A WONDER
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
ABOUT YOUR ANCIENT PAST.

00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:34.858
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

00:18:34.858 --> 00:18:36.528
BRING THE MILLENNIUM EYE
TO EGYPT

00:18:36.528 --> 00:18:38.864
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
A LITTLE HISTORY LESSON.

00:18:38.864 --> 00:18:41.903
SORRY, BUT I DON'T
HAVE TIME TO RUN HALFWAY
AROUND THE WORLD

00:18:41.903 --> 00:18:43.472
CHASING A FAIRY TALE.

00:18:43.472 --> 00:18:45.642
I HAVE A COMPANY TO RUN,
REMEMBER?

00:18:45.642 --> 00:18:47.211
SO YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN LEARNING

00:18:47.211 --> 00:18:50.616
WHY YOU SHARE
SUCH A STRONG BOND
WITH YOUR BLUE-EYES?

00:18:50.616 --> 00:18:52.986
AND WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:56.258
THE ANSWER LIES
IN THE SANDS OF EGYPT, SETO.

00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:14.387
Kaiba, voice-over:
LIKE I'M GOING TO EGYPT

00:19:14.387 --> 00:19:16.525
'CAUSE SOME LUNATIC
TOLD ME TO.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.880
Woman, on PA:
ATTENTION PASSENGERS,

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.652
FLIGHT 706 FLYING
NON-STOP TO CAIRO, EGYPT,

00:19:33.652 --> 00:19:35.388
IS NOW BOARDING.

00:19:35.388 --> 00:19:37.725
HEY!
YUGI!

00:19:37.725 --> 00:19:39.529
WHAT'RE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

00:19:42.733 --> 00:19:44.235
WHADDA YA THINK,
YUGE?

00:19:44.235 --> 00:19:46.840
WE'RE ALL COMIN' TO EGYPT
WITH YA, DUDE.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.509
YOU DON'T HAFTA DO THAT.

00:19:48.509 --> 00:19:49.578
YOU KIDDIN'?

00:19:49.578 --> 00:19:50.813
WE WOULDN'T MISS DIS
FOR THE WORLD,

00:19:50.813 --> 00:19:52.750
AND BESIDES,
TEA PAID
FOR THE TICKETS.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.486
TRY "I LENT YOU
THE MONEY,"

00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:57.190
'CAUSE YOU TWO
CONVENIENTLY FORGOT
YOUR WALLETS.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.192
RIGHT.
