00:09:14.373 --> 00:09:16.543
THAT WAS EVER
CREATED, DIDN'T I?

00:09:16.543 --> 00:09:21.483
JINZO WILL NOW ATTACK DRAGON
WITH CYBER ENERGY SHOCK.

00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:28.227
DRAGON DESTROYED.

00:09:28.227 --> 00:09:29.763
YOUR MOVE.

00:09:29.763 --> 00:09:31.766

THE CARD YOU
GAVE ME!

00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:40.412
THIS WILL BRING OUT
THE TRUE STRENGTH
OF YOUR DECK.

00:09:40.412 --> 00:09:41.847
HUH?

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:43.850
Tea: WHAT'S

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.720
LET'S WATCH.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:51.629

00:09:51.629 --> 00:09:53.665

GO, HEART OF THE UNDERDOG!

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:01.912
Yugi, thinking:
I HOPE THIS WORKS!

00:10:01.912 --> 00:10:03.314
Joey: I DON'T GET IT.

00:10:03.314 --> 00:10:06.418
WHAT'S THAT DOG UNDER?

00:10:06.418 --> 00:10:09.156
IF ANYONE SHOULD
KNOW THAT CARD, IT'S YOU.

00:10:09.156 --> 00:10:11.393
THEY SHOULD JUST CALL IT
"HEART OF THE WHEELER!"

00:10:11.393 --> 00:10:12.762
YOU GO, YUGI!

00:10:12.762 --> 00:10:14.698
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:17.669
COMMENCING TURN.
DRAWING CARD.

00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:23.912
SUMMONING SINISTER SERPENT
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:10:23.912 --> 00:10:29.888
NOW JINZO
ATTACKS BABY DRAGON.

00:10:29.888 --> 00:10:35.330
SINISTER SERPENT WILL NOW
STRIKE OPPONENT DIRECTLY.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.334
UNH!

00:10:38.334 --> 00:10:40.337
TURN COMPLETE.

00:10:40.337 --> 00:10:44.878
THE TIME HAS COME...
TO END THIS DUEL.

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:50.186
NOW I ACTIVATE
THE SPECIAL ABILITY
OF HEART OF THE UNDERDOG.

00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:51.287
IF I DRAW A MONSTER
FROM MY DECK

00:10:51.287 --> 00:10:54.092
THEN I'M FREE TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD,

00:10:54.092 --> 00:10:55.560
AND IF THAT'S
A MONSTER, AS WELL,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.165
THEN THE CYCLE CONTINUES.

00:10:58.165 --> 00:11:00.735
AND NOW
FOR MY FIRST CARD.

00:11:00.735 --> 00:11:01.737
I'VE DRAWN
CURSE OF DRAGON!

00:11:01.737 --> 00:11:04.808
SO I DRAW AGAIN.

00:11:04.808 --> 00:11:07.913
KOUMORI DRAGON!

00:11:07.913 --> 00:11:10.216
WINGED DRAGON
OF THE FORTRESS!

00:11:10.216 --> 00:11:11.785
I'M NOT DONE YET!

00:11:11.785 --> 00:11:13.822
I DRAW CRAWLING DRAGON...

00:11:13.822 --> 00:11:20.332
FOLLOWED BY
BLACKLAND FIRE DRAGON!

00:11:20.332 --> 00:11:22.502
I NOW PLAY SPIRIT RYU!

00:11:22.502 --> 00:11:27.642
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:27.642 --> 00:11:28.945
NOW, SPIRIT RYU...

00:11:28.945 --> 00:11:32.517
ATTACK HIS JINZO
WITH SONIC FLASH ATTACK!

00:11:32.517 --> 00:11:34.487
[ROARS]

00:11:34.487 --> 00:11:36.256
THANKS TO ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:11:36.256 --> 00:11:38.359
THE ATTACK POWER
OF MY SPIRIT RYU

00:11:38.359 --> 00:11:40.963
INCREASES BY ONE THOUSAND
POINTS FOR EVERY DRAGON

00:11:40.963 --> 00:11:43.501
I DISCARD FROM MY HAND.

00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:45.871
AND I COUNT SIX DRAGONS.

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.274
THAT MEANS MY SPIRIT RYU
GAINS AN ADDITIONAL

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:54.184
SIX THOUSAND
ATTACK POINTS!

00:11:54.184 --> 00:11:55.786
NOW, MY SPIRIT...

00:11:55.786 --> 00:11:59.591
DESTROY HIS JINZO
AND THE REST
OF HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:11.477
GAME OVER.

00:12:11.477 --> 00:12:13.447

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.206

BUT SINCE YOU'RE

00:14:03.077 --> 00:14:07.718
SETTLE DOWN,

00:14:07.718 --> 00:14:10.822
LISTEN. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT COMPUTER.

00:14:10.822 --> 00:14:12.758
IT'S THE HACKER WHO
BROKE IN THAT'S THE WACKO.

00:14:12.758 --> 00:14:13.827
Mokuba: WHO WAS IT?

00:14:13.827 --> 00:14:15.163
I DON'T KNOW, MOKUBA.

00:14:15.163 --> 00:14:18.467
THERE'S A LONG
LIST OF SUSPECTS.

00:14:18.467 --> 00:14:20.570
AS WE'VE SEEN MANY TIMES
IN THE PAST,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.141
THE KAIBA CORPORATION HAS
ITS SHARE OF ENEMIES,

00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:24.877
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY
SURPRISE ME

00:14:24.877 --> 00:14:27.614
THAT SOMEONE'S
OUT TO SABOTAGE
MY NEW TOURNAMENT.

00:14:27.614 --> 00:14:31.487
BUT MARK MY WORDS,
THIS PUNK WILL BE
FOUND AND PUNISHED!

00:14:31.487 --> 00:14:33.123
IN THE MEANTIME,

00:14:36.862 --> 00:14:40.334
WE CAN'T AFFORD
ANY MORE UNEXPECTED
INTERRUPTIONS.

00:14:40.334 --> 00:14:42.871
THE ONLY ATTACKS
THIS WEEK SHOULD
BE IN THE KAIBADOME.

00:14:42.871 --> 00:14:45.809
YES, SIR. OF COURSE.

00:14:45.809 --> 00:14:48.179
AND ANYONE WHO'S LATE
FOR REGISTRATION
WILL BE DISQUALIFIED.

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:52.552
MOKUBA, MAKE SURE
WHEELER'S LATE.

00:14:52.552 --> 00:14:55.324
HEY! HOLD ON!

00:14:55.324 --> 00:14:57.760
I KNOW AN INSULT
WHEN I HEAR ONE!

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.064
LOOK AT ME WHEN
I'M YELLIN' AT YOU!

00:15:09.245 --> 00:15:12.350
WHOA. WHO ARE ALL
THESE PEOPLE, MOKUBA?

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.253
Mokuba: WE'RE TRYING
TO CREATE A BIG BUZZ
ABOUT THIS,

00:15:14.253 --> 00:15:17.825
SO WE INVITED EVERY
NEWSPAPER AND TV NETWORK
WE COULD THINK OF.

00:15:17.825 --> 00:15:18.826
TELL THOSE REPORTERS
SOMETHING,

00:15:18.826 --> 00:15:21.097
AND THE WHOLE WORLD
HEARS IT!

00:15:21.097 --> 00:15:23.634
HA HA! HI, WORLD.
TRISTAN HERE.

00:15:23.634 --> 00:15:25.403
NO ONE CARES!

00:15:25.403 --> 00:15:26.604

00:15:32.246 --> 00:15:35.118
CHOW TIME! WHOA!

00:15:35.118 --> 00:15:36.854

00:15:36.854 --> 00:15:38.623
OH, IS THAT RIGHT!?

00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:48.071
UH, YEAH?

00:15:48.071 --> 00:15:50.041
I KNEW IT.

00:15:50.041 --> 00:15:51.543
I'D RECOGNIZE THAT ADORABLE
SPIKY HAIR ANYWHERE!

00:15:51.543 --> 00:15:53.546
UH, THANKS.

00:15:53.546 --> 00:15:54.681

00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:55.683
BUT CALL ME VIV.

00:15:55.683 --> 00:15:58.453
AH, HI VIV.

00:15:59.655 --> 00:16:01.425
LISTEN, I KNOW ONCE
THE COMPETITION STARTS

00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:04.597
YOU AND I ARE GONNA BE
ARCHRIVALS, RIGHT?

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:05.631
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN'T BE BUDDIES

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.603
WHEN WE'RE OFF
THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:16:08.603 --> 00:16:09.604
YOU'RE A QUIET ONE,
AREN'T YOU?

00:16:09.604 --> 00:16:10.606

SCUSE ME.

00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:27.498
YOU'RE LEON, RIGHT?

00:16:27.498 --> 00:16:28.633
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:16:28.633 --> 00:16:31.671
I'M IN THE KC GRAND
CHAMPIONSHIP, TOO.

00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:32.673
WOW, YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

00:16:32.673 --> 00:16:35.176
IT'S TRUE.

00:16:35.176 --> 00:16:37.380
IN FACT...
IT'S BEEN MY DREAM

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.383
TO DUEL AGAINST YOU
EVER SINCE
DUELIST KINGDOM!

00:16:39.383 --> 00:16:45.125
WELL, YA NEVER KNOW,
IT COULD HAPPEN.

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:47.495
LET'S GET STARTED,
ROLAND.

00:16:47.495 --> 00:16:49.264
TIME IS MONEY.

00:16:49.264 --> 00:16:52.870
BUT, MR. KAIBA,
WE'RE STILL WAITING
FOR ONE MORE CHALLENGER.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.274
THEN HE'S
DISQUALIFIED!

00:16:55.274 --> 00:16:56.542
DIDN'T I MAKE

00:16:56.542 --> 00:16:58.879
UH, YES, SIR.
