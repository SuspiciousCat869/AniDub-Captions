00:08:19.356 --> 00:08:20.758
NO WAY!

00:08:20.758 --> 00:08:22.261
AS YOU CAN SEE,

00:08:22.261 --> 00:08:24.497
BRUNHILDE ESCAPED
WITHOUT A SCRATCH,

00:08:24.497 --> 00:08:26.501
THANKS TO HER
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:08:26.501 --> 00:08:27.703
AND ALL I HAD TO DO

00:08:27.703 --> 00:08:29.706
WAS LOWER
HER DEFENSE POINTS.

00:08:29.706 --> 00:08:31.843
I PLACE THIS FACEDOWN.

00:08:31.843 --> 00:08:34.214
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:36.117
ANOTHER MOVE WASTED.

00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:37.653
EVENTUALLY,
YOUR GIRLFRIEND

00:08:37.653 --> 00:08:38.688
IS GONNA RUN
OUT OF POINTS,

00:08:38.688 --> 00:08:39.757
AND WHEN SHE DOES,

00:08:39.757 --> 00:08:41.526
MY DRAGON
WILL BE WAITING.

00:08:41.526 --> 00:08:43.463
BUT BY THAT POINT,
I'LL HAVE WON.

00:08:43.463 --> 00:08:45.500
AND SPEAKING
OF WINNING...

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.939
WATCH AS I END THIS
DUEL RIGHT NOW!

00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:51.510
I SWITCH BRUNHILDE
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.646
NOW, FOR EVERY DRAGON
ON THE FIELD,

00:08:53.646 --> 00:08:57.887
HER STRENGTH
INCREASES BY 300

00:08:57.887 --> 00:08:59.456
NEXT I'LL PLAY THIS.

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.592

WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY NEW TOY?

00:09:12.411 --> 00:09:14.516
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
DON'T ANSWER THAT YET!

00:09:14.516 --> 00:09:18.856

WHAT IT CAN DO!

YEAH, BUT HOW!?

00:09:25.267 --> 00:09:27.671
NOT ONLY DOES
MY ENCHANTED SWORD

00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:29.707
REMOVE ALL DRAGONS
FROM THE GAME,

00:09:29.707 --> 00:09:31.811
IT GIVES MY
MAIDEN A BOOST!

00:09:31.811 --> 00:09:33.614
TELL ME, HERR KAIBA,

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:36.319
WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING
A WASHED UP HAS-BEEN?

00:09:36.319 --> 00:09:38.956
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

00:09:38.956 --> 00:09:40.893
ENOUGH SMALL TALK...

00:09:40.893 --> 00:09:43.398

NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO

00:09:50.242 --> 00:09:52.680
IS CUT MY VALKYRIES'
STRENGTH IN HALF!

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.883
AFTER THAT I'M AFFORDED
THE DISTINCT HONOR

00:09:54.883 --> 00:09:56.185
OF BEING ABLE TO

00:09:56.185 --> 00:09:59.725
ATTACK YOUR
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:00.793
GO AHEAD.

THAT CARD WILL
PROTECT ME!

00:10:02.997 --> 00:10:06.302
I ALREADY KNOW IDENTITY
OF YOUR FACEDOWN CARD,

00:10:06.302 --> 00:10:08.173
HERR KAIBA,
AND QUITE FRANKLY,

00:10:08.173 --> 00:10:10.076
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
MY PLAN AT ALL.

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:14.650
NOW, BRUNHILDE, ATTACK!

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.886
I'LL WEAKEN HER
WITH THIS!

00:10:16.886 --> 00:10:20.026
GO, SHRINK CARD!

00:10:20.026 --> 00:10:25.501

WEAKEN YOU!

YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:51.010
OUR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN
RIVALS FOR GENERATIONS.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.415
AND YOURS ALWAYS HAD
THE UPPER HAND.

00:10:55.417 --> 00:10:56.753

[GROWLS]

00:11:04.132 --> 00:11:07.170
Zigfried, narrating:
IT WAS HUMILIATING.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.806
IN THE SCHROEDER FAMILY,

00:11:08.806 --> 00:11:10.709
LOSING IS NOT AN OPTION.

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:14.082
SO, I DECIDED TO TAKE
MATTERS INTO MY OWN HANDS.

00:11:14.082 --> 00:11:15.618
MY GOAL WAS SIMPLE:

00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:17.788
BOOST SCHROEDER CORP
TO NUMBER ONE,

00:11:17.788 --> 00:11:23.130
AND LEAVING THE KAIBA
FAMILY IN RUINS!

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.867
BUT THAT PROVED
TO BE A TASK

00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:27.705
THAT NEITHER I NOR MY
FATHER COULD ACCOMPLISH.

00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:33.648
IN FACT, IT DROVE HIM MAD.

00:11:33.648 --> 00:11:36.887
WITH MY FATHER UNABLE
TO MAINTAIN THE COMPANY,

00:11:36.887 --> 00:11:40.126

UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT.

[BOTH GRUNT]

00:11:42.196 --> 00:11:44.901
MY FIRST ACT
AS COMPANY PRESIDENT

00:11:44.901 --> 00:11:47.438
WAS ONE OF CONTROVERSY.

00:11:47.438 --> 00:11:50.810
I DECIDED TO ENTER INTO
THE GAMING INDUSTRY--

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.116
A BUSINESS UNTAPPED
BY ANY OTHER COMPANY!

00:11:54.116 --> 00:11:55.184

00:11:55.184 --> 00:11:56.787
MR. ZIGFRIED, SIR?

00:11:56.787 --> 00:11:58.857
I'M AFRAID
THE KAIBA CORPORATION

00:11:58.857 --> 00:12:00.393
JUST MADE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:12:00.393 --> 00:12:03.398
THEY'VE CONVERTED
THEIR COMPANY AS WELL.

00:12:03.398 --> 00:12:05.702

[GASPS]

00:12:06.704 --> 00:12:08.740
THAT IS A LIE!

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.245
Narrating: UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WAS ALL TRUE!

00:12:11.245 --> 00:12:12.647
SO FROM THAT MOMENT ON,

00:12:12.647 --> 00:12:15.452
I DEVOTED ALL OF MY TIME
TO GAME DEVELOPMENT!

00:12:15.452 --> 00:12:16.688
AND ONE DAY...

00:12:16.688 --> 00:12:17.755
IT HAPPENED!

00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:20.226

A LANDMARK INVENTION

HOWEVER, MY EXCITEMENT
WAS SHORT-LIVED.

00:12:30.243 --> 00:12:33.983
SOMEHOW, YOU MANAGED
TO STEAL MY INVENTION

00:12:33.983 --> 00:12:35.786
AND TAKE ALL THE CREDIT,

00:12:35.786 --> 00:12:38.491

BE TRUE?

00:15:29.479 --> 00:15:32.617
THAT LETS ME DRAW
TWO CARDS FROM MY DECK.

00:15:32.617 --> 00:15:36.791
NEXT, I'LL ACTIVATE
MY MAGICAL ALMS CARD!

00:15:36.791 --> 00:15:38.327
THE FIRST THING
THIS DOES

00:15:38.327 --> 00:15:42.467
IS RAISE MY
LIFE POINTS
BY 1,000!

00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:44.671
NEXT, WE HAVE
TO PREDICT HOW MANY

00:15:44.671 --> 00:15:47.309
MAGIC CARDS WE THINK
WE'LL USE EACH TURN.

00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:49.278
AND EACH OF US WILL
AUTOMATICALLY GAIN

00:15:49.278 --> 00:15:51.683
500 LIFE POINTS
FOR EACH CARD.

00:15:51.683 --> 00:15:54.087
BUT IF YOU USE FEWER THAN
THE NUMBER YOU GUESS,

00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:57.392
YOU LOSE 1,000
LIFE POINTS PER CARD!

00:15:57.392 --> 00:16:00.764
WHICH MEANS ONE
MISTAKE AND YOU'RE
THROUGH, HERR KAIBA!

00:16:05.572 --> 00:16:08.109
NOW, I'LL PLAY
FINAL LIGHT!

00:16:08.109 --> 00:16:11.013
AND I PREDICT THAT'S
THE ONLY MAGIC CARD

00:16:11.013 --> 00:16:13.017
I'LL ACTIVATE
DURING THIS TURN.

00:16:13.017 --> 00:16:16.089
NOW, FOR THE COST OF
A MERE 1,000 LIFE POINTS

00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:19.862
I'M ABLE TO
SUMMON A MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:16:19.862 --> 00:16:23.468
AND I CHOOSE
VALKYRIE BRUNHILDE!

00:16:23.468 --> 00:16:25.973
OF COURSE, YOU
ARE ALSO PERMITTED

00:16:25.973 --> 00:16:28.476
TO SUMMON A MONSTER
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD,

00:16:28.476 --> 00:16:30.212
SO, LET'S HAVE IT!

00:16:30.212 --> 00:16:31.816
THEN I CHOOSE...

00:16:31.816 --> 00:16:35.889
MY CAVE DRAGON!

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:38.193
WHY, THANK YOU,
HERR KAIBA.

00:16:38.193 --> 00:16:40.396
YOUR DRAGON
GIVES MY VALKYRIE

00:16:40.396 --> 00:16:43.067
AN EXTRA 300
ATTACK POINTS!

00:16:43.067 --> 00:16:45.305
AND NOW, MY DEAREST
BRUNHILDE,

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:48.677
ATTACK HIS CAVE DRAGON!

00:16:48.677 --> 00:16:53.853
[SCREAMING]

00:16:53.853 --> 00:16:57.659
NOW, HOW MANY MAGIC CARDS
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL USE?

00:16:57.659 --> 00:17:00.197
YOU CAN'T AFFORD
TO GUESS WRONG!

00:17:00.197 --> 00:17:02.033
I WON'T!

00:17:02.033 --> 00:17:05.439
I PREDICT I'LL USE 4
MAGIC CARDS THIS TURN!

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:06.540
4 CARDS!?

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.642
DON'T YOU REALIZE

00:17:07.642 --> 00:17:09.646
YOU'RE ONLY HOLDING ONE
CARD IN YOUR HAND?

00:17:09.646 --> 00:17:11.049
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:17:11.049 --> 00:17:14.754
BUT THAT'S ALL ABOUT
TO CHANGE, ZIGFRIED!

00:17:14.754 --> 00:17:15.823
NO!

00:17:15.823 --> 00:17:17.492
YOU HAVE TO
BE BLUFFING!

00:17:17.492 --> 00:17:19.095
LET'S FIND OUT.

00:17:19.095 --> 00:17:20.531
FIRST...

00:17:20.531 --> 00:17:23.502
I ACTIVATE MY
CARD OF DEMISE!

00:17:23.502 --> 00:17:26.040
THIS LET'S ME DRAW TILL
I'M HOLDING 5 CARDS!

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.176
AND IN 5 TURNS...

00:17:27.176 --> 00:17:29.246
I DISCARD MY
ENTIRE HAND!

00:17:29.246 --> 00:17:32.117
OH, NO!

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:34.421
AND NEXT, I PLAY...

00:17:34.421 --> 00:17:37.360
ANOTHER MAGIC CARD--
SOUL RELEASE!

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.796
NOW I CAN CHOOSE A CARD
FROM THE GRAVEYARD

00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:42.101
TO REMOVE FROM THE GAME!

00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:43.670
AND I CHOOSE...

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.475
MY CHAOS EMPEROR DRAGON!

00:17:46.475 --> 00:17:48.177
THEN, I'LL PLAY...

00:17:48.177 --> 00:17:51.516
MY THIRD MAGIC CARD--
SPELL REPRODUCTION!

00:17:51.516 --> 00:17:54.021
THIS LETS ME SEND
TWO MAGIC CARDS

00:17:54.021 --> 00:17:57.794
TO MY GRAVEYARD IN ORDER
TO BRING BACK ONE!

00:17:57.794 --> 00:18:00.231
Zigfried:
NO! YOU CAN'T!

00:18:00.231 --> 00:18:02.000
I JUST DID!

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.638
SO, AT A COST OF
2,000 LIFE POINTS,

00:18:04.638 --> 00:18:09.480
I PLAY DIMENSION FUSION!

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.083
NOW, EACH OF US
CAN BRING BACK

00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:12.485
ANY OF OUR MONSTERS

00:18:12.485 --> 00:18:16.626
THAT HAVE BEEN REMOVED
FROM THE GAME!

00:18:16.626 --> 00:18:22.536
[ROARING]

00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:28.144
THAT GIVES ME
5 DRAGONS!

00:18:28.144 --> 00:18:29.380
HOW FOOLISH!

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.515
DON'T YOU
REMEMBER THAT

00:18:30.515 --> 00:18:32.720
FOR EVERY DRAGON
MONSTER ON THE FIELD,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.856
MY VALKYRIE
BRUNHILDE GAINS

00:18:34.856 --> 00:18:37.994
300 EXTRA
ATTACK POINTS!?

00:18:37.994 --> 00:18:41.801
LUSTER DRAGON NUMBER TWO,
ATTACK HIS VALKYRIE NOW!

00:18:41.801 --> 00:18:43.804
[ROARS]

00:18:51.217 --> 00:18:52.319
OH, MAN!

00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:53.321
WHY'D HE DO THAT?!

00:18:53.321 --> 00:18:54.422
SETO!

00:18:54.422 --> 00:18:58.562
YOU'VE GIVEN UP,
HAVEN'T YOU!?

00:18:58.562 --> 00:19:01.000
LOOK, WITH ONE LESS
DRAGON ON THE FIELD,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.970
HIS VALKYRIE'S
POINTS DROPPED!

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.374
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR MY CHAOS DRAGON

00:19:05.374 --> 00:19:07.411
TO ATTACK YOUR VALKYRIE!

00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:13.320
[ROARS]

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.823
REMEMBER?

00:19:14.823 --> 00:19:17.027
BRUNHILDE HAS
A SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:19:17.027 --> 00:19:19.632
BY LOWERING
HER DEFENSE
POINTS BY 1,000,

00:19:19.632 --> 00:19:21.101
AND SHE BECOMES
INVINCIBLE.

00:19:21.101 --> 00:19:23.604
NOW, BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON...

00:19:23.604 --> 00:19:25.809
IT'S YOUR TURN
TO ATTACK HER!

00:19:25.809 --> 00:19:27.411
WHITE LIGHTNING!

00:19:37.028 --> 00:19:42.938
[GROWLS]

00:19:42.938 --> 00:19:45.742
WHICH MEANS MY SECOND
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON

00:19:45.742 --> 00:19:48.213
CAN WIPE HER OUT NOW!

00:19:48.213 --> 00:19:54.156
[ROAR]

00:19:54.156 --> 00:19:55.425
NO!

00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:58.396
NOW I'M COMPLETELY
DEFENSELESS!

00:19:58.396 --> 00:20:00.367
I'M GLAD YOU
CAME HERE...

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:01.669
BECAUSE NOW
I GET A CHANCE

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:04.206
TO PUBLICLY
HUMILIATE YOU AGAIN!

00:20:04.206 --> 00:20:09.182
NOW TAKE IT AWAY,
BLUE-EYES!

00:20:09.182 --> 00:20:13.188
[SNARLS]

00:20:13.188 --> 00:20:14.725
NO! NO!

00:20:14.725 --> 00:20:17.963
[GROANS]

00:20:17.963 --> 00:20:21.369
[WHIMPERS]

00:20:21.369 --> 00:20:24.307
THIS ISN'T OVER!

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:25.709
[GROWLS]

00:20:25.709 --> 00:20:27.145
TRUST ME.

00:20:27.145 --> 00:20:29.716
LOOK, FACE THE FACTS,
ZIGFRIED.

00:20:29.716 --> 00:20:31.753
YOUR LIFE POINTS
HIT ZERO.

00:20:31.753 --> 00:20:33.757
THAT'S ABOUT
AS OVER AS IT GETS!

00:20:33.757 --> 00:20:36.427
SO TAKE WHAT LITTLE
DIGNITY YOU HAVE LEFT...

00:20:36.427 --> 00:20:37.829
AND GET LOST!

00:20:37.829 --> 00:20:38.932
OH, YEAH!

00:20:38.932 --> 00:20:40.167
YOU TELL HIM!

00:20:40.167 --> 00:20:41.597
HE'S HISTORY!

00:20:41.597 --> 00:20:42.764
LET'S HOPE SO.

00:20:42.764 --> 00:20:47.069
[LAUGHS]
