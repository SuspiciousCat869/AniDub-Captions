THE WINNER OF THIS DUEL
IS LEON WILSON!

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.489
ANY PARTICULAR REASON
FOR THIS?

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.458

THAT GUY?

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:02.322
HE WEASELED HIS WAY
INTO THIS TOURNAMENT

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:04.758
JUST TO PUBLICLY
HUMILIATE KAIBA.

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:06.393
Leon:
WELL, HE DID HAVE
HIS REASONS.

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:09.529
YEAH BUT WHEN HE
STARTED ENDANGERING
PEOPLES' LIVES...

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.331
ZIGFRIED STEPPED
OVER THE LINE!

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.667
DO YOU GUYS THINK
ALL THAT STUFF

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:15.002
ABOUT KAIBA STEALING
ZIGFRIED'S INVENTION IS TRUE?

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:18.271
I MEAN HE SEEMED
PRETTY BITTER.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.140
HEY.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.708
WHATTA YOU THINK
OF ALL THIS?

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.845
Yami-Yugi:
KAIBA MAY BE COMPETITIVE,
BUT HE'S NOT A THIEF.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:30.684
HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE A RESULT
OF HIS DRIVE AND DETERMINATION.

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:33.353
BUT ZIGFRIED HAS BEEN BLINDED
BY HIS OWN JEALOUSY.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:36.289
HE SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE
TRYING TO OUTDO KAIBA,

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.793
BUT HE WAS ALWAYS
ONE STEP BEHIND.

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:41.161
HEY!

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.996
SETO, WAIT!

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.365
AWESOME DUELING
OUT THERE BRO!

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.768
HOPEFULLY DEFEATING
THAT WANNABE

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:49.970
SENT THE MESSAGE TO THE
REST OF OUR COMPETITORS

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.906
THAT KAIBACORP
IS NOT A COMPANY
TO BE MESSED WITH.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:56.443
BECAUSE NEXT TIME
I'M NOT GONNA BE
SO FRIENDLY.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:57.911
ROLAND...

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.446

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:02.616
ANNOUNCE THE START
OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP
MATCH-UP.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.017
SIR!?

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.820
SHALL I HAVE SECURITY REMOVE
ZIGFRIED FROM THE PARK?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.355
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:11.091
I WANT HIM TO SEE
WHAT HE MISSED OUT ON,

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:15.796
SO GIVE HIM A GOOD SEAT
FOR THE NEXT DUEL.

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:16.797
AH FUNNY.

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:18.198
WAIT UP!

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.368

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:52.532
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:04.611
THE CHAMPIONSHIP BOUT IS ABOUT

BLUE-EYES FORTRESS!

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.680

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:46.573
Roland: A MAN WITHOUT WHOM
NONE OF THIS COULD TAKE PLACE.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:50.277
THE HOST OF THE KC GRAND
CHAMPIONSHIP TOURNAMENT--

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:53.246
MR. SETO KAIBA!

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.583
LEAVE IT TO KAIBA TO MAKE
THIS WHOLE TOURNAMENT
ALL ABOUT HIM!

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.185
WELL HE DID ORGANIZE IT,
AND PAY FOR IT

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:01.187
AND BUILD THE THEME PARK
TO HOST IT

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:03.857
SO I'D SAY
IT IS ALL ABOUT HIM.

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.659
YEAH IN FACT NOW
THAT I THINK OF IT

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.628
THE ONLY THING THAT
KAIBA DIDN'T DO IN
THIS TOURNAMENT IS DUEL.

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:10.497
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:13.967
AND LEMME TELL YA HE WANTED TO
PARTICIPATE IN THIS TOURNAMENT
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:18.238
BUT HE WAS TOO BUSY OPENING
KAIBA LAND IMPROVING OUR
COMPANY'S IMAGE.

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:21.374
HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO REALLY
DESERVES TO FACE YUGI.

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:23.410
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF I'D
GO DAT FAR MOKUBA.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.178

THE TITLE-SHOT!

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:36.156

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:38.258
HE WOULDA BLOWN YOU ALL AWAY!

00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:43.296
THE KC GRAND CHAMPIONSHIP

WITH ONE THING IN MIND!

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:45.765

NOW!

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:29.743
I'LL BEGIN BY ACTIVATING
A MAGIC CARD KNOWN
AS POLYMERIZATION!

00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:32.812
AND I'LL USE IT TO
FUSE TWO OF MY MONSTERS
TOGETHER.

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:01.708
Leon: YOU THINK THIS
IS ALL A BIG JOKE!?

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:07.147
I'VE WAITED MY ENTIRE LIFE
FOR THE CHANCE TO FACE OFF
AGAINST YUGI!

00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:11.818
SO YOU MIGHT SAY I'M NOT
TAKING THIS DUEL TOO LIGHTLY
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!

00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:13.953
I'M HERE TO WIN AND WIN BIG!

BUT ISN'T DAT LITTLE
RED RIDING HOOD!?

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:33.339
I GUESS LEON

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:35.742
Rebecca: TRUST ME YOU GUYS
DON'T EVEN KNOW THE HALF OF IT!

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.677
WELL HOW TOUGH
CAN THEY BE?

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:41.581
LET'S JUST SAY THEY'RE NOT
THE SWEET LITTLE CHARACTERS

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.882
Leon: MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:09:42.882 --> 00:09:47.053
SPEAKING OF NOT BEING SWEET,
WHAT'S UP WITH LEON?

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:50.156
YEAH, EVER SINCE THIS
DUEL STARTED, HE'S BEEN
ACTING LIKE A JERK!

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:52.692
Kaiba: FOR ONCE I AGREE
WITH YOU DORKS.

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:56.930
I'VE BEEN WATCHING
THE COMPETITORS CLOSELY
SINCE THE TOURNAMENT BEGAN,

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:01.534
AND SOMETHING DEFINITELY
SEEMS DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT KID.

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:04.204
AND I DON'T TRUST HIM.

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:07.974
Yugi:
PHARAOH...ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:09.876
SOMETHING WRONG?

00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:13.480
IT'S JUST THAT LEON
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ACTING
LIKE HIMSELF OUT THERE.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.616
YES HE DOES SEEM A BIT
ANGRY TO SAY THE LEAST.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.418
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED?

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:20.186
YA THINK THE PRESSURE
IS GETTING TO HIM?

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.222
I DON'T KNOW YUGI.

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:24.891
BUT NOW THE DUEL
MUST GO ON!

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:27.026
OH NO!!!!

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:31.197
ARGH!

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:33.032
HOW COULD I MISS IT?!

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:36.202
MR. KAIBA'S GONNA GO BALLISTIC
WHEN HE HEARS THIS!!

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:45.178
[ROARING]

00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:46.346
ALRIGHT!

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:49.582
I SUMMON OBNOXIOUS
CELTIC GUARDIAN!

00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:58.424
ATTACK LITTLE
RED RIDING HOOD WITH
CELTIC BLADE SLASH!

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.735
NICE ONE YUGI!

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:10.637
I NEVER LIKED THAT STORY
ANYWAY!

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:14.340
THESE FAIRY TALE FREAKS
ARE NOTHIN' COMPARED TO
YUGI'S MONSTERS!

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.776
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE
OF THAT, JOEY.

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:21.147
EVERY ONE OF LEON'S MONSTERS
COMES WITH AN ANNOYING
LITTLE TWIST.

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:24.284
Leon: NOW FOR LITTLE
RED RIDING HOOD'S
LITTLE TWIST!

00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:26.486
ONCE SHE'S DESTROYED,

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:31.057
I'M ALLOWED TO TRANSFER ANY
LEVEL-FOUR WARRIOR MONSTER FROM
MY DECK DIRECTLY TO THE FIELD!

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:32.926
SO WATCH THIS!

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:37.096
I SUMMON MY FOREST HUNTER
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:40.633
LIKE MOST OF MY MONSTERS
FOREST HUNTER COMES WITH
A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:45.138
AND HIS LETS HIM REMOVE ONE
BEAST OR BEAST-WARRIOR MONSTER
FROM THE GAME

00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:47.273
BEFORE HE EVEN ATTACKS YOU!

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:48.708
BUT THAT MEANS--

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.076
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:51.277
FOREST HUNTER...!

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.479
ELIMINATE CHIMERA!

00:11:57.417 --> 00:11:58.785
FIRE!

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.192
YUGI!

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:07.560
I'M TELLIN' YOU GUYS

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.329
LEON PULLED OUT
ALL THESE WEIRD TRICKS

00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:11.531
WHEN HE DUELED
AGAINST ME, ALSO!

00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:15.435
BUT I WILL SAY HE DEFINITELY
SEEMED TO BE HAVING MORE FUN
THAN HE IS RIGHT NOW.

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:17.136
BUT WHAT CHANGED?

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:19.772
HE'S DUELING FOR THE
CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE NOW.

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:21.708
BEING NERVOUS ABOUT A BIG DUEL
IS ONE THING

00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:24.444
BUT ACTING LIKE A TOTAL CREEP
IS ANOTHER!

00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:26.779
LEON SAID HE'S BEEN WAITING
TO DUEL YUGI FOR YEARS

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:30.583
SO YOU'D THINK HE'D AT LEAST
CRACK A SMILE OUT THERE!

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.019
AND WITH THAT
I SHALL END MY TURN.

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:35.154
YA KNOW SOMETHING YUGI?

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:37.323
EVER SINCE
I FIRST SAW YOU DUEL

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:39.125
YOU'VE BEEN LIKE
A ROLE MODEL TO ME.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.427
AND I DREAMED ABOUT
ONE DAY FACING YOU.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:45.665
AND NOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING...
I CAN'T EVEN ENJOY MYSELF!

00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:47.667
'CAUSE I HAVE A JOB TO DO!

00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:49.736
WHAT'S HE
TALKING ABOUT!?

00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:51.638
MR. KAIBA!

00:12:51.638 --> 00:12:53.840
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS, SIR!

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.743
SOMETHING WAS FISHY
IN LEON'S PROFILE,

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:59.379
SO I RAN ANOTHER
BACKGROUND CHECK!

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:00.913
TELL ME THIS IS
SOME KIND OF A JOKE!

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:04.284
Zigfried: I'M AFRAID
IT'S TRUE HERR KAIBA.

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:08.221
SO THIS IS THE FINAL PART
OF YOUR TWISTED PLAN?

00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:11.124
YES, AND IT TOOK YOU
LONG ENOUGH TO FIGURE
IT OUT.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:14.093
THROWING AWAY YOUR OWN LIFE
WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:16.562
SO YOU HAD TO DRAG YOUR OWN
BROTHER DOWN WITH YOU!?

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:17.997
[COLLECTIVE GASP]

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:20.300
IT'S ALL TRUE.
EVERY WORD.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.403
LEON WILSON IS,
IN REALITY,
MY YOUNGER BROTHER!

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:26.472
LEON VON SCHROEDER!

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:29.175
THE CAT IS OUT OF
THE BAG, LEON!

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:31.044
IT'S TIME TO REVEAL
THE REAL REASON

00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:32.478
YOU ENTERED
THIS TOURNAMENT!

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.547
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
BIG BRO!

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:36.683
Joey:
WAIT, SO THESE TWO
ARE BROTHERS?

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:38.184
Tea: PAY ATTENTION JOEY!

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:40.320
THIS IS INSANE!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.991
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS MAKE YOU
BELIEVE THAT I WAS THE REAL
THREAT IN THIS TOURNAMENT.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:48.861
YOU WERE SO INTENT ON
STOPPING ME THAT YOU WERE
BLINDED FROM THE TRUTH.

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:54.267
SO WHILE YOU WERE FOOLISHLY
EXHAUSTING YOUR RESOURCES TRYING
TO UNCOVER THE TRUTH ABOUT ME,

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:59.505
MY BROTHER WAS QUIETLY CLIMBING
THE RANKS OF THIS COMPETITION
VIRTUALLY UNOPPOSED!

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.909
AND NOW A VON SCHROEDER
IS ABOUT TO WIN IT ALL!

00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:07.914
YOUR BIGGEST RIVAL IS ABOUT TO
REIGN VICTORIOUS IN YOUR OWN
TOURNAMENT HERR KAIBA!

00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:09.982
AND THE TIMING
COULDN'T BE BETTER

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:13.720
SINCE SCHROEDER CORP
IS ABOUT TO RELEASE
OUR NEW GAMING SYSTEM.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.690
JUST IMAGINE THE PUBLICITY
MY NEW GAME WILL GET!

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.626
WHEN MY BROTHER DEFEATS
THE KING OF GAMES HIMSELF!

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:25.998
YOU MEAN YOU SABOTAGED
MY TOURNAMENT JUST TO SELL
A FEW LOUSY GAMES?

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:29.902
IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO
KNOWS ABOUT LOUSY GAMES,
IT'S YOU, HERR KAIBA.

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:32.238
YOU'VE HAD YOUR MOMENT
AT THE TOP

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:34.440
SO NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO STEP ASIDE.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.577
AND AS SOON AS MY BROTHER
IS CROWNED WORLD CHAMPION

00:14:37.577 --> 00:14:40.179
THE NEW AGE OF SCHROEDER
CORP WILL BEGIN!

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:42.181
THIS DUEL'S NOT OVER
YET ZIG-FREAK!

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.350
N' YUGI WON'T LOSE!

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.686
Roland: SHOULD I STOP THE DUEL,
MR. KAIBA?

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:49.155
IF YOU DISQUALIFY
LEON NOW

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:51.190
YOU'LL BE BREAKING THE RULES
OF YOUR OWN COMPETITION.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.860
DUELS IN PROGRESS
CAN'T BE STOPPED.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.763
PLUS IF YOU PULL THE PLUG
BEFORE A CHAMPION IS NAMED,

00:14:56.763 --> 00:15:00.933
THEN YOUR ENTIRE TOURNAMENT
WAS NOTHING MORE THAN
A GIANT WASTE OF TIME!

00:15:00.933 --> 00:15:03.369
BUT THAT'S ONLY
ONE MAN'S OPINION.

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:04.570
YOU DO WHAT YOU THINK
IS RIGHT.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.874
HA HA HA!

00:15:07.874 --> 00:15:11.411
THERE'S A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH YOUR PLAN, ZIGFRIED.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:14.080
THERE'S ONLY ONE DUELIST
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.949
WHO'S TALENTED ENOUGH
TO DEFEAT YUGI AND THAT'S ME!

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:20.787
AND AS I SEE IT YOUR PLAN
ONLY WORKS IF HE LOSES.

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:23.723
BUT THEN AGAIN, I GUESS THAT'S
ONLY "ONE MAN'S OPINION"

00:15:23.723 --> 00:15:25.792
ISN'T IT ZIGFRIED?

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:28.728
SO I'D SAY YOUR BROTHER HAS
AS MUCH OF A SHOT OF WINNING

00:15:28.728 --> 00:15:31.564
AS YOUR COMPANY DOES
OF EVER SUCCEEDING!

00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:34.300
Tristan: WHOA,
NOW THAT WAS PRETTY LOW.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.334
HE DESERVES IT!

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.803
YEAH NO MERCY!

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:41.140
Kaiba: THIS CHAMPIONSHIP DUEL
WILL NOW CONTINUE AS SCHEDULED!

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.944
AND MAY THE BEST DUELIST WIN!

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:48.614
I NEVER EXPECTED ANYONE
TO DEFEAT YOU IN THIS
TOURNAMENT, YUGI.

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:51.784
THAT HONOR WILL BELONG TO ME.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.586
ALRIGHT LEON!

00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:56.255
IT IS TIME
TO PROVE YOUR WORTH
AS A VON SCHROEDER

00:15:56.255 --> 00:16:00.193
AND CRUSH YUGI MUTO
JUST LIKE WE REHEARSED
IT A THOUSAND TIMES!

00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:03.996
Joey: SHEESH...WHO KNEW ZIGGY
WAS SUCH A STAGE MOM?

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:06.566
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN BRO.

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:08.835
LET'S GET BACK TO
BUSINESS, SHALL WE!?

00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:10.536
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.939
THAT MEANS EVERYTHING
LEON SAID TO US

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:16.175
ABOUT HIS DREAMS OF BECOMING
A CHAMPION DUELIST
WAS ONE BIG LIE!

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:18.177
I'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF THIS.

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:22.248
TELL ME LEON, ARE YOU REALLY
HERE TO DESTROY KAIBACORP?

00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:25.117
OR ARE YOU LETTING YOUR BROTHER
CONTROL WHO YOU ARE!?

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:27.687
THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE!

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.925
Zigfried:
LISTEN LEON!

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.694
DON'T LET THESE DO-GOODERS
TURN YOU AGAINST ME!

00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:37.864
THEY WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND
WHAT OUR FAMILY
HAS BEEN THROUGH!

00:16:37.864 --> 00:16:40.600
NOW GO AHEAD AND CRUSH
YUGI MUTO

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.804
SO YOU CAN OBTAIN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE
YOU SO RIGHTFULLY DESERVE!

00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:47.340
IT'S YOUR DUTY
AS A SCHROEDER!

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.474
I KNOW.

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:49.575
HOLD ON!

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:50.810
SAVE IT!

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.346
MY BROTHER'S RIGHT--
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT!

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:56.716
TRUST ME I KNOW WHAT YOU
WERE JUST ABOUT TO SAY YUGI.

00:16:56.716 --> 00:16:59.418
THAT DUELING IN ORDER TO GET
REVENGE IS WRONG!

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:02.188
BUT MY BROTHER NEVER ASKED
FOR MY HELP BEFORE

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:04.390
AND NOW
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER
HE NEEDS ME!

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.192
I'M SORRY.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.227
BUT I CAN'T
LET HIM DOWN.

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:13.466
EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER,
ZIGFRIED WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT
MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY.

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:15.535
HEY ZIGGY!

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:19.138
CHECK OUT THIS NEW FAIRY TALE
BOOK I JUST GOT!

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:21.474
DON'T BOTHER
YOUR BROTHER, LEON!

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:24.277
IT'S TIME FOR
HIS LESSONS NOW AND
HE MUST CONCENTRATE.

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:27.880
NOW REMEMBER ZIGFRIED,
YOU MUST STUDY VERY HARD!

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.516
YOUR FATHER CAN'T RUN
SCHROEDER CORP FOREVER

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:34.320
AND SOMEDAY
OUR FAMILY BUSINESS
WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.122
AS FOR YOU...

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:39.792
SEE TO IT THAT YOUR
BROTHER ISN'T DISTRACTED
BY ALL OF YOUR NOISE.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:43.663
I PROMISE I WON'T MAKE
A PEEP.

00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:49.068
WITH EVERYONE'S ATTENTION
FOCUSED ON ZIGFRIED, I WAS
PRETTY MUCH FORGOTTEN ABOUT.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.671
SO I LEARNED
TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF.

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:54.073
I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME
READING FAIRY TALES.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.508
IT WAS FUN,

00:17:55.508 --> 00:17:58.010
BUT PART OF ME STILL WISHED
THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:03.049
TO HELP MY FAMILY...
JUST LIKE ZIGFRIED.

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:05.651
THEN I DISCOVERED
THE GAME OF DUEL MONSTERS.

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:08.521
AND MY LIFE
WAS NEVER THE SAME.

00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:10.456
I PLAY...THIS!

00:18:18.731 --> 00:18:22.234
I GUESS I JUST HAD
A KNACK FOR DUELING.

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:25.738
MC: AND THE WINNER IS...
LEON WILSON!

00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:30.509
Leon: I CHANGED MY NAME
SO MY FAMILY WOULDN'T FIND OUT.

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.012
NICE DUELING.

00:18:33.012 --> 00:18:34.847
YOU FOUND ME!

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:36.349
ARE YOU MAD?

00:18:36.349 --> 00:18:37.883
OF COURSE NOT,

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:40.720
I CAME TO CONGRATULATE YOU
ON YOUR LATEST VICTORY.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.156
LOOK AT YOU HACKING INTO
TOURNAMENT COMPUTER SYSTEMS

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:47.360
AND CREATING PHONY IDENTITIES
LIKE A LITTLE SECRET AGENT.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.862
WHO KNEW YOU WERE
SO DEVIOUS?

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.764
DON'T TELL MOM AND DAD!

00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:54.767
YOU KNOW THERE'S NO WAY
THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND
ZIGFRIED!

00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:58.337
BUT I LOVE DUELING MORE
THAN ANYTHING SO I DID
WHATEVER IT TOOK.

00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:01.540
THERE'S NO NEED TO EXPLAIN
YOURSELF TO ME.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:07.146
I'M JUST GLAD THAT I'M
FINALLY GETTING THE CHANCE TO
BOND WITH MY LITTLE BROTHER.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.115
LET ME REPHRASE.

00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:13.285
MY TALENTED LITTLE BROTHER
WHO SEEMS TO POSSESS ALL
SORTS OF HIDDEN ABILITIES.

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:18.290
ABILITIES HE SHOULD BE USING
TO HELP HIS BIG BROTHER
RUN THEIR FAMILY BUSINESS.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.592
YOU NEED ME!?

00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:20.793
YOU MEAN IT!?

00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:22.728
LEON.

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:26.499
YOU HAVE A GIFT THAT COULD
HELP THRUST SCHROEDER CORP
STRAIGHT UP TO NUMBER ONE!

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.634
JUST TELL ME WHATEVER
YOU NEED ZIGFRIED!

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:32.138
I'LL DO ANYTHING TO BE A
PART OF OUR FAMILY AGAIN!

00:19:32.138 --> 00:19:36.442
ANYTHING!

00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:39.712
I PROMISE YOU'LL NEVER
BE ALONE AGAIN.

00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:43.182
SEE YUGI...I'M NOT JUST
FIGHTING FOR MYSELF

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.217
I'M FIGHTING FOR
MY WHOLE FAMILY!

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:48.154
NOW LET'S DUEL!

00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:51.691
SO LEON WAS BRAINWASHED
INTO DUELING US!?

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:55.628
HE SHOULD PLAY FOR HIS LOVE
OF THE GAME NOT HIS
FAMILY'S VENGEANCE!

00:19:55.628 --> 00:19:57.730
DEEP DOWN HE KNOWS
THAT TOO.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.598
I BELIEVE IT'S MY TURN!

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:02.802
SOOO...I'LL START THINGS OFF
BY SUMMONING THIS CARD!

00:20:02.802 --> 00:20:04.804
IRON HANS!

00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:07.606
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL
'CAUSE ONCE THIS MONSTER'S
ON THE FIELD,

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:12.745
IT ALLOWS ME TO AUTOMATICALLY
SUMMON MY IRON KNIGHT AS WELL!

00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:14.613
GET READY TO STEP DOWN.

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:19.485
'CAUSE THERE'S A NEW CHAMPION
IN TOWN AND HIS NAME IS
LEON VON SCHROEDER!

00:20:19.485 --> 00:20:22.621
NOW I SUMMON MY IRON KNIGHT!

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:31.697
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
LET ME DOWN LEON.

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:35.868
I WIN!

00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:39.672
[GASPS]

00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:42.608
YOU HAVE ONE MONSTER
AND I HAVE THREE!

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:47.313

YOUR FORMER TITLE WILL
BELONG TO SCHROEDER CORP!
