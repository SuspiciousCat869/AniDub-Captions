TO A "PRESCHOOLER"?

00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:33.218
[THINKING]
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO
BE RUNNING SMOOTHLY.

00:08:33.218 --> 00:08:35.423
BUT THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME.

00:08:35.423 --> 00:08:41.132
I WOULD'VE EXPECTED
MY LITTLE HACKER FRIEND
TO STRIKE AGAIN BY NOW.

00:08:41.132 --> 00:08:45.006
UNLESS...HE'S ALREADY
IN KAIBALAND!

00:08:45.006 --> 00:08:47.410
ROLAND, RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK
OF EVERY COMPETITOR...

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.646
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

00:08:48.646 --> 00:08:50.248
Roland: YES, SIR!

00:08:50.248 --> 00:08:55.056
UNTIL THEN, EVERYONE
IS A SUSPECT.

00:08:55.056 --> 00:08:58.296
ALRIGHT...I'M THROUGH
GOIN' EASY ON YOU!

00:08:58.296 --> 00:09:00.433
IT'S "GO TIME" NOW!

00:09:00.433 --> 00:09:02.570
SO WIPE THAT SMILE
OFF YOUR FACE!

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.440
OR ELSE I WILL!

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.748
LOOK OUT!

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:12.554
THERE APPEARS TO BE
SOME NASTY WEATHER
UP AHEAD.

00:09:12.554 --> 00:09:16.193
YOU'RE NOT SCARED
OF A LITTLE RAIN...
ARE YOU, KID?

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:19.466
'CAUSE I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
MYSTICAL SPACE TYPHOON!

00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:21.636
TOUGH BREAK.

00:09:21.636 --> 00:09:23.540
NOW YOUR TRAP
GOES BYE BYE.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.347
LATER, GRAVITY BIND!

00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:29.183
OH, NO! NOW VIVIAN
CAN ATTACK

00:09:29.183 --> 00:09:32.055
WITH ALL HER
POWERFUL MONSTERS!

00:09:32.055 --> 00:09:34.159
ACTIVATE
FACEDOWN CARD!

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:36.730
IMPERIAL ORDER!

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.635
AS LONG AS THIS TRAP
REMAINS ON MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD,

00:09:39.635 --> 00:09:42.406
YOUR MAGIC CARDS
ARE USELESS!

00:09:42.406 --> 00:09:44.443
THAT BRAT DID IT AGAIN!

00:09:44.443 --> 00:09:46.113
NOW I PLAY
THE MAGIC CARD
SCAPEGOAT!

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:56.297
OH, WELL.
I GUESS YOUR
STORM BLEW OVER.

00:09:56.297 --> 00:10:00.370
HOLD ON...WHY DIDN'T
SCAPEGOAT DISAPPEAR?

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.508
DAT'S BECAUSE SHE
DREW SCAPEGOAT FIRST

00:10:02.508 --> 00:10:05.480
BUT PLAYED IT LAST
AND THEN...NO CLUE.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.417
Yugi: IT'S SIMPLE GUYS...
THE LAST CARD PLAYED

00:10:07.417 --> 00:10:09.220
IN A TURN ALWAYS
ACTIVATES FIRST,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.655
SO THE FIRST CARD
HAS NO EFFECT

00:10:10.655 --> 00:10:13.327
ON THE LAST, EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS PLAYED FIRST!

00:10:13.327 --> 00:10:14.562
WAIT SO LAST
IS FIRST?

00:10:14.562 --> 00:10:17.701
RIGHT, AND SINCE REBECCA
USED SCAPEGOAT LAST,

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.405
IT WAS UNAFFECTED
BY IMPERIAL ORDER.

00:10:20.405 --> 00:10:22.810
COME ON, MAN.
IT'S SIMPLE.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.047
THEN PERHAPS YOU'D
LIKE TO EXPLAIN
IT TO ME AGAIN.

00:10:25.047 --> 00:10:28.419
OKAY, TWERP!
PLAYTIME'S OVER!

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:30.624
SURE YOU MAY'VE STOPPED
ME FROM PLAYING ANY

00:10:30.624 --> 00:10:32.393
OF MY MAGIC CARDS...
OR ANY MONSTER

00:10:32.393 --> 00:10:33.996
THAT HAS MORE
THAN THREE STARS...

00:10:33.996 --> 00:10:35.699
BUT...WATCH THIS!

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:42.444
YOU CAN'T STOP ME FROM
PLAYING GYAKU-GIRE PANDA!

00:10:42.444 --> 00:10:43.580
[GROWLS]

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.085
AND NOW TO ACTIVATE
HIS SPECIAL POWER.

00:10:47.085 --> 00:10:48.254
FOR EVERY MONSTER
YOU HAVE ON THE FIELD,

00:10:48.254 --> 00:10:51.527
MY CUDDLY PANDA GAINS
500 EXTRA POINTS!

00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:55.266
[GROWLS]

00:10:55.266 --> 00:10:58.406
WHOA! NOW IT'S GOT OVER
3,000 ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:58.406 --> 00:10:59.407
ERR.

00:10:59.407 --> 00:11:01.277
WHAT'S WRONG,
YOU DON'T HAVE

00:11:01.277 --> 00:11:03.481
ANY HIDDEN TRAP CARDS
TO STOP ME?

00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:05.117
NOW, MY PANDA!

00:11:05.117 --> 00:11:07.421
ATTACK HER SCAPEGOAT
WITH KUNG POW PAW!

00:11:07.421 --> 00:11:12.396
[GROWLING]

00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:13.732
AND SINCE MY PANDA'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:11:13.732 --> 00:11:16.470
ARE GREATER THAN YOUR
SCAPEGOAT'S DEFENSE POINTS,

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.341
THE DIFFERENCE COMES OUT
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:11:18.341 --> 00:11:21.279
ONE MORE ATTACK,
AND YOU'RE BEAR BAIT!

00:11:27.818 --> 00:11:28.919
WHAT'S WRONG, BEC?

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:30.523
YOU GOT THE SNIFFLES
'CAUSE MY PANDA

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.859
SCRATCHED OUT MOST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.730
WITH ONE SWIPE
OF HIS PAW?

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.566
AW, HOW SAD.

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:39.104
PLEASE.
YA THINK I CARE? NO!

00:11:39.104 --> 00:11:40.740
[SIGHS]

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.644
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
CAN DO ANYTHING.

00:11:42.644 --> 00:11:43.745
GUESS AGAIN!

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:46.049
FIRST I'LL FREE UP
MY MAGIC CARDS!

00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:47.485
HUH?

00:11:47.485 --> 00:11:50.591
YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENS NEXT, RIGHT?

00:11:50.591 --> 00:11:53.829
I COLLECT MY 200
LIFE POINTS!

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:54.932
OH, YEAH.
DON'T FORGET

00:11:54.932 --> 00:11:57.369
ABOUT THE 500 POINTS
YOU LOSE THANKS

00:11:57.369 --> 00:11:59.005
TO MY FIRE PRINCESS!

00:11:59.005 --> 00:12:00.508
OHH!

00:12:00.508 --> 00:12:02.712
ERR!

00:12:02.712 --> 00:12:05.650
YOU'RE REALLY STARTING
TO BUG ME, YOU LITTLE RUNT!

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.919
HOW SAD.

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:07.988
IF YOU DON'T
LIKE THAT...

00:12:07.988 --> 00:12:11.026
WELL...THEN YOU'RE
GONNA HATE THIS!

00:12:11.026 --> 00:12:12.796
TOKEN THANKSGIVING!

00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:16.402
SURE IT DESTROYS
MY THREE REMAINING
SCAPEGOATS,

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.708
BUT IT GIVES ME
AN EXTRA 800 POINTS
FOR EACH ONE!

00:12:23.348 --> 00:12:24.516
[GROWLS]

00:12:24.516 --> 00:12:26.921
OH, AND SINCE I JUST
GOT STRONGER,

00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:32.664
MY FIRE PRINCESS
TAKES A FEW MORE
POINTS FROM YOU.

00:12:32.664 --> 00:12:33.966
HOLD ON...
I'VE GOT ONE MORE
LITTLE SURPRISE

00:12:33.966 --> 00:12:36.170
FOR YOU, VIV!

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.145
INJECTION
FAIRY LILY!

00:12:41.145 --> 00:12:43.683
HA HA HA!

00:12:43.683 --> 00:12:46.087
NOW I SACRIFICE
2,000 OF MY
LIFE POINTS

00:12:46.087 --> 00:12:52.999
TO MAKE
LILY STRONGER!

00:12:52.999 --> 00:12:55.337
ATTACK HER
OVERSTUFFED TEDDY BEAR!

00:12:55.337 --> 00:12:56.873
[GROWLING]

00:12:56.873 --> 00:13:00.446
ERR! ERR!

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.382
OH, YEAH!
THE BEC IS BACK!

00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:04.887
SO THE FIRST CARD'S
LAST?

00:13:04.887 --> 00:13:06.824
THEN THE LAST CARD
GOES FIRST?

00:13:06.824 --> 00:13:07.858
I'M STILL LOST!

00:13:07.858 --> 00:13:09.829
I END MY TURN!

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:13.034
OK...LAST CHANCE.

00:13:13.034 --> 00:13:15.105
I'LL START OFF...
WITH THIS!

00:13:15.105 --> 00:13:16.808
IT'S A HANDY LITTLE
MAGIC CARD...

00:13:16.808 --> 00:13:20.815
CALLED LUMINOUS CLOUDS!

00:13:20.815 --> 00:13:22.517
THIS GIVES ME
THE POWER TO SACRIFICE

00:13:22.517 --> 00:13:24.988
MY KUNG FU NYAN NYAN!

00:13:24.988 --> 00:13:27.026
ALONG WITH
MY MASTER KYONSHEE

00:13:27.026 --> 00:13:32.669
IN ORDER TO
SUMMON DRAGON LADY!

00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:34.772
SHE CAN'T ATTACK
WITH THAT THING!

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:37.511
DRAGON LADY'S
A SEVEN-STAR MONSTER!

00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:38.512
THAT'S STRANGE.

00:13:38.512 --> 00:13:40.483
I KNOW.
WHAT'S SHE UP TO?!

00:13:40.483 --> 00:13:42.619
BAD NEWS, JUNIOR.

00:13:42.619 --> 00:13:45.658
EVERY TURN THAT MY DRAGON
LADY DOESN'T ATTACK,

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:49.699
SHE AUTOMATICALLY DESTROYS
ONE OF YOUR MAGIC
OR TRAP CARDS!

00:13:53.438 --> 00:13:57.646
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE...
MY MYSTIC ERUPTION CARD!

00:13:57.646 --> 00:14:01.418
NOW ANY PLAYER WHO LOST
A MAGIC OR TRAP CARD
THIS TURN

00:14:01.418 --> 00:14:02.955
ALSO LOSES
A THOUSAND LIFE POINTS!

00:14:02.955 --> 00:14:06.161
[GASPS]

00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:07.196
REBECCA! NO!

00:14:07.196 --> 00:14:10.001
AW, MAN!
HER LIFE POINTS

00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:11.837
ARE BACK
IN THE GUTTER AGAIN!

00:14:11.837 --> 00:14:14.141
SO, SHORT STUFF...
SEE WHAT HAPPENS

00:14:14.141 --> 00:14:15.477
WHEN YOU PARTY
WITH THE BIG GIRLS?

00:14:15.477 --> 00:14:17.581
MAYBE YOU'D HAVE
BETTER LUCK

00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:19.717
PLAYING A GAME
OF "GO FISH!"

00:14:19.717 --> 00:14:21.955
BUT I THINK
THE FUNNIEST PART
OF THIS WHOLE DUEL

00:14:21.955 --> 00:14:25.494
IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT
YUGI CAME HERE TO SEE YOU!

00:14:25.494 --> 00:14:26.629
HA HA HA!

00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:28.900
OH, LIKE HE CAME
HERE TO SEE YOU!?

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.636
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.574
IF I WERE ABOUT TO
LOSE THIS DUEL,

00:14:32.574 --> 00:14:33.876
I WOULDN'T BE
LAUGHING.

00:14:33.876 --> 00:14:35.145
HUH?

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:36.981
THIS IS WHERE IT ALL
ENDS, VIV.

00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:39.018
FOR YOU THAT IS.
MY MOVE!

00:14:39.018 --> 00:14:40.821
THE FIRST THING
I'LL DO IS COLLECT

00:14:40.821 --> 00:14:45.062
MY 200 POINTS FROM
MY GOOD FRIEND MARIE.

00:14:45.062 --> 00:14:48.000
AND LET'S NOT FORGET
THE 500 POINTS
YOU LOSE

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.771
THANKS TO MY
FIRE PRINCESS!

00:14:50.771 --> 00:14:54.645
YOU'RE STILL NO MATCH
FOR MY DRAGON LADY, SHRIMP.

00:14:54.645 --> 00:14:56.449
THEN I GUESS
I'LL JUST HAFTA
SACRIFICE

00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:58.785
MY TWO MONSTERS
TO PLAY THIS CARD!

00:14:58.785 --> 00:15:01.690
IT'S MY GUARDIAN
ANGEL JOAN
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:15:09.504 --> 00:15:11.141
AND SINCE YOU
ALREADY GOT RID

00:15:11.141 --> 00:15:12.577
OF MY
GRAVITY BIND...

00:15:12.577 --> 00:15:13.946
GUARDIAN ANGEL'S
ABLE TO ATTACK!

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:16.116
HOLD ON!!

00:15:16.116 --> 00:15:18.186
EVEN IF YOU DESTROY
MY DRAGON LADY,

00:15:18.186 --> 00:15:20.089
I'LL STILL HAVE
SOME POINTS LEFT!

00:15:20.089 --> 00:15:21.592
TRUST ME,
I'VE DONE THE MATH.

00:15:21.592 --> 00:15:26.301
THAT'S WHY I'M
ACTIVATING MY
SILENT DOOM CARD!

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.736
THIS MAGIC CARD
LETS ME BRING
ONE MONSTER BACK

00:15:27.736 --> 00:15:30.508
FROM THE GRAVEYARD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:15:30.508 --> 00:15:35.183
AND I CHOOSE
FIRE PRINCESS!

00:15:35.183 --> 00:15:36.151
NOT HER AGAIN!

00:15:36.151 --> 00:15:38.922
YUP, I'M AFRAID SO!

00:15:38.922 --> 00:15:45.033
NOW GUARDIAN ANGEL,
ATTACK HER DRAGON LADY!

00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:47.504
OHH!

00:15:47.504 --> 00:15:49.976
THERE'S ONLY ONE
THING LEFT TO DO.

00:15:49.976 --> 00:15:51.611
AND THAT'S ACTIVATE
JOAN'S POWER.

00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:56.186
GIVING MY
LIFE POINTS A BOOST.

00:15:56.186 --> 00:15:57.990
OF COURSE, THAT IN
TURN ACTIVATES

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.026
THE POWER
OF MY FIRE PRINCESS,

00:16:00.026 --> 00:16:06.304
CAUSING YOU TO
LOSE THE REST
OF YOUR POINTS!

00:16:06.304 --> 00:16:07.306
GREAT.

00:16:07.306 --> 00:16:08.942
WAY TA GO, REBECCA!

00:16:08.942 --> 00:16:10.177
THAT WAS AWESOME!

00:16:10.177 --> 00:16:12.782
Rebecca:
THANKS, TEA!

00:16:12.782 --> 00:16:14.284
WE KNEW YOU'D
PULL THROUGH!

00:16:14.284 --> 00:16:15.887
SCHMOOPIE!

00:16:15.887 --> 00:16:19.527
I WON!

00:16:19.527 --> 00:16:21.797
NO ONE COMES
BETWEEN US, VIV!

00:16:21.797 --> 00:16:24.068
ERR! WE'LL JUST SEE!
