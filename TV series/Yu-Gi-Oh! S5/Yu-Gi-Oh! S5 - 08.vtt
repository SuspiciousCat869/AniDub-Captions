MY YUGI-POO WAS HERE.

00:08:31.062 --> 00:08:35.570
Joey: MR. MOTO,
YOU OUT THERE?

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:39.711
Tristan: HELLO?

00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:40.713
GRAMPS?

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:50.698
Woman, on PA: ATTENTION,
KAIBA LAND GUESTS.

00:08:50.698 --> 00:08:54.037
A SHORT, STOCKY, ELDERLY
GENTLEMAN IN OVERALLS
AND A BLACK HEADBAND

00:08:54.037 --> 00:08:57.210
HAS BEEN SEPARATED
FROM HIS LOVED ONES.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.381
IF ANYONE HAS
LOST A GRANDPA,

00:08:59.381 --> 00:09:02.052
HE'S WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE MAIN GATE.

00:09:02.052 --> 00:09:03.722
OVERALLS AND A HEADBAND?

00:09:03.722 --> 00:09:09.365
THAT'S MY GRANDPA!

00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:11.636
HEY, YUGE,
DID YOU HEAR THAT
ANNOUNCEMENT?

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:13.507
YEAH, AND I GUESS
YOU GUYS DID, TOO.

00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:14.776
YUP.

00:09:14.776 --> 00:09:15.778
AND HOW MANY
ELDERLY GENTLEMEN
WITH OVERALLS

00:09:15.778 --> 00:09:17.748
DO YOU GUYS KNOW?

00:09:17.748 --> 00:09:18.984
All: ONE!

00:09:18.984 --> 00:09:21.054
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS
HE'S NOT HERE.

00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:22.490
GOOD POINT.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.062
YA THINK WE'RE AT
THE WRONG GATE?

00:09:25.062 --> 00:09:27.366
HEY, CHECK THAT OUT.

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:31.406
Yugi:
I WONDER IF GRANDPA
PUT IT THERE!

00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:32.742
LET'S SEE.

00:09:32.742 --> 00:09:34.712
IT'S SOME KINDA A MAP.

00:09:34.712 --> 00:09:36.583
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE WHOLE LAYOUT
OF KAIBA LAND.

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:38.753
AND LOOK!

00:09:38.753 --> 00:09:41.559
"X" MARKS THE SPOT.

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:45.265
SO, YOU MEAN,
IF WE FIND THAT SPOT,
WE'LL FIND GRANDPA?

00:09:45.265 --> 00:09:47.168
I HOPE.

00:09:47.168 --> 00:09:49.540
I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS 'A THIS.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.445
WHY WOULD YUGI'S
GRANDFATHER PAGE US
TO COME HERE,

00:09:52.445 --> 00:09:53.481
RUN AND HIDE,

00:09:53.481 --> 00:09:54.483
AND THEN
LEAVE US A MAP

00:09:54.483 --> 00:09:56.018
SO WE CAN FIND HIM,
HUH?

00:09:56.018 --> 00:09:57.354
WHAT'RE YOU
SAYING?

00:09:57.354 --> 00:10:01.329
THAT SOMEONE SET
A TRAP FOR US!

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:04.033
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
FALL FOR ANY TRAP!

00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:06.505
IF WE WANNA
SAVE GRANDPA,
WE MIGHT HAVE TO!

00:10:11.347 --> 00:10:15.087
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME TO
BEGIN OUR SEMI-FINAL ROUND!

00:10:15.087 --> 00:10:19.395
OUR FIRST DUEL
PITS ZIGFRIED LLOYD
AGAINST BALFRY GINGER.

00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:23.837
THESE TWO DAPPER DANS
WILL FACE-OFF IN
KAIBA CORP'S GALAXY THEATER!

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:28.211
AND NOW ON TO
OUR SECOND MATCH-UP,

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:31.217
FEATURING
THE TWO YOUNGEST MINORS

00:10:31.217 --> 00:10:33.555
TO EVER JOIN
A MAJOR TOURNAMENT,

00:10:33.555 --> 00:10:37.094
REBECCA HAWKINS
AND LEON WILSON!

00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:41.469
THESE SMALL FRIES
WILL WAGE WAR
IN SMALL TOWN, U.S.A.

00:10:41.469 --> 00:10:47.581
NOW, DUELISTS, BEGIN!

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:51.754
Both: LET'S DUEL!

00:10:51.754 --> 00:10:53.992
Both: TIME TO DUEL!

00:10:53.992 --> 00:10:55.729
REBECCA'S GOT
NOTHIN' ON YOU!

00:10:55.729 --> 00:10:57.332
CRUSH THIS WANNA-BE!

00:10:57.332 --> 00:11:00.805
I'LL KICK THINGS OFF,
IF YA DON'T MIND.

00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:05.747
SO, THE FIRST THING
I'LL DO IS ACTIVATE
MY GRACEFUL CHARITY.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.222
NOW I CAN DRAW
3 NEW CARDS,

00:11:10.222 --> 00:11:15.699
AND THEN I DISCARD
TWO FROM MY HAND.

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:18.404
SO I'LL SEND THESE TWO
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:11:18.404 --> 00:11:20.575
Rebecca, voice-over:
AND SINCE ONE OF 'EM

00:11:20.575 --> 00:11:22.478
HAPPENS TO BE
MARIE THE FALLEN ONE,

00:11:22.478 --> 00:11:29.357
I GAIN AN EXTRA
200 LIFE POINTS
WITH EVERY TURN.

00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:30.826
I'M NOT DONE YET.

00:11:30.826 --> 00:11:35.302
NEXT, I PLAY
FIRE PRINCESS
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:11:35.302 --> 00:11:39.276
THEN I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:11:39.276 --> 00:11:45.688
I'LL START THINGS OFF
BY SUMMONING FOREST WOLF.

00:11:45.688 --> 00:11:48.359
NOW, ATTACK REBECCA'S
FIRE PRINCESS

00:11:48.359 --> 00:11:50.396
WITH FAIRY TALE
FANG ATTACK.

00:11:57.042 --> 00:11:59.145
WHAT BIG TEETH
HE HAS, RIGHT?

00:11:59.145 --> 00:12:01.851
WELL, AS THE FAIRY TALE GOES,

00:12:01.851 --> 00:12:04.622
"THE BETTER TO DEVOUR
YOUR PRINCESS WITH,
MY DEAR."

00:12:04.622 --> 00:12:07.361
SO IS THAT
THE BIG BAD WOLF?

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.931
WRONG STORY.

00:12:08.931 --> 00:12:12.237
NOW I PLAY A MAGIC CARD,
SO GO, CURSE OF THORNS!

00:12:17.847 --> 00:12:21.721
THIS STOPS MARIE
THE FALLEN ONE FROM USING
HER SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:23.724
NOT BAD, KID.

00:12:23.724 --> 00:12:25.695
NOT BAD.

00:12:25.695 --> 00:12:26.730
GLAD YOU LIKED IT.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:31.539
NICE ROUND, LEON!

00:12:31.539 --> 00:12:34.377
ALL RIGHT, MY MOVE.

00:12:34.377 --> 00:12:39.721
I SUMMON
MY LUSTER DRAGON
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:12:39.721 --> 00:12:43.461
HEY, LEON, IF YOU THINK
YOUR FOREST WOLF
HAS A BIG MOUTH,

00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:47.168
THEN TAKE A CLOSE LOOK
AT MY DRAGON'S--

00:12:47.168 --> 00:12:49.305
THE BETTER
TO BLAST YOU BACK TO
FAIRY LAND WITH.

00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:02.729
WHEN MY FOREST WOLF
IS DESTROYED,

00:13:02.729 --> 00:13:06.169
WHATEVER MONSTERS
HE SWALLOWED RETURN
TO THE FIELD,

00:13:06.169 --> 00:13:07.773
SO YOU GOT
YOUR PRINCESS BACK.

00:13:07.773 --> 00:13:09.309
NICE DUELING.

00:13:09.309 --> 00:13:12.448
THANK YOU,
AND THERE'S MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM,

00:13:12.448 --> 00:13:19.260
LIKE THIS DIRECT ATTACK!

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.997
THAT SHOULD DO FOR NOW.

00:13:20.997 --> 00:13:24.403
WOW, YOU'RE JUST AS GOOD
AS THEY SAY YOU ARE,

00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:27.442
BUT IF YOU THINK
THAT SCARES ME,
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:13:27.442 --> 00:13:29.212
LOOK OUT!

00:13:29.212 --> 00:13:35.357
I'LL START BY PLAYING
GLIFE THE PHANTOM BIRD
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:36.626
Rebecca, voice-over:
BIG DEAL.

00:13:36.626 --> 00:13:39.364
AS SOON AS I ACTIVATE
MY FACE DOWN MAGIC CARD,

00:13:39.364 --> 00:13:41.601
HIS OVERSIZED
CHICKEN'LL BE USELESS.

00:13:46.745 --> 00:13:48.180
IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.552
WHEN MY PHANTOM BIRD
IS SUMMONED TO THE FIELD,

00:13:50.552 --> 00:13:54.559
HE DESTROYS
ONE OF MY OPPONENT'S TRAP
OR MAGIC CARDS.

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:57.665
AND NOW,
GLIFE THE PHANTOM BIRD,
ATTACK HER PRINCESS.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.221
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
A MAGIC CARD KNOWN AS
GINGERBREAD HOUSE,

00:14:10.221 --> 00:14:12.391
AND IF YOU THINK
MY FAIRY TALE IS GOOD NOW,

00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:14.997
JUST WAIT TILL
THE HAPPY ENDING.

00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:20.802
COME ON, REBECCA!

00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:22.137
LET'S SEE WHATCHA GOT!

00:14:22.137 --> 00:14:23.808
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

00:14:23.808 --> 00:14:25.978
I'LL START BY--

00:14:25.978 --> 00:14:28.082
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:42.409
Hawkins, voice-over:
HOW STRANGE.

00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:45.147
HE JUST RAISED
THE ATTACK POINTS OF
REBECCA'S MONSTER.

00:14:45.147 --> 00:14:50.991
IT'S JUST LIKE MY MOM SAYS,
DON'T FILL UP ON SWEETS.

00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:52.026
I KNOW
MY GINGERBREAD HOUSE

00:14:52.026 --> 00:14:54.831
SEEMS LIKE
A GOOD THING AT FIRST,

00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:57.770
BUT ONCE YOU GO INSIDE,
THERE'S A PRICE TO BE PAID.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.039
SURE, YOU GET 600 POINTS,

00:14:59.039 --> 00:15:02.813
BUT IF YOUR MONSTER'S TOTAL
IS 2,500 OR MORE--

00:15:02.813 --> 00:15:04.449
BOOM!

00:15:04.449 --> 00:15:08.724
IT'S DESTROYED,
AND THEN I'M REWARDED WITH
500 EXTRA LIFE POINTS

00:15:08.724 --> 00:15:10.326
Rebecca, voice-over:
LEON'S CARDS ARE SO...

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.729
WEIRD!

00:15:11.729 --> 00:15:14.501
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANY OF THEM BEFORE.

00:15:14.501 --> 00:15:16.237
ENOUGH GAMES!

00:15:16.237 --> 00:15:19.477
NOW I ACTIVATE
THE SHALLOW GRAVE!

00:15:19.477 --> 00:15:23.885
SO WE EACH CHOOSE
ONE MONSTER TO TRANSFER
FROM OUR GRAVEYARD

00:15:23.885 --> 00:15:26.156
BACK TO THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:15:26.156 --> 00:15:29.829
SO HOW 'BOUT
A WARM WELCOME FOR
MY LUSTER DRAGON?

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:34.939
AND LET'S GIVE IT UP
FOR THE RETURN
OF MY FOREST WOLF.

00:15:34.939 --> 00:15:38.745
NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
MY LUSTER DRAGON.

00:15:38.745 --> 00:15:44.423
THAT LETS ME SUMMON
LUSTER DRAGON NUMBER TWO
IN ITS PLACE!

00:15:44.423 --> 00:15:48.931
ALL RIGHT, L.D.,
IT'S TIME TO SHOW THAT
OVERGROWN PIGEON OF HIS

00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:49.933
WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:52.371
EMERALD FLAME ATTACK!

00:16:01.053 --> 00:16:02.356
HAD ENOUGH YET?

00:16:02.356 --> 00:16:05.595
WELL, I GOTTA ADMIT,
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD, REBECCA,

00:16:05.595 --> 00:16:08.233
BUT THIS STORY
IS NOT OVER YET,

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:11.439
SO SIT BACK AND ENJOY!

00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:16.181
FIRST, I'LL SWITCH MY WOLF
INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:16:16.181 --> 00:16:20.790
THEN I'LL SUMMON A GIRL
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER
FROM YOUR OLD BEDTIME STORIES.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.459
AND THANKS TO HER
FAIRY GODMOTHER,

00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:25.599
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO GO
TO THE BALL!

00:16:25.599 --> 00:16:31.076
YOU GUESSED IT,
IT'S CINDERELLA!

00:16:31.076 --> 00:16:33.046
AND HER SPECIAL ABILITY

00:16:33.046 --> 00:16:36.485
LET'S ME AUTOMATICALLY
SUMMON PUMPKIN CARRIAGE
TO THE FIELD.

00:16:36.485 --> 00:16:42.196
AND WHAT PRINCESS IS COMPLETE
WITHOUT HER GLASS SLIPPERS?

00:16:42.196 --> 00:16:43.332
HUH? GIMME A BREAK.

00:16:43.332 --> 00:16:45.969
HERE'S THE DEAL.

00:16:45.969 --> 00:16:48.975
AS LONG AS THAT
PUMPKIN CARRIAGE
IS ON THE FIELD,

00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:52.315
CINDERELLA IS ABLE
TO BYPASS YOUR DRAGON
AND ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY.

00:16:52.315 --> 00:16:56.824
NOW, CINDERELLA,
KICK OFF THOSE SLIPPERS
AND LET'S PARTY!

00:17:03.903 --> 00:17:06.842
BUT CINDERELLA
NEVER TAKES AWAY
SOMEONE'S LIFE POINTS

00:17:06.842 --> 00:17:09.113
WITHOUT GIVING
SOMETHING BACK IN RETURN!

00:17:09.113 --> 00:17:11.350
A PERFECT FIT!

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:14.255
MY DRAGON'S
WEARING SLIPPERS?

00:17:14.255 --> 00:17:17.428
YUP, AND AS LONG
AS YOUR DRAGON SPORTS
THAT STYLISH FOOTWEAR,

00:17:17.428 --> 00:17:19.565
IT CAN'T ATTACK CINDERELLA.

00:17:19.565 --> 00:17:24.441
OH, AND DID I MENTION
YOUR DRAGON LOSES
1,000 ATTACK POINTS?

00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:26.110
IS THAT ALL?

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:27.580
NOPE.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.417
WE CAN'T FORGET
ABOUT MY WOLF
IN GRANDMA'S CLOTHING.

00:17:29.417 --> 00:17:30.919
ATTACK!

00:17:39.903 --> 00:17:41.372
AND OF COURSE,

00:17:41.372 --> 00:17:42.975
WHENEVER A MONSTER
WEARING GLASS SLIPPERS
IS DESTROYED,

00:17:42.975 --> 00:17:44.978
CINDERELLA RECEIVES
A BRAND NEW PAIR

00:17:44.978 --> 00:17:48.485
THAT SHE CAN USE
FOR HER NEXT ATTACK.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:54.029
AND THIS SECOND PAIR
GIVES HER A 1,000 POINT BOOST.

00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:58.002
OH, AND LAST,
BUT NOT LEAST,
ONE FACE DOWN CARD.

00:17:58.002 --> 00:17:59.806
Rebecca, voice-over:
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FIGHT AGAINST

00:17:59.806 --> 00:18:01.977
LEON'S DECK OF
FAIRYTALE REJECTS?

00:18:01.977 --> 00:18:03.880
THEY'RE DRIVING ME NUTS.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.884
AND I GAVE UP
THESE LAME STORIES

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:07.320
WHEN I THREW OUT
MY TEDDY BEAR!

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.322
HERE GOES.

00:18:08.322 --> 00:18:10.559
MY MOVE!

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:12.128
AND I THINK
IT'S ABOUT TIME

00:18:12.128 --> 00:18:14.500
ONE OF US PLAYED
A REAL CARD
FOR A CHANGE--

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.237
TRIBUTE TO THE DOOMED.

00:18:16.237 --> 00:18:18.341
SO WHO'S AFRAID
OF THE BIG BAD WOLF?

00:18:18.341 --> 00:18:23.450
NOT ME, THANKS TO THIS.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.257
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
STAMPING DESTRUCTION.

00:18:27.257 --> 00:18:30.463
IT DESTROYS
ONE MAGIC CARD
ON THE FIELD

00:18:30.463 --> 00:18:33.134
AND DELIVERS
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE TO
THAT CARD'S OWNER.

00:18:40.247 --> 00:18:46.526
AND FINALLY,
I'LL GIVE YOUR PRINCESS
A ROYAL BUTT-KICKING.

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:48.362
WELL, NOT IF
I CAN HELP IT.

00:18:48.362 --> 00:18:50.366
I ACTIVATE
MY MIRROR FORCE TRAP CARD,

00:18:50.366 --> 00:18:54.875
SO YOUR ATTACK IS DEFLECTED,
AND BOUNCED RIGHT BACK.

00:18:57.947 --> 00:19:01.186
NO! NOT HIM.

00:19:01.186 --> 00:19:03.190
FINE. YOUR MOVE!

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.693
YOU SEEM UPSET.

00:19:04.693 --> 00:19:06.262
RELAX.

00:19:06.262 --> 00:19:08.700
DUELING'S SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN, REBECCA.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.537
JUST LOOK AT CINDERELLA.

00:19:10.537 --> 00:19:12.306
SHE'S HAVING A BALL.

00:19:17.617 --> 00:19:19.019
Rebecca, voice-over:
I CAN'T BELIEVE

00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:21.223
I'M FIGHTING AGAINST
PRINCESSES AND FAIRIES,

00:19:21.223 --> 00:19:26.366
AND LOSING.

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:30.040
Zigfried:
A VICTORY JUST WASN'T
IN THE STARS FOR YOU.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.943
Roland: HERE IS YOUR WINNER,

00:19:31.943 --> 00:19:36.685
THE TRENDY, YET TASTEFUL,
ZIGFRIED LLOYD!

00:19:36.685 --> 00:19:41.962
Zigfried, voice-over:
COME AND GET ME,
HERR KAIBA.

00:19:41.962 --> 00:19:44.065
Kaiba, voice-over:
I'M ON TO YOU, ZIGFRIED.

00:19:49.308 --> 00:19:53.149
ARE YOU GUYS SURE
WE'RE GOING THE RIGHT WAY?

00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:55.219
ASSUMING WE CAN
TRUST THAT MAP,

00:19:55.219 --> 00:19:58.258
YUGI'S GRANDPA
SHOULD BE RIGHT
AROUND THAT CORNER.

00:19:58.258 --> 00:20:00.429
LET'S JUST HOPE HE'S OK!

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:01.731
HE BETTER BE.

00:20:07.743 --> 00:20:10.046
THAT'S IT.

00:20:10.046 --> 00:20:12.050
Tristan:
HE'S IN A CHINESE
RESTAURANT?

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.156
YOU MEAN,
WHILE WE WERE RUNNING
AROUND LIKE LUNATICS,

00:20:15.156 --> 00:20:18.763
GRANDPA WAS EATIN'
WONTON SOUP?

00:20:18.763 --> 00:20:20.099
Tea: WAIT.

00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:22.662
YUGI, BE CAREFUL.

00:20:29.035 --> 00:20:31.805
Yugi: GRANDPA,
YOU IN THERE?

00:20:31.805 --> 00:20:33.774
HELLO?

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.475
Yugi, voice-over:
NO MATTER WHAT
IT TAKES,

00:20:35.475 --> 00:20:36.676
I'LL SAVE YOU.
