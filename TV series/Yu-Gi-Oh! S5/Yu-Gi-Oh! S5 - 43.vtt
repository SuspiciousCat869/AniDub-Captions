YOUR MONSTER HAS
1,500 ATTACK POINTS!

00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:27.322
SO, YOU LOSE 3,000
LIFE POINTS NOW!

00:16:27.322 --> 00:16:29.725
BUT YUGI DOESN'T
HAVE THAT MANY POINTS!

00:16:29.725 --> 00:16:30.827
BINGO.

00:16:30.827 --> 00:16:32.930
SO, ONCE BAKURA'S
GHOST ATTACKS,

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.501
YUGI LOSES THE DUEL!

00:16:34.501 --> 00:16:37.672
I HEAR THE SHADOW REALM'S
LOVELY THIS TIME OF YEAR.

00:16:37.672 --> 00:16:40.343
LET'S FIND OUT
IF IT'S TRUE!

00:16:40.343 --> 00:16:43.214
YUGI!

00:16:43.214 --> 00:16:47.755
IT LOOKS LIKE MY
TRIP'S BEEN POSTPONED!

00:16:47.755 --> 00:16:49.091
BUT HOW?!

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:50.493
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

00:16:50.493 --> 00:16:53.865
I ACTIVATED MY TURN JUMP
MAGIC CARD, THAT'S ALL!

00:16:53.865 --> 00:16:55.836
WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT?!

00:16:55.836 --> 00:16:57.572
IT ALLOWED ME TO
NEGATE THE ATTACK

00:16:57.572 --> 00:16:59.108
OF YOUR SPIRIT MONSTER

00:16:59.108 --> 00:17:00.977
BY SKIPPING RIGHT OVER
THE BATTLE PHASE

00:17:00.977 --> 00:17:02.380
OF THIS TURN.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.449
BUT, WAIT!

00:17:03.449 --> 00:17:05.251
THAT'S NOT
ALL IT DID!

00:17:11.962 --> 00:17:13.832
IT CAN'T BE!

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.034
Yugi: I'M AFRAID
IT'S TRUE!

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:19.208
MY SILENT SWORDSMAN
JUST JUMPED TO LEVEL 4!

[GASPS]

00:17:20.243 --> 00:17:21.946
IT HAS 3,000 POINTS!

00:17:21.946 --> 00:17:23.214
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:17:23.214 --> 00:17:26.787
NOW, SILENT
SWORDSMAN, ATTACK!

00:17:26.787 --> 00:17:27.822

ONE MORE.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:41.745
ONE MORE?

00:17:41.745 --> 00:17:43.047
ONE MORE.

00:17:43.047 --> 00:17:45.451

00:17:51.861 --> 00:17:52.863
YEAH!

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:53.865
YOU WANT S'MORE?!

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:54.966

S'MORE? HA HA.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.506
AH, NEVER MIND.

00:17:58.506 --> 00:18:00.276
[THINKING]
THIS IS PROBABLY
THE TOUGHEST DUEL

00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:01.745
YUGI'S EVER FOUGHT.

00:18:01.745 --> 00:18:04.583
USUALLY, THE PHARAOH
STEPS IN AND TAKES OVER.

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.986
BUT NOW YUGI'S DOING
IT ON HIS OWN.

00:18:06.986 --> 00:18:10.893
WITH HIS OWN DECK!

00:18:10.893 --> 00:18:12.629
GO GET HIM, YUGI!

00:18:12.629 --> 00:18:13.631
PLEASE.

00:18:13.631 --> 00:18:14.699
THAT LITTLE TWIT

I HAVE IN STORE NEXT!

Shimon: I'M AFRAID
THE DARK ONE

00:18:26.852 --> 00:18:28.422
IS TOO POWERFUL
FOR AN ARMY

OF MERE MORTALS
TO DEFEAT.

00:18:30.492 --> 00:18:33.129
THE ONLY WAY TO FACE
A SUPERNATURAL THREAT

00:18:33.129 --> 00:18:36.536
IS TO USE
