THEN JUST WAIT UNTIL
YOU MEET ZORC THE DARK ONE!

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:09.067
DID YOU SAY "ZORC?!"

00:18:09.067 --> 00:18:12.440
ZORC THE DARK ONE
WILL AWAKEN.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.916
THIS STONE TABLET
CONCEALS THE SOURCE
OF MY TRUE POWER,

00:18:16.916 --> 00:18:21.726
SO I SHALL CALL UPON
ANOTHER SHADOW CREATURE
TO PROTECT IT!

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:23.997
MEET MY SKELETON FIEND!

00:18:23.997 --> 00:18:25.399
TWO BEASTS?!

00:18:25.399 --> 00:18:28.740
YES, DOUBLE THE DESTRUCTION,
DOUBLE THE FUN!

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.846
NOW IS ANYONE UP
FOR A GAME OF HIDE-AND-SEEK?

00:18:31.846 --> 00:18:32.981
WELL, I AM!

00:18:32.981 --> 00:18:35.620
[ROARING]

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.824
LOOK! HIS CREATURE!

00:18:37.824 --> 00:18:39.127
IT'S GONE!

00:18:39.127 --> 00:18:42.099
WE MUSTN'T LET IT
GET AWAY!

00:18:42.099 --> 00:18:43.903
RAPID SPELL FIRE!

00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:54.825
MY DIABOUND IS CONCEALED
BY THE DARKNESS,

00:18:54.825 --> 00:19:00.202
SO TRYING TO ATTACK HIM
IS POINTLESS!

00:19:00.202 --> 00:19:04.377
HMM. WE WEREN'T
ATTACKING HIM.

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:07.350
NO! BUT HOW DID YOU
EXPOSE MY CREATURE?!

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.459
WE SIMPLY BRIGHTENED UP
THE ROOM TO PENETRATE
THE DARKNESS!

00:19:11.459 --> 00:19:16.134
NOW, MAHAD!
FINISH HIM OFF!

00:19:16.134 --> 00:19:20.342
AAH!

00:19:20.342 --> 00:19:21.545
IT'S OVER!

00:19:21.545 --> 00:19:25.285
NOT YET.

00:19:25.285 --> 00:19:28.559
YOUR SPELL-CASTER MAY HAVE
IMPROVED HIS SKILLS,

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:31.999
BUT I'M AFRAID
HE'S STILL NOT GOOD
ENOUGH TO KEEP ME DOWN.

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:34.605
HUH?

00:19:34.605 --> 00:19:36.174
NOW, DARK SPIRITS,

00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:41.652
FILL ME WITH YOUR POWER
SO I MAY AVENGE
YOUR SUFFERING!

00:19:41.652 --> 00:19:46.328
HA HA HA!

00:19:46.328 --> 00:19:48.366
[ROARING]

00:19:48.366 --> 00:19:50.336
IT'S EVEN
STRONGER NOW!

00:19:50.336 --> 00:19:55.380
QUICKLY, MAHAD!
ATTACK!

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.684
HE BLOCKED IT!

00:19:57.684 --> 00:19:59.988
DIABOUND!
SPIRAL WAVE ATTACK!!

00:19:59.988 --> 00:20:03.629
[GRUNTING]

00:20:03.629 --> 00:20:05.032
NO! MAHAD!

00:20:05.032 --> 00:20:08.673
TIME TO SEAL YOUR FRIEND
AWAY FOR ALL ETERNITY!

00:20:08.673 --> 00:20:10.443
LIGHTNING BLAST!

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.793
AH. GAME OVER.

00:20:18.793 --> 00:20:21.799
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN
IS NO MORE.

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:23.336
THIS CAN'T BE.

00:20:23.336 --> 00:20:26.909
Girl: MAHAD IS SAFE,
MY PHARAOH.

00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:28.546
BUT HOW?

00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:30.183
WHO SUMMONED YOU?

00:20:30.183 --> 00:20:35.093
A FORMER STUDENT
OF YOURS.

00:20:35.093 --> 00:20:36.562
MANA!

00:20:36.562 --> 00:20:38.626
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
NEED SOME HELP.

00:20:38.626 --> 00:20:40.094
HA HA HA!
