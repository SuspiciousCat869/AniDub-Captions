00:11:53.485 --> 00:11:55.653
1 MORE RIDDLE,
AND YOU MAY LEAVE.

00:11:55.653 --> 00:11:58.957
A RIDDLE?
AH--HEH--

00:11:58.957 --> 00:12:00.725
ANYTHING BUT THAT!

00:12:00.725 --> 00:12:05.597
JUST KIDDING.
HA HA HA!

00:12:05.597 --> 00:12:06.931
Joey:
OH, REAL FUNNY!

00:12:06.931 --> 00:12:08.600
SO EVERYONE'S
A COMEDIAN NOW?

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:14.105
YOU KNOW I HATE
THOSE RIDDLES!

00:12:14.105 --> 00:12:16.307
FAREWELL,
MY FRIENDS!

00:12:32.253 --> 00:12:34.088
Tea: I COULD SWEAR
THE PASSAGEWAY

00:12:34.088 --> 00:12:37.525
WE ENTERED FROM
WAS RIGHT HERE.

00:12:37.525 --> 00:12:39.093
WHERE'D IT GO?

00:12:39.093 --> 00:12:40.261
KNOWING
THIS PLACE,

00:12:40.261 --> 00:12:42.029
WE STILL HAVE TO CLEAR
ANOTHER CHALLENGE.

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:43.531
THAT'S NOT
FUNNY, "T."

00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:45.700
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT RIDDLES.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.604
THEY DON'T LIKE ME,
AND I DON'T LIKE THEM!

00:12:49.604 --> 00:12:51.339
YOUR FRIEND IS CORRECT.

00:12:51.339 --> 00:12:53.841
YOU MAY HAVE
PASSED ALL 5 TESTS,

00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:55.109
BUT I'M AFRAID THIS
JOURNEY OF YOURS

00:12:55.109 --> 00:12:56.510
IS NOT YET COMPLETE.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.479
1 TASK REMAINS.

00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:00.748
ONCE YOU'VE MADE IT
HOME TO YOUR WORLD,

00:13:00.748 --> 00:13:02.850
YOU MUST QUICKLY
LOCATE A HIDDEN CHAMBER

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.086
AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID.

00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:07.788
YOUR PENDANT WILL NOW
BE ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR.

00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:10.024
ONCE INSIDE, YOU WILL
BE GRANTED THE POWER

00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:11.926
I ONCE CRAVED--

00:13:11.926 --> 00:13:13.561
THE POWER TO
RULE THE WORLD!

00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:15.263
YES, BUT I ALREADY
TOLD YOU.

00:13:15.263 --> 00:13:17.098
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN ANY POWER,

00:13:17.098 --> 00:13:19.233
I JUST WANNA
GO BACK HOME.

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:20.568
I KNOW.

00:13:20.568 --> 00:13:21.903
BUT THERE IS
SOMEONE OUT THERE

00:13:21.903 --> 00:13:25.339
WHO DOES SEEK
SUCH A POWER.

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:27.241
DR. BRISBANE!

00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:28.409
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE!

00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:29.577
I MEAN, YOU
SAID YOU WERE

00:13:29.577 --> 00:13:31.312
ALEXANDER
THE GREAT!

00:13:31.312 --> 00:13:32.914
HOLD ON, DUDE!

00:13:32.914 --> 00:13:34.415
DR. BRISBANE'S NAME
WAS ALEX, WHICH

00:13:34.415 --> 00:13:36.651
COULD BE SHORT FOR
ALEXANDER THE GREAT!

00:13:36.651 --> 00:13:37.752
WAIT A SEC.

00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:38.853
SO ARE YOU SAYIN'
ALEX IS REALLY

00:13:38.853 --> 00:13:40.588
ALEXANDER THE GREAT?

00:13:40.588 --> 00:13:42.323
OR IS THIS GUY AN
ALEX IMPOSTER

00:13:42.323 --> 00:13:43.791
WHO ISN'T SO GREAT?

00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:44.892
NEITHER.

00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:46.193
DR. BRISBANE
HAS BEEN

00:13:46.193 --> 00:13:48.029
A COLLEAGUE OF
MINE FOR YEARS.

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:49.764
AND THOUGH
HE DOES BEAR

00:13:49.764 --> 00:13:51.999
A STRONG
RESEMBLANCE
TO THIS MAN,

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:53.200
I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT THE TWO

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.670
ARE NOT ONE
AND THE SAME.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.338
I'M AFRAID THAT
THE WORDS YOU SPEAK

00:13:57.338 --> 00:14:01.375
ARE ONLY PARTIALLY
TRUE, DR. MUTO.

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:02.743
THIS "COLLEAGUE"
OF YOURS

00:14:02.743 --> 00:14:05.546
IS POSSESSED
BY MY DARK HALF!

00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:07.481
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
BY YOUR "DARK HALF?"

00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:08.749
THE MOMENT I PLACED

00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:11.552
THAT ANCIENT EGYPTIAN
ARTIFACT AROUND MY NECK,

00:14:11.552 --> 00:14:15.189
MY SOUL WAS SPLIT
INTO 2 PIECES.

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:16.657
WELL, GO ON.

00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:18.359
I WAS TRAPPED
IN THIS WORLD,

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:20.094
WHILE MY EVIL HALF

00:14:20.094 --> 00:14:22.096
WAS LOCKED IN
THAT PYRAMID.

00:14:22.096 --> 00:14:23.731
BUT HE WAS
SET FREE THE MOMENT

00:14:23.731 --> 00:14:26.767
DR. MUTO ENTERED WITH
PROFESSOR ALEX BRISBANE--

00:14:26.767 --> 00:14:30.404
WHO HAPPENS TO BE A DIRECT
DESCENDENT OF MINE!

00:14:30.404 --> 00:14:32.239
MY DARK HALF
THEN SEIZED CONTROL

00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:34.208
OF DR. BRISBANE,
AND BROUGHT YOU HERE

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:37.745
TO UNLOCK THE POWER
THAT WE NEVER COULD.

00:14:37.745 --> 00:14:40.581
YOU MUST OBTAIN THAT
POWER BEFORE HE DOES,

00:14:40.581 --> 00:14:43.951
OR HE'LL USE IT TO
TAKE OVER YOUR WORLD!

00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:48.322
NO--BUT HE CAN'T!

00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:50.524
DON'T LET THAT PENDANT
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

00:14:50.524 --> 00:14:51.959
WHOEVER WEARS IT
HOLDS THE KEY

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:53.694
TO THE ULTIMATE POWER.

00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:55.529
AND WHEN YOU RETURN,
MY DARK SIDE

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:57.365
WILL BE WAITING
TO SEIZE IT!

00:14:57.365 --> 00:14:59.033
I SEE.

00:14:59.033 --> 00:15:00.534
SO THAT EVIL
SPIRIT TRICKED US

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:01.736
INTO PLAYING THIS GAME.

00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:03.337
HE KNEW IT WAS
THE ONLY WAY

00:15:03.337 --> 00:15:04.705
TO GET THAT PENDANT!

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:06.574
AND HE WAS RIGHT,

00:15:06.574 --> 00:15:09.010
SO WE MUST THINK OF
A PLAN TO STOP HIM.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.746
RIGHT!

00:15:11.746 --> 00:15:13.581
Grandpa:
ACCORDING TO ALEXANDER,

00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:17.084
ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS CONCENTRATE.

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:18.185
ALL RIGHT.

00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:19.820
THINK ABOUT THAT PYRAMID!

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.835
WELL, BY THE
LOOK OF THINGS,

00:15:37.835 --> 00:15:39.136
I'D SAY
WE'RE BACK!

00:15:39.136 --> 00:15:40.605
SHE'S RIGHT!

00:15:40.605 --> 00:15:41.639
SEEMS LIKE IT,

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:42.640
BUT THERE'S ONLY
1 WAY TO BE SURE

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.841
WE'RE BACK IN
THE REAL WORLD,

00:15:43.841 --> 00:15:46.010
AND I THINK YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.011
UH!
UH!

00:15:47.011 --> 00:15:48.179
Both: YUP,
WE'RE BACK!

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:49.580
HA--HEY!
HA!

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.582
♪ WE'RE BACK IN
THE REAL WORLD ♪

00:15:51.582 --> 00:15:52.617
♪ NO DRAGONS
OR WEIRD GIRLS ♪

00:15:52.617 --> 00:15:54.018
OUR PLAN WORKED.

00:15:54.018 --> 00:15:55.519
BY USING YOUR
BODY AS A VESSEL,

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:57.788
I WAS ABLE
TO ENTER YOUR WORLD.

00:15:57.788 --> 00:15:59.323
GLAD I COULD HELP.

00:15:59.323 --> 00:16:00.925
NOW AS SOON AS WE
FIND DR. BRISBANE,

00:16:00.925 --> 00:16:02.393
YOU CAN JUMP
INTO HIS BODY

00:16:02.393 --> 00:16:04.729
AND REUNITE WITH
YOUR OTHER HALF.

00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:06.530
Alexander: HELLO!
DR. MUTO!

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.369
YOU'RE BACK!

00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:13.237
I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

00:16:13.237 --> 00:16:14.906
I'VE BEEN WORRIED
SICK ABOUT YOU

00:16:14.906 --> 00:16:17.108
SINCE THE MOMENT
YOU DISAPPEARED INTO THAT MAP.

00:16:17.108 --> 00:16:18.542
WELL, YOU CAN
STOP WORRYING,

00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:20.878
'CAUSE WE ALL MADE
IT BACK IN 1 PIECE.

00:16:20.878 --> 00:16:22.914
WELL, THANK GOODNESS
FOR THAT.

00:16:22.914 --> 00:16:24.415
BECAUSE IF ANYTHING
HAD HAPPENED TO YOU,

00:16:24.415 --> 00:16:27.018
I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO FORGIVE MYSELF.

00:16:27.018 --> 00:16:28.085
OH, PLEASE.

00:16:28.085 --> 00:16:29.253
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU COULD HAVE

00:16:29.253 --> 00:16:30.721
KNOWN ABOUT
ALL THIS.

00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:33.591
ALEXANDER, ARE YOU
SURE MY FRIEND

00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:35.826
IS POSSESSED BY
AN EVIL FORCE?

00:16:35.826 --> 00:16:37.094
HMM.

00:16:37.094 --> 00:16:38.796
SO, DID YOU
FIND ANYTHING?

00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:39.964
HUH?

00:16:39.964 --> 00:16:42.333
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
CROSSED TO THE OTHER SIDE,

00:16:42.333 --> 00:16:44.035
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING
OF INTEREST THERE?

00:16:44.035 --> 00:16:45.670
UH...
LIKE WHAT?

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.505
I MEAN,
IS THERE SOMETHING

00:16:47.505 --> 00:16:48.973
I SHOULD HAVE
FOUND THERE?

00:16:48.973 --> 00:16:50.675
I DON'T KNOW.

00:16:50.675 --> 00:16:52.176
I THOUGHT PERHAPS
YOU'D BRING BACK

00:16:52.176 --> 00:16:53.711
AN ARTIFACT
OR SOMETHING.

00:16:53.711 --> 00:16:55.680
THERE'S NO DOUBT.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.114
THIS MAN IS UNDER
THE CONTROL

00:16:57.114 --> 00:16:59.116
OF MY DARK HALF!

00:16:59.116 --> 00:17:00.251
YES.

00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:02.219
CLEARLY HE'S AFTER
THE PENDANT.

00:17:02.219 --> 00:17:04.922
I'LL DISTRACT HIM
SO YOU TWO CAN REUNITE.

00:17:04.922 --> 00:17:07.091
ARTIFACT, EH?
LET ME THINK.

00:17:07.091 --> 00:17:10.494
Grandpa: MY MIND'S NOT
AS SHARP AS IT USED TO BE.

00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:11.595
OH, WAIT!

00:17:11.595 --> 00:17:12.763
NOW THAT YOU
MENTION IT,

00:17:12.763 --> 00:17:14.732
I DID FIND
SOMETHING.

00:17:14.732 --> 00:17:16.400
IS THIS WHAT
YOU MEANT?

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.503
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I MEANT.

00:17:19.503 --> 00:17:22.506
HA HA HA!

00:17:22.506 --> 00:17:28.412
NOW!

00:17:28.412 --> 00:17:30.247
AFTER ALL
THESE YEARS,

00:17:30.247 --> 00:17:33.617
I FINALLY CAUGHT
UP WITH YOU!

00:17:33.617 --> 00:17:37.288
NOW JOIN TOGETHER
WITH ME TO BECOME 1!

00:17:37.288 --> 00:17:44.295
AAH!

00:17:44.295 --> 00:17:46.030
DR. BRISBANE?

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.631
ARE YOU
FEELING OK?

00:17:54.905 --> 00:17:56.340
YES, I'M FINE.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.009
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M FEELING BETTER

00:17:58.009 --> 00:17:59.710
THAN I HAVE
IN A LONG TIME.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.245
THAT'S AWESOME.

00:18:01.245 --> 00:18:03.280
WE TOTALLY
PULLED IT OFF!

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.916
NOW, LET'S HAVE
A LOOK AT THAT

00:18:05.916 --> 00:18:11.589
STRANGE OBJECT
YOU BROUGHT BACK.

00:18:11.589 --> 00:18:16.494
NO, GRANDPA!
IT'S A TRICK!

00:18:16.494 --> 00:18:18.496
YOU'RE NOT ALEX!

00:18:18.496 --> 00:18:21.032
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE!

00:18:21.032 --> 00:18:24.735
[LAUGHING]

00:18:24.735 --> 00:18:26.370
AS YOU CAN SEE,
MY PEACEFUL SIDE

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.406
IS ALSO MY
FOOLISH SIDE!

00:18:28.406 --> 00:18:29.807
HE COULD NEVER
HAVE CONQUERED

00:18:29.807 --> 00:18:32.576
HALF THE GLOBE
WITHOUT ME!

00:18:32.576 --> 00:18:34.512
WE'VE GOT
TO STOP HIM.

00:18:34.512 --> 00:18:36.514
IT IS TIME
TO COMPLETE

00:18:36.514 --> 00:18:41.185
WHAT I BEGAN
CENTURIES AGO!

00:18:41.185 --> 00:18:42.686
YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE!

00:18:42.686 --> 00:18:45.523
DIDN'T YOU LEARN
YOUR LESSON LAST TIME?

00:18:45.523 --> 00:18:48.492
THE POWER YOU SEEK
DOESN'T BELONG TO US!

00:18:48.492 --> 00:18:50.995
YOU'VE HELD ME BACK
FOR THE LAST TIME!

00:18:50.995 --> 00:18:52.863
YOU WON'T
GET AWAY WITH THIS!

00:18:52.863 --> 00:18:55.366
Yugi: NOW, GIVE US
BACK THAT PENDANT!

00:18:55.366 --> 00:19:02.006
GET HIM!

00:19:02.006 --> 00:19:04.341
WE CAN'T LET HIM
GET TO THAT ROOM.

00:19:12.283 --> 00:19:18.089
I'VE STARED AT THIS
DOORWAY HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

00:19:18.089 --> 00:19:20.891
HOWEVER, THIS TIME,
I HOLD THE KEY.

00:19:25.963 --> 00:19:28.165
AT LONG LAST!

00:19:33.971 --> 00:19:35.239
STOP!

00:19:35.239 --> 00:19:41.812
DUDE, WE WORKED TOO
HARD FOR THAT THING!

00:19:41.812 --> 00:19:47.685
I GOTCHA!

00:19:47.685 --> 00:19:49.854
[GROANING]

00:19:49.854 --> 00:19:51.255
WE'VE GOT YOU!

00:19:51.255 --> 00:19:53.324
NO! LET GO!

00:19:53.324 --> 00:19:55.759
I WILL NOT BE ROBBED
OF MY DESTINY!

00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:57.495
DON'T DROP HIM!

00:19:57.495 --> 00:19:58.629
OH!

00:19:58.629 --> 00:20:05.336
All: WHOA!

00:20:11.108 --> 00:20:14.979
WHERE ARE WE?

00:20:14.979 --> 00:20:16.614
LOOK, GUYS!

00:20:23.854 --> 00:20:25.656
I KNOW YOU!

00:20:25.656 --> 00:20:31.529
Alexander: YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CREATED THE PYRAMID!

00:20:31.529 --> 00:20:34.565

00:20:34.565 --> 00:20:36.534
