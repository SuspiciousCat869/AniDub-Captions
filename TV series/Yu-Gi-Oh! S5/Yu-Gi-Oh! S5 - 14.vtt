00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.209
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE NEXT
INTERNATIONAL CHAMP, YUGI!

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:10.282
I PLAY GOLDEN
CASTLE OF STROMBERG!

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:15.893
ZIGFRIED...

00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:18.733
YOU REALIZE YOUR BROTHER JUST
PLAYED AN ILLEGAL CARD RIGHT?

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.940
WITNESS IF YOU WILL THE
FINAL PHASE OF MY REVENGE.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.211
AND AS SOON AS
IT WAS PLAYED

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.652
IT UNLOCKED
THE MOST DEVASTATING
VIRUS EVER CONSTRUCTED!

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.724
LAUNCH THE ANTIVIRAL
PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY!

00:00:30.724 --> 00:00:33.997
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY YOU CAN
PUT AN END TO ALL THIS.

00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:38.440
DESTROY THE GOLDEN CASTLE
OF STROMBERG AND THE VIRUS
WILL CEASE!

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.575
NOW WHAT?

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:42.081
DUEL AGAINST ME WITH
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:44.820
AND SHOW ZIGFRIED WHAT
THE HEART OF THE CARDS
IS ALL ABOUT!

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.726
AND TOGETHER YOU AND I
WILL PUT AN END

00:00:47.726 --> 00:00:48.795
TO YOUR BROTHER'S
SELFISH SCHEME.

00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:50.699
EVERY CARD
HAS ITS WEAKNESS.

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.937
WE JUST NEED TO
FIGURE OUT THIS ONE.

00:00:52.937 --> 00:00:54.506
AND WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME.

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:03.549
THOUSANDS OF KAIBACORP
COMPUTER FILES ARE
BEING DELETED!

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.655
THANKS IN NO SMALL PART
TO MY UNDEFEATABLE VIRUS.

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:08.159
WE'LL SEE!

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.530
IF WHAT ZIGFRIED SAYS
IS TRUE

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.035
THEN YUGI HAS TO GET RID
OF THAT CASTLE CARD PRONTO

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:14.572
OR KAIBA'S GONNA LOSE
EVERYTHING!

00:02:14.572 --> 00:02:16.543
Joey:
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:22.388
ZIGFRIED REPROGRAMMED THE CARD
AND MADE IT INDESTRUCTIBLE!

00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:24.125
SETO?

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.496
RUNNING FROM OUR PROBLEMS
ARE WE?

00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:28.367
I DON'T RUN FROM ANYTHING.

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:32.576
WHEN I'M FACED WITH A PROBLEM
I ELIMINATE THE SOURCE.

00:02:32.576 --> 00:02:35.114
SETO WAIT UP.

00:02:35.114 --> 00:02:38.788
DON'T YOU FOOLS REALIZE
I'VE ALREADY WON?

00:02:38.788 --> 00:02:42.462
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO TRIGGER THAT VIRUS, LEON.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.402
BUT WITH YOUR HELP
I THINK WE CAN STOP IT.

00:02:45.402 --> 00:02:48.207
I NEED YOU TO DUEL WITH
ALL OF YOUR HEART.

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:51.114
YOU'RE RIGHT; AS LONG
AS LEON STAYS STRONG
AND DOESN'T GIVE UP...

00:02:51.114 --> 00:02:53.319
WE'RE BOUND TO FIND
THAT CARD'S WEAKNESS!

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.721
YES.

00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:59.397
THANKS YUGI.

00:02:59.397 --> 00:03:02.203
I GUESS THERE'S NOTING
I CAN DO TO CHANGE THE PAST,

00:03:02.203 --> 00:03:05.076
BUT I CAN WORK WITH YOU
TO CHANGE THE FUTURE.

00:03:05.076 --> 00:03:08.583
'CAUSE I KNOW THERE'S
A SOLUTION TO THIS WHOLE THING.

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.520
AND IF ANYONE CAN
FIGURE IT OUT IT'S YOU!

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.326
THEN LET'S DUEL.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:16.800
MY MOVE!

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.810
GOLDEN CASTLE OF STROMBERG'S
SPECIAL EFFECT IS NOW
AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATED!

00:03:24.082 --> 00:03:27.489
WHAT'S DA DEAL
WIT YUGI'S DARK
MAGICIAN GIRL!?

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.917
NO WAY.

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:45.259
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN GIRL'S
DESTROYED, AND CINDERELLA
GOT HER SLIPPERS BACK!

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.866
AS LONG AS MY NEW
AND IMPROVED CASTLE
REMAINS ON THE FIELD,

00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:52.407
BOTH PLAYERS' MONSTERS WILL BE
FORCED TO DO BATTLE EACH TURN!

00:03:52.407 --> 00:03:54.111
AND AS AN ADDED TWIST

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:56.449
WHENEVER ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
IS FORCED TO ATTACK

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.190
HALF OF THAT MONSTER'S ATTACK
POINTS ARE THEN DEDUCTED
FROM YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.427
AND THEN THE MONSTER ITSELF
IS DESTROYED!

00:04:02.427 --> 00:04:04.733
CAN HE REALLY MAKE A CARD
DO THAT!?

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:10.377
I THINK
HE JUST DID JOEY!

00:04:10.377 --> 00:04:12.115
ALRIGHT.

00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:14.787
INITIATE PROTOCOL
KC FIVE FOURTEEN.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.758
WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS THING
TO SPREAD ANY FURTHER!

00:04:16.758 --> 00:04:17.793
YES SIR.

00:04:17.793 --> 00:04:19.162
SETO.

00:04:19.162 --> 00:04:20.665
WHAT CAN I DO
TO HELP OUT!?

00:04:20.665 --> 00:04:22.669
TAKE CHARGE OF
E-LEVEL SECURITY

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.442
AND MAKE SURE EVERY
FIREWALL STAYS ACTIVE!

00:04:25.442 --> 00:04:30.051
LEAVE IT TO ME.

00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:31.989
POOR LEON.

00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:34.728
HE WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING
TO HELP HIS BIG BROTHER,

00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:36.565
AND HOW DID ZIGFRIED
REPAY HIM?

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:38.402
WITH LIES AND BETRAYAL.

00:04:38.402 --> 00:04:41.074
MY BROTHER WOULD NEVER
DO THAT TO ME.

00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:44.548
HOW DO I DESTROY
THAT CASTLE??

00:04:44.548 --> 00:04:46.820
MAGIC AND TRAPS CARDS
ARE USELESS AGAINST IT.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.061
AND ANY MONSTER I SUMMON
WILL SELF DESTRUCT
AND DRAIN MY LIFE POINTS.

00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:52.998
WHAT'S THE USE?

00:04:52.998 --> 00:04:54.135
LEON!

00:04:54.135 --> 00:04:55.204
WE CAN'T GIVE UP!

00:04:55.204 --> 00:04:57.374
EVERY CARD
HAS A WEAKNESS.

00:04:57.374 --> 00:05:00.147
AND AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE
TO DUEL TO THE VERY END,

00:05:00.147 --> 00:05:02.652
WE'LL FIND A WAY TO TEAR
THAT CASTLE DOWN!

00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:05.525
NOW I'LL PLACE THIS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:07.729
YOU AND I CAN DO THIS!

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.399
YUGI IS RIGHT.

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:12.305
QUITTING IS NOT AN OPTION!

00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:15.111
MY MOVE!

00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:17.182
PARDON ME.

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.454
THERE'S ONE MORE THING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:21.725
GOLDEN CASTLE
COMES WITH A PRICE.

00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:24.230
IN ORDER TO KEEP IT
ON THE FIELD,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.900
HALF THE CARDS
IN ONE'S DECK

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.038
MUST BE SENT DIRECTLY
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:05:28.038 --> 00:05:29.842
AT THE START OF EACH TURN.

00:05:29.842 --> 00:05:31.244
OH...

00:05:31.244 --> 00:05:34.652
AND THIS COST
MUST BE PAID BY YUGI!

00:05:34.652 --> 00:05:35.887
YOU'RE KIDDIN'!

00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:37.391
CONGRATULATIONS
ZIGFRIED.

00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:39.795
YOU'VE JUST TAKEN CHEATING
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL!

00:05:39.795 --> 00:05:41.399
OH NO!

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:43.269
IT'S THE STRONGEST CARD
I'VE EVER SEEN!

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:44.338
WHAT!?

00:05:44.338 --> 00:05:45.741
ME TOO.

00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:48.146
WHEN ZIGFRIED BROKE
INTO KAIBA'S GAMING SYSTEM

00:05:48.146 --> 00:05:51.820
HE GAVE HIS GOLDEN CASTLE
POWERS THAT NO CARD
HAS EVER HAD BEFORE!

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.795
GIVING THE CARDHOLDER
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

00:05:55.795 --> 00:05:57.732
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

00:05:57.732 --> 00:06:00.604
YUGI'S THE ONE WITH
THE DISADVANTAGE HERE

00:06:00.604 --> 00:06:02.743
SO YOU SHOULD REALLY
BE THANKING ME!

00:06:02.743 --> 00:06:08.087
HE JUST LOST
HALF HIS DECK!

00:06:08.087 --> 00:06:09.590
C'MON!

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.761
WE CAN'T LET 'IM
GET AWAY WIT THIS!

00:06:11.761 --> 00:06:14.868
I MAY BE UP HERE
IN GRANDSTAND...

00:06:14.868 --> 00:06:17.406
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T CONTROL THIS DUEL!

00:06:17.406 --> 00:06:19.176
HE'S INSANE.

00:06:19.176 --> 00:06:23.919
BEFORE LONG MY BROTHER WILL HOLD
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP CROWN

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.825
AND KAIBACORP WILL CRUMBLE
INTO RUINS.

00:06:31.902 --> 00:06:34.708
Zigfried: IF I WERE YOU
I'D SUMMON A MONSTER, LEON.

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:36.712
THIS IS A DUEL AFTER ALL.

00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:38.616
HE'S RIGHT. GO.

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:40.887
WELL...

00:06:40.887 --> 00:06:44.595
I GUESS I'LL SUMMON
FOREST WOLF IN ATTACK MODE.

00:06:44.595 --> 00:06:49.772
NOW THE SPECIAL EFFECT OF GOLDEN
CASTLE FORCES LEON'S MONSTERS
TO ATTACK!

00:06:49.772 --> 00:06:51.610
OH AND LOOK AT THIS...

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.514
YUGI IS DEFENSELESS!

00:07:02.165 --> 00:07:03.333
FOREST WOLF!

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:05.271
FINISH HIM OFF!

00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:08.277
YUGI! NO!

00:07:08.277 --> 00:07:10.515
I REVEAL MY FACEDOWN CARD!

00:07:10.515 --> 00:07:12.319
DARK MAGIC RETRIBUTION!

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:14.256
WHEN MY OPPONENT'S
MONSTER ATTACKS,

00:07:14.256 --> 00:07:19.366
DARK MAGIC RETRIBUTION ALLOWS ME
TO BRING ONE SPELL-CASTER BACK
FROM MY CARD GRAVEYARD!

00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:20.836
I CHOOSE...

00:07:20.836 --> 00:07:22.540
MY DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:07:28.485 --> 00:07:31.225
SHE ONLY REMAINS ON THE FIELD
FOR THE DURATION OF THE BATTLE

00:07:31.225 --> 00:07:35.366
BUT THAT'S LONG ENOUGH FOR ME
TO DEFEND THE REMAINDER
OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:07:35.366 --> 00:07:37.303
HE'S SAFE GUYS.

00:07:37.303 --> 00:07:38.840
YEAH BUT FOR
HOW LONG?

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.245
I CAN'T EVEN CONTROL
MY OWN MONSTERS.

00:07:41.245 --> 00:07:42.715
WE'LL BE FINE.

00:07:42.715 --> 00:07:44.518
NOW!

00:07:44.518 --> 00:07:47.558
SINCE THREE TURNS HAVE
PASSED SINCE YOU PLAYED
SPINNING WHEEL SPINDLE,

00:07:47.558 --> 00:07:49.295
MY QUEEN'S KNIGHT RETURNS!

00:07:49.295 --> 00:07:54.873
FOR MY NEXT MOVE
I'LL PLACE THESE TWO CARDS
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:07:54.873 --> 00:07:57.879
AND THEN
I'LL ACTIVATE THIS!

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:00.017
IT'S MY CARD OF SANCTITY!

00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:02.589
THIS MAGIC CARD ALLOWS
BOTH PLAYERS TO DRAW

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:05.662
UNTIL WE'RE EACH HOLDING
SIX CARDS IN OUR HANDS.

00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:14.547
NOW I SUMMON MY KING'S KNIGHT
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:08:14.547 --> 00:08:18.188
AND SINCE KING'S KNIGHT
AND QUEEN'S KNIGHT ARE
BOTH ON THE FIELD,

00:08:18.188 --> 00:08:21.361
I'M ABLE TO SUMMON JACK'S KNIGHT
FROM MY DECK TO JOIN THEM!

00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.246
IF YOU'RE THROUGH
WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME

00:08:30.246 --> 00:08:34.923
MAY I REMIND YOU YOUR
THREE KNIGHTS ARE USELESS
AGAINST MY GOLDEN CASTLE!

00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:38.029
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:40.033
NOW I ACTIVATE...

00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:43.907
MY ROYAL STRAIGHT!

00:08:43.907 --> 00:08:47.782
THIS MAGIC CARD ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON AN EXTREMELY
POWERFUL MONSTER

00:08:47.782 --> 00:08:48.952
FROM EITHER MY DECK...

00:08:48.952 --> 00:08:50.121
MY HAND...

00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:51.423
OR MY GRAVEYARD.

00:08:51.423 --> 00:08:53.193
SO BEHOLD!

00:08:53.193 --> 00:08:55.499
ROYAL STRAIGHT SLASHER!

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.893
AND NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
MY ROYAL STRAIGHT SLASHER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:09:08.893 --> 00:09:13.034
NOW WHEN I SEND ONE MONSTER FROM
EACH OF THE FIRST FIVE LEVELS
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:09:13.034 --> 00:09:19.815
SLASHER DESTROYS EVERY CARD ON
MY OPPONENT'S SIDE OF THE FIELD!

00:09:19.815 --> 00:09:21.552
TRAP AND MAGIC CARDS
DON'T WORK,

00:09:21.552 --> 00:09:23.757
BUT MONSTER
ABILITIES DO!

00:09:23.757 --> 00:09:27.631
LEVEL ONE!
KURIBOH!

INCLUDING HIS GOLDEN CASTLE!

YES!

00:10:05.643 --> 00:10:07.113
SEE YA!

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:14.828
NO WAY!

00:10:14.828 --> 00:10:17.167
[ZIGFRIED LAUGHING]

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:18.770
IT'S STILL THERE!

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.008
ZIGFRIED WAS RIGHT!

00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:23.212
WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO DESTROY IT!

00:10:28.323 --> 00:10:30.843
Tea: HOW'S THAT CASTLE
STILL STANDING!?

00:10:30.843 --> 00:10:31.954
SHOULDN'T IT'VE
BEEN DESTROYED?

00:10:32.052 --> 00:10:33.062
SHOULDN'T IT'VE
BEEN DESTROYED?

00:10:33.062 --> 00:10:34.499
IT SHOULD BE
A SAND CASTLE!

00:10:34.499 --> 00:10:36.470
SURPRISE, SURPRISE!

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.075
NO!
DON'T EVEN TELL ME!

00:10:39.075 --> 00:10:41.647
WHEN ZIGFRIED OVERWROTE
THE CARD'S DATA TEXT,

00:10:41.647 --> 00:10:43.919
HE MUST'VE PROTECTED
HIS GOLDEN CASTLE

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:45.488
FROM MONSTER EFFECTS
ALSO!

00:10:45.488 --> 00:10:47.993
Tea: THAT MEANS THERE'S
NO WAY TO GET RID OF IT!

00:10:47.993 --> 00:10:49.463
THEN I GUESS
THE DUEL'S DONE...

00:10:49.463 --> 00:10:50.599
RIGHT YUGE!?

00:10:50.599 --> 00:10:52.469

TIME TRAVEL!

00:10:55.542 --> 00:10:59.116
IT ALLOWS ME TO TEMPORARILY
REMOVE ONE OF MY MONSTERS
FROM THE FIELD

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:02.423
UNTIL MY OPPONENT'S
TURN BEGINS.

00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:04.393
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

Zigfried:
HOW NOBLE OF YOU!

00:11:06.197 --> 00:11:10.005
YOUR MONSTER WOULD HAVE
BEEN FORCED TO ATTACK
AND LEON WOULD HAVE LOST.

00:11:10.005 --> 00:11:11.943
BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN.

00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:14.214
NOW LEON, BEGIN YOUR TURN

00:11:14.214 --> 00:11:19.324
SO YOU CAN CLAIM
THE CHAMPIONSHIP CROWN!

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:21.529
I BELIEVE IN YOU YUGI.

00:11:21.529 --> 00:11:24.001
Leon: I'M NOT SURE HOW
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT...

00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:26.873
BUT I KNOW YOU'LL PUT
AN END TO HIS PLAN.

00:11:26.873 --> 00:11:28.310
LET'S DO THIS!

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.278
NOW!

00:11:29.278 --> 00:11:31.684
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!

00:11:31.684 --> 00:11:35.625
DEPOSIT HALF YOUR DECK
IN THE GRAVEYARD TO KEEP
MY CASTLE IN PLAY!

00:11:35.625 --> 00:11:38.231
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:39.566
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT.

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:41.002
YOU MUST!

00:11:41.002 --> 00:11:43.007
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:11:43.007 --> 00:11:46.113
THERE'S ONLY ONE CARD
LEFT IN MY DECK.

00:11:46.113 --> 00:11:49.153
THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ME TO DEPOSIT HALF OF IT

00:11:49.153 --> 00:11:50.923
INTO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:11:50.923 --> 00:11:54.397
SO I SUPPOSE YOUR
GOLDEN CASTLE OF
STRONGBERG HAS TO GO!

00:11:54.397 --> 00:11:55.533
WHAT?

00:11:55.533 --> 00:12:02.080
THAT CAN'T BE!

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.850
YOU DID IT!

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.023
YOU MESS WITH THE BEST,
AND YOU FAIL
LIKE THE REST!

00:12:07.023 --> 00:12:09.762
IT SEEMED LIKE
THE PERFECT CARD.

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:11.799
ZIGFRIED DESIGNED IT
TO BE IMPERVIOUS

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:14.638
TO THE EFFECTS OF
EVERY OTHER CARD
IN THE GAME.

00:12:14.638 --> 00:12:16.609
BUT IN THE END
EVERYTHING HAS ITS WEAKNESS.

00:12:16.609 --> 00:12:17.879
RIGHT.

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:20.718
AND WITH YOUR GRANDSON'S
REFUSAL TO GIVE IN...

00:12:20.718 --> 00:12:24.058
HE WAS ABLE TO FIND IT.

00:12:24.058 --> 00:12:26.463
Kaiba: WE'VE GOT TO
CUT THIS THING OFF

00:12:26.463 --> 00:12:30.839
BEFORE ANY OTHER FILES
ARE DESTROYED!

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:32.275
GOOD NEWS!

DEAD IN ITS TRACKS!

LOOK.
THE CASTLE'S GONE.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.192
I GUESS YUGI FOUND
ITS WEAK SPOT AFTER ALL.

00:12:40.192 --> 00:12:42.163
SO EVERYTHING'S
SAFE NOW?

00:12:42.163 --> 00:12:46.772
WE'LL KNOW AS SOON AS WE LAUNCH
THE BACK-UP SYSTEM AND REBOOT
THE KC MAINFRAME.

00:12:46.772 --> 00:12:49.745
LET'S MOVE!

00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:51.615
Tristan: GET 'A LOAD
OF ZIG-FREAK!

00:12:51.615 --> 00:12:53.151
OH WELL.

AND YOU STILL LOST.

WAS ABLE TO DISMANTLE
MY GOLDEN CASTLE.

00:13:02.237 --> 00:13:05.176
BUT IN THE END
VICTORY WILL BE MINE!

00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:06.178
YEAH RIGHT.

ON THE CONTRARY
MY YOUNG AND FASHIONABLY
CHALLENGED FRIEND,

00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:13.260
MY CONQUEST
HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN!

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.499
YOU MAY HAVE STOPPED MY VIRUS
BUT NOT SOON ENOUGH!

00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:20.942
BY NOW MOST OF KAIBACORP'S
GAMING DATA HAS BEEN
PERMANENTLY LOST.

NOT TO MENTION YUGI
HAS ONE CARD LEFT!

00:13:23.915 --> 00:13:26.821
AND THIS DUEL
IS NOT OVER YET!

00:13:26.821 --> 00:13:30.963
WHEN HE'S UNABLE TO DRAW A CARD
IN HIS NEXT TURN
MY BROTHER WINS!

00:13:30.963 --> 00:13:34.203
I CAN'T LET YUGI LOSE.

00:13:34.203 --> 00:13:37.109
NOT WHEN MY BROTHER CHEATED HIM
OUT OF HIS TITLE.

00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:40.983
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
I CAN SAVE HIM.

00:13:40.983 --> 00:13:42.353
I'M QUITTING.

00:13:42.353 --> 00:13:43.956
Yugi:
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT!

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.593
NOW THAT YOU BROTHER'S
CASTLE IS GONE,

00:13:45.593 --> 00:13:47.497
THE REAL DUEL CAN BEGIN!

YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF
TO FULFILL YOUR DREAM

RIGHT!?

00:13:54.578 --> 00:13:55.981
RIGHT.

IT WAS YOUR MOVE.

BUT FIRST SINCE
THE EFFECT OF MY TIME
TRAVEL CARD IS OVER,

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.600
MY SLASHER RETURNS.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.106
NOW I ACTIVATE
MONSTER REBORN!

00:14:08.106 --> 00:14:13.217
AND I'LL USE IT
TO BRING CINDERELLA
BACK FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:14:13.217 --> 00:14:15.188
AND WITH HER BACK
IN ACTION

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:21.100
I CAN AUTOMATICALLY SUMMON
MY PUMPKIN CARRIAGE
TO THE FIELD!

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:27.346
THEN I'LL SACRIFICE CINDERELLA
AND PUMPKIN CARRIAGE!

00:14:27.346 --> 00:14:32.123
THAT ALLOWS ME TO CALL
HEXE TRUDE TO THE FIELD!

00:14:32.123 --> 00:14:33.425
ALRIGHT TRUDY!

00:14:33.425 --> 00:14:36.131
ATTACK HIS SLASHER!

00:14:42.511 --> 00:14:46.018
AND EVERY TIME MY HEXE TRUDE
BLOWS AWAY ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:50.460
HER ATTACK STRENGTH INCREASES
BY FOUR HUNDRED POINTS!

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.899
ALRIGHT YUGI,
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

00:14:52.899 --> 00:14:54.969
YUGI ONLY HAS ONE
CARD LEFT

00:14:54.969 --> 00:14:57.909
AND HE'S UP AGAINST
A MONSTA WITH
THREE THOUSAND POINTS!

00:14:57.909 --> 00:15:00.714
AND IF HE RUNS
OUTTA CARDS
HE LOSES!

00:15:00.714 --> 00:15:02.752
DUDE, I HATE TO SAY IT

00:15:02.752 --> 00:15:04.990
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S A NEW CHAMP
IN TOWN!

00:15:09.297 --> 00:15:10.500
THIS IS
MY LAST CHANCE.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.838
PLEASE

00:15:12.838 --> 00:15:14.208
GUIDE ME.

NOW...!

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:22.725
FIRST I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:15:22.725 --> 00:15:25.398
AND THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
THIS CARD!

00:15:25.398 --> 00:15:27.100
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS!

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.376
AS LONG AS I SEND ONE OF
MY MAGIC OR TRAP CARDS
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:15:31.376 --> 00:15:34.984
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS
WILL RESTORE A THOUSAND
OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:15:34.984 --> 00:15:36.988
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE THIS!

MONSTER REBORN!

00:15:38.525 --> 00:15:40.094
UH...BUT WHY?!

00:15:40.094 --> 00:15:43.401
I'LL USE IT
TO SUMMON A MONSTER
YOU MIGHT KNOW.

DARK MAGICIAN!

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:54.658
BUT WAIT HE ONLY HAS
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
ATTACK POINTS YUGI.

00:15:54.658 --> 00:15:57.997
AND MY HEXE TRUDE
HAS THREE THOUSAND!

00:15:57.997 --> 00:16:00.169
YES BUT NOW
I REVEAL THIS!

NECROMANCY!

00:16:01.538 --> 00:16:03.075
ITS SPECIAL EFFECT

00:16:03.075 --> 00:16:06.081
BRINGS BACK
FOUR RANDOM MONSTERS
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:09.054
THEN THEY'RE SUMMONED
TO YOUR SIDE OF THE
FIELD IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:09.054 --> 00:16:14.432
BUT YOUR HEXE TRUDE
WILL LOSE SIX HUNDRED
ATTACK POINTS

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:18.875
FOR EVERY ONE
OF THESE MONSTERS
THAT'S DESTROYED.

BY SACRIFICING
ONE THOUSAND OF
MY LIFE POINTS

DIFFUSION WAVE-MOTION
ALLOWS ME TO USE
MY DARK MAGICIAN

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:38.047
TO ATTACK EVERY ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:16:38.047 --> 00:16:40.018
NO! YOU CAN'T!

00:16:40.018 --> 00:16:41.253
I CAN!

00:16:41.253 --> 00:16:42.456
AND NOW I WILL!

UNDER THE TOUGHEST
OF CIRCUMSTANCES

IT WASN'T A TOTAL LOSS.

OF REPROGRAMMING

FOR KAIBACORP
TO RESTORE

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.794
SO THE ONLY LOSER HERE
IS YOU!

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:07.833
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:09.737
MY STRATEGY
WAS FLAWLESS!

00:18:09.737 --> 00:18:11.406
ZIGFRIED, WAIT.

00:18:11.406 --> 00:18:13.811
NOT NOW, LEON!

00:18:13.811 --> 00:18:16.517
LOOK, EVEN IF YOUR PLAN
DID WORK NOTHING
WOULD'VE CHANGED.

00:18:16.517 --> 00:18:21.327
CAN'T YOU SEE OUR FAMILY'S
OBSESSION WITH THE KAIBA'S
HAS RUINED US!

00:18:21.327 --> 00:18:24.901
WHAT'S RUINED US LEON,
IS THAT I'M WEAK!

00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:26.738
I'LL NEVER BEAT KAIBA!

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:29.611
THAT'S THE FIRST SENSIBLE THING
HE'S SAID ALL WEEK.

00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:32.182
ZIGFRIED, LISTEN.

00:18:32.182 --> 00:18:34.587
IT'S NOT OUR FAMILY'S
LOSSES THAT HURT US,

00:18:34.587 --> 00:18:35.790
IT'S OUR ATTITUDE.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.228
STRENGTH ISN'T
CRUSHING SOMEONE.

00:18:38.228 --> 00:18:40.901
SEE, DUELING YUGI
TAUGHT ME THAT
TRUE STRENGTH

00:18:40.901 --> 00:18:43.438
IS STICKING WITH IT
WHEN EVERYONE EXPECTS
YOU TO QUIT.

00:18:43.438 --> 00:18:46.612
SURE WE MAY LOSE
SOME OF OUR BUSINESS
TO KAIBACORP

00:18:46.612 --> 00:18:49.685
BUT LOSING IS A REASON
TO TRY HARDER NOT TO
GIVE UP, RIGHT?

00:18:49.685 --> 00:18:53.626
SO LET'S GO HOME
AND MAKE SCHROEDER CORP
THE BEST COMPANY WE CAN!

00:18:53.626 --> 00:18:55.630
THANK YOU LEON.

00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:02.110
ROLAND!

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.079
WRAP THIS UP!

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:06.620
Roland: RIGHT!

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.696
THE KC GRAND CHAMPIONSHIP
HAS COME TO A CLOSE!

00:19:10.696 --> 00:19:13.635
THE WINNER...
AND STILL WORLD CHAMP...

00:19:13.635 --> 00:19:15.304
IS YUGI MUTO!

00:19:15.304 --> 00:19:17.208
[CHANTING]
HE'S OUR MAN!

00:19:17.208 --> 00:19:19.247
HE'S OUR MAN!

00:19:19.247 --> 00:19:24.223
[CHANTING CONTINUES]

00:19:24.223 --> 00:19:27.664
YAY!

00:19:27.664 --> 00:19:31.304
YUGI!

00:19:36.014 --> 00:19:37.450
DAT WAS FUN.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:38.987
BUT I'M READY
TO GO BACK.

00:19:38.987 --> 00:19:41.025
AND I'M READY FOR
A HOME-COOKED MEAL!

00:19:41.025 --> 00:19:43.129
LET'S NOT DRAG OUT
THIS GOODBYE

00:19:43.129 --> 00:19:45.199
BECAUSE I'LL BE
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
IN A FEW WEEKS.

00:19:45.199 --> 00:19:47.137
COOL!
WHY'S THAT DUKE?

00:19:47.137 --> 00:19:49.041
I'VE GOT A DATE
WITH SERENITY!

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:51.146
Both: SAY WHAT!?

00:19:51.146 --> 00:19:54.118
AH, WHAT I WOULDN'T DO
TO BE A YOUNG MAN AGAIN.

00:19:54.118 --> 00:19:56.857
I STILL FEED AS NIMBLE
AS THE DAY I WAS BORN!

00:19:56.857 --> 00:19:58.427
MY BACK!

00:19:58.427 --> 00:20:01.266
I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THAT
YOU WERE SAYING?

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:02.669
YUGI...

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:04.907
DON'T FORGET YOU
PROMISED TO E-MAIL
ME TWICE A DAY

00:20:04.907 --> 00:20:06.377
AND VISIT
EVERY WEEKEND.

00:20:06.377 --> 00:20:07.779
SURE.

00:20:07.779 --> 00:20:09.516
IT'S BEEN INTERESTING
TO SAY THE LEAST.

00:20:09.516 --> 00:20:11.520
BYE SCHMOOPIE!!

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.157
REBECCA!

00:20:13.157 --> 00:20:16.397
AND TEA, I'M GONNA
MISS YOU TOO.

00:20:16.397 --> 00:20:17.700
UH-UH.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.136
I BET YOU ARE.

00:20:19.136 --> 00:20:21.441
HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING!?

00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:25.082
I HOOK YOU UP WITH OUR JET
AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE COURTESY
TO BOARD ON TIME!?

00:20:25.082 --> 00:20:27.320
OOPS.
SORRY ABOUT THAT!

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.589
Joey:
I CALL THE WINDOW SEAT!

00:20:28.589 --> 00:20:30.994
Tristan: COME ON
YOU GOT IT LAST TIME!

00:20:35.837 --> 00:20:37.374
Joey: SO NOW THAT YOU WON
THE CHAMPIONSHIP,

00:20:37.374 --> 00:20:38.476
WHAT'S NEXT?

00:20:38.476 --> 00:20:41.642
Yugi: WELL, JOEY,
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.
