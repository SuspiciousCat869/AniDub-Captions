WEBVTT

00:00:00.861 --> 00:00:03.196
Narrator: PREVIOUSLY,
ON YU-GI-OH...

00:00:07.598 --> 00:00:10.666
WELL, BY THE LOOK
OF THINGS, I'D SAY
WE'RE BACK!

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.467
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE ALRIGHT.

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.734
I'VE BEEN WORRIED SICK ABOUT
YOU SINCE THE MOMENT YOU

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.702
DISAPPEARED INTO THAT MAP.

00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:18.436
SO, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:20.437
IS THIS WHAT YOU MEANT?

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.537
YES!

00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:24.505
NO GRANDPA,
IT'S A TRICK!

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:28.373
IT'S TIME TO COMPLETE WHAT
I BEGAN CENTURIES AGO!

00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:34.710
I'VE STARED AT THIS
DOORWAY HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.844
HOWEVER, THIS TIME
I HOLD THE KEY.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:46.448
AT LONG LAST!

00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:47.715
STOP!

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:52.316
DUDE, WE WORKED TOO
HARD FOR THAT THING!

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:57.885
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:04.121
Yugi: LOOK GUYS!

00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:06.556
IT'S SHADI!

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:08.590
Joey: BUT WHAT'S
HE DOIN' HERE?

00:01:13.993 --> 00:01:15.526
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE ♪

00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:16.793
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE ♪

00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:17.994
♪ YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:22.630
♪ YU-GI-OH ♪

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:40.370
♪ YOUR MOVE ♪

00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:45.072
♪ YU-GI-OH ♪

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.707
IT'S TIME
TO DUEL!

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.581
♪ YU-GI-OH ♪

00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:17.985
YOU NOW STAND AT
THE THRESHOLD OF A POWER

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:20.453
GREATER THAN ANYTHING
YOU COULD IMAGINE.

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:22.521
YEAH BUT ALL WE REALLY
WANT IS TO IS GO HOME.

00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:23.921
THEN GO!

00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:26.622
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT
POWER FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS

00:02:26.622 --> 00:02:28.024
AND NOW IT'S MINE!

00:02:28.024 --> 00:02:29.890
WE'RE THE ONES THAT
DID ALL THE WORK!

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.091
DAT'S RIGHT!

00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:33.325
SO WHATEVER'S IN HERE
BELONGS TA US, PAL!

00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:34.693
REALLY?

00:02:34.693 --> 00:02:37.027
I SEE NO ONE TOLD YOU THAT
I ALREADY PASSED THESE FIVE

00:02:37.027 --> 00:02:40.528
TRIALS CENTURIES AGO!

00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:44.163
I REACHED THE PYRAMID'S SECRET
CHAMBER JUST AS YOU DID.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.898
BUT THE DOORWAY WOULDN'T OPEN.

00:02:46.898 --> 00:02:52.100
I WAS ROBBED OF MY PRIZE!

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.200
MY LORD.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.068
PERHAPS THIS
WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

00:02:55.068 --> 00:02:56.135
WHAT?!

00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:57.802
YOU LACK FAITH
IN ME?

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.604
WE HAVE DONE
ALL WE CAN SIR.

00:03:00.604 --> 00:03:02.437
THEY'RE RIGHT,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

00:03:02.437 --> 00:03:03.772
I HAVE
A STRONG FEELING

00:03:03.772 --> 00:03:05.439
THAT THIS TEST
WAS JUST A TRICK

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.906
AND THE POWER YOU SEEK
DOESN'T BELONG

00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:08.607
IN THE HANDS OF ANY MAN

00:03:08.607 --> 00:03:11.441
REGARDLESS OF HOW STRONG
A LEADER HE MAY BE!

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.908
I SEE.

00:03:12.908 --> 00:03:15.743
SO WHAT YOU PEOPLE ARE
SAYING IS THAT I'M NOT WORTHY

00:03:15.743 --> 00:03:17.811
OF THE POWER I WAS PROMISED!!

00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:20.845
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT
POWER IS TOO DANGEROUS

00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:23.013
FOR A MERE MORTAL
TO CONTROL.

00:03:23.013 --> 00:03:24.614
YOU ARE A GREAT LEADER,

00:03:24.614 --> 00:03:26.614
AND THE FACT THAT
YOU PASSED THESE TRIALS

00:03:26.614 --> 00:03:28.315
IS TESTAMENT TO THAT.

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:30.482
BUT PLEASE, LET US
LEAVE THIS PLACE

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:33.950
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.152
YOU HAVE ALREADY AMASSED
A GREAT EMPIRE, MY KING.

00:03:37.152 --> 00:03:38.619
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH!?

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.387
IT'S NEVER ENOUGH!
AAH!

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:42.421
ARE YOU ALRIGHT!?

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:45.955
KING ALEXANDROS!

00:03:45.955 --> 00:03:47.690
Alex, voice-over:
AS MY RAGE GREW,

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.991
THE TWO SIDES OF
MY SOUL BEGAN THE STRUGGLE

00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:53.292
FOR CONTROL.

00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:56.827
I AWOKE TO A STARTLING SCENE.

00:03:56.827 --> 00:03:59.494
THE SOULS OF MY VASSALS
HAD BEEN TAKEN...

00:03:59.494 --> 00:04:01.362
TRAPPED WITHIN
THE PYRAMID.

00:04:01.362 --> 00:04:03.596
AND I WAS NEXT.

00:04:15.134 --> 00:04:20.870
MY VERY SPIRIT WAS
THEN SPLIT IN TWO!

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.272
MY WEAK HALF ENTERED THE
WORLD OF THE CAPSULE MONSTERS,

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:26.539
WHILE I WAS TRAPPED
IN THIS PYRAMID...

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.374
WHERE I WAITED
FOR A CHANCE TO ESCAPE.

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:32.041
TWO MILLENNIA LATER,

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:35.109
THAT OPPORTUNITY AROSE.

00:04:35.109 --> 00:04:37.177
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:40.445
YES.

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:42.913
Alex, voice-over:
FATE HAD SENT A DISTANT
DESCENDANT OF MINE

00:04:42.913 --> 00:04:44.480
TO RESCUE ME.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.548
I WOULD FINALLY GET
A SECOND CHANCE!

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:54.984
AAH!

00:04:54.984 --> 00:05:02.021
HA HA HA HA!

00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:04.655
AT LAST I HAD THE BODY
NECESSARY TO FINISH

00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:08.824
WHAT I BEGAN.

00:05:08.824 --> 00:05:12.092
ALL I NEEDED NOW WAS SOMEONE
CAPABLE OF CLEARING THE FIVE

00:05:12.092 --> 00:05:15.393
TESTS, JUST AS I HAD.

00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:17.127
SO I WAITED.

00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:20.095
FOR I KNEW IF THE POWER THAT
HAD ELUDED ME FOR SO LONG WAS

00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:24.364
TRULY MEANT TO BE
MINE...HELP WOULD ARRIVE.

00:05:24.364 --> 00:05:27.398
Tristan: THAT WAS
ENOUGH EXCITEMENT
TO LAST THE WHOLE TRIP.

00:05:27.398 --> 00:05:29.432
Tea: THE PILOT SENT
A DISTRESS SIGNAL

00:05:29.432 --> 00:05:30.566
BUT HE SAID IT MAY
TAKE A WHILE

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:32.367
BEFORE
SOMEONE SHOWS UP.

00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:35.735
Alex, voice-over:
NOW EVERYTHING WAS IN PLACE.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.902
SO ALL THAT STUFF
HAPPENED BY
COINCIDENCE?!

00:05:37.902 --> 00:05:41.537
NO. THESE EVENTS WERE GUIDED
BY THE HANDS OF FATE.

00:05:41.537 --> 00:05:43.971
YOU GOTTA BE OUTTA
YOUR TURBAN BRO!

00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:47.073
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
FATE WANTS THAT GUY
TO WIN THIS!

00:05:47.073 --> 00:05:49.207
HE DOESN'T DESERVE
JACK SQUAT!

00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:51.742
THERE IS BUT ONE WAY TO
DETERMINE WHICH OF YOU IS

00:05:51.742 --> 00:05:54.509
DESERVING OF THE
GAME'S ULTIMATE PRIZE.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.811
YOU MUST BOTH PARTICIPATE
IN ONE FINAL TEST!

00:05:58.811 --> 00:06:01.145
ANOTHER CHALLENGE!?

00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:03.947
YES. DR. ALEX BRISBANE,

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:06.714
WHO BEARS THE SOUL
OF KING ALEXANDROS
THE THIRD,

00:06:06.714 --> 00:06:09.216
SHALL FACE YUGI MUTO,
WHO BEARS THE SOUL

00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:12.083
OF THE GREAT NAMELESS PHARAOH,
IN AN ALL-OUT CAPSULE

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:13.851
MONSTERS WAR!

00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:16.351
ONLY THE TRUE KING
SHALL PREVAIL!

00:06:16.351 --> 00:06:17.819
NOW...BEGIN!

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.919
[ECHO] BEGIN!

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.221
THIS ISN'T GOING TO
TAKE VERY LONG.

00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:24.589
SOON I'LL HAVE WHAT'S
RIGHTFULLY MINE!

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:25.822
YEAH!?

00:06:25.822 --> 00:06:28.390
WELL NOT OF THE FIVE
MUSKETEERS CAN HELP IT!

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.691
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:33.059
YOU'RE OUT-NUMBERED
PAL!

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.259
WAIT!

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.594
I NEED TO DO
THIS ALONE GUYS.

00:06:36.594 --> 00:06:38.761
I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU IN
ANY MORE DANGER THAN I

00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:40.762
ALREADY HAVE!

00:06:40.762 --> 00:06:44.130
Tristan: YOU REALLY HAFTA GET
YOURSELF A NEW LINE, DUDE!

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.398
FACE IT.

00:06:45.398 --> 00:06:48.132
YOU'RE STUCK WITH US
'TIL THE BITTER END!

00:06:48.132 --> 00:06:50.599
I GUESS IF I'M GONNA STOP THIS
CREEP FROM TAKING OVER

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:53.968
THE WORLD I NEED ALL THE
HELP I CAN GET.

00:06:53.968 --> 00:06:59.536
IT'S TIME TO TEACH HIM
HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED!

00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:05.973
NOW, LET THE BATTLE COMMENCE!

00:07:05.973 --> 00:07:07.273
Tristan: AH, JOEY!?

00:07:07.273 --> 00:07:10.441
WHAT WAS THAT YOU SAID ABOUT
HIM BEING OUT-NUMBERED!?

00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:25.475
HE BROUGHT
HIS ROYAL GUARD!

00:07:25.475 --> 00:07:28.709
WELL...GUESS IT'S
FIVE ON FIVE.

00:07:35.911 --> 00:07:38.580
THE RULES OF THIS
TRIAL ARE SIMPLE.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.447
YOU MAY SUMMON ANY AND ALL
CAPSULE MONSTERS YOU MANAGED

00:07:41.447 --> 00:07:43.215
TO COLLECT ON YOUR JOURNEY.

00:07:43.215 --> 00:07:46.149
YOU LOSE...WHEN
THEY'RE ALL DESTROYED.

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:48.817
THE VICTOR WILL THEN CLAIM
THE POWER NECESSARY TO CONTROL

00:07:48.817 --> 00:07:49.817
THE WORLD!

00:07:49.817 --> 00:07:50.952
IF HE WINS

00:07:50.952 --> 00:07:52.819
THE WHOLE
PLANET
WILL SUFFER!

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:54.786
THEN IT'S A GOOD
THING HE WON'T!

00:07:54.786 --> 00:07:55.787
GOOD CALL!

00:07:55.787 --> 00:07:57.287
NOW LET'S DO THIS!

00:07:57.287 --> 00:08:02.757

DARK WITCH!

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:53.294
TIME TO SHINE A
SPOTLIGHT ON THESE DIVAS!

00:10:53.294 --> 00:10:59.430

WELL I WAS THE HIDE-AND-SEEK
CHAMP BACK IN MY DAY!

00:11:20.772 --> 00:11:24.340

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.976

00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:50.518
MY LOYAL SERVANTS...YOU

NOW DISMISSED!

00:11:56.954 --> 00:11:58.222
THAT'S STRANGE.

00:11:58.222 --> 00:12:01.223
WHY WOULD HE LAUNCH AN
ATTACK AGAINST HIS OWN TEAM?

00:12:01.223 --> 00:12:05.691
AAH!

00:12:27.992 --> 00:12:30.060
ANY IDEA HOW TO HANDLE
THIS THING?

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.028
WELL IN THE BOARD
GAME IT'S PRACTICALLY
INDESTRUCTIBLE.

00:12:33.028 --> 00:12:34.828
Tristan: BUT IF WE'VE
LEARNED ANYTHING FROM
PLAYING THIS GAME

00:12:34.828 --> 00:12:37.330
IT'S THAT EVERY MONSTER
HAS ITS WEAKNESS.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.897
AS A WISE MAN ONCE SAID,
"THE BIGGER THEY ARE...

00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:42.165
DA HARDER THEY FALL!"

00:12:42.165 --> 00:12:43.232
[GASP]

00:12:43.232 --> 00:12:45.299

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:01.440
NOW I REMEMBER
WHY THAT MONSTER

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.573
IS SO HARD TO
DESTROY!

00:13:03.573 --> 00:13:05.141
EACH ONE OF ITS
SEVEN ARMS

00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:07.075
HAS ITS OWN
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:13:07.075 --> 00:13:11.177
RIGHT YOU ARE!
AND I SHALL INTRODUCE
YOU TO THEM ONE BY ONE!

00:13:11.177 --> 00:13:13.944

NOW WHAT?!

00:13:56.163 --> 00:13:57.229

"ARM OF DESTRUCTION!"

00:15:11.727 --> 00:15:13.195

PLEASE HURRY!

00:15:23.532 --> 00:15:25.300
RUN WHILE YOU CAN!

00:15:33.362 --> 00:15:37.396
Yami-Yugi:

00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:40.398
YOU THREE SAVED ME!

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:43.166
YOU SACRIFICED YOUR OWN
SAFETY....TO PROTECT

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:45.333
AN OLD MAN.

00:15:45.333 --> 00:15:47.268
GOODBYE, PAL!

00:15:47.268 --> 00:15:49.202
THANKS THUNDER KID!

00:15:49.202 --> 00:15:51.402
WE'LL MISS YOU GUYS!

00:15:58.539 --> 00:15:59.906
THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME.

00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:01.540
IF WE DON'T ACT QUICKLY

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.608
ALL OF OUR MONSTERS'LL
MEET THE SAME
FATE AS THOSE GUYS!

00:16:04.608 --> 00:16:09.210
ALRIGHT! ENOUGH
OF THIS NONSENSE!
THE WAR IS OVER!

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.744
MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY!

00:16:11.744 --> 00:16:13.411

ATTAAAAACK!

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.448
YOU'RE MORE FOOLISH THAN
I HAD THOUGHT.

00:16:20.448 --> 00:16:23.049
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT EACH
OF MY MONSTER'S ARMS HAS ITS

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:26.084
OWN UNIQUE ABILITY?

00:16:26.084 --> 00:16:32.953
ACTIVATE "ARM OF
CLAIRVOYANCE!"

00:16:32.953 --> 00:16:34.454
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:37.388
MY FIEND ALLOWS ME TO READ
YOUR MIND AND THEREFORE

00:16:37.388 --> 00:16:40.323
ANTICIPATE YOUR EVERY MOVE!

00:16:40.323 --> 00:16:42.524
WAIT!
I'VE GOT A PLAN!

00:16:42.524 --> 00:16:44.991
WE MUST DIVIDE AND CONQUER!

00:16:44.991 --> 00:16:47.059
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:47.059 --> 00:16:48.927
CLEARLY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:16:48.927 --> 00:16:54.096
MY MONSTER CAN SEE ALL!

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:59.598
FRONT! RIGHT! LEFT!

00:16:59.598 --> 00:17:02.499

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:09.969
FLAME SWORDSMAN!

00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:13.503
NOW THAT'S WHAT I
CALL A BULL'S-EYE!

00:17:13.503 --> 00:17:15.871
Alex: NO ONE LIKES
A BACKSTABBER!

00:17:15.871 --> 00:17:20.107
HA HA HA!

00:17:20.107 --> 00:17:21.207
HEY RED-EYES!

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:26.375
ATTACK WITH
INFERNO FIRE BLAST!

00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:27.576
THANKS PAL.

00:17:27.576 --> 00:17:29.877
WE COULDN'T 'A DONE
THIS WITHOUT YA.

00:17:38.948 --> 00:17:42.015
THOSE GOONS...ARE GONNA PAY!

00:17:42.015 --> 00:17:44.416
WATCH YOUR BACK!

00:17:44.416 --> 00:17:48.985
RAPID-FIRE FLAME STRIKE!

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:52.120
I TOLD YA, YUGE...WE CAN
HANDLE THIS GANG 'A GHOULS...

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.653
YOU CONCENTRATE ON THAT
OVER-SIZED SCRAP HEAP!

00:17:54.653 --> 00:17:55.821
HE'S RIGHT!

00:17:55.821 --> 00:17:56.921
YOU GO!

00:17:56.921 --> 00:17:58.055
GOOD LUCK!

00:17:58.055 --> 00:17:59.223
ALRIGHT YUGI.

00:17:59.223 --> 00:18:01.190
WE MUSTN'T
LET THEM DOWN.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.224
ANY IDEA WHAT TO DO?

00:18:03.224 --> 00:18:04.325
YES.

00:18:04.325 --> 00:18:05.825
TO START WITH, WE
NEED TO FIGURE OUT

00:18:05.825 --> 00:18:08.826
A WAY AROUND THAT
"DEFENSE ARM."

00:18:08.826 --> 00:18:11.128
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS
HE CAN READ OUR MINDS

00:18:11.128 --> 00:18:13.895
AND THEREFORE
PREDICT OUR STRATEGY.

00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:17.263
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY
TO CONFUSE HIM?

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:20.198
I THINK YOU MAY BE ON
TO SOMETHING, YUGI.

00:18:25.434 --> 00:18:28.168
YOU FOOLS ARE
WASTING YOUR TIME.

00:18:28.168 --> 00:18:29.902
YOU CAN'T WIN.

00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:31.402
SEVEN-ARMED FIEND!

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:35.238
PREPARE TO ATTACK!

00:18:35.238 --> 00:18:37.838
Alex: LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE
OUR FIRST VICTIM.

00:18:37.838 --> 00:18:38.939
Yami-Yugi: WAIT!

00:18:38.939 --> 00:18:41.540
I'M THE ONE YOU
WANT, NOT HIM!

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.040
WAIT PAL!

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.975
GO! THIS IS OUR CHANCE!

00:18:44.975 --> 00:18:46.909
LET'S HOPE THIS WORKS.

00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:49.643
UH!

00:18:49.643 --> 00:18:54.279
NOW...WHY DON'T WE SEE WHAT'S
ON YOUR MIND, SHALL WE?

00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:55.679
WHAT?!

00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:57.147
WHERE AM I?

00:18:57.147 --> 00:19:02.349
THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY BE
THE PHARAOH'S MIND!

00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:04.683
[ROAR]

00:19:04.683 --> 00:19:05.950
YOU WERE RIGHT!

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.085
SINCE YOUR MIND IS LINKED TO
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:19:08.085 --> 00:19:10.952
YOU WERE ABLE TO
TRAP HIM INSIDE IT!

00:19:17.488 --> 00:19:19.723
NOW HE CAN'T
PREDICT OUR MOVES!

00:19:19.723 --> 00:19:22.457
AND WE CAN BRING
DOWN THIS BEHEMOTH!

00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:31.194
THIS LABYRINTH
IS NEVER ENDING!

00:19:31.194 --> 00:19:37.596
EACH DOORWAY LEADS TO
HUNDREDS OF OTHERS!

00:19:37.596 --> 00:19:39.165
I'M TRAPPED!

00:19:39.165 --> 00:19:42.299
IF I DON'T FIND A WAY OUT OF
THIS MAZE I'LL LOSE THE GAME!

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:43.766
NO!
