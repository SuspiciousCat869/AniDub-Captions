THE PIECES AND MOVE ON.

WE'LL HAVE THIS CITY
REBUILT IN NO TIME.

00:18:57.081 --> 00:18:58.850
Atem: IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE EASY,

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.854
BUT THIS KINGDOM SHALL
RETURN TO ITS FORMER GLORY.

00:19:02.854 --> 00:19:05.857
AND YOU WILL SEE TO IT
THAT THIS OCCURS, SETO.

00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:06.958

00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.826
I WILL BE
LEAVING THIS WORLD.

00:19:08.826 --> 00:19:10.895

TAKING THE THRONE.

00:19:10.895 --> 00:19:12.797

00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:20.438
BUT AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

00:19:20.438 --> 00:19:22.240
THIS KINGDOM NEEDS
A STRONG LEADER

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.474
TO MOVE US AHEAD.

00:19:23.474 --> 00:19:24.776
AND WHO BETTER TO
LEAD THIS NATION

00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:26.177

[THINKING]
THE TRUTH IS,

00:19:29.113 --> 00:19:31.282
I HAVE NO MEMORIES
BEYOND THIS POINT,

00:19:31.282 --> 00:19:33.618
SO I CAN NO LONGER
EXIST HERE.

00:19:33.618 --> 00:19:36.220
MY TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.222

THE LAND OF EGYPT.

00:19:46.697 --> 00:19:48.232
TRUST THE LIGHT
IN YOUR SOUL.

00:19:48.232 --> 00:19:52.336

00:19:52.336 --> 00:19:54.138
AND NOW, I
LEAVE YOU THIS

00:19:54.138 --> 00:19:56.574

MY FATHER'S DREAM.

00:19:58.876 --> 00:20:01.212
AND MAINTAIN
PEACE IN EGYPT.

00:20:01.212 --> 00:20:03.414
YES, MY KING.

00:20:03.414 --> 00:20:05.683
IT IS YOU
WHO IS NOW KING.

00:20:05.683 --> 00:20:11.622
[GASPS]

00:20:11.622 --> 00:20:14.459
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS?

00:20:14.459 --> 00:20:15.460
