00:08:49.687 --> 00:08:51.289
WELL IT APPEARS TO BE
A SWORD...

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:53.291
EMBEDDED
IN THAT VOLCANO.

00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:54.459
PERHAPS IT'S
THE SAME ONE

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:56.394
THAT WAS MENTIONED
IN THE RIDDLE.

00:08:56.394 --> 00:08:58.730
THE BLADE OF CHAOS!

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.931
WELL ACCORDING TO
THE RIDDLE

00:08:59.931 --> 00:09:01.132
WE NEED TO
"RELEASE" IT

00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:02.967
IN ORDER TO
"BRING ABOUT PEACE."

00:09:02.967 --> 00:09:04.269
GET IT?
THE "CHAOS"

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:06.204
MUST REFER
TO THE MOLTEN LAVA

00:09:06.204 --> 00:09:09.107
THAT'S FLOWING FROM
THIS MONSTROSITY.

00:09:09.107 --> 00:09:11.476
DOES THAT MEANS IF
WE CAN SOMEHOW
FIGURE OUT

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:12.677
HOW TO REMOVE
THAT SWORD

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.679
THE VOLCANO
WILL STOP ERUPTING?

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:18.883
YUP. AND WE ACE
THE TEST!

00:09:18.883 --> 00:09:20.518
Tristan:
LET'S DRAW STRAWS

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:21.786
TO SEE WHO'S GOING
TO THE TOP.

00:09:21.786 --> 00:09:24.289
Tea: TRISTAN!
WE'RE ALL GOING!

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:26.991
NO I'M AFRAID IT'S
MUCH TOO DANGEROUS.

00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:29.661
SINCE I HAVE
THE ARMOR, I'LL GO.

00:09:29.661 --> 00:09:31.229
THE REST
OF YOU WAIT HERE.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:45.310
UNH!

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.612
IS THAT WHO I
THINK IT IS!?

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.355
Yami-Yugi: JOEY!?

00:09:59.355 --> 00:10:00.623
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU!?

00:10:00.623 --> 00:10:02.958
HA HA HA!

00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.195
DON'T PLAY DUMB
WITH ME.

00:10:06.195 --> 00:10:08.697
IT'S THE SAME THING
THAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

00:10:08.697 --> 00:10:10.966
UNH! AAH!

00:10:18.307 --> 00:10:22.144
I MERGED TOGETHER
WITH MY FAVORITE MONSTER!

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:24.647
AND NOW THAT I'VE GOTTEN
A LITTLE POWER BOOST...

00:10:24.647 --> 00:10:26.415
I FIGURE I'LL BE
FINISHING UP THIS GAME

00:10:26.415 --> 00:10:28.217
WITHOUT YOU LOSERS.

00:10:28.217 --> 00:10:29.585
OH YEAH!?

00:10:29.585 --> 00:10:31.620
EASY NOW.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.056
THAT'S NOT JOEY
TALKING.

00:10:34.056 --> 00:10:37.293
HE MUST BE
UNDER THE CONTROL
OF AN EVIL FORCE.

00:10:37.293 --> 00:10:38.561
NOT AGAIN.

00:10:38.561 --> 00:10:39.929
SNAP OUT OF IT!

00:10:39.929 --> 00:10:42.298
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
'CAUSE I'M STRONGER!

00:10:42.298 --> 00:10:45.968
AND NOW...I'LL PROVE IT!

00:10:45.968 --> 00:10:47.536
UNH!

00:10:47.536 --> 00:10:48.804
MY FRIENDS!

00:10:48.804 --> 00:10:50.506
WHY DON'T YA TRY
WORRYIN' ABOUT YOURSELF

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:51.774
FOR A CHANGE!

00:10:51.774 --> 00:10:53.642
HYAH!

00:10:53.642 --> 00:10:55.144
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

00:10:55.144 --> 00:10:59.014
UNH! AAH!

00:10:59.014 --> 00:11:00.983
YOU MUST STOP THIS!

00:11:00.983 --> 00:11:02.051
BELIEVE ME,
YOU'RE NOT

00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:08.724
IN YOUR RIGHT MIND!

00:11:08.724 --> 00:11:11.460
WE CAN'T FIGHT AGAINST
OUR BEST FRIEND!

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.629
HE ISN'T GIVING US
MUCH OF A CHOICE!

00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:16.332
HA HA HA!

00:11:16.332 --> 00:11:19.902
[THINKING]
I'M SORRY, JOEY,
BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:11:19.902 --> 00:11:23.405
HYAH!

00:11:23.405 --> 00:11:25.508
SO THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA BE!

00:11:25.508 --> 00:11:26.842
BIG MISTAKE!

00:11:26.842 --> 00:11:29.879
HYAH! UNH!

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:33.082
JOEY! I KNOW YOU'RE
IN THERE SOMEWHERE!

00:11:33.082 --> 00:11:36.919
FACE IT! THE JOEY
YOU KNEW IS GONE!

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:38.621
[THINKING]
WAIT! WHAT AM I DOING?

00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:40.756
SOMETHING HAPPENED WHEN
I FUSED WITH RED-EYES,

00:11:40.756 --> 00:11:42.625
AND NOW I CAN'T
CONTROL MYSELF!

00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:44.927
I GOTTA...BREAK FREE!

00:11:44.927 --> 00:11:47.229
YUGI! I DON'T WANNA
FIGHT YA, PAL!

00:11:47.229 --> 00:11:49.031
BUT I'M TRAPPED
AND THIS ARMOR SEEMS TO HAVE

00:11:49.031 --> 00:11:50.733
A MIND OF ITS OWN!

00:11:58.507 --> 00:12:00.943
LOOK! THE SWORD!

00:12:00.943 --> 00:12:02.511
THAT'S NOT GOOD!

00:12:02.511 --> 00:12:04.680
IT'S SINKING
EVEN DEEPER NOW!

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.814
OH NO!

00:12:05.814 --> 00:12:07.383
THERE ISN'T MUCH
TIME LEFT.

00:12:07.383 --> 00:12:12.054
SOMEONE'S GOT
TO REMOVE
THAT SWORD NOW!

00:12:12.054 --> 00:12:14.557
IT LOOKS LIKE YUGI'S
GOT HIS HANDS FULL.

00:12:14.557 --> 00:12:16.625
THEN WE HAVE NO
CHOICE BUT TO PULL
THAT SWORD OUT

00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:18.127
BY OURSELVES.

00:12:18.127 --> 00:12:20.696
WISH ME LUCK!

00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:25.467
Joey: LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
GOT ANOTHER HERO.

00:12:25.467 --> 00:12:27.336
TRISTAN!

00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:28.337
THAT'S FOR ALL
THE CHEAP SHOTS

00:12:28.337 --> 00:12:30.172
YOU'VE TAKEN AT ME!

00:12:30.172 --> 00:12:31.941
[GROANING]

00:12:31.941 --> 00:12:33.008
TAKE IT EASY!

00:12:33.008 --> 00:12:34.276
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

00:12:34.276 --> 00:12:38.814
I THINK SO.

00:12:38.814 --> 00:12:41.417
C'MON! IF WE DON'T
PULL THAT SWORD OUT NOW,

00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:47.790
WE'LL NEVER PASS
THIS TEST.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.760
[ALL GROANING]

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.862
GREAT. IT'S STUCK.

00:12:53.862 --> 00:12:56.098
HA HA HA!

00:12:56.098 --> 00:13:03.138
TEA! GRANDPA! TRISTAN!

00:13:03.138 --> 00:13:05.174
TIME FOR A CHANGE
OF STRATEGY.

00:13:05.174 --> 00:13:06.642
WAIT WHATTA YA MEAN?

00:13:06.642 --> 00:13:08.210
JOEY'S TOO STRONG.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.411
SO NOW WHAT?

00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:11.213
WE NEED TO
TAKE HIM DOWN!

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.521
THE ONLY WAY TO GET
TO THAT SWORD...

00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:22.625
IS BY GETTING JOEY
OUT OF OUR WAY.

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:27.930
READY?

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.766
IN ORDER FOR THIS
TO WORK, I NEED
YOUR HELP.

00:13:30.766 --> 00:13:34.570
THE THREE OF US
NEED TO ATTACK
HIM SIMULTANEOUSLY.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.472
ARE YOU SERIOUS!?

00:13:36.472 --> 00:13:38.140
HE'LL GET HURT.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.511
PERHAPS.

00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:45.247
IT'S A CHANCE
WE HAFTA TAKE.

00:13:45.247 --> 00:13:46.882
ALRIGHT. LET'S GO!

00:13:46.882 --> 00:13:50.519
LOAD CAPSULE!
LOAD CAPSULE!

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:53.422
GO, THUNDER KID!

00:13:53.422 --> 00:13:56.525
AND THUNDER DRAGON!

00:13:56.525 --> 00:13:59.795
I CALL MY DARK WITCH!

00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:04.266
ALRIGHT...DON'T FIRE AT JOEY
UNTIL WE HAVE A CLEAR SHOT.

00:14:04.266 --> 00:14:07.002
I DON'T KNOW IF
I CAN GO THROUGH
WITH THIS, GUYS.

00:14:07.002 --> 00:14:09.138
I MEAN, IF WE DEFEAT
JOEY, HE COULD BE

00:14:09.138 --> 00:14:12.041
TRAPPED IN THIS
PLACE FOREVER!

00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:15.044
SO WE SHOULD
JUST STAND HERE
AND DO NOTHING?

00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:16.745
THEN WE'LL NEVER
COMPLETE THIS
CHALLENGE,

00:14:16.745 --> 00:14:19.415
AND WE'LL ALL BE
STUCK HERE FOREVER!

00:14:19.415 --> 00:14:20.849
I KNOW THIS
IS DIFFICULT,

00:14:20.849 --> 00:14:23.118
BUT IT'S THE
ONLY OPTION
WE'VE GOT LEFT.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.286
[THINKING]
JOEY. I KNOW THE REAL YOU

00:14:31.286 --> 00:14:34.522
IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE,
AND I'M GONNA SET YOU FREE!

00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:51.973
Joey: YUGI. YOU GOTTA
HELP ME, PAL.

00:14:51.973 --> 00:14:53.775
SURE. BUT HOW?

00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:55.543
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:14:55.543 --> 00:14:58.279
SOMETHIN' WAS WRONG
WITH THAT DRAGON'S MIND.

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:02.250
SO WHEN WE MERGED
TOGETHER I GOT INFECTED.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.219
WAIT, SO NOW I
HAVE TO BREAK
WHATEVER SPELL

00:15:04.219 --> 00:15:07.355
WAS CONTROLLING
THE RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON?

00:15:07.355 --> 00:15:09.557
DAT'S RIGHT AND
YOU WANNA KNOW HOW?

00:15:09.557 --> 00:15:11.392
DESTROY IT.

00:15:11.392 --> 00:15:13.328
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

00:15:13.328 --> 00:15:16.131
BUT...THAT MEANS
I'D BE DESTROYING
YOU ALSO.

00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:17.398
I KNOW, PAL.

00:15:17.398 --> 00:15:19.267
BUT YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

00:15:19.267 --> 00:15:25.306
IF YOU DON'T DO THIS,
THE GAME'S OVER.

00:15:25.306 --> 00:15:26.775
WE HAVE TO PULL
OUT THAT SWORD

00:15:26.775 --> 00:15:29.911
BEFORE IT SINKS
INTO THE VOLCANO!

00:15:29.911 --> 00:15:33.348
NOT ON MY WATCH,
TRISTAN.

00:15:33.348 --> 00:15:35.650
IT'S NOW OR NEVER
SO PREPARE TO STRIKE!

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.653
WAIT! I CAN'T DO IT.

00:15:38.653 --> 00:15:41.189
THERE'S GOTTA BE
ANOTHER WAY.

00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:42.924
Yami-Yugi: I'LL DO IT.

00:15:42.924 --> 00:15:46.394
YUGI. ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANNA GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

00:15:46.394 --> 00:15:47.562
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

00:15:47.562 --> 00:15:49.097
GIMME A BREAK.

00:15:49.097 --> 00:15:54.969
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE GUTS, YUGI.

00:15:54.969 --> 00:15:57.505
YOU WANNA SEE SOME
REAL MOVES WATCH THIS!

00:15:57.505 --> 00:16:00.241
Joey, voice-over:
OH NO YA DON'T!
IT'S OVER, PAL!

00:16:00.241 --> 00:16:01.976
WHO'S THERE!?

00:16:01.976 --> 00:16:04.679
WHY CAN'T I MOVE
MY ARMS!?

00:16:04.679 --> 00:16:08.683
DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER
TEACH YA NOT TO
BRAINWASH PEOPLE!?

00:16:08.683 --> 00:16:10.885
STOP! LET GO!

00:16:10.885 --> 00:16:13.488

ARE YOU ALRIGHT, MAN!?

00:16:27.302 --> 00:16:30.805
JOEY!

00:16:30.805 --> 00:16:32.073
HE'S OKAY!

00:16:32.073 --> 00:16:33.107
IT WORKED, GUYS!

00:16:33.107 --> 00:16:34.642
SO HE'S BACK?!

00:16:34.642 --> 00:16:36.311
Grandpa: HOLD ON!

00:16:36.311 --> 00:16:38.146
DON'T START CELEBRATING
JUST YET!

00:16:38.146 --> 00:16:39.514
WE FAILED!

00:16:39.514 --> 00:16:41.983
THE SWORD IS SINKING!

00:16:41.983 --> 00:16:43.418
YOU'RE KIDDING!

00:16:43.418 --> 00:16:45.620
THE TEST IS OVER?

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.324
WE SAVED JOEY,
BUT WE RAN OUT
OF TIME.

00:16:49.324 --> 00:16:53.595
NOW WE'LL
NEVER GET HOME.

00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:56.197
[ROARS]

00:16:56.197 --> 00:16:58.132
IT'S RED-EYES

00:16:58.132 --> 00:17:02.637
HE'S STILL ALIVE!

00:17:02.637 --> 00:17:05.206
GO MAGIC CYLINDER!

00:17:05.206 --> 00:17:10.078
REDIRECT HIS ATTACK!

[ROARS]

00:17:20.722 --> 00:17:24.626
IT'S TIME
TO END THIS.

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.060
JOEY, WAIT!

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.664
WHAT'RE YOU DOING!?

00:17:29.664 --> 00:17:31.165
WE HAVEN'T FAILED YET!

00:17:31.165 --> 00:17:32.634
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:34.369
THE SWORD IS GONE.

00:17:34.369 --> 00:17:36.004

00:17:39.908 --> 00:17:42.243
IS THAT...
ANOTHER SWORD!?

00:17:42.243 --> 00:17:44.045
AAH!

00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:46.347
RED-EEEEEYES!

00:17:46.347 --> 00:17:47.849
I'LL SAVE YOU!

00:17:47.849 --> 00:17:49.651
SO THAT MUST BE...

00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:51.686
THE BLADE OF CHAOS!

00:17:51.686 --> 00:17:56.624
[SCREAMING]

00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:07.368
JOEY! THAT SWORD
IS THE SOURCE
OF THE CURSE!

00:18:07.368 --> 00:18:09.604
WE CAN STILL PASS
THIS TEST!

00:18:09.604 --> 00:18:12.573
THE BLADE OF CHAOS
MUST BE DESTROYED!

00:18:12.573 --> 00:18:14.943
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.121
CHECK IT OUT!

00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:28.957
WE CLEARED
THE THIRD CHALLENGE!

00:18:28.957 --> 00:18:30.758
BUT HOW?

00:18:30.758 --> 00:18:32.093
I'M NOT SURE.

00:18:32.093 --> 00:18:33.494
Yami-Yugi: IT'S SIMPLE.

00:18:33.494 --> 00:18:35.930
THE SWORD IN THE VOLCANO
WAS JUST A DECOY.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.034
THE REAL BLADE OF CHAOS
WAS IN JOEY'S RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON.

00:18:40.034 --> 00:18:42.470
OUR CHALLENGE WAS
TO REMOVE THIS SWORD

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.372
AND BREAK
THE CURSE IT CARRIED.

00:18:44.372 --> 00:18:46.140
AND THANKS
TO JOEY'S BRAVERY,

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.610
WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE
THE DRAGON AND RESTORE
PEACE ONCE AGAIN.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.212

IN MY SHOES,

00:18:51.212 --> 00:18:52.814

THE SAME THING.

00:18:52.814 --> 00:18:54.282

00:18:54.282 --> 00:18:55.283

00:18:55.283 --> 00:18:56.351
NICE JOB.

00:18:56.351 --> 00:18:57.852

00:18:57.852 --> 00:19:00.722

00:19:02.523 --> 00:19:07.195
[GROWLS]

00:19:07.195 --> 00:19:09.097
NOW GET SOME REST.

00:19:18.473 --> 00:19:21.109
I'M GLAD WE'RE
TOGETHER AGAIN OLD PAL.

00:19:21.109 --> 00:19:25.580
NOW LET'S GO KICK SOME
BUTT ON THE NEXT TEST.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.682
BUT FIRST, LET'S SLEEP.

00:19:27.682 --> 00:19:29.384
JOEY! OH GREAT.

00:19:29.384 --> 00:19:31.919
DOES THIS MEAN
I GET STUCK HAULING
SLEEPING BEAUTY

00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:37.592
FROM CHALLENGE
TO CHALLENGE NOW?

00:19:37.592 --> 00:19:40.628
Tea:
YUGI? ARE YOU OK?

00:19:40.628 --> 00:19:43.031
I'LL BE FINE.

00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:45.299
WELL ON TO
THE NEXT TEST

00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:47.602
THREE DOWN
AND TWO MORE TO GO!

00:19:47.602 --> 00:19:51.873
LET'S MOVE.

00:19:51.873 --> 00:19:54.208
I'M GUESSING THIS
IS THE WAY OUT.

00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:55.943
GEE, WHAT GAVE
IT AWAY, YUGI?

00:19:55.943 --> 00:19:58.679
THE SLIDING ROCK OR
THE GLOWING DOORWAY?

00:19:58.679 --> 00:20:01.783
MAYBE OUR NEXT TRIAL
WILL BE IN OUTER SPACE.

00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:03.251
THANKS TO THE DEAD
WEIGHT ON MY BACK,

00:20:03.251 --> 00:20:07.355
I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF GRAVITY RIGHT NOW.

00:20:07.355 --> 00:20:09.257
I'LL TAKE SIX
CHOCOLATE GLAZED

00:20:09.257 --> 00:20:11.059
AND THREE
OF THE BOSTON CREAM.

00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:12.527
HOW MUCH IS THAT?

00:20:12.527 --> 00:20:13.661
AH, JUST PUT IT
ON MY TAB.

00:20:13.661 --> 00:20:15.196

00:20:17.031 --> 00:20:22.670
Tristan: SOME OF US HAVE
SOME EXTRA BAGGAGE!

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.039
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT
YOU IS TRUE, PHARAOH.

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:27.875
YOU'RE AS LOYAL AS
YOU ARE COURAGEOUS.

00:20:27.875 --> 00:20:31.145
IF ANYONE EXISTS WHO CAN
COMPLETE THESE FIVE TRIALS

00:20:31.145 --> 00:20:33.981
AND FINALLY SET MY
SPIRIT FREE IT IS YOU.
