YOU REALLY KNOW
WHAT THIS ALL MEANS?

00:10:13.857 --> 00:10:16.426
I THINK.

00:10:16.426 --> 00:10:19.929
WELL? SPIT IT OUT
ALREADY, WILL YA!

00:10:19.929 --> 00:10:22.699
DROP HIM,
WHEELER!

00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:24.434
AS I WAS SAYING,

00:10:24.434 --> 00:10:25.769
I THINK THAT DESIGN
ON THE DOOR

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:28.071
IS THE KEY TO
GETTING IT OPEN.

00:10:28.071 --> 00:10:30.874
THE RECTANGLE IN THE MIDDLE
REPRESENTS THE FORTRESS.

00:10:30.874 --> 00:10:32.075
AND THE OUTER RECTANGLE

00:10:32.075 --> 00:10:34.544
REPRESENTS
THE SURROUNDING WALLS.

00:10:34.544 --> 00:10:36.913
Tristan: IT'S INTERESTING,
BUT WHAT DOES IT TELL US?

00:10:36.913 --> 00:10:39.015
IT TELLS US THAT
THE 4 LITTLE SQUARES

00:10:39.015 --> 00:10:40.817
REPRESENT THE 4 STATUES

00:10:40.817 --> 00:10:43.586
STANDING IN EACH
OF THE 4 CORNERS
OF THE FORTRESS!

00:10:43.586 --> 00:10:48.525
WAIT--SO WHEN ALL 4
GLOW WE CAN GET IN!?

00:10:48.525 --> 00:10:50.493
HEY, GRANDPA.

00:10:50.493 --> 00:10:55.498
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT
POSITION YOU WERE STANDING
IN JUST A SECOND AGO?

00:10:55.498 --> 00:10:59.702
WAIT! I WAS STANDING
WITH MY ARMS FOLDED
JUST LIKE THIS STATUE!

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.041
IT JUST LIT UP AGAIN!

00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:06.576
OF COURSE.

00:11:06.576 --> 00:11:08.745
WHENEVER SOMEONE
MIMICS THE STANCE

00:11:08.745 --> 00:11:10.547
OF ONE OF THOSE
4 STATUES,

00:11:10.547 --> 00:11:13.416
THE CORRESPONDING SQUARE
ON THE DOOR LIGHTS UP.

00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:16.085
OH. ALL WE HAVE TO
DO IS STRIKE A POSE

00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:18.888
LIKE THE OTHER 3 GUYS
AND THE DOOR WILL OPEN!

00:11:25.094 --> 00:11:29.098
YUP. I FEEL
LIKE AN IDIOT.

00:11:29.098 --> 00:11:31.601
GOOD WORK, TEA.
ANOTHER LIGHT WENT ON!

00:11:31.601 --> 00:11:35.371
HOW LONG DO WE
HAFTA STAND LIKE DIS?

00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:37.073
ANYTHING HAPPENING, YUGI!?

00:11:37.073 --> 00:11:43.179
YUP! BOTH OF YOUR
LIGHTS ARE GLOWING!

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:45.348
IT ACTUALLY WORKED.

00:11:45.348 --> 00:11:46.583
WELL DONE.

00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:48.818
NOW HURRY UP AND FIND
THAT HIDDEN CASKET

00:11:48.818 --> 00:11:51.821
SO WE CAN UNCOVER
THE PATHWAY HOME
BEFORE THE SUN SETS.

00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:58.661
YUGI! IN ORDER TO KEEP
THAT DOOR OPEN

00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:00.930
WE NEED TO STAY
IN THESE POSITIONS.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.099
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO ENTER
THAT FORTRESS

00:12:03.099 --> 00:12:05.602
AND LOCATE THE HIDDEN
CASKET ON YOUR OWN.

00:12:05.602 --> 00:12:07.270
OUR FATE'S
IN YOUR HANDS!

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.872
'CAUSE WE
CAN'T MOVE OURS!

00:12:08.872 --> 00:12:10.340
YOU CAN DO THIS, YUGI!

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.941
ALL RIGHT, HERE GOES!

00:12:11.941 --> 00:12:14.677
I PROMISE I'M GONNA
GET US OUTTA THIS PLACE!

00:12:24.987 --> 00:12:27.156
THAT MUST BE WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR!

00:12:27.156 --> 00:12:33.762
BUT IT WAS WAY
TOO EASY TO FIND.

00:12:33.762 --> 00:12:35.431
AAH!

00:12:35.431 --> 00:12:39.368
[SCREAMING]

00:12:44.974 --> 00:12:48.577
YUGI. IT SEEMS WE
RAN RIGHT INTO A TRAP.

00:12:48.577 --> 00:12:51.013
I WASN'T THINKING.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

00:12:51.013 --> 00:12:52.715
IT'S FINE.

00:12:52.715 --> 00:12:54.583
WHAT WE NEED TO DO
NOW IS FIGURE OUT

00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:56.251
HOW TO GET BACK
WHERE WE WERE.

00:12:56.251 --> 00:13:01.757
AND WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME.

00:13:01.757 --> 00:13:07.663
HELP! I'M CRAMPING!

00:13:07.663 --> 00:13:09.999
AND I USED TO THINK
YOU WERE SUCH A POSER.

00:13:15.738 --> 00:13:17.873
AAH!

00:13:17.873 --> 00:13:24.046
OH, NO! THEY'RE ALIVE!

00:13:24.046 --> 00:13:26.415
AAH!

Joey: LET'S GET
READY TO RUMBLE!

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:14.596
GETTING OUT OF THIS PIT
BEFORE NIGHTFALL
WON'T BE EASY.

00:14:14.596 --> 00:14:20.669
AND IT JUST GOT TOUGHER!

00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:22.671
YUGI! IF YOU HAVE
ANY IDEAS,

00:14:22.671 --> 00:14:28.177
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO SPEAK UP!

00:14:28.177 --> 00:14:30.813
REMEMBER...THIS
IS ALL A GAME.

00:14:30.813 --> 00:14:32.147
THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY
OUT OF THESE TRAPS.

00:14:32.147 --> 00:14:33.882
WE JUST NEED
TO FIGURE IT OUT!

00:15:14.923 --> 00:15:17.226
A CAPSULE!

TO RELEASE THE
MONSTER FROM THERE?
