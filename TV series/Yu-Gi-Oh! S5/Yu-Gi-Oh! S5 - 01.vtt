KICKED IN PUBLIC
AGAIN RIGHT!?

00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:32.383
ONE MORE
HUMILIATING DEFEAT

00:08:32.383 --> 00:08:35.154
AND HIS REPUTATION'LL
REALLY BE SHOT!

00:08:35.154 --> 00:08:36.825
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

00:08:36.825 --> 00:08:38.327
HE CAN'T DUEL.

00:08:38.327 --> 00:08:40.131
HE HAS TOO MUCH TO DO.

00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:44.473
WHY DON'T YOU TRY OPENING UP
A CHAIN OF AMUSEMENT PARKS
SOMEDAY!

00:08:44.473 --> 00:08:48.481
BELIEVE ME IT WASN'T
AN EASY DECISION FOR
MY BROTHER TO MAKE.

00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:50.418
OF COURSE NOT.

00:08:50.418 --> 00:08:52.755
WAY TO SHOOT OFF
YOUR BIG MOUTH.

00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:54.458
WHO? ME?!

00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:57.331
WELL MAYBE I DID GET
A BIT CARRIED AWAY
BACK THERE.

00:08:57.331 --> 00:08:59.068
A'RIGHT.

00:08:59.068 --> 00:09:03.176
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS
AND TALK ABOUT THIS
TOURNAMENT SHALL WE?

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:07.484
WE'RE INVITING THE
TOP-RANKED DUELISTS FROM

00:09:07.484 --> 00:09:11.324

FOR A SHOT AT THE WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE!

00:09:11.324 --> 00:09:15.599
BUT IN ORDER FOR US TO DO
THAT...WE NEED THE WORLD CHAMP!

00:09:15.599 --> 00:09:18.105
WHATTA YA THINK PHARAOH?

00:09:18.105 --> 00:09:22.246
SHOULD WE DO IT?

00:09:22.246 --> 00:09:23.882
WOW, THE BEST DUELISTS
IN THE WORLD?

00:09:23.882 --> 00:09:25.452
HOW COULD I SAY NO?!

00:09:25.452 --> 00:09:28.224
MOKUBA,

00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:29.861

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.831
I KNEW YOU'D JOIN!

00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:34.536
IF YOU GET YUGI,

00:09:34.536 --> 00:09:36.106
AND WHAT ABOUT ME?

00:09:36.106 --> 00:09:39.446
I'M THE YOUNGEST REGIONAL
CHAMPION TO PLAY THE GAME.

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:43.486
PLUS ANYWHERE
YUGI GOES, I GO.

00:09:43.486 --> 00:09:45.157
YUP.

00:09:45.157 --> 00:09:48.129
IT JUST SO HAPPENS
I WAS TOLD TO INVITE
ALL THREE OF YOU.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:52.571
SO I HAVE A TICKET HERE FOR
YUGI, REBECCA AND JOEY.

00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:55.444
AS WE SAY IN DA BIZ...
IT'S TIME TO DUEL!

00:09:55.444 --> 00:09:58.516
THE NEXT FLIGHT TO
KAIBA LAND IS BOARDING NOW!

00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:10.773
SO, MY DEAR FRIEND
HERR KAIBA IS THROWING
ANOTHER TOURNAMENT IS HE?

00:10:10.773 --> 00:10:12.477
HOW CHARMING.

00:10:12.477 --> 00:10:17.920
WELL, LIKE I ALWAYS SAY...
EVERY ROSE HAS ITS THORN.

00:10:19.858 --> 00:10:23.765
SO...YOU'D BETTER
BE CAREFUL.

00:10:23.765 --> 00:10:29.175
FOR EVEN THE MOST
DELICATE FLOWER CAN BE
QUITE DANGEROUS.

00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:32.348
AND I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
TO HURT YOURSELF.

00:10:32.348 --> 00:10:34.753
LEAVE THAT TO ME!

00:10:34.753 --> 00:10:37.325
AUF WIEDERSEHEN,
HERR KAIBA!

00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:48.710
LADIES AND GENTS
WELCOME TO KAIBA LAND!

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.950
IT'S HUGE!

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.756
DUDE, YOU'RE FOGGIN' UP
THE WINDOW.

00:10:54.756 --> 00:10:58.463
WE PLAN TO OPEN TONS OF THESE
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:10:58.463 --> 00:11:00.668
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE GOT EVERY
RIDE EVER INVENTED.

00:11:00.668 --> 00:11:02.103
OH, YEAH.

00:11:02.103 --> 00:11:04.976
I JUST HOPE THEY'VE GOT
A TUNNEL OF LOVE DON'T YOU?

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.162
BEFORE WE GET THE FULL TOUR...
I GOTTA USE DA LITTLE BOYS'
ROOM.

00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:20.172
FIRST DOOR ON THE LEFT.

00:11:20.172 --> 00:11:22.042
IT'S BLUE-EYES!

00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:25.182
THAT WOULD BE A STATUE.

00:11:25.182 --> 00:11:26.684
I WANT A MONSTER BALLOON!

00:11:26.684 --> 00:11:27.886
THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!

00:11:27.886 --> 00:11:29.724
SUZY, HOLD ON TIGHT!

00:11:29.724 --> 00:11:32.428
LOOK NO HANDS!

00:11:32.428 --> 00:11:33.698
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THE PARK
DIDN'T OPEN YET.

00:11:33.698 --> 00:11:34.767
IT DIDN'T.

00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:36.770
THESE ARE
SPECIAL GUESTS.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.711
OH AND DID I MENTION
EVERY RIDE IS FREE TODAY?

00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:42.181
YOU GUYS ROCK!

00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:43.517
I LOVE DIS PLACE!

00:11:43.517 --> 00:11:44.753
LET'S TILT N' WHIRL
'TIL WE HURL!

00:11:44.753 --> 00:11:46.222
OH YEAH!

00:11:46.222 --> 00:11:48.527
I NEED SOME
FEMALE FRIENDS.

00:11:48.527 --> 00:11:50.698
I SAVED THE BEST PART
FOR LAST.

00:11:50.698 --> 00:11:54.071
WE CALL THAT THE KAIBA DOME!

00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:56.742
IS THAT A BLUE EYES
ARENA?!

00:11:56.742 --> 00:11:59.214
WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH
NORMAL PEOPLE HERE.

00:11:59.214 --> 00:12:01.886
NO...WE'RE NOT.

00:12:01.886 --> 00:12:05.459
IT'S THE WORLD'S LARGEST
INDOOR STADIUM.

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:08.732
AND THAT'S THE KC DUELTEK 760.

00:12:08.732 --> 00:12:10.469
NOT TOO SHABBY.

00:12:10.469 --> 00:12:13.875
IT'S OUR NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART
DUEL MONSTERS PLATFORM.

00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:17.450
RIP THAT BLADE KNIGHT
TO SHREDS NOW!!

00:12:21.223 --> 00:12:22.225
IN YOUR FACE!

00:12:22.225 --> 00:12:23.729
REVEALING MAGIC CARD.

00:12:23.729 --> 00:12:27.702
ACTIVATE SCAPEGOAT.

00:12:27.702 --> 00:12:28.771
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:12:28.771 --> 00:12:30.808
THAT MOVE
MAKES NO SENSE!

00:12:30.808 --> 00:12:33.514
WHY ACTIVATE
SCAPEGOAT NOW?

00:12:33.514 --> 00:12:35.217
LOOKS LIKE YOUR
STATE-OF-THE-ART COMPUTER

00:12:35.217 --> 00:12:36.754
JUST MADE A ROOKIE MISTAKE.

00:12:36.754 --> 00:12:38.924
JUST WATCH AND SEE.

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:40.761
I HAVE A FEELING THAT
FACEDOWN CARD'S A TRAP, JOEY.

00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:42.765
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:12:42.765 --> 00:12:44.735
REVEALING TRAP CARD.

00:12:44.735 --> 00:12:47.975
ACTIVATE DNA SURGERY.

00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:50.814
AS LONG AS CARD
REMAINS IN PLAY...

00:12:50.814 --> 00:12:52.785
EVERY MONSTER
ON THE PLAYING FIELD

00:12:52.785 --> 00:12:55.724
WILL BE TRANSFORMED
INTO A DRAGON.

00:12:55.724 --> 00:12:57.093
SAY WHAT!?

00:13:04.774 --> 00:13:06.277
DID YOU SEE THAT!?

00:13:06.277 --> 00:13:07.580
THEY'RE ALL DRAGONS!

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.088
NOW ACTIVATING THE MAGIC
CARD POLYMERIZATION.

00:13:12.088 --> 00:13:13.791
DAT COMPUTER
DID HAVE A PLAN.

00:13:13.791 --> 00:13:15.595
TOLD YA.

00:13:15.595 --> 00:13:18.868
NOW FUSING TOGETHER ALL
CREATURES ON MY SIDE
OF THE PLAYING FIELD

00:13:18.868 --> 00:13:22.107
IN ORDER TO FORM FIVE HEADED
DRAGON MONSTER.

00:13:28.788 --> 00:13:30.657
THE POOR KID.

00:13:30.657 --> 00:13:32.795
THERE'S NO WAY HE'LL BEAT DAT
DIGITAL DUELIST NOW.

00:13:32.795 --> 00:13:33.864
NOPE.

00:13:33.864 --> 00:13:35.667
THERE'S NOT
A CHANCE.

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:38.874
OUR COMPUTER WAS
PROGRAMMED TO MIMIC
THE STRATEGIES

00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:40.878
OF THE WORLD'S
BEST DUELISTS.

00:13:40.878 --> 00:13:45.353
WE'VE IMPORTED SETO'S
DECK... AND YUGI'S TOO.

00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:47.290
AND IT'S GOT MINE, RIGHT?

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.826
YEAH SO IT CAN LOSE TOO.

00:13:48.826 --> 00:13:52.934
JUST TO BE FAIR.

00:13:52.934 --> 00:13:56.842
BUT WHAT FUN IS IT TO DUEL
AGAINST A COMPUTER THAT
ALWAYS WINS?

00:13:56.842 --> 00:13:58.679
WE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

00:13:58.679 --> 00:14:00.883
SO WE LET PLAYERS CHOOSE
ONE OF FIVE LEVELS

00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:03.755
FROM "BEGINNER"
ALL THE WAY TO "EXPERT."

00:14:03.755 --> 00:14:07.829
WHAT AN AWESOME WAY FOR KIDS TO
PRACTICE DUELING AND IMPROVE
THEIR SKILLS.

00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:09.065
YES.

00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:10.568
A FEW MORE DUELS LIKE THIS,

00:14:10.568 --> 00:14:14.609
AND I THINK LUKE THERE
COULD BE A WORLD CHAMP.

00:14:14.609 --> 00:14:20.220
COMMENCING ATTACK.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.358
GAME OVER.

00:14:22.358 --> 00:14:23.927
NICE TRY LUKE!

00:14:23.927 --> 00:14:26.800
LOOKS LIKE YOU OWE ME A
BLUE-EYES BURGER!

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.570
YOU PUT UP A GOOD
FIGHT, LUKE!

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.908
YOU JUST SET YOUR LEVEL
A LITTLE TOO HIGH.

00:14:30.908 --> 00:14:33.579
HEY ISN'T THAT YUGI
MUTO OVER THERE!?

00:14:33.579 --> 00:14:35.350
IT'S PROBABLY JUST ONE 'A THOSE
THEME PARK LOOK-A-LIKES.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.654
THAT'S GOTTA BE HIM!

00:14:37.654 --> 00:14:38.856
I'M GETTING AN AUTOGRAPH!

00:14:38.856 --> 00:14:42.329
ME TOO!

00:14:42.329 --> 00:14:45.369
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S A
CELEBRITY.

00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:46.604
WELL...

00:14:46.604 --> 00:14:47.707
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

00:14:47.707 --> 00:14:49.945
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S YOU.

00:14:49.945 --> 00:14:53.118
I'VE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS
SINCE DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:14:53.118 --> 00:14:55.054
BY THE WAY...I'M LEON.

00:14:55.054 --> 00:14:57.158
HI LEON.

00:14:57.158 --> 00:14:59.630
HEEEY, ANYONE WANT
MY AUTOGRAPH?

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.669
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
KNOW YOU OR SOMETHING?

00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:06.676
COME ON KID, JUMPIN' JOEY
WHEELER, BATTLE CITY FINALIST?

00:15:06.676 --> 00:15:08.380
JOE WHO?

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.618
I'M SORRY BUT DO I KNOW YOU?

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:13.056
I TELL YA,
I GET NO RESPECT!

00:15:13.056 --> 00:15:14.893
SCUSE ME!
MR. KING OF GAMES?

00:15:14.893 --> 00:15:16.395
OVER HERE SIR!

00:15:16.395 --> 00:15:17.632
AH, YEAH?

00:15:17.632 --> 00:15:19.702
CAN YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT MY DECK PLEASE?

00:15:19.702 --> 00:15:23.910
NO MATTER WHAT I DO
I CAN'T SEEM TO WIN
A DUEL.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.647
I SEE DA PROBLEM.

00:15:25.647 --> 00:15:27.651
ALL YA GOT
ARE DRAGON CARDS.

00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:29.721
YEAH, DRAGONS
ARE MY FAVORITE.

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:33.963
I TRADED ALL MY
MAGIC AND TRAP CARDS
TO GET 'EM.

00:15:33.963 --> 00:15:38.271
SURE DRAGONS ARE POWERFUL BUT
YOU'LL NEVER WIN WITH THIS DECK.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.209
WHY NOT?

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:41.711
AH...THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

00:15:41.711 --> 00:15:45.719
HERE'S THE DEAL...IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT YOU VALUE YOUR CARDS

00:15:45.719 --> 00:15:47.723
AND THAT RESPECT IS
GONNA TAKE YOU FAR.

00:15:47.723 --> 00:15:51.463
BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO BALANCE
YOUR DECK WITH MAGIC
AND TRAP CARDS.

00:15:51.463 --> 00:15:52.900
I DO?

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.440
MATTER A' FACT...
TAKE THIS CARD.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.442
YOU MEAN IT?

00:15:57.442 --> 00:15:59.412
OF COURSE.

00:15:59.412 --> 00:16:01.717
HUH?

00:16:01.717 --> 00:16:03.721
HEART
OF THE UNDERDOG?

00:16:03.721 --> 00:16:05.691
IT REMINDS ME OF
A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE

00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:06.960
AND IT COULD BE
JUST WHAT YOU NEED.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.931
AH CAN I KEEP IT?

00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:10.433
NO WAY!

00:16:10.433 --> 00:16:12.171
AWESOME!

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:13.940
WHO DOES DAT CARD
REMIND YOU OF ANYWAY?

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.946
I'LL...TELL YA LATER.

00:16:16.946 --> 00:16:18.449
I'M GONNA TEST IT OUT NOW!

00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:21.689
GOOD LUCK!

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:24.828
I WOULDN'T SET THE LEVEL TOO
HIGH IF I WERE YOU!

00:16:24.828 --> 00:16:25.964
THANKS!
GOOD CALL.

00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:31.942
LET'S TRY LEVEL TWO.

00:16:31.942 --> 00:16:35.783
LOOKS LIKE MY PLAN'S
IN FULL BLOOM.

00:16:35.783 --> 00:16:38.822
AH THE SWEET SMELL OF REVENGE.

00:16:49.605 --> 00:16:51.776
INITIATING GAME PLAY.

00:16:51.776 --> 00:16:52.778
LET'S DUEL!

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:56.084
COMMENCING DUEL SEQUENCE.

00:16:56.084 --> 00:16:59.089
LOOKS LIKE THE KAIBA BOYS
FORGOT TO PAY THEIR
ELECTRIC BILL.

00:16:59.089 --> 00:17:02.095
EITHER THAT OR THERE
ARE STILL SOME KINKS
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

00:17:02.095 --> 00:17:03.832
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:17:03.832 --> 00:17:06.370
WE WORKED OUT EVERY
POSSIBLE BUG.

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:08.374
WELL APPARENTLY
YA DIDN'T.

00:17:08.374 --> 00:17:11.047
ONE BUG MUSTA SOMEHOW
SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS.

00:17:11.047 --> 00:17:12.816
STAY CALM, EVERYONE!

00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:15.120
I'LL FIGURE THIS OUT!

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.290
HEY LOOK!

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.230
IT'S BACK ON!

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:26.209
WE'RE TRAPPED!

00:17:26.209 --> 00:17:29.282
NOW ALTERING ORIGINAL
DUEL SEQUENCE.

00:17:29.282 --> 00:17:30.818
IT'S NOT RESPONDING!

00:17:30.818 --> 00:17:32.288
I'VE LOST CONTROL!

00:17:32.288 --> 00:17:37.330
STEP ASIDE MOKUBA.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.834
JUST AS I SUSPECTED!

00:17:38.834 --> 00:17:40.838
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:17:40.838 --> 00:17:43.409
ACCORDING TO THIS ANALYSIS
YOUR COMPUTERIZED CARD-SHARK

00:17:43.409 --> 00:17:46.080
IS BEING CONTROLLED BY AN
OUTSIDE PARTY.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.352
BUT WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH
ANY ORDINARY HACKER.

00:17:48.352 --> 00:17:50.322
THIS IS A HIGH-END JOB!

00:17:50.322 --> 00:17:51.825
WHO WOULD DO THIS?

00:17:51.825 --> 00:17:53.395
IT'S POINTLESS.

00:17:53.395 --> 00:17:56.067
IT'S JUST AN AMUSEMENT PARK
ATTRACTION.

00:17:56.067 --> 00:17:58.371
WHY WOULD SOMEONE WANT
TO BREAK INTO IT?

00:17:58.371 --> 00:18:00.375
WELL MY GUESS IS THAT
THEY'RE USING IT

00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:04.115
TO GET SOMETHING
THEY WANT FROM YOU.

00:18:04.115 --> 00:18:06.086
WHAT MAKES THEM THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK!?

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:07.890
THEY GOT YOUR ATTENTION
DIDN'T THEY?

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.428
I SAY WE TEAR DAT
SCRAP HEAP TA SHREDS!

00:18:10.428 --> 00:18:12.365
I'M WITH YA BRO,
LET'S GO!

00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:14.102
HOLD ON!

00:18:14.102 --> 00:18:17.175
IF YOU DO THAT WE MAY NEVER
GET OUTTA HERE!

00:18:17.175 --> 00:18:19.446
THEN WHAT'RE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

00:18:19.446 --> 00:18:23.454
THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUTTA
HERE IS TO DEFEAT THAT
COMPUTER IN A DUEL!

00:18:23.454 --> 00:18:26.827
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
OUR FATE IS IN THE HANDS
OF THAT KID UP THERE.

00:18:26.827 --> 00:18:28.362
IT IS TIME TO DUEL.

00:18:28.362 --> 00:18:29.866
OH NO!

00:18:29.866 --> 00:18:30.867
HELP!

00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:32.237
I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.877
NOW SUMMONING BERSERK GORILLA
TO THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:18:35.877 --> 00:18:38.248
ATTACK POINTS: 2000.

00:18:38.248 --> 00:18:43.291
SUPPLEMENTING MONSTER
WITH ONE FACEDOWN CARD
AND CONCLUDING TURN.

00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:44.393
THAT CHIMP'S
GONNA CRUSH HIM!

00:18:44.393 --> 00:18:45.662
HE NEEDS HELP!

00:18:45.662 --> 00:18:46.798
HEY, LOOK!

00:18:46.798 --> 00:18:48.335
MORE BAD NEWS.

00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:51.241
THE COMPUTER SET ITSELF
TO THE TOUGHEST LEVEL!

00:18:52.276 --> 00:18:54.413
OH MAN, I'M TOAST.

00:18:54.413 --> 00:18:55.916
HE'S RIGHT.

00:18:55.916 --> 00:18:58.254
HE'LL NEVER SURVIVE
LEVEL 5.

00:18:58.254 --> 00:18:59.690
HE'S JUST A BEGINNER.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.193
NO WAY.

00:19:01.193 --> 00:19:03.264
AND IF JUNIOR LOSES THE DUEL
TO THAT RUSTBUCKET,

00:19:03.264 --> 00:19:06.570
WE'RE GONNA BE TRAPPED IN THIS
PLACE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG.

00:19:08.139 --> 00:19:10.243
YUGI, YOU KNOW WHAT
WE HAVE TO DO.

00:19:11.747 --> 00:19:13.784
YU-GI-OH!

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:18.159
[GRUNTS]

00:19:19.595 --> 00:19:20.730
HOLD ON.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.534
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

00:19:22.534 --> 00:19:24.170
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.574
IT'S COOL.

00:19:25.574 --> 00:19:26.809
VERY WELL.

00:19:26.809 --> 00:19:28.780
I WILL BRING
YOUR DECK TO VICTORY.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.218
BUT YOU NEED TO
HAVE FAITH.

00:19:31.218 --> 00:19:32.788
SOUNDS GOOD.

00:19:32.788 --> 00:19:35.893
NOW, LET'S DISMANTLE
THIS THING!

00:19:35.893 --> 00:19:37.296
GO YUGI!

00:19:37.296 --> 00:19:39.200
WE'RE ALL
BEHIND YOU!

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.538
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DUEL!

00:19:41.538 --> 00:19:43.876
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S BEHIND
THIS, BUT WHOEVER IT IS,

00:19:43.876 --> 00:19:46.213
THEY MUST BE STOPPED.

00:19:46.213 --> 00:19:48.217
Duel computer:
MAKE YOUR MOVE,

00:19:48.217 --> 00:19:50.711
OR FORFEIT THE DUEL!
