00:09:33.434 --> 00:09:35.037
SO THAT'S WHAT
HE'S BEEN WAITING TO SUMMON.

00:09:35.037 --> 00:09:37.174
IT'S AWESOME.

00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:41.616
FOR ONCE IT LOOKS
LIKE JOSEPH WHEELER IS
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS.

00:09:41.616 --> 00:09:44.555
I SHOULD ENJOY THIS
WHILE IT LASTS.

00:09:44.555 --> 00:09:46.024
YOU KNOW, YUGI,

00:09:46.024 --> 00:09:51.968
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S
NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH THAT CARD.

00:09:51.968 --> 00:09:55.474
Yugi: YOU HAVE AN
ANCIENT DRAGON TOO?

00:09:55.474 --> 00:09:57.812
YES, BUT I'VE NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO SUMMON IT

00:09:57.812 --> 00:09:59.982
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ALL
THE NECESSARY COMPONENTS.

00:09:59.982 --> 00:10:04.691
IN FACT, YOUR GRANDFATHER
IS THE ONLY DUELIST I KNOW

00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:08.865
WHO POSSESSES ALL 7 CARDS
NEEDED TO CALL FORTH
THIS DIVINE CREATURE.

00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:13.239
SO I HOPE YOU KIDS
APPRECIATE THE RARE EVENT
YOU'VE JUST WITNESSED.

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:15.177
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS,

00:10:15.177 --> 00:10:17.982
WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED
IN A FRIENDLY COMPETITION
OF SORTS--

00:10:17.982 --> 00:10:19.818
BOTH HUNTING DOWN
THE SAME CARDS.

00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:24.928
UNTIL RECENTLY, EACH OF US
HAD IN OUR POSSESSION
6 OF THE 7 CARDS,

00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:26.998
BUT THAT WOULD SOON CHANGE.

00:10:26.998 --> 00:10:29.502
Grandpa: OH,
AND BY THE WAY, ARTHUR,

00:10:29.502 --> 00:10:32.007
I HAVE SOME INTERESTING
NEWS TO REPORT.

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:35.013
LOOKS LIKE YOU OWE ME
A CHOCOLATE SHAKE,

00:10:35.013 --> 00:10:37.082
'CAUSE I MANAGED
TO TRACK DOWN
THE FIFTH CARD.

00:10:37.082 --> 00:10:39.821
YOU DID WHAT?

00:10:39.821 --> 00:10:42.091
NOW I CAN FINALLY
SUMMON THE ANCIENT DRAGON.

00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:43.093
I MUST SEE IT.

00:10:43.093 --> 00:10:45.264
OF COURSE.

00:10:45.264 --> 00:10:46.900
YES, BUT WHEN?

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.504
DID YOU FORGET?

00:10:48.504 --> 00:10:50.173
I'VE JOINED
KAIBA'S TOURNAMENT.

00:10:50.173 --> 00:10:53.178
WHAT BETTER WAY TO SHOW OFF
MY NEW CARD?

00:10:53.178 --> 00:10:56.017
THAT WAS THE CHEERIEST
I'D HEARD HIM
IN A LONG TIME.

00:10:56.017 --> 00:10:57.018
IT WAS?

00:10:57.018 --> 00:10:59.122
YES.

00:10:59.122 --> 00:11:01.293
YOUR GRANDFATHER IS HAPPIEST
WHEN HE'S DUELING.

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:02.696
I THINK IT KEEPS HIM YOUNG.

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:05.634
I GUESS HE'S JUST
A KID AT HEART.

00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:06.803
GUESS SO.

00:11:06.803 --> 00:11:08.573
JUST LOOK AT HIM.

00:11:08.573 --> 00:11:11.845
HE'S MANAGED TO SUMMON
A CARD HE'S BEEN WAITING
TO PLAY FOR YEARS,

00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:14.617
AND HE'S ABOUT TO USE IT
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:11:18.624 --> 00:11:23.199
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IT
AN HONOR TO BE ATTACKED BY
MY ANCIENT DRAGON.

00:11:23.199 --> 00:11:24.635
YOU SPENT
THE ENTIRE DUEL

00:11:24.635 --> 00:11:26.772
SETTIN' UP FOR ONE CARD.

00:11:26.772 --> 00:11:28.141
IF YA ASK ME,
DAT'S A HUGE WASTE
'A TIME.

00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:30.880
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.285
YOU SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN
EVERYTHING THAT I TAUGHT YOU.

00:11:34.285 --> 00:11:38.627
WELL, SUIT YOURSELF,
BECAUSE EITHER WAY
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE WIPED OUT.

00:11:38.627 --> 00:11:43.536
ANCIENT DRAGON,
DESTROY HIS GOBLIN ATTACK FORCE
WITH LEGENDARY BLAZE!

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.981
NO WAY.

00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:51.650
WHAT HAPPENED TO
MY SCAPEGOATS?

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.558
I SEE MY DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY
THREW YOU FOR A LOOP.

00:11:55.558 --> 00:11:58.062
WHENEVER IT DEFEATS
ONE OF YOUR
MONSTERS IN BATTLE,

00:11:58.062 --> 00:12:01.067
IT ALSO DESTROYS
EVERY MONSTER THAT'S
IN DEFENSE MODE

00:12:01.067 --> 00:12:02.703
ON YOUR SIDE OF
THE FIELD.

00:12:02.703 --> 00:12:03.705
THAT'S NOT COOL.

00:12:10.184 --> 00:12:12.321
I'LL NEVER LET YOU WIN.

00:12:12.321 --> 00:12:15.026
DIS TOURNAMENT
IS MY CHANCE TO FINALLY
MAKE IT BIG

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.663
AND GET SOME RESPECT--

00:12:16.663 --> 00:12:18.999
LIKE YUGI GETS!

00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:21.170
I GOTTA BE NUMBER ONE.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.807
I GOTTA.

00:12:22.807 --> 00:12:25.144
JOEY, TRY TO
LIGHTEN UP
A LITTLE BIT.

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:26.981
YOU'RE SO
CAUGHT UP IN
WINNING THE DUEL

00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:28.584
YOU FORGOT
WHAT'S
IMPORTANT.

00:12:28.584 --> 00:12:30.019
YOU FORGOT
TO HAVE FUN!

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:31.188
FUN?

00:12:31.188 --> 00:12:32.691
DIS IS SERIOUS, YUGE.

00:12:32.691 --> 00:12:33.759
CHILL OUT!

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:35.997
THIS TOURNAMENT'S
NO BIG DEAL.

00:12:35.997 --> 00:12:39.670
IT'S JUST A CHEAP WAY
FOR KAIBA CORP
TO GET SOME PUBLICITY.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.774
YOU REALIZE
I'M STANDING RIGHT
NEXT TO YOU, RIGHT?

00:12:41.774 --> 00:12:45.815
JUST BE YOURSELF
OUT THERE, GOT IT?

00:12:45.815 --> 00:12:49.755
THANKS, GUYS.

00:12:49.755 --> 00:12:51.792
YOU KIDS ARE SO SUPPORTIVE.

00:12:51.792 --> 00:12:53.629
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU ALL.

00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:55.532
YER PROUD?

00:12:55.532 --> 00:12:58.805
WHATTA YOU TALKIN' ABOUT
APDNARG?

00:12:58.805 --> 00:13:00.308
NOW BACK TO DA DUEL,

00:13:00.308 --> 00:13:02.011
AND FROM NOW ON,

00:13:02.011 --> 00:13:04.615
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
THE ONLY ONE HAVIN' FUN,
TOUGH GUY.

00:13:04.615 --> 00:13:07.420
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.057
WHO CARES IF APDNARG
IS MORE SKILLED THAN YOU?

00:13:09.057 --> 00:13:11.395
SO WHAT?

00:13:11.395 --> 00:13:12.396
SURE, HE'LL PROBABLY
WIN, BUT--

00:13:12.396 --> 00:13:14.133
DAT'S ENOUGH MOTIVATION.

00:13:14.133 --> 00:13:17.305
I'M WAITING.

00:13:17.305 --> 00:13:20.244
A'RIGHT, YOU WANNA SEE
SOME MAD SKILLS?

00:13:20.244 --> 00:13:21.246
BRING IT ON, KID.

00:13:21.246 --> 00:13:23.382
HERE GOES.

00:13:23.382 --> 00:13:26.622
LOOK OUT!

00:13:26.622 --> 00:13:28.793
TIME TA GIVE MY LUCK
ONE MORE SHOT

00:13:28.793 --> 00:13:34.636
WITH A MAGIC CARD
CALLED ROLL OF FATE.

00:13:34.636 --> 00:13:37.642
THIS CARD ALLOWS ME TO
DRAW UP TO 6 NEW CARDS

00:13:37.642 --> 00:13:40.013
DEPENDING ON
WHAT NUMBER I ROLL,

00:13:40.013 --> 00:13:45.089
JUST AS LONG AS I REMOVE
DA SAME NUMBER OF CARDS
FROM THE GAME.

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:51.367
NOW, LEGENDARY GAMBLER,
CANCEL OUT HIS ROLL.

00:13:51.367 --> 00:13:53.604
WHEELER GETS A 4,

00:13:53.604 --> 00:13:56.709
AND THE FREAK IN DA MASK
GETS A 3.

00:13:56.709 --> 00:14:01.651
HE SHOOTS, HE SCORES,
HE DRAWS 4 CARDS.

00:14:01.651 --> 00:14:04.456
DAT'S WHAT I CALL
A HAND.

00:14:04.456 --> 00:14:05.658
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE BLUFFING.

00:14:05.658 --> 00:14:08.831
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT PAL.

00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:10.835
I ACTIVATE
LANDSTAR FORCES.

00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:14.074
THIS CARD LETS ME
AUTOMATICALLY SUMMON

00:14:14.074 --> 00:14:17.447
EVERY LANDSTAR MONSTER
I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND
DIRECTLY TO DA FIELD,

00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:20.452
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

00:14:20.452 --> 00:14:23.792
AND WHATTA YA KNOW?

00:14:23.792 --> 00:14:26.129
I HAPPEN TO HAVE 3:

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:27.965
BRIGADIER OF LANDSTAR,

00:14:27.965 --> 00:14:29.669
KNIGHT OF LANDSTAR,

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:32.174
AND GRAPPLER
OF LANDSTAR.

00:14:32.174 --> 00:14:35.980
AND NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
MY 3 LANDSTARS.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.186
DIS LETS ME SUMMON
GILFORD THE LIGHTNING.

00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:46.800
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.972
BY SACRIFICING
MY 3 LANDSTARS,

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:51.776
I ACTIVATED GILFORD'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:14:51.776 --> 00:14:57.419
SO ALL YOUR MONSTERS
ARE GONERS.

00:14:57.419 --> 00:14:58.421
NOT MY DRAGON.

00:14:58.421 --> 00:15:00.892
WHAT A REMARKABLE DISPLAY.

00:15:00.892 --> 00:15:03.864
AND I'M JUST
GETTING WARMED UP.

00:15:03.864 --> 00:15:06.703
NOW ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY,
GILFORD.

00:15:06.703 --> 00:15:09.207
YOU'LL HAVE TO GUESS
WHAT CARD THIS IS FIRST.

00:15:09.207 --> 00:15:12.713
I BEEN PAYIN' ATTENTION,
SO DON'T BE SO SMUG.

00:15:12.713 --> 00:15:15.050
THAT, SIR,
IS A MONSTER CARD--

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.155
MORE SPECIFICALLY,
SINISTER SERPENT.

00:15:17.155 --> 00:15:19.826
WELL DONE, JOSEPH.

00:15:19.826 --> 00:15:21.495
NOW WHERE WAS I?

00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:22.765
OH, YEAH.

00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:25.035
GILFORD, ATTACK
THAT MASKED MAN NOW.

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:38.059
DAT'LL DO FOR NOW.

00:15:38.059 --> 00:15:40.497
YOUR DRAGON'S BACK,
BUT HOW?

00:15:40.497 --> 00:15:42.066
QUITE SIMPLE.

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:44.237
MY ANCIENT CITY
IS STILL IN PLAY,

00:15:44.237 --> 00:15:47.409
AND AS LONG AS THAT CARD
REMAINS ON THE FIELD

00:15:47.409 --> 00:15:50.682
I CAN CONTINUE
TO BRING MY DRAGON BACK
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:15:50.682 --> 00:15:53.019
YOU MIGHT SAY
IT'S INDESTRUCTIBLE.

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:55.190
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
A MONSTER THIS SPECIAL

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.460
CAN'T BE GOTTEN RID OF
SO EASILY.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.297
WE'LL SEE, PAL.

00:15:59.297 --> 00:16:00.299
NOW MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:03.438
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

00:16:03.438 --> 00:16:08.748
NOW, ANCIENT DRAGON,
ATTACK GILFORD THE LIGHTNING!

00:16:08.748 --> 00:16:11.085
THEIR MONSTERS'
ATTACK POINTS ARE EQUAL.

00:16:11.085 --> 00:16:13.522
THEN THEY'LL BOTH
BE WIPED OUT.

00:16:13.522 --> 00:16:15.226
BUT NOT FOR LONG,

00:16:15.226 --> 00:16:17.397
'CAUSE THAT DRAGON
COMES BACK.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:29.418
AH, MAN, NOT MY GILFORD.

00:16:29.418 --> 00:16:33.191
NOT ONLY IS
YOUR BEST CARD GONE,

00:16:33.191 --> 00:16:34.995
MY BEST CARD'S BACK!

00:16:40.405 --> 00:16:42.208
THE ODDS ARE AGAINST YOU.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:48.319
DAT MAY BE, BUT MY CARDS
NEVA LET ME DOWN.

00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:53.796
C'MON, DECK, LET'S ROCK!

00:16:53.796 --> 00:16:56.801
FIRST, I'LL PLAY
A MAGIC CARD KNOWN
AS POT OF GREED,

00:16:56.801 --> 00:16:58.905
SO I DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:17:05.383 --> 00:17:08.054
Joey, voice-over:
I JUST DREW
GIANT TRUNADE.

00:17:08.054 --> 00:17:11.160
DAT SENDS EVERY MAGIC
AND TRAP CARD ON
BOTH SIDES THE FIELD

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.063
BACK TO
THE PLAYERS' HANDS,

00:17:13.063 --> 00:17:15.568
SO I CAN USE IT
TO GET RID OF
HIS ANCIENT CITY

00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:18.574
AND PREVENT HIM
FROM BRINGING BACK
HIS DRAGON.

00:17:18.574 --> 00:17:20.210
HOLD ON.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.581
GIANT TRUNADE
ALSO SENDS MY MAGIC
AND TRAP CARDS

00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:24.985
BACK TO MY HAND.

00:17:24.985 --> 00:17:28.158
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M ABOUT TO SAY THIS,

00:17:28.158 --> 00:17:30.996
BUT YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT IT TOO MUCH!

00:17:30.996 --> 00:17:33.567
KEEP YOUR COMMENTS
TO YOURSELF!

00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:36.572
I MAY NOT HAVE A DECK
FULL OF RARE CARDS
LIKE YOURS,

00:17:36.572 --> 00:17:39.912
AND I MAY NOT PLAN OUT
MY STRATEGY STEP BY STEP
LIKE YOU DO,

00:17:39.912 --> 00:17:42.183
BUT I THINK PRETTY
QUICKLY ON MY FEET

00:17:42.183 --> 00:17:46.190
AND I ALWAYS
TRUST MY INSTINCTS
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.861
I GUESS DAT'S
'CAUSE I HAD SOME
GOOD TEACHERS.

00:17:48.861 --> 00:17:50.364
THANK YOU, JOSEPH.

00:17:50.364 --> 00:17:52.101
I MEAN, GOOD FOR YOU.

00:17:52.101 --> 00:17:54.772
YEAH, I WAS TAUGHT TO
PLAY DA GAME WITH HEART,

00:17:54.772 --> 00:17:58.779
AND ABOVE ALL,
ALWAYS HAVE FUN,

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:00.383
AND DAT'S JUST
WHAT I'M DOIN'.

00:18:00.383 --> 00:18:01.618
ARE YOU READY, PAL?

00:18:01.618 --> 00:18:02.853
FIRE AWAY.

00:18:02.853 --> 00:18:05.057
DA FIRST THING
I'M GONNA DO

00:18:05.057 --> 00:18:07.161
IS ACTIVATE
MY PREMATURE BURIAL
MAGIC CARD.

00:18:07.161 --> 00:18:10.868
ALL I HAFTA DO IS
GIVE UP 800 LIFE POINTS

00:18:10.868 --> 00:18:13.539
TO BRING ONE MONSTER
BACK FROM MY GRAVEYARD,

00:18:13.539 --> 00:18:17.948
AND I CHOOSE
MY GOBLIN ATTACK FORCE!

00:18:17.948 --> 00:18:21.554
DEN I'LL ACTIVATE
ANOTHER MAGIC CARD
CALLED GIANT TRUNADE.

00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:26.597
OH, NO!

00:18:26.597 --> 00:18:29.034
NOW ALL OUR MAGIC
AND TRAP CARDS
RETURN TO OUR HANDS.

00:18:34.611 --> 00:18:36.848
MY CITY!

00:18:36.848 --> 00:18:41.423
WITHOUT THAT,
I HAVE NOTHING TO PROTECT
MY ANCIENT DRAGON.

00:18:41.423 --> 00:18:44.095
INCONCEIVABLE.

00:18:44.095 --> 00:18:45.097
AWESOME!

00:18:45.097 --> 00:18:46.900
IF HE DOESN'T SCREW THIS UP,

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.838
JOEY MAY ACTUALLY
HAVE A SHOT OF
WINNING THIS DUEL!

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:52.376
I'M AFRAID THERE'S MORE
WHERE DAT CAME FROM.

00:18:52.376 --> 00:18:54.914
NOW DAT PREMATURE
BURIAL'S BACK
IN MY HAND,

00:18:54.914 --> 00:18:56.584
I CAN ACTIVATE IT AGAIN.

00:18:56.584 --> 00:18:58.220
OH, BOY.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.229
DAT MEANS
GILFORD THE LIGHTNING
COMES BACK, TOO.

00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:05.567
A'RIGHT, GILFORD,
ATTACK!

00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:08.238
SLICE AND DICE
HIS ANCIENT DRAGON.

00:19:17.522 --> 00:19:18.523
I'M WIDE OPEN.

00:19:18.523 --> 00:19:21.195
DAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:21.195 --> 00:19:23.098
ANY LAST REQUESTS?

00:19:28.374 --> 00:19:30.178
DID JOEY JUST WIN?

00:19:30.178 --> 00:19:32.014
IT WOULD APPEAR HE DID.

00:19:32.014 --> 00:19:34.685
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

00:19:34.685 --> 00:19:37.424
NICE DUEL, STRANGER.

00:19:37.424 --> 00:19:41.531
I JUST WISH I KNEW
WHO YOU WERE.

00:19:41.531 --> 00:19:43.535
ACTUALLY, YOU ALREADY DO.

00:19:43.535 --> 00:19:45.705
PEEK-A-BOO.

00:19:45.705 --> 00:19:47.209
NO WAY!

00:19:47.209 --> 00:19:48.544
WAY.

00:19:48.544 --> 00:19:50.547
PRETTY GOOD DISGUISE, HUH?

00:19:50.547 --> 00:19:54.622
THAT COULD BE MY NEW LOOK.

00:19:54.622 --> 00:19:57.293
THERE'S SOMETHIN'
I DON'T GET, MR. MOTO.

00:19:57.293 --> 00:20:01.701
WHY'D YA JOIN DIS TOURNAMENT
IN DA FIRST PLACE?

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:03.605
YOU SHOULD BE RESTING.

00:20:03.605 --> 00:20:06.510
TELL YA THE TRUTH,
I WAS HOPING TO DUEL YOU.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.114
WHY ME?

00:20:09.114 --> 00:20:11.352
I DID TEACH YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW,

00:20:11.352 --> 00:20:14.057
SO I THOUGHT
IT WAS ABOUT TIME
TO TEST YOU.

00:20:14.057 --> 00:20:17.063
AND? DID I PASS OR WHAT?

00:20:17.063 --> 00:20:18.365
LET'S SEE.

00:20:18.365 --> 00:20:22.405
IF I HAD TO GRADE YOUR DUEL,
YOU'D GET "A PLUS."

00:20:22.405 --> 00:20:24.409
YES!

00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:26.045
I ACED THE TEST.

00:20:26.045 --> 00:20:28.316
WELL, I GUESS
THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

00:20:28.316 --> 00:20:31.154
PINCH ME, 'CAUSE
I MUST BE DREAMING.

00:20:31.154 --> 00:20:34.494
HEY, IT'S A FIGURE
OF SPEECH!

00:20:34.494 --> 00:20:37.566
WHAT A WAY
TO KICK THINGS OFF.

00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:39.703
YOUR GRANDFATHER
DUELED QUITE WELL.

00:20:39.703 --> 00:20:41.406
YEAH, AND YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE?

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.577
I THINK HE HAD MORE
FUN THAN ANYONE.

00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:45.915
SO WHY'D YOU PICK
THE NAME "APDNARG"?

00:20:45.915 --> 00:20:48.017
IT'S "GRANDPA"
SPELLED BACKWARDS.

00:20:48.017 --> 00:20:49.486
[GASPING]

00:20:49.486 --> 00:20:50.487
I DON'T GET IT.
