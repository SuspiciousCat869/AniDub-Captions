00:09:55.459 --> 00:09:58.465
OF THIS, MY BROTHER
WOULD NEVER APPROVE.

00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:10.121
WE STAND BEFORE
THE EVIL VILLAGE
OF KUL ELNA.

00:10:10.121 --> 00:10:11.624
THE INHABITANTS
ARE POSSESSED

00:10:11.624 --> 00:10:14.529
WITH THE DARKEST SPIRITS
KNOWN TO MAN.

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:17.135
THAT'S WHY
THEY HAVE BEEN RAIDING
OUR ROYAL TOMBS

00:10:17.135 --> 00:10:19.539
AND STEALING OUR RICHES
FOR YEARS.

00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:22.579
BUT TONIGHT
WE SHALL PUT AN END
TO THEIR EVIL WAYS.

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:27.088
CAPTURE THOSE SPIRITS, MEN!

00:10:29.326 --> 00:10:31.663
RELINQUISH
YOUR EVIL SPIRITS!

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:34.069
LEAVE OUR
VILLAGE AT ONCE!

00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:36.140
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.648
DOWN WITH
THEIR EVIL WAYS!

00:10:43.053 --> 00:10:48.164
IT'S TIME
TO PUT YOUR SOULS
TO GOOD USE!

00:10:48.164 --> 00:10:53.607
SPIRITS OF DARKNESS,
I COMMAND THEE!

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:56.680
OFFER UP YOUR POWER,
YOUR VERY ESSENCE,

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.256
SO THAT
THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS
MAY BE BORN!

00:11:03.026 --> 00:11:04.061
Aknadin, voice-over:
IT IS NOT FROM GOLD

00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:06.099
THAT THESE TREASURES
ARE FORGED,

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:09.239
BUT FROM THE DARKNESS
THAT LIES WITHIN
THE HEARTS OF MEN.

00:11:17.622 --> 00:11:19.191
IT WORKED!

00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:23.300
BEHOLD,
THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS!

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.703
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:11:32.619 --> 00:11:37.127
Swen: MASTER AKNADIN,
PERHAPS WE'VE
ANGERED THE GODS.

00:11:40.468 --> 00:11:44.676
IT LOOKS AS IF
THE 7 ITEMS FIT
INSIDE THAT STONE.

00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:54.028
WHAT HAVE I UNLEASHED?

00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:17.840
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.382
RETURN THOSE TREASURES
TO THEIR RESTING PLACE.

00:12:22.382 --> 00:12:26.891
THESE ITEMS
BELONG TO US.

00:12:28.728 --> 00:12:31.400
SHADOW CREATURE,
UNHAND ME AT ONCE.

00:12:36.244 --> 00:12:40.652
MASTER AKNADIN,
WE MUST LEAVE NOW!

00:12:40.652 --> 00:12:43.758
NOT WITHOUT THIS.

00:12:43.758 --> 00:12:45.896
IT'S GONE!

00:13:01.026 --> 00:13:02.863
I MADE IT.

00:13:02.863 --> 00:13:08.608
I'M HOME.

00:13:08.608 --> 00:13:12.549
IT SEEMS THE KING OF EGYPT
HAS GIVEN UP.

00:13:12.549 --> 00:13:14.052
[LAUGHING]

00:13:14.052 --> 00:13:15.555
THOSE FOOLS!

00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:17.926
THEY ALL RAN AWAY!

00:13:17.926 --> 00:13:21.266
MEN, THOSE COWARDS HAVE
ABANDONED THEIR KINGDOM,

00:13:21.266 --> 00:13:23.403
WHICH MEANS THAT EGYPT
BELONGS TO US NOW.

00:13:30.384 --> 00:13:34.893
LET'S GO!

00:13:36.563 --> 00:13:38.634
LOOK AT THESE POOR FOOLS.

00:13:38.634 --> 00:13:41.072
THEY FACE US
WITH AN ARMY OF 7.

00:13:41.072 --> 00:13:44.813
SHOW NO MERCY, MEN!

00:13:44.813 --> 00:13:49.322
IN THE NAME OF EGYPT,
MILLENNIUM ITEMS,
ACTIVATE NOW!

00:13:51.426 --> 00:13:55.701
MIGHTY SPIRITS,
PROTECT OUR KINGDOM.

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:15.074
Aknadin, voice-over:
I SHALL NEVER
FORGET THAT DAY.

00:14:15.074 --> 00:14:19.549
IT WAS BOTH
MY GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT
AND MY DARKEST HOUR.

00:14:19.549 --> 00:14:22.521
MY EFFORTS
HAD SAVED EGYPT FROM
DESTRUCTION,

00:14:22.521 --> 00:14:25.094
BUT I DESERTED
MY FAMILY TO DO SO.

00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:30.571
AND MY ONLY SON SETO
WOULD NEVER KNOW OF
HIS NOBLE ANCESTRY.

00:14:30.571 --> 00:14:33.910
Shimon:
ON BEHALF OF KING
AKNAMKANON,

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.783
LET US WELCOME
THE NEW GUARDIAN
OF THE MILLENNIUM ROD,

00:14:36.783 --> 00:14:38.353
MASTER SETO.

00:14:38.353 --> 00:14:40.924
THOUGH RAISED BY PEASANTS,
HE HAS RISEN TO EXCELLENCE,

00:14:40.924 --> 00:14:45.968
PASSING HIS TESTS
WITH THE HIGHEST SCORES
WE'VE EVER SEEN.

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:48.707
WELCOME TO
MY SACRED COURT.

00:14:48.707 --> 00:14:51.913
MANY THANKS
FOR THIS GREAT HONOR,
MY KING.

00:14:51.913 --> 00:14:53.650
I'LL SERVE THEE WELL.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.658
FROM THIS DAY FORTH,
I AM YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT.

00:14:57.658 --> 00:14:59.361
AS THE YOUNGEST
ROYAL GUARDIAN,

00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:03.470
YOU WILL SIT AT THE
RIGHT HAND OF MY SON,
THE FUTURE KING.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.108
THANK YOU, YOUR HIGHNESS.

00:15:06.108 --> 00:15:08.947
YOU HAVE BEEN
UNUSUALLY QUIET,
AKNADIN.

00:15:08.947 --> 00:15:10.551
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:11.886
Aknadin, voice-over:
I WAS IN SHOCK.

00:15:11.886 --> 00:15:14.391
THERE, KNEELING
BEFORE THE PHARAOH,

00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:16.161
UNBEKNOWNST TO ANYONE
IN THE ROOM,

00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:18.132
WAS MY OWN SON.

00:15:18.132 --> 00:15:21.639
THE BOY I ABANDONED
AND STRIPPED OF HIS
ROYAL HERITAGE

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:25.012
HAD NOW OVERCOME
EVERY OBSTACLE
AND RISEN TO GREATNESS,

00:15:25.012 --> 00:15:26.716
ALL ON HIS OWN MERIT.

00:15:26.716 --> 00:15:31.926
AT THAT MOMENT I REALIZED
IT IS YOU WHO
SHOULD BE PHARAOH.

00:15:31.926 --> 00:15:36.501
MY SON DESERVES TO BE KING,
AND MARK MY WORDS,

00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:38.773
KING HE SHALL BECOME.

00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:47.892
ALRIGHT, DIABOUND,

00:15:47.892 --> 00:15:51.632
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
WE SHOWED OFF
YOUR NEWEST ABILITY,

00:15:51.632 --> 00:15:53.669
ILLUSIONARY SHOCKWAVE.

00:15:59.381 --> 00:16:02.954
DIABOUND STEALS THE ABILITIES
OF THE ENEMIES IT DEFEATS.

00:16:02.954 --> 00:16:05.059
THAT LAST ATTACK
CAME COURTESY OF MAHAD.

00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:08.232
THAT CAN'T BE!

00:16:08.232 --> 00:16:11.872
SLIFER, LIGHTNING BLAST!

00:16:11.872 --> 00:16:17.684
YES!

00:16:17.684 --> 00:16:22.193
SORRY, PHARAOH,
BUT YOU'RE NOT IN
THE CLEAR JUST YET.

00:16:24.063 --> 00:16:25.131
NOW!

00:16:31.511 --> 00:16:32.513
NO!

00:16:32.513 --> 00:16:34.818
YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT.

00:16:34.818 --> 00:16:37.991
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH!

00:16:37.991 --> 00:16:39.894
AND YOU SEEM
TO HAVE FORGOTTEN

00:16:39.894 --> 00:16:43.802
THAT THIS BATTLE ISN'T
ONE OF YOUR LITTLE
CARD TOURNAMENTS, PHARAOH,

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:45.906
AND AS YOU'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT,

00:16:45.906 --> 00:16:48.746
IN THIS ARENA,
I HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.

00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:53.187
DIABOUND,
DESTROY THE CITY!

00:16:53.187 --> 00:16:54.858
LOOK! IN THE SKY!

00:16:54.858 --> 00:16:56.193
WHAT IS THAT THING?

00:16:56.193 --> 00:16:57.195
WHAT THING?

00:16:57.195 --> 00:16:59.701
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

00:16:59.701 --> 00:17:02.272
OH, NO!

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:06.948
MAKE WAY FOR HIS MAJESTY.

00:17:06.948 --> 00:17:09.186
STOP!

00:17:09.186 --> 00:17:11.290
THIS FIGHT IS
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.794
VERY WELL.

00:17:12.794 --> 00:17:15.031
THEN IT'S TIME TO DECIDE,

00:17:15.031 --> 00:17:18.271
CONTINUE TO FIGHT ME,
OR SAVE YOUR PEOPLE!

00:17:29.041 --> 00:17:31.513
I THINK THAT RED MONSTER
JUST SAVED US.

00:17:33.484 --> 00:17:35.388
QUICK, RUN!

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:38.661
SLIFER, PROTECT
THESE VILLAGERS.

00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:40.665
HOW NOBLE OF YOU
TO USE YOUR MONSTER

00:17:40.665 --> 00:17:43.336
AS A SHIELD
TO SAVE THESE FOOLS.

00:17:43.336 --> 00:17:46.109
BUT HOW MUCH ABUSE
CAN SLIFER ENDURE?

00:17:46.109 --> 00:17:48.079
I GUESS WE'LL SEE.

00:17:55.494 --> 00:17:57.732
LOOKS LIKE A DEAD END,
PHARAOH.

00:17:57.732 --> 00:18:02.642
SO MUCH FOR RESCUING
THOSE PRECIOUS
VILLAGERS OF YOURS.

00:18:02.642 --> 00:18:05.514
NO HARM SHALL BEFALL
THE PEOPLE OF
MY KINGDOM, BAKURA,

00:18:05.514 --> 00:18:06.850
MARK MY WORDS.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:11.860
SLIFER, ATTACK!

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.096
WHOA!

00:18:13.096 --> 00:18:14.665
THOSE ARE DEFINITELY
NOT HOLOGRAMS!

00:18:14.665 --> 00:18:20.544
UH, NO.

00:18:20.544 --> 00:18:23.149
WHAT?

00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:25.253
I REFUSE TO LET YOU
PUT THIS CITY
IN ANY MORE DANGER.

00:18:25.253 --> 00:18:29.762
SLIFER, TAKE THIS FIGHT
TO THE SKIES!

00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:34.438
MY PEOPLE ARE SAFE
FROM YOUR ATTACKS.

00:18:34.438 --> 00:18:37.344
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD
MAY CONTROL THE SKIES,

00:18:37.344 --> 00:18:40.450
HOWEVER, MY DIABOUND
COMMANDS THE DARKNESS,

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:45.327
MAKING HIM INFINITELY
MORE POWERFUL
THAN YOUR DRAGON.

00:18:45.327 --> 00:18:46.829
IT'S GONE!

00:18:46.829 --> 00:18:48.733
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

00:18:48.733 --> 00:18:52.608
MY CREATURE HAS THE ABILITY
TO MOVE IN SHADOW,
COMPLETELY UNDETECTABLE,

00:18:52.608 --> 00:18:56.249
AND BY THE TIME
IT REVEALS ITSELF,
IT SHALL BE TOO LATE.

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:03.429
YOUR BOND WITH THE GODS
IS SO STRONG

00:19:03.429 --> 00:19:05.634
THAT WHEN THEY FEEL PAIN,
SO DO YOU.

00:19:05.634 --> 00:19:10.142
NOW HOW SHALL I CONCLUDE
THIS BATTLE OF OURS, PHARAOH?

00:19:10.142 --> 00:19:13.650
SHALL I DESTROY
YOUR SLIFER OR THIS CITY?

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.720
OR PERHAPS I'LL HAVE
DIABOUND CRUSH YOU.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.827
OF COURSE,
THERE IS A SIMPLER WAY
TO SPARE YOURSELF

00:19:18.827 --> 00:19:21.164
AND YOUR CITY
FROM DESTRUCTION.

00:19:21.164 --> 00:19:23.302
JUST SURRENDER
YOUR MILLENNIUM PUZZLE TO ME.

00:19:23.302 --> 00:19:26.341
IF YOU DO,
I PROMISE TO LEAVE YOU

00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:29.214
AND YOUR PRECIOUS
VILLAGERS ALONE.

00:19:29.214 --> 00:19:30.817
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
IF I HAND OVER
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE,

00:19:30.817 --> 00:19:33.155
BAKURA WILL BECOME
UNSTOPPABLE.

00:19:33.155 --> 00:19:37.831
BUT I CAN'T LET HIM
HARM MY PEOPLE.

00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:40.937
A WISE DECISION,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

00:19:40.937 --> 00:19:43.175
THIS JUST MIGHT WORK.

00:19:43.175 --> 00:19:44.845
IF I CAN DISTRACT HIM
FOR LONG ENOUGH,

00:19:44.845 --> 00:19:46.616
I MAY BE ABLE
TO DEFEAT HIM.

00:19:46.616 --> 00:19:49.187
IT'S MY ONLY HOPE.

00:19:49.187 --> 00:19:52.293
NOW, GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE
AND KNEEL BEFORE ME,

00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:54.798
I COMMAND YOU.

00:19:54.798 --> 00:19:57.470
NEVER.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:01.511
SLIFER, NOW!

00:20:01.511 --> 00:20:03.682
ALL RIGHT,
CALL OFF YOUR DIABOUND

00:20:03.682 --> 00:20:06.454
AND I SHALL CALL OFF
MY EGYPTIAN GOD.

00:20:06.454 --> 00:20:07.791
NO.

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:10.629
TWO CAN PLAY AT THIS GAME--

00:20:10.629 --> 00:20:14.771
JUST LOOK BEHIND YOU.

00:20:14.771 --> 00:20:19.982
WELL, THIS IS QUITE
AN INTERESTING PREDICAMENT,
ISN'T IT?

00:20:19.982 --> 00:20:22.386
WHAT TO DO NOW?

00:20:22.386 --> 00:20:26.461
IT LOOKS LIKE A DRAW,
BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING.

00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:30.981
DIABOUND, DESTROY HIM!

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.351
HOLD ON!

00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:37.153
THAT'S SETO'S CREATURE!

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:40.724
PHARAOH,
WE SHALL SAVE THEE!
