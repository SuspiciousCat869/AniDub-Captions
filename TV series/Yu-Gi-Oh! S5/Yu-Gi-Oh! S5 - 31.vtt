Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.370
MAHAD,
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.805
THE MILLENNIUM RING--

00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:10.245
WE ARE IN THE PRESENCE
OF PURE EVIL.

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:11.948
PARDON THE INTERRUPTION,

00:00:11.948 --> 00:00:14.251
BUT APPARENTLY
SOMEONE LEFT ME
OFF THE GUEST LIST.

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:15.420
BAKURA!

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.157
NOW, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND,

00:00:17.157 --> 00:00:18.893
HAND OVER
YOUR MILLENNIUM ITEMS!

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:19.928
WHAT?

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:21.765
LET ME INTRODUCE MY FRIEND.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:23.734
DIABOUND MEET THE PHARAOH,

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:27.341
AND PHARAOH,
MEET THE INSTRUMENT
OF YOUR DEMISE.

00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:29.979
NOW, ANY LAST WORDS
BEFORE I END THIS SHADOW GAME

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.115
AND SEIZE CONTROL
OF YOUR MILLENNIUM ITEMS?

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.153
GOOD.

00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:36.122
THEN, DIABOUND,
BRING ME VICTORY.

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.992
STOP RIGHT THERE,
BAKURA!

00:00:37.992 --> 00:00:42.233
I SUMMON OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR!

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:43.235
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:45.272
OBELISK, ATTACK!

00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:48.010
FIST OF FURY!

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.449
NOW, DIABOUND,
USE THE POWER OF BLUE-EYES!

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.884
WHITE LIGHTNING ATTACK!

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.903
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE ♪

00:01:03.903 --> 00:01:05.206
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE ♪

00:01:05.206 --> 00:01:06.208

IT'S TIME TO D-D-DUEL!

00:01:52.887 --> 00:01:54.824
♪ YU-GI-OH ♪

00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:11.753
Aknadin:
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!

00:02:11.753 --> 00:02:14.324
THEIR POWER
IS EQUAL!

00:02:21.403 --> 00:02:25.243
HE WITHSTOOD THE ASSAULT
OF AN EGYPTIAN GOD.

00:02:25.243 --> 00:02:26.445
Bandit-Bakura, voice-over:
HAD I NOT ACQUIRED

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.883
THE ATTACKING POWER
OF KAIBA'S BLUE-EYES,

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:30.919
MY DIABOUND
WOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:32.855
I'D BEST BE TAKING
MY LEAVE...

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:34.359
FOR NOW.

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.096
THIS ISN'T OVER, PHARAOH.

00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:40.135
AND YOU,
I BELIEVE IT'S MAHAD?

00:02:40.135 --> 00:02:42.940
DON'T GROW TOO FOND
OF THAT ITEM
AROUND YOUR NECK.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.008
I HAVE A SPECIAL,
SHALL WE SAY,

00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:46.913
ATTACHMENT TO
THE MILLENNIUM RING.

00:02:46.913 --> 00:02:49.083
AT ONE TIME,
IT WAS MINE.

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:51.188
THIS ITEM WAS
CREATED FOR ME,

00:02:51.188 --> 00:02:52.857
SO YOU LIE.

00:02:52.857 --> 00:02:53.891
BUT IT IS DESTINED FOR ME.

00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:57.765
IN FACT,
ALL 7 MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:02:57.765 --> 00:03:00.203
HAVE BEEN FATED
TO FALL INTO MY HANDS.

00:03:00.203 --> 00:03:02.206
JUST YOU WAIT.

00:03:02.206 --> 00:03:07.048
STOP!

00:03:07.048 --> 00:03:09.051
WE MUSTN'T LET HIM ESCAPE!

00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:10.888
GUARDS, AFTER HIM!

00:03:10.888 --> 00:03:11.956
YES, MASTER.

00:03:21.506 --> 00:03:26.013
YOU CAN'T CONTAIN ME.

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:33.126
'TIL WE MEET AGAIN.

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:35.796
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
SO I WAS SENT BACK IN TIME

00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:39.069
TO RELIVE THESE EVENTS
ALL OVER AGAIN?

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.405
SHIMON?

00:03:40.405 --> 00:03:44.913
TELL ME,
WHAT IS THAT STRANGE
OBJECT IN THE SKY.

00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:46.415
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:49.820
UP THERE, THAT PYRAMID.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.425
I'M SORRY,
YOUR EXCELLENCY,

00:03:52.425 --> 00:03:54.963
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:57.834
BUT IT'S RIGHT THERE
IN PLAIN SIGHT.

00:03:57.834 --> 00:03:58.836
PHARAOH?

00:03:58.836 --> 00:03:59.905
LET'S GO IN.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.575
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.811
VERY WELL.

00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:04.980
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
I'M SURE IT HAS SOMETHING

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.151
TO DO WITH
BAKURA'S SHADOW GAME.

00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:12.894
BUT WHY CAN
NO ONE ELSE SEE IT?

00:04:12.894 --> 00:04:14.563
Seto, voice-over:
IS HE TRULY
THE CHOSEN PHARAOH

00:04:14.563 --> 00:04:17.301
THE SCRIPTURES SPEAK OF?

00:04:17.301 --> 00:04:20.506
MY KING,
YOU FOUGHT BRAVELY.

00:04:20.506 --> 00:04:25.082
YES, THANKS TO YOU,
WE CAN ALL REST WELL.

00:04:25.082 --> 00:04:27.151
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
IF ONLY KAIBA WERE
ABLE TO SEE HIMSELF

00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:32.494
FIGHTING BOLDLY
BY MY SIDE.

00:04:32.494 --> 00:04:36.601
CAN'T THESE PEOPLE SEE
THIS IS ONLY A CARD GAME?

00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:38.170
WHATTA YOU LOOKING AT?

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.277
YOU THINK I'M GONNA LET YOU
CHANGE MY MIND?

00:04:42.277 --> 00:04:44.447
I AM NOT FLYING TO EGYPT.

00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:45.850
LOOK AT ME.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.627
I'M TALKING TO SOME
GOLDEN ANTIQUE EYEBALL.

00:04:51.627 --> 00:04:53.130
HOLD ON.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.399
WHAT'S THAT?

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.981
NO WAY.

00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:04.983
IT'S A TRICK.

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:15.468
Kaiba, voice-over:
I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT
THIS ANCIENT NONSENSE

00:05:15.468 --> 00:05:17.037
FOR TOO LONG,

00:05:17.037 --> 00:05:18.640
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO SHUT THESE PEOPLE UP

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.244
IS TO PROVE THEM ALL WRONG.

00:05:21.244 --> 00:05:23.982
THIS IS KC-1
SETTING COURSE FOR
CAIRO, EGYPT.

00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:33.461
Aknadin:
ANY WORD ON BAKURA?

00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:35.799
Seto:
WITH AN ENTIRE SQUADRON
OF GUARDS HIS TRAIL,

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:36.801
HE WILL NOT GET FAR.

00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:38.437
REALLY?

00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:39.872
AFTER SEEING
HIS FRIGHTENINGLY
IMPRESSIVE

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.975
DISPLAY OF POWER,
I DISAGREE.

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:43.946
LISTEN, SETO,

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:46.551
WE'RE NOT DEALING
WITH ANY
ORDINARY THIEF.

00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:48.287
HE'S HARBORING
A CREATURE

00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:52.160
WITH A STRENGTH
THAT RIVALS THAT OF
THE EGYPTIAN GODS.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.833
MASTER AKNADIN,
YOU'VE JUST GIVEN ME AN IDEA.

00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:57.502
THIS TABLET SANCTUARY
IS FULL OF CREATURES

00:05:57.502 --> 00:06:00.741
WE'VE PULLED FROM
THE HEARTS OF CRIMINALS.

00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:03.313
SURELY THERE MUST BE
OTHER EVIL-DOERS

00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:05.683
HARBORING AS MUCH DARKNESS
AS THIS BAKURA,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

00:06:05.683 --> 00:06:09.656
I WOULD.

00:06:09.656 --> 00:06:11.392
YOUR KING WANTED POWER.

00:06:11.392 --> 00:06:12.728
THAT'S WHY
HE DEVISED A PLAN

00:06:12.728 --> 00:06:16.301
TO USE THE 7 ITEMS
TO CONTROL THE ENTIRE WORLD.

00:06:16.301 --> 00:06:18.939
THE SECRET LIES
IN THE VILLAGE
OF KUL ELLNA.

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:21.009
Aknadin, voice-over:
PERHAPS BAKURA ESCAPED
FROM THAT VILLAGE

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.580
BEFORE IT WAS DESTROYED.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.918
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE INCREDIBLE POWER

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:28.255
OF THE BEAST THAT
DWELLS WITHIN HIM,

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:30.592
FOR HIS ANGER AND HATRED
WOULD BE IMMEASURABLE.

00:06:30.592 --> 00:06:33.430
ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS FIND THESE CRIMINALS.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.435
THEN WE SIMPLY
USE THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:06:36.435 --> 00:06:37.938
TO HARNESS
THE EVIL CREATURES

00:06:37.938 --> 00:06:40.009
THAT DWELL WITHIN
THEIR HEARTS.

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:44.316
YES, WE'LL HAVE
AN UNSTOPPABLE ARMY
OF SHADOW MONSTERS.

00:06:44.316 --> 00:06:47.755
SETO,
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING
IS COMPLETELY IMMORAL,

00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:50.026
NOT TO MENTION
QUITE DANGEROUS.

00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:52.330
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MASTER,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.867
WOULD WE NOT BE REDUCING
THE AMOUNT OF LAWBREAKERS

00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:56.804
THAT WREAK HAVOC ON
THIS KINGDOM EVERY DAY?

00:06:56.804 --> 00:06:57.806
PERHAPS.

00:06:57.806 --> 00:06:59.209
AND IN THE END,

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:00.611
WE'D BE CREATING
THIS MONSTER ARMY

00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:03.749
IN ORDER TO PROTECT
THE PEOPLE OF EGYPT.

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:06.354
IS THAT NOT WHAT
WE ALL PROMISED TO DO

00:07:06.354 --> 00:07:09.893
THE DAY WE TOOK OUR OATH
AS THE SACRED GUARDIANS
OF THE PHARAOH?

00:07:20.545 --> 00:07:22.281
MILLENNIUM NECKLACE,

00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:23.483
SHOW ME WHAT
DANGERS LIE AHEAD.

00:07:30.495 --> 00:07:31.497
NOTHING?

00:07:31.497 --> 00:07:34.302
EVER SINCE
BAKURA ARRIVED,

00:07:34.302 --> 00:07:38.341
MY VISION OF THE FUTURE
HAS BEEN CLOUDED.

00:07:38.341 --> 00:07:42.015
IT'S AS IF THE KINGDOM
IS SHROUDED IN
A BLANKET OF SHADOWS.

00:07:42.015 --> 00:07:45.120
BUT I MUST CONTINUE
MY EFFORTS TO SEE
THROUGH THE DARKNESS.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.324
YOU SHOULD PRESERVE
YOUR ENERGY.

00:07:47.324 --> 00:07:48.793
THIS EVENING'S BATTLE
WITH BAKURA

00:07:48.793 --> 00:07:52.299
HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL
ON ALL OF US, ISIS.

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:55.738
WHEN HE RETURNS,
WE'LL NEED OUR FULL POWER
IN ORDER TO FACE HIM.

00:07:55.738 --> 00:07:58.410
SO LISTEN TO SHADA
AND GET SOME REST.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.713
I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP,
BOTH OF YOU.

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:04.320
BUT MY MILLENNIUM
NECKLACE MAY BE
OUR ONLY HOPE

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.358
OF KNOWING WHAT BAKURA
IS PLOTTING NEXT.

00:08:07.358 --> 00:08:10.496
SINCE THE WELL BEING
OF THE CITIZENS OF EGYPT
IS AT STAKE,

00:08:10.496 --> 00:08:15.739
I'M AFRAID REST IS
A LUXURY I CAN'T AFFORD.

00:08:15.739 --> 00:08:17.810
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
IF I'M UNABLE
TO SAVE MANKIND

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.514
FROM THE EVIL THAT'S
ABOUT TO UNFOLD,

00:08:20.514 --> 00:08:24.822
WHAT WILL BECOME
OF THE FUTURE?

00:08:24.822 --> 00:08:28.661
THE SAFETY OF MY FRIENDS
DEPENDS UPON MY VICTORY.

00:08:28.661 --> 00:08:32.768
YUGI, I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN
TO PROTECT YOU.

00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:42.118
EVERY DOORWAY
IN THIS PLACE
LOOKS THE SAME.

00:08:42.118 --> 00:08:43.653
NO JOKE.

00:08:43.653 --> 00:08:46.358
WE'LL NEVER FIND
THE RIGHT ONE.

00:08:46.358 --> 00:08:49.363
AND EVERY TIME I OPEN ONE,
I FIND 50 MORE OF THEM.

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:50.899
EVEN THE DOORS
HAVE DOORS?

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:54.439
HEY, GUYS,
EITHER THE BATTERIES
ON MY WATCH JUST DIED

00:08:54.439 --> 00:08:57.377
OR TIME IS SOMEHOW
STANDING STILL.

00:08:57.377 --> 00:08:59.681
HEY, SHE'S RIGHT.

00:08:59.681 --> 00:09:02.420
DUDES, THIS PLACE
IS STARTING
TO FREAK ME OUT.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.489
IF WE DON'T FIND
THE PHARAOH SOON,
I'M GONNA LOSE IT.

00:09:04.489 --> 00:09:05.491
HOLD ON.

00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:06.526
THAT'S THE ONE.

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:08.797
I DON'T HAVE
A MILLENNIUM THINGY,

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:11.435
BUT I DO HAVE INSTINCTS.

00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:14.039
THEN I SAY
WE BUST THAT SUCKER
DOWN ON 3.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:15.642
3!
3!

00:09:15.642 --> 00:09:18.547
GUYS, WAIT.

00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:23.389
PHARAOH,
HERE WE COME.

00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:25.625
SO MUCH FOR
YOUR INSTINCTS.

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:26.761
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:28.797
HOW CAN THEY BE UP THERE
AND DOWN HERE?

00:09:28.797 --> 00:09:32.804
LET'S ASK QUESTIONS LATER.

00:09:32.804 --> 00:09:34.040
THANKS.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.876
MANY DOORWAYS
WITHIN THE CHASMS

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.880
OF THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
CONTAIN TRAPS.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.553
YOU MIGHT WANNA TELL US
THAT SOONER NEXT TIME!

00:09:41.553 --> 00:09:43.923
CERTAIN DOORWAYS
CONTAIN TRAPS...

00:09:43.923 --> 00:09:47.663
I THOUGHT HE WAS
S'POSDA FIND THIS
DOORWAY FOR US.

00:09:47.663 --> 00:09:49.633
HEY, WAIT A SEC.

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:52.739
THERE'S NO ONE
WHO'S CLOSER TO THE PHARAOH
THAN YUGI IS, RIGHT, GUYS?

00:09:52.739 --> 00:09:55.009
SO MAYBE IF YOU
CONCENTRATE HARD ENOUGH,

00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:56.011
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT DOOR HE'S BEHIND.

00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:58.415
I'LL TRY.

00:09:58.415 --> 00:10:00.652
HEY,
IT'S WORTH A SHOT, RIGHT?

00:10:00.652 --> 00:10:02.455
WELL, I SUPPOSE,

00:10:02.455 --> 00:10:03.992
BUT EVER SINCE
HIS SPIRIT LEFT
THE PUZZLE,

00:10:03.992 --> 00:10:04.993
I HAVEN'T SENSED HIM
AT ALL.

00:10:04.993 --> 00:10:07.564
JUST TRY, YUGE.

00:10:07.564 --> 00:10:09.568
IT MAY BE THE ONLY
CHANCE WE'VE GOT.

00:10:09.568 --> 00:10:10.702
PHARAOH,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:10:10.702 --> 00:10:12.573
WE'RE ALL INSIDE THE
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:10:12.573 --> 00:10:16.078
AND WE'RE TRYING TO
FIND YOU.

00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:18.850
PHARAOH,
ARE YOU OUT THERE?

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:19.852
HELLO?

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:22.156
PHARAOH!

00:10:26.995 --> 00:10:28.831
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
IT'S STRANGE.

00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:32.003
EVERYONE HERE SEEMS TO
KNOW ME QUITE WELL,

00:10:32.003 --> 00:10:35.042
BUT I HAVE NO MEMORY
OF ANY OF THEM.

00:10:35.042 --> 00:10:37.980
WHAT DID ALL THESE
PEOPLE MEAN TO ME
WHEN I WAS PHARAOH?

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.117
DID I CONSIDER
THEM MY FRIENDS

00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:42.655
OR WERE THEY MERELY
MY SERVANTS?

00:10:42.655 --> 00:10:45.860
PARDON ME,
MY PHARAOH.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.931
HOW CAN I HELP YOU, AH...

00:10:47.931 --> 00:10:49.667
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:51.303
MAHAD.

00:10:51.303 --> 00:10:54.007
MY KING, PLEASE
ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES FOR
THE INTERRUPTION,

00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:58.048
BUT IT IS NOT WISE
FOR YOU TO BE
OUTSIDE ALONE.

00:10:58.048 --> 00:10:59.217
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:10:59.217 --> 00:11:00.219
IT'S NOT SAFE HERE.

00:11:00.219 --> 00:11:01.286
WE SHOULD GO.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.424
YES, STAY CLOSE--

00:11:03.424 --> 00:11:08.833
ESPECIALLY AFTER TODAY.

00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:11.771
ONE CAN NEVER BE
TOO CAUTIOUS.

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:12.773
[CLUNK]

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:13.774
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:19.417
STAY BEHIND ME.

00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:21.989
MANA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:11:21.989 --> 00:11:25.094
WHAT, I CAN'T PAY A VISIT
TO MY OLDEST FRIEND?

00:11:25.094 --> 00:11:27.198
I JUST MISS HIM THAT'S ALL.

00:11:27.198 --> 00:11:29.368
EVER SINCE HE'S BECOME
THE NEW PHARAOH,

00:11:29.368 --> 00:11:30.703
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO TALK AT ALL.

00:11:30.703 --> 00:11:33.275
IT HAS ONLY BEEN
ONE DAY.

00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:36.046
YOU'RE MANA,

00:11:36.046 --> 00:11:38.717
AND YOU AND I GREW UP
TOGETHER?

00:11:38.717 --> 00:11:40.888
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN
IN A WHOLE DAY,

00:11:40.888 --> 00:11:42.858
BUT YOU DIDN'T
FORGET ME, DID YOU?

00:11:42.858 --> 00:11:46.297
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
OF PRACTICING MAGIC TOGETHER,

00:11:46.297 --> 00:11:49.236
I MEAN YOU AND I
ARE PRACTICALLY FAMILY.

00:11:49.236 --> 00:11:51.205
YES, OF COURSE.

00:11:51.205 --> 00:11:52.441
HOLD ON.

00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:54.979
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
WALKING AROUND IN THE DESERT

00:11:54.979 --> 00:11:57.416
WITHOUT WEARING A HAT AGAIN,
NOW HAVE YOU?

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:59.320
MANA, THAT IS ENOUGH.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.389
IT IS NOT LIKE
IT USED TO BE.

00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:05.196
DO YOU NOT SEE, HE'S
THE KING OF EGYPT NOW,

00:12:05.196 --> 00:12:09.136
AND DOES NOT HAVE
TIME FOR--

00:12:09.136 --> 00:12:12.508
IS THAT WHY
YOU'VE BEEN DOING ALL
THE TALKING FOR HIM?

00:12:12.508 --> 00:12:14.078
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

00:12:14.078 --> 00:12:15.848
HOW DID YOU GET PAST
THE GUARDS ANYWAY?

00:12:15.848 --> 00:12:19.787
WELL, MY MAGIC'S
BEEN IMPROVING.

00:12:19.787 --> 00:12:22.225
DO NOT TELL ME
YOU USED YOUR
FREEZING SPELL.

00:12:22.225 --> 00:12:24.329
WE NEED THEM TO
GUARD THE PALACE.

00:12:24.329 --> 00:12:25.330
OOPS, SORRY.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.503
I RELEASE THEE.

00:12:28.503 --> 00:12:29.504
UH-OH.

00:12:29.504 --> 00:12:31.842
YOUR MAGIC'S IMPROVING,
IS IT?

00:12:31.842 --> 00:12:36.349
LET ME TRY THAT AGAIN.

00:12:36.349 --> 00:12:37.351
IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

00:12:37.351 --> 00:12:40.423
JUST HURRY UP.

00:12:40.423 --> 00:12:42.560
LET'S SEE,
TURNING HUMANS INTO TOADS,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.561
GETTING RID
OF BAD BREATH...

00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:47.101
AH, THE FREEZE SPELL!

00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:51.575
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
ITS GOOD TO KNOW
I HAD FRIENDS.

00:12:53.846 --> 00:12:55.182
Bandit-Bakura:
PERHAPS TRYING TO ACQUIRE

00:12:55.182 --> 00:12:58.454
ALL 7 MILLENNIUM ITEMS
AT ONCE WAS A BIT AMBITIOUS,

00:12:58.454 --> 00:13:00.691
BUT NO MATTER.

00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:03.095
THEY'LL COME TO ME
IN TIME.

00:13:03.095 --> 00:13:05.533
SO FOR NOW I'LL FOCUS
ON ONE IN PARTICULAR--

00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:08.771
THE MILLENNIUM RING.

00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:12.211
ONCE I OBTAIN THAT,
THE OTHERS WILL SOON FOLLOW.

00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:16.718
SLEEP WELL, PHARAOH.

00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:22.161
THE DAMAGE LOOKS
QUITE EXTENSIVE,
SIR.

00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:23.330
Seto, voice-over:
YOU WILL NOT GET AWAY
WITH THIS, BAKURA.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.035
EXCUSE ME?

00:13:26.035 --> 00:13:27.437
YES?

00:13:27.437 --> 00:13:31.043
ARE YOU HERE TO PROTECT US
FROM THAT SCARY GUY?

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:33.180
YES, WE ARE.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.052
I PROMISE
HE WILL NOT SCARE
ANYONE AGAIN.

00:13:36.052 --> 00:13:39.959
AW, GOOD!

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:42.229
Seto, voice-over:
THE MILLENNIUM RING.

00:13:42.229 --> 00:13:44.233
HOW STRANGE.

00:13:44.233 --> 00:13:48.740
BAKURA!

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.079
KNOW THIS,

00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:54.250
I SHALL DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.886
TO KEEP YOUR DARKNESS
FAR FROM THIS KINGDOM.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.929
Mana: SO TELL ME,

00:14:01.929 --> 00:14:04.534
IS EVERYTHING REALLY
GONNA CHANGE

00:14:04.534 --> 00:14:07.873
NOW THAT YOU'VE
BECOME THIS BIG
IMPORTANT PHARAOH?

00:14:07.873 --> 00:14:10.377
TO BE HONEST,
IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER
WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE

00:14:10.377 --> 00:14:12.214
BEFORE I WAS KING.

00:14:12.214 --> 00:14:15.052
YOU MUST HAVE
A LOT ON YOUR MIND
THESE DAYS.

00:14:15.052 --> 00:14:16.321
YES, I DO.

00:14:16.321 --> 00:14:17.422
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TIME
FOR ME, RIGHT?

00:14:17.422 --> 00:14:20.929
OF COURSE.

00:14:20.929 --> 00:14:23.333
MANA, WOULD YOU--

00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:26.338
COULD YOU TELL ME
MORE ABOUT US?

00:14:26.338 --> 00:14:28.174
WAIT, YOU'RE SERIOUS,
AREN'T YOU?

00:14:28.174 --> 00:14:30.812
THIS PHARAOH THING
HAS MADE YOU WEIRD.

00:14:30.812 --> 00:14:32.916
OOPS. DID I SAY THAT
OUT LOUD?

00:14:32.916 --> 00:14:34.986
IT'S FINE.

00:14:34.986 --> 00:14:36.488
I GUESS NOW THAT YOU'RE
THE KING OF EGYPT,

00:14:36.488 --> 00:14:39.928
I NEED TO START
CALLING YOU THINGS LIKE
"YOUR HIGHNESS."

00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:40.929
WEIRD.

00:14:49.043 --> 00:14:51.514
MAHAD, YOU STARTLED ME.

00:14:51.514 --> 00:14:55.355
GREETINGS, ISIS.

00:14:55.355 --> 00:14:59.394
HAVE YOU DISCOVERED
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS
FOR OUR KINGDOM?

00:14:59.394 --> 00:15:01.431
NO, I HAVE NOT.

00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:04.270
MY MILLENNIUM NECKLACE
HAS BEEN ACTING
STRANGELY.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.438
I SEE.

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:07.608
SO HAS MY RING.

00:15:07.608 --> 00:15:09.279
IT'S BAKURA.

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:11.115
YOU NEED NOT WORRY.

00:15:11.115 --> 00:15:13.018
I HAVE FAITH THAT
OUR NEW PHARAOH WILL LEAD US
FROM THIS DARKNESS.

00:15:13.018 --> 00:15:14.020
YES.

00:15:21.933 --> 00:15:24.437
Isis, voice-over:
PLEASE, MILLENNIUM NECKLACE,
I BESEECH THEE.

00:15:24.437 --> 00:15:28.945
PIERCE THE SHADOWS
AND SHOW ME THE LIGHT
OF THE FUTURE.

00:15:30.548 --> 00:15:31.549
WAIT.

00:15:31.549 --> 00:15:32.551
WHAT IS THIS?

00:15:32.551 --> 00:15:37.025
I SEE SOMETHING...

00:15:40.365 --> 00:15:43.136
JUMBLED PIECES OF EVENTS
YET TO COME.

00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:46.241
I SENSE A GREAT EVIL.

00:15:46.241 --> 00:15:48.111
I MUST TELL MAHAD.

00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:54.581
Mahad: MY PHARAOH,
REST ASSURED,

00:15:54.581 --> 00:15:57.586
THE SACRED TOMB OF
FORMER KING AKNAMKANON

00:15:57.586 --> 00:15:59.322
WILL NEVER BE DISTURBED
AGAIN.

00:15:59.322 --> 00:16:04.931
MY TEAM OF SORCERERS
IS CASTING A SPELL TO SECURE
ITS WALLS AS WE SPEAK.

00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:06.400
EXCELLENT.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.306
YES, BUT I'LL
BELIEVE THAT TOMB IS
SAFE FROM INTRUDERS

00:16:09.306 --> 00:16:12.311
ONCE I HAVE TESTED
IT FOR MYSELF.

00:16:12.311 --> 00:16:13.881
AFTER ALL,
WE'VE SEEN WHAT

00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:16.886
YOUR MAGICIANS
IN TRAINING
ARE CAPABLE OF.

00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:20.158
I WOULD SAY
A BIT MORE TRAINING
COULDN'T HURT.

00:16:20.158 --> 00:16:22.428
ALRIGHT, SETO,
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH.

00:16:22.428 --> 00:16:23.998
I AGREE.

00:16:23.998 --> 00:16:25.934
GOOD LUCK TO YOU, MAHAD,
AND THANK YOU.

00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:30.743
MY KING.

00:16:30.743 --> 00:16:32.846
MAHAD, WAIT!

00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:34.883
PLEASE TAKE ME
WITH YOU, MASTER!

00:16:34.883 --> 00:16:37.688
I'VE BEEN
PRACTICING MY SPELLS
AND I CAN HELP!

00:16:37.688 --> 00:16:41.294
COME BACK HERE,
MANA.

00:16:41.294 --> 00:16:42.396
I'M AFRAID
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

00:16:42.396 --> 00:16:45.267
AND YOU'RE MERELY A STUDENT.

00:16:45.267 --> 00:16:47.104
I'M MAHAD'S
TOP STUDENT.

00:16:47.104 --> 00:16:51.212
I HAVE TWICE THE SKILLS
OF ANY MAGICIAN
HE'S LEADING TO THAT TOMB.

00:16:51.212 --> 00:16:53.682
MY MASTER NEEDS ME!

00:16:53.682 --> 00:16:57.922
IT SEEMS TO ME YOU
UNDERESTIMATE THE SKILLS
OF YOUR TEACHER.

00:16:57.922 --> 00:17:00.327
MAHAD IS
A STRONG WIZARD.

00:17:00.327 --> 00:17:03.165
IN FACT,
YOU WOULD NOT FIND
A MORE POWERFUL MAGICIAN

00:17:03.165 --> 00:17:04.300
IF YOU SEARCHED
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.805
HE'LL BE FINE.

00:17:06.805 --> 00:17:08.874
YES, I KNOW.

00:17:08.874 --> 00:17:10.110
Shimon, voice-over:
WHAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:11.746
IS THAT MAHAD'S
TRUE POWER
WAS SO GREAT,

00:17:11.746 --> 00:17:15.519
HE HAD TO LOCK
A PORTION OF IT AWAY
FOR HIS OWN SAFETY.

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:17.924
IF HE WERE TO RELEASE
HIS FULL ABILITY,

00:17:17.924 --> 00:17:19.860
MAHAD'S STRENGTH
COULD EXCEED THAT
OF ANY GUARDIAN

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.862
IN THE PHARAOH'S COURT.

00:17:27.807 --> 00:17:29.810
Mahad: ISIS.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:30.812
MAHAD.

00:17:30.812 --> 00:17:33.450
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.056
I'M NOT SURE
YOU SHOULD GO THROUGH
WITH THIS.

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:41.096
SO YOU WERE ABLE
TO READ MY FUTURE,
WEREN'T YOU?

00:17:41.096 --> 00:17:43.134
PLEASE--

00:17:43.134 --> 00:17:46.005
ACTUALLY, I WOULD
PREFER NOT TO KNOW.

00:17:46.005 --> 00:17:51.915
ISIS, KEEP AN EYE
ON THE PHARAOH.

00:17:51.915 --> 00:17:53.718
PLEASE WAIT.

00:17:53.718 --> 00:17:57.758
JUST KNOW
THAT IN MY VISION,
YOU DO RETURN.

00:17:57.758 --> 00:17:59.094
THANK YOU.

00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:09.011
Mahad, voice-over:
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
MY DUTY TO PROTECT YOU,

00:18:09.011 --> 00:18:13.920
MY PHARAOH.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.921
HERE, MANA.

00:18:14.921 --> 00:18:17.425
THANK YOU, PRINCE.

00:18:17.425 --> 00:18:19.863
Mahad:
THERE YOU ARE.

00:18:19.863 --> 00:18:21.265
LET ME GUESS.

00:18:21.265 --> 00:18:25.840
MY FATHER ASKED YOU
TO LOOK AFTER ME.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.346
WATCH OUT! BEHIND YOU!

00:18:29.346 --> 00:18:32.918
NO, MAHAD!

00:18:32.918 --> 00:18:34.354
MY PRINCE,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:18:34.354 --> 00:18:35.356
I AM FINE.

00:18:35.356 --> 00:18:37.459
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

00:18:37.459 --> 00:18:38.762
FORGET ABOUT ME.

00:18:38.762 --> 00:18:40.799
DON'T MOVE.

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:42.368
NO, MY PRINCE.

00:18:42.368 --> 00:18:45.807
THE FUTURE PHARAOH
NEEDN'T DO THIS.

00:18:45.807 --> 00:18:47.209
YOU WERE BIT BY A SNAKE,

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.213
AND I'M GETTING
THE POISON OUT.

00:18:49.213 --> 00:18:50.949
IF IT WERE
THE OTHER WAY AROUND,

00:18:50.949 --> 00:18:53.788
YOU WOULD DO
THE SAME THING FOR ME,
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:55.490
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.694
YES, WE ARE.

00:18:57.694 --> 00:18:59.431
AND SOMEDAY,
WHEN I BECOME PHARAOH,

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:02.770
I KNOW YOU'LL BE
STANDING RIGHT THERE
BY MY SIDE, MAHAD.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:06.342
I WOULD NOT HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

00:19:06.342 --> 00:19:09.281
Mahad, voice-over:
EVEN AS A CHILD
YOU PROTECTED ME

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:12.186
MORE THAN I COULD
EVER PROTECT YOU.

00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:14.957
SO KNOW THIS,
WHEREVER DESTINY
MAY LEAD ME,

00:19:14.957 --> 00:19:19.966
I PROMISE TO RETURN
THAT FAVOR.

00:19:19.966 --> 00:19:22.571
THE VALLEY OF THE KINGS
ISN'T THIS WAY.

00:19:22.571 --> 00:19:24.140
QUIET BACK THERE.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.845
OUR ORDERS ARE
TO FOLLOW MASTER MAHAD.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.805
Mahad, voice-over:
I SWORE I WOULD
NEVER DO THIS,

00:19:42.805 --> 00:19:44.809
BUT I DO NOT SEE
ANY OTHER WAY.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.045
IN ORDER
TO DEFEAT BAKURA,

00:19:47.045 --> 00:19:52.488
I MUST RELEASE
THE POWER I SEALED AWAY
SO LONG AGO.

00:19:52.488 --> 00:19:58.498
SACRED MILLENNIUM RING,
I CALL UPON THEE.

00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:01.136
UNLOCK THE GREAT FORCE
I BURIED HERE.

00:20:06.812 --> 00:20:10.419
HE'S BACKED HIMSELF
INTO A CORNER.

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:12.422
FOLLOW ME.

00:20:12.422 --> 00:20:16.829
Man: NOW!

00:20:16.829 --> 00:20:21.003
BEST OF LUCK,
MASTER MAHAD.

00:20:21.003 --> 00:20:25.144
I GUESS IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME NOW.

00:20:25.144 --> 00:20:27.481
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:36.664
WELL, WHAT DO
WE HAVE HERE?

00:20:38.767 --> 00:20:41.439
LET THE FESTIVITIES
COMMENCE.

00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:43.569
I HAVE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

00:20:43.569 --> 00:20:44.903
LET'S DUEL.
