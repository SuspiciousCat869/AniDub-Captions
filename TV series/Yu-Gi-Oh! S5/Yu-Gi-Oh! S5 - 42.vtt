UNDERSTAND THE BRILLIANCE
OF THIS SHADOW GAME

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:08.709
I'VE CREATED?

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.644
YOU AND I ARE THE "GAME
MASTERS."

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:13.514
I DEFEATED YOU ONCE
AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN!

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:15.682
BUT YOU WON'T BE
SO LUCKY THIS TIME.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.684

KNOW YOUR OWN NAME.

A SINGLE WORD WITH THE
POWER TO BOTH RESURRECT

ZORC AND LOCK HIM AWAY.

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:25.759
HOWEVER I DISCOVERED A WAY
TO BRING BACK THE DARK ONE

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.427
WITHOUT THAT WORD!

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.963

YOU SHALL BE KING!

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.144
IF YOU ACCEPT THE DARK
POWER OF THE SHADOWS YOU'LL

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.314
BE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE
THAT YOUR FATHER MADE.

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:50.717

OH!

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.114
IT'S YUGI.

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:44.517
SETO!

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:46.553
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:48.521
Seto: WE'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU, PHARAOH.

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:52.058
AFTER ALL, ZORC'S
ARRIVAL IS UPON US.

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:54.527
AND HE DESERVES TO BE
GREETED BY A KING WORTHY

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:56.062
OF HIS GREATNESS.

00:09:56.062 --> 00:10:01.601
SETO, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?!

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.671
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:06.973
Yami-Yugi:
HER CREATURE WAS
SEALED IN STONE!

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:08.408
I KNOW WHO DID THIS!

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:09.943
TELL ME WHERE
AKNADIN IS!

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.644
RIGHT HERE!

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:17.617
HA HA HA!

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.252
Aknadin: SURPRISE!

00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:22.255
I'VE INFILTRATED
SETO'S MIND.

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:25.091
[CHUCKLING]

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:27.260
MY SON WAS HAVING
DIFFICULTY ACCEPTING HIS

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.095
DESTINY, YOU SEE.

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:31.898
SO I DECIDED TO HELP
HIM MAKE UP HIS MIND.

00:10:31.898 --> 00:10:35.535
BY TAKING IT OVER!!

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:38.905
Aknadin: THE TIME HAS
FINALLY ARRIVED SETO!

00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:41.374
THE POWER OF THE
WHITE DRAGON IS YOURS!

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:44.110
NOW DESTROY THE PHARAOH
AND TAKE HIS PLACE!

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.578
LET'S DUEL!

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:51.751
Yami-Yugi:
SETO, DON'T DO THIS!

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.087
YOUR MIND HAS BEEN
CLOUDED BY DARKNESS!

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:55.221
Seto: WRONG!

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:57.423
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
EVERYTHING IS CLEAR!

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:59.659
COME FORTH, WHITE DRAGON!

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:13.439
[ROARING]

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:16.109
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO FIGHT!

00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:22.215
I SUMMON MAHAD,
THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:25.618
Seto: PREPARE TO FEEL
THE POWER OF TWO GENERATIONS

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:27.086
IN ONE ATTACK!

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:28.221
Mahad: HE'S RIGHT
PHARAOH.

00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:30.790
THEIR MAGIC IS
TWICE AS STRONG NOW.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.994
Seto: NOW MY DRAGON...ATTACK
WITH WHITE LIGHTNING!

00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:40.466
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:41.634
AAH!

00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:44.370
Mahad: GOOD LUCK, MY KING.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.706
UH!

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.441
NO...MAHAD.

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:51.110
YOUR REIGN ENDS
NOW, PHARAOH.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.446
YOU'VE DISGRACED THE
THRONE OF EGYPT JUST LIKE

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:55.315
YOUR FATHER!

00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:57.517
BUT NOT FOR LONG!

00:11:57.517 --> 00:11:59.919
BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO
TAKE WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:02.088
MINE AGES AGO!

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:04.123
SETO, LISTEN TO ME.

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.858
YOUR MIND IS BEING
CONTROLLED AND IF

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:08.561
YOU DON'T BREAK FREE
EGYPT IS DOOMED!

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.798
YOU MADE A VOW
TO PROTECT OUR LAND,
REMEMBER!?

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:14.133
AND I AM PROTECTING
OUR LAND!

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:15.435
FROM YOU!

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:16.970
NOW BLUE EYES, ATTACK!

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.906
[ROARING]

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:25.945
NO...PLEASE...DON'T.

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:28.715
Seto: WHAT!?
HOW DARE YOU DISOBEY ME!

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:30.183
ATTACK!!

00:12:30.183 --> 00:12:35.989
Aknadin: DO YOU HEAR ME?
I SAID ATTACK!

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:40.793
THANK YOU KISARA.

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:43.896
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS!?

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:48.201
OH! THE WHITE DRAGON!

00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:50.336
[BELLOWING]

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:55.108
BUT HOW!?

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.877
Aknadin: SETOOO!

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:05.118
YOU'RE FREE NOW.

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:10.223
AND I PROMISE AKNADIN
WILL NEVER HARM YOU AGAIN.

00:13:10.223 --> 00:13:12.759
MY POWER RESTS
WITH YOU NOW.

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:20.300
UH.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:26.773
KISARA!

00:13:26.773 --> 00:13:29.976
YOUR SPIRIT NOW LIVES
WITHIN THE WHITE DRAGON.

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:38.685
NICE OUTFIT.

00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:39.752
KAIBA!

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:42.121
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THIS WORLD?

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:43.790
DON'T YOU THINK I'VE
BEEN ASKING MYSELF

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.325
THE SAME QUESTION?

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.694
CAUSE I CERTAINLY
DIDN'T CHOOSE TO
COME HERE.

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.796
BELIEVE ME I CAN
THINK OF BETTER
VACATION SPOTS

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:51.664
THAN THIS DUMP.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.533
NOW WHY DON'T YOU
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY
EVERYONE'S

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:55.535
RUNNING AROUND IN
THESE RIDICULOUS
COSTUMES

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:57.070
AND SPEAKING LIKE
THEY'RE IN SOME BAD

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.304
SHAKESPEAREAN PLAY?

00:13:58.304 --> 00:13:59.672
AND HIM.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.607
AM I SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THAT'S
SOME ANCIENT

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.743
VERSION OF ME?

00:14:03.743 --> 00:14:06.379
HIS NAME IS SETO AND FIVE
THOUSAND YEARS AGO HE

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:09.449
FOUGHT BRAVELY BY MY
SIDE TO SAVE EGYPT.

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:11.751
I ALSO LEARNED THAT HIS
FATHER AND MY FATHER

00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:13.686
WERE BROTHERS.

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:15.455
ARE YOU SAYING
WE'RE COUSINS?

00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:18.024
ALL I KNOW IS THAT WE'VE
GONE BACK IN TIME.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.259
AND THE SAME EVIL FORCE
THAT ONCE TRIED TO DESTROY

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:22.261
MANKIND HAS COME BACK!

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:24.397
NOW I'D SUGGEST
YOU GO HOME!

00:14:24.397 --> 00:14:27.667
IT ISN'T SAFE FOR YOU OR
ANYONE ELSE TO BE HERE!

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:29.669
YOU MAY BUY INTO
THE DELUSION THAT
YOU'RE SOME

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:32.004
HOTSHOT PHARAOH
BUT I DON'T!

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:33.840
AND PHARAOH
OR NO PHARAOH,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.975
NO ONE TELLS
SETO KAIBA
WHAT TO DO.

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.610
IS THAT CLEAR!?

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.879
AS YOU WISH.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.548
Yami-Bakura:
WELL, YOU'VE MADE
QUITE THE COMEBACK!

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.884
BUT THERE'S NOTHING YOU OR
THE KAIBA TWINS CAN DO TO

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.252
STOP ME NOW!

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.321
LOOKS LIKE IT'S TOO
LITTLE TOO LATE.

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:52.058
IN A MATTER OF MOMENTS
THE DARK ONE WILL RETURN.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.326
[THINKING]
BAKURA'S RIGHT.

00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:55.862
AS SOON AS THE SANDS OF
HIS HOURGLASS RUN OUT,

00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:58.131
ZORC WILL RISE AND THE
WORLD WILL BE SHROUDED

00:14:58.131 --> 00:14:59.565
IN DARKNESS.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.201
OUR ONLY HOPE IS TO
UNLOCK MY HIDDEN POWERS

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:06.906
BY UNCOVERING THE
GREATEST KEPT SECRET
OF MY PAST!

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.842
MY TRUE NAME.

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:12.879
THINKING UP A LAST-MINUTE
PLAN TO WIN THIS GAME?

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.847
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME!

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:16.749
I'M AFRAID I DISAGREE.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:20.086
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF
BAKURA: THIS IS A GAME.

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:23.222
AND EVERY CHALLENGE IN
A GAME HAS A SOLUTION.

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:25.458
NOW NEED I
REMIND YOU...?

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:27.827
YOU'RE PLAYING WITH
THE KING OF GAMES!

00:15:27.827 --> 00:15:30.062
Yami-Yugi: SO
LET'S REVIEW THE CLUES:

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:33.332
FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO I
LOCKED ZORC'S SPIRIT AWAY,

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:37.236
ALONG WITH MY OWN,
USING MY NAME AS THE KEY.

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:41.040
THEN, AS A SAFETY MEASURE
I ERASED MY OWN MIND!

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.676
YES, AND UNLESS YOUR
MEMORY MIRACULOUSLY RETURNS

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:47.513
IN THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS
YOU LOSE THE SHADOW GAME!

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.782
THERE IS OF COURSE, ANOTHER
WAY FOR YOU UNLOCK THIS

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.684
MYSTERY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:53.886
BUT I'VE ALREADY TAKEN
MEASURES TO MAKE SURE IT

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.788
NEVER HAPPENS.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.056
IT INVOLVES
THOSE MEDDLESOME

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.691
FRIENDS OF YOURS.

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.259
WHAT ABOUT MY FRIENDS?

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:03.262
LET'S JUST SAY THEY'VE
STUMBLED UPON YOUR OLD TOMB

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:06.232
WITHIN WHICH IS INSCRIBED
YOUR ORIGINAL NAME.

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:08.034
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:10.536
IF I GIVE YOU A GLIMMER OF
HOPE YOU'LL BE THAT MUCH

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:13.339
MORE DEVASTATED WHEN IT
COMES CRUMBLING DOWN!

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.641
YOU SEE THE MOMENT THEY
DISCOVER YOUR TRUE NAME,

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:19.212
THEIR EXCURSION WILL BE CUT
SHORT BY MY NEWEST PAWN.

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:21.180
AND WHO IS THIS
PAWN OF YOURS!?

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.050
OH, I BELIEVE YOU
KNOW HIM QUITE WELL.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.385
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE WAS
A FAITHFUL FRIEND OF YOURS

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:30.122
UNTIL HE LOST HIS MIND!

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:32.258
JUST TELL US
ALREADY WILL YA!

00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:34.694
WHAT WAS IT YOU WISHED
FOR THE DAY YOU
FIRST SOLVED

00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:36.662
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE?!

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.998
FOR TRUE FRIENDS.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.101
AND MY WISH WAS GRANTED.

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.570
Joey: AW MAN, YOU WIN
AGAIN, YUGE!

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.106
Tristan: LEAVE THIS
PUNK TO ME, YUGI!

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:48.107
HEY!

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:50.510
LONG TIME NO SEE!

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.978
YOU WERE MY WISH.

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:53.112
YOU MEAN THAT?

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:54.213
IT WAS US?

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:55.948
YOU NEVER TOLD US THAT.

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:59.285
HOW PRECIOUS.

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:01.087
AAH!

00:17:01.087 --> 00:17:02.088
TRISTAN!

00:17:02.088 --> 00:17:04.657
WHAT'S THE DEAL!?

00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:06.959
AAH!
AAH!

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.094
ARE YOU NUTS!?

00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:09.629
WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU?

00:17:09.629 --> 00:17:12.098
SOMETHING VERY POWERFUL.

00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:13.099
HUH?
HEH?

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:21.107
AAH!
AAH!

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:29.015
NO WAY!

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:31.083
Tristan: HA HA HA!

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:36.989
IT'S SIMPLE.

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.724
GO THROUGH THAT DOOR AND
YOU'LL FIND WHAT YOU'RE

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:39.959
LOOKING FOR.

00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:41.327
Joey: BUT TA GET
IN THERE

00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:42.728
YUGI'S GOTTA
GIVE UP HIS
WISH!

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.597
SO WHEN HE LEAVES
THIS BALANCE BEAM

00:17:44.597 --> 00:17:48.100
WE LEAVE HIS
LIFE FOR GOOD.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.570
DO WHAT YOU
GOTTA DO YUGE!

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.271
I CAN'T DO THAT!

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:55.841
IF I LEAVE YOU'LL FALL
INTO THE PIT OF SHADOWS.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:57.977
Tristan: YOU ARE

00:17:57.977 --> 00:18:00.546
YOU FINALLY HAVE THE CHANCE
TO FIND THE PHARAOH'S NAME

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:02.582

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:30.309

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.945
AND A BIGGER BIRD.

00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:08.147
SO WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.883
Tea: JUST MEMORIZE
THE SYMBOLS!

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.752

TRISTAN!

00:19:23.963 --> 00:19:26.699
I THOUGHT YOU THREE
WERE DOWN FOR THE COUNT.

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:28.734
BUT APPARENTLY YOU
DON'T KNOW WHEN TO QUIT.

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:29.802
DAT'S IT!

00:19:29.802 --> 00:19:32.138
CONSIDER THIS
FRIENDSHIP OVER TRISTAN!

00:19:32.138 --> 00:19:33.873
I DON'T THINK THAT'S HIM.

00:19:33.873 --> 00:19:37.276
HOW RIGHT YOU
ARE MY FRIEND.

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.277

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:44.684
NOW THE REAL FUN CAN START.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.919
Bakura: UNFORTUNATELY
WE'RE UNABLE TO SEE

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:49.388
WHAT GOES ON IN THAT
TOMB OF YOURS.

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.857
BUT IF I HAD TO GUESS I'D
SAY YOUR FRIENDS WERE SENT

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.360
PLUMMETING INTO THE
SHADOWS AT THE HANDS OF MY

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.495
OTHER HALF.

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:59.165
THEY MAY EVEN HAVE
LOCATED YOUR NAME FIRST.

00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:01.600
BUT SADLY THAT INFORMATION
WILL NEVER MAKE ITS WAY TO

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.502
YOU, PHARAOH.

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:04.637
OH YES.

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:07.440
AND DID I MENTION
THAT TIME IS UP?

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.674
NO!

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:11.043
HA HA HA!

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:24.557
Joey: NOW WHAT!?

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.126
THE DARK ONE IS ABOUT TO
MAKE HIS GRAND ENTRANCE.

00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:29.061
WE HAVE TO STOP HIM!

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:30.362
Bakura: IMPOSSIBLE!

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:33.365
WE BOTH KNOW THERE'S
ONLY ONE WAY TO DO THAT.

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:35.000
AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE
LEAVING HERE

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.969
WITH THE PHARAOH'S NAME.

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:39.305
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT!

00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:40.806
HE'S GOT A DUEL DISK!

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:44.810
YES. NOW PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR YOUR FINAL DUEL!

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.713
HA HA HA!
