00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:20.110
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
EVERYTHING WE DO AFFECTS
THE EVENTS OF THE PAST?

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.346
ARE YOU?

00:09:21.346 --> 00:09:23.483
JUST WHEN I THINK YOU
CAN'T SINK ANY LOWER,

00:09:23.483 --> 00:09:25.521
YOU PROVE ME WRONG,
BAKURA.

00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:27.158
MANIPULATING
THE LIVES OF OTHERS

00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:30.932
JUST SO YOU CAN PLAY OUT
SOME TWISTED GAME?

00:09:30.932 --> 00:09:32.268
NOT SOME GAME.

00:09:32.268 --> 00:09:34.038
THE GAME.

00:09:34.038 --> 00:09:37.178
AND AS SOON
AS I RESURRECT ZORC FROM
THE MILLENNIUM STONE,

00:09:37.178 --> 00:09:39.782
THE FINAL STAGE
OF THIS GAME WILL BEGIN.

00:09:39.782 --> 00:09:42.956
[LAUGHING]

00:09:42.956 --> 00:09:44.025
WAIT!

00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:46.029
SO IF I DON'T
DEFEAT ZORC,

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:47.865
THAT MEANS
I LOSE THE GAME?

00:09:47.865 --> 00:09:49.802
YOU'LL LOSE
MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

00:09:49.802 --> 00:09:51.372
LIKE WHAT?

00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:54.378
LIKE THOSE MEDDLING TWITS
YOU CALL FRIENDS.

00:09:54.378 --> 00:09:56.716
THEY ENTERED A WORLD
WHERE THEY DIDN'T BELONG.

00:09:56.716 --> 00:09:59.054
SO WHEN THE PLAYING FIELD
DISAPPEARS,

00:09:59.054 --> 00:10:02.695
THEY'LL BE TRAPPED
IN THE SHADOWS.

00:10:02.695 --> 00:10:04.799
YOU'LL NEVER
SEE THEM AGAIN!

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:06.402
[LAUGHING]

00:10:10.344 --> 00:10:12.046
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE
YOUR FRIENDS,

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:13.750
YOU'LL HAVE TO WIN
THE GAME.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.658
HOWEVER, AT THE MOMENT
ALL OF YOUR PAWNS
ARE FROZEN IN TIME

00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:19.662
THANKS TO THIS HANDY DEVICE.

00:10:19.662 --> 00:10:21.299
WHAT'S THAT?

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:24.304
WHY, IT'S MY
HOURGLASS TOKEN,
OF COURSE.

00:10:24.304 --> 00:10:26.342
YOUR HOURGLASS TOKEN?

00:10:26.342 --> 00:10:27.545
EXACTLY,

00:10:27.545 --> 00:10:30.484
AND AS THE GAME MASTER,
I POSSESS 3 OF THEM.

00:10:30.484 --> 00:10:35.393
THIS ONE FREEZES TIME
FOR EVERY CHARACTER
IN THE GAME EXCEPT FOR MINE.

00:10:35.393 --> 00:10:37.665
SO YOU CAN
MANIPULATE TIME?

00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:38.733
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:10:38.733 --> 00:10:40.469
AND IT'S NOT
THE FIRST TIME.

00:10:40.469 --> 00:10:42.073
OBSERVE.

00:10:42.073 --> 00:10:44.912
I USED THIS ONE
EARLIER IN THE GAME.

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:46.683
PERHAPS YOU RECALL
A LITTLE INCIDENT

00:10:46.683 --> 00:10:49.120
DURING WHICH TIME
WENT IN REVERSE?

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.556
NOW YOU KNOW HOW.

00:11:07.724 --> 00:11:09.361
SO THAT WAS YOU!

00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:11.164
GUILTY AS CHARGED,

00:11:11.164 --> 00:11:15.072
AND HE WHO CONTROLS
THE HANDS OF TIME
CONTROLS FATE.

00:11:15.072 --> 00:11:18.512
THANKS TO THESE HOURGLASSES,
I CAN REWRITE HISTORY--

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:23.288
AND NOT ONLY ONCE,
BUT 3 TIMES OVER
THE COURSE OF THE GAME.

00:11:23.288 --> 00:11:24.959
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS RIGHT?

00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:28.399
YOUR LIFE IS
UNDER MY CONTROL!

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:33.976
[LAUGHING]

SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:40.122
I CAN'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

00:11:40.122 --> 00:11:42.293
Yugi, voice-over:
BAKURA MUST BE BEHIND THIS.

00:11:42.293 --> 00:11:46.134
I JUST HOPE
THE PHARAOH'S ALL RIGHT.

I COULD THINK OF WORSE
SITUATIONS TO BE STUCK IN.

Yami-Bakura, voice-over:
YOU'RE MY PAWN NOW,

00:11:53.081 --> 00:11:55.252
SO YOU'RE FREE
TO MOVE ABOUT.

00:11:55.252 --> 00:12:00.596
WHAT PUZZLES ME IS WHY
THAT BUFFOON IS UNAFFECTED.

00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:02.165
THIS IS BAD.

00:12:02.165 --> 00:12:05.439
MY BELLY IS SO BIG
I CAN'T SEE MY SLIPPERS.

00:12:05.439 --> 00:12:07.175
MASTER ZORC, HEAR ME!

00:12:07.175 --> 00:12:11.250
I NOW OFFER YOU
THE 7 TREASURES!

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.956
Isis, voice-over:
I SENSE THE PULSE
OF PURE EVIL

BEATING BELOW US.

00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:18.832
THE DARK ONE
HAS AWAKENED.

00:12:18.832 --> 00:12:22.507
Zorc: SO THE MORTAL
RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING

00:12:22.507 --> 00:12:25.345
THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS
HAS RETURNED.

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:28.017
NOW DENOUNCE
YOUR ALLEGIANCE TO EGYPT

00:12:28.017 --> 00:12:30.522
AND PLEDGE
YOUR LOYALTY TO ME.

00:12:30.522 --> 00:12:34.429
DO THIS AND EVERYTHING
YOU DESIRE SHALL BE YOURS.

00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:38.204
MY ONLY WISH
IS FOR A NEW PHARAOH
TO BE NAMED.

00:12:38.204 --> 00:12:41.143
HE SHALL BE
MY OWN BELOVED SON,

00:12:41.143 --> 00:12:43.614
SETO!

00:12:43.614 --> 00:12:44.616
Seto, voice-over: NO.

00:12:44.616 --> 00:12:47.088
THIS CANNOT BE TRUE.

00:12:47.088 --> 00:12:50.896
MASTER AKNADIN IS MY FATHER?

00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:52.432
Zorc: VERY WELL.

00:12:52.432 --> 00:12:55.271
YOUR TRANSFORMATION
FROM SACRED GUARDIAN

00:12:55.271 --> 00:12:58.444
TO LORD OF DARKNESS
IS NOW COMPLETE.

NO! AKNADIN!

MY AKNADIN GAME PIECE
HAS JUST DOUBLED
IN OVERALL STRENGTH.

00:13:15.745 --> 00:13:20.421
I GIVE YOU
THE GREAT SHADOW MAGUS!

00:13:20.421 --> 00:13:22.492
WHAT'VE YOU DONE
TO AKNADIN?

00:13:22.492 --> 00:13:24.229
I HAVEN'T DONE A THING.

00:13:24.229 --> 00:13:26.400
ALL OF THESE EVENTS
ARE REOCCURRING

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.373
EXACTLY AS THEY DID
5,000 YEARS AGO--

00:13:29.373 --> 00:13:32.412
WITH SOME SMALL MODIFICATIONS,
OF COURSE.

00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:34.583
THANKS TO THIS
SHADOW GAME OF MINE,

00:13:34.583 --> 00:13:37.822
I'M ABLE TO INFLUENCE
CERTAIN EVENTS.

00:13:37.822 --> 00:13:42.532
YOU SEE, PHARAOH,
IN THE OLD DAYS YOU MANAGED
TO LOCK AWAY YOUR OWN SPIRIT

00:13:42.532 --> 00:13:45.237
IN ORDER TO SEAL ZORC AWAY.

00:13:45.237 --> 00:13:47.542
BUT YOU WON'T BE
SO LUCKY THIS TIME.

00:13:47.542 --> 00:13:50.013
THERE ARE STILL
SOME HOLES IN YOUR MEMORY.

00:13:50.013 --> 00:13:51.884
I MEAN,
LET'S FACE IT, PHARAOH,

00:13:51.884 --> 00:13:53.921
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
YOUR OWN NAME,

00:13:53.921 --> 00:14:00.133
A SINGLE WORD WITH
THE POWER TO BOTH RESURRECT
ZORC AND LOCK HIM AWAY.

00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:01.770
HOWEVER, I DISCOVERED A WAY

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.375
TO BRING BACK THE DARK ONE
WITHOUT THAT WORD

00:14:04.375 --> 00:14:06.446
BY SIMPLY USING THIS--

00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:09.051
MY THIRD AND FINAL
HOURGLASS.

00:14:09.051 --> 00:14:10.120
OH, NO!

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.458
JUST WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING, BAKURA?

00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:14.295
LET ME SPELL THIS OUT
FOR YOU.

00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:16.366
WHEN THE LAST GRAIN
OF SAND FALLS,

00:14:16.366 --> 00:14:19.572
THE RULER OF
THE DARKEST SHADOWS
SHALL RISE!

Yami-Bakura, voice-over:
THE PHARAOH'S NAME SHOULD BE
LOCATED IN THIS ROOM.

00:14:29.358 --> 00:14:34.301
NOW FIND IT
BEFORE THE OTHERS DO
AND DESTROY IT.

00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:37.307
EVERY PHARAOH IN HISTORY
MUST BE LISTED HERE.

00:14:37.307 --> 00:14:38.610
SO THE NAME
I'M LOOKING FOR'S

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:39.745
GOTTA BE WRITTEN
SOMEWHERE

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:42.051
ON THE LAST TABLET.

00:14:42.051 --> 00:14:43.153
WHAT?

00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:46.092
THIS DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE AT ALL!

00:14:46.092 --> 00:14:49.933
THIS STONE TABLET
IS COMPLETELY BLANK!

00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:52.271
Zorc: NOW,
GREAT SHADOW MAGUS,

00:14:52.271 --> 00:14:54.943
BANISH THE PHARAOH
TO THE DARKNESS

00:14:54.943 --> 00:14:57.381
SO THAT YOUR SON
MAY TAKE THE THRONE.

I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED
FOR YOU, SETO,

EVER SINCE YOU WERE
A YOUNG BOY.

00:15:05.764 --> 00:15:07.501
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION,

00:15:07.501 --> 00:15:11.342
NO ONE MUST EVER KNOW
I HAVE A FAMILY.

Seto, voice-over:
HOW COULD HE LEAVE ME

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:15.684
AND THEN LIE TO ME
ALL THESE YEARS?

00:15:15.684 --> 00:15:18.323
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU SHOULD KNOW, MY SON.

00:15:18.323 --> 00:15:21.929
THE FORMER KING, AKNAMKANON,
WAS MY BROTHER.

00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:25.035
THAT MEANS
SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN TO
THE CURRENT PHARAOH,

00:15:25.035 --> 00:15:28.276
YOU ARE NEXT IN LINE
TO INHERIT THE THRONE.

00:15:28.276 --> 00:15:31.047
Shimon, voice-over:
WHY, AFTER ALL THESE
YEARS OF LOYALTY,

00:15:31.047 --> 00:15:34.220
WOULD HE TURN ON
HIS OWN FAMILY?

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.826
BAKURA MUST HAVE PREYED
UPON THE HIDDEN JEALOUSY

00:15:36.826 --> 00:15:39.865
AKNADIN ALWAYS FELT
TOWARDS HIS BROTHER

00:15:39.865 --> 00:15:42.370
AND THE INCREDIBLE GUILT
HE MUST HAVE HARBORED

NO LONGER SHALL
WE LIVE IN THE SHADOW
OF MY BROTHER!

THE TIME HAS COME
TO RISE UP

00:15:54.494 --> 00:15:58.101
AND CLAIM OUR RIGHTFUL PLACE
ON THE THRONE OF EGYPT!

00:15:58.101 --> 00:16:00.339
HEED MY WORDS!

00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:03.680

Yugi: DID YOU FORGET?

00:16:36.242 --> 00:16:38.713
THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE
PLAYING THIS GAME,

00:16:38.713 --> 00:16:41.152
AND I HAVE A TOKEN
AS WELL.

00:16:41.152 --> 00:16:44.358
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

00:16:44.358 --> 00:16:47.965
Aknadin: WHO DARES STAND
IN THE WAY OF MY DESTINY?

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:50.136
IDENTIFY YOURSELF!

00:16:51.706 --> 00:16:53.610
PROTECTOR
OF THE PHARAOHS.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.718
FOR CENTURIES I HAVE
DEFENDED THE HONOR
OF EGYPT'S KINGS,

00:16:57.718 --> 00:16:59.555
SO FEAR NOT,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

00:16:59.555 --> 00:17:02.293
I SHALL SHIELD YOU
FROM THE DARKNESS

00:17:02.293 --> 00:17:04.398
JUST AS I SHIELDED
YOUR FATHER

00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:08.640
AND HIS FATHER BEFORE.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.042
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
HELLO?

00:17:10.042 --> 00:17:12.013
WHO'S THERE?

TO WARN YOU OF AN IMPENDING
DANGER, PHARAOH.

00:17:15.654 --> 00:17:20.564
ZORC THE DARK ONE
WILL SOON AWAKEN.

00:17:20.564 --> 00:17:22.033
I REMEMBER HIM.

00:17:22.033 --> 00:17:24.539
HE CAME TO ME
IN A VISION
WHEN I WAS STRANDED,

00:17:24.539 --> 00:17:27.343
BUT I THOUGHT
I WAS JUST
HALLUCINATING.

00:17:27.343 --> 00:17:30.817
Aknadin: IF YOU TRULY ARE
THE PROTECTOR
OF THE PHARAOH,

00:17:30.817 --> 00:17:33.990
THEN YOU SHOULD BE
PROTECTING MY SON SETO,

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.161
FOR HE IS
THE TRUE KING OF EGYPT,

00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:39.334
NOT THAT IMPOSTER
COWERING BEHIND YOU.

00:17:39.334 --> 00:17:44.210
Hasan: DARKNESS BE GONE.

00:18:04.451 --> 00:18:05.519
Aknadin: WHAT?

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:07.857
BUT I RENDERED
THOSE FOOLS IMMOBILE!

00:18:07.857 --> 00:18:10.596
THEY WERE PRISONERS
IN THEIR OWN BODIES.

00:18:10.596 --> 00:18:12.200
Hasan: NOT ANYMORE.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.775
YOUR SHADOW SPELL
HAS BEEN BROKEN.

00:18:16.775 --> 00:18:21.618
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE SHADOWS
CLAIM YOUR SPIRIT, PHARAOH.

00:18:21.618 --> 00:18:25.192
Yami-Bakura:
AND EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER
CARED ABOUT CRUMBLES.

00:18:25.192 --> 00:18:28.632
YOUR POOR FRIENDS ARE ALL
RUNNING OUT OF STEAM.

00:18:28.632 --> 00:18:29.634
WHAT?

00:18:29.634 --> 00:18:31.605
BUT HOW?

00:18:31.605 --> 00:18:36.047
ATTACHED TO EVERYONE'S
DUEL DISKS IS A SENSOR THAT
MEASURES THEIR LIFE ENERGY.

00:18:36.047 --> 00:18:39.721
MY GREAT SHADOW MAGUS
IS AT FULL POWER,

00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:43.094
BUT THE SAME
CANNOT BE SAID
FOR YOUR FRIENDS.

00:18:43.094 --> 00:18:46.401
[CHUCKLING]

00:18:46.401 --> 00:18:50.376
I'M AFRAID ONCE
AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE-FORCE
SENSOR GOES DARK

00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:54.451
THEIR SPIRIT IS BANISHED
TO THE SHADOW REALM
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:56.488
THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO.

00:18:56.488 --> 00:19:01.397
WHEN YOU LOSE IN THE PAST,
YOU LOSE HERE AS WELL.

00:19:01.397 --> 00:19:03.067
NOW THEN,
ARE YOU BEGINNING

00:19:03.067 --> 00:19:04.738
TO UNDERSTAND
THE BRILLIANCE

00:19:04.738 --> 00:19:07.042
OF THIS SHADOW GAME
I'VE CREATED?

00:19:07.042 --> 00:19:09.413
YOU AND I ARE
THE GAME MASTERS,

00:19:09.413 --> 00:19:11.083
MANIPULATING
THE FATE OF PEOPLE

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:14.089
WHO LIVED ON THIS EARTH
5,000 YEARS AGO.

00:19:14.089 --> 00:19:16.227
AT TIMES, WE'RE MERELY
OBSERVING EVENTS

00:19:16.227 --> 00:19:18.531
EXACTLY AS THEY WERE
PLAYED OUT IN THE PAST.

00:19:18.531 --> 00:19:20.602
OTHER TIMES WE INTERVENE,

00:19:20.602 --> 00:19:22.439
MANIPULATING
CERTAIN ACTIONS

00:19:22.439 --> 00:19:25.345
IN ORDER TO CHANGE
THE OUTCOME IN OUR FAVOR.

00:19:25.345 --> 00:19:28.852
SO, YOU MIGHT SAY
WE'RE LIKE TWO SIDES
OF THE SAME COIN,

00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:32.526
AND WE'RE PLAYING OUT
THE ULTIMATE BATTLE BETWEEN
LIGHT AND SHADOWS.

00:19:32.526 --> 00:19:35.365
BAKURA, THIS MUST END!

00:19:35.365 --> 00:19:36.600
OF COURSE.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.939
EVERY GAME HAS AN END,
PHARAOH,

00:19:38.939 --> 00:19:42.012
IT'S JUST A QUESTION
OF WHO THE VICTOR WILL BE

00:19:42.012 --> 00:19:45.018
AND WHO WILL
SPEND ETERNITY ROAMING
THE SHADOW REALM.

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:48.024
NOW DO YOU SEE WHY
I CALLED THIS
THE ULTIMATE GAME?

00:19:48.024 --> 00:19:51.297
HERE WE BOTH SIT
HIGH ABOVE THE REST
OF THE WORLD

00:19:51.297 --> 00:19:53.768
DECIDING THE FUTURE
OF MANKIND.

00:19:53.768 --> 00:19:56.907
THE FATE OF THE WORLD
RESTS IN OUR HANDS!

00:19:56.907 --> 00:20:00.415
[LAUGHING]

00:20:00.415 --> 00:20:01.584
THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:20:01.584 --> 00:20:03.321
YOU MAY FIGHT FOR GREED,

00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:06.460
BUT I FIGHT
FOR SOMETHING ELSE
ENTIRELY,

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.468
THE SAFETY OF MY FRIENDS
AND THAT OF THE WORLD.

00:20:10.468 --> 00:20:13.307
I DEFEATED YOU ONCE
AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN.

00:20:13.307 --> 00:20:15.311
THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST,
PHARAOH.

00:20:15.311 --> 00:20:18.651
BUT HERE IN THIS SHADOW GAME
I HAVE ALL SORTS OF ADVANTAGES

00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:20.822
I DIDN'T HAVE
IN OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER,

00:20:20.822 --> 00:20:23.294
AND SINCE YOUR MEMORY
IS SKETCHY AT BEST,

00:20:23.294 --> 00:20:25.598
YOU'LL NEVER REMEMBER
HOW YOU WON.

00:20:25.598 --> 00:20:29.238
[LAUGHING]

00:20:29.238 --> 00:20:30.942
I STILL HAVE TIME!

00:20:30.942 --> 00:20:32.846
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

00:20:32.846 --> 00:20:35.033
TIME IS ONE LUXURY
YOU DON'T HAVE,

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:37.869
FOR THE COUNTDOWN
TO DESTRUCTION HAS BEGUN!

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:43.708
