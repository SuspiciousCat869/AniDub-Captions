BIG DEAL.
I'LL SHOW YA HOW
IT'S REALLY DONE.

00:08:28.498 --> 00:08:30.601
OH, NO, YA DON'T.
THIS GUY'S MINE!

00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:32.171
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN
WHAT YOU CAN DO.

00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:33.840
NOW LEAVE IT
TO A REAL MAN!

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.309
OH...SO I DO
ALL THE WORK,

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.512
THEN YOU STEP IN
AND STEAL THE GLORY?

00:08:37.512 --> 00:08:40.417
YOU CALL BLOCKING
YOUR OWN ATTACK
"DOING ALL THE WORK"?!

00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:42.153
YOU'RE ON
THE SAME TEAM!

00:08:42.153 --> 00:08:44.123
NOW START ACTING LIKE IT!

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:45.125
RIGHT!
RIGHT!

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:46.294
READY TO DO THIS?

00:08:46.294 --> 00:08:47.628
YUP, ON 3.

00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:50.867
3!
3!

00:08:50.867 --> 00:08:52.136
HELP! I'M BLIND!

00:08:52.136 --> 00:08:53.171
ME, TOO!

00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:55.074
THE SUN'S
WAY TOO STRONG!

00:08:55.074 --> 00:08:57.711
IT MUST BE
DIRECTLY OVERHEAD!

00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:07.260
BLOCK THAT BLAST!

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.063
I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED THIS!

00:09:09.063 --> 00:09:12.001
GUESSED WHAT?

00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:14.671
THAT CREATURE IS ABLE
TO ABSORB THE SUN'S LIGHT

00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.009
AND THEN FOCUS IT
INTO A LASER BEAM!

00:09:17.009 --> 00:09:20.648
AND REMEMBER, THIS ISLAND
IS FLOATING ABOVE THE CLOUDS,

00:09:20.648 --> 00:09:23.519
SO THE SUN'S RAYS
ARE EXTREMELY INTENSE HERE,

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.589
GIVING HIM EXTRA POWER!

00:09:25.589 --> 00:09:27.492
HEY, TRISTAN!
THAT'S ME.

00:09:27.492 --> 00:09:28.694
WHAT'S OUR PLAN?

00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:33.434
HMM,
SCREAM FOR YUGI?

00:09:33.434 --> 00:09:34.470
YOU ALL RIGHT?!

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.006
OHH...

00:09:36.006 --> 00:09:38.009
MR. MOTO! STAY DOWN!

00:09:38.009 --> 00:09:42.950
THUNDER KID! ATTACK!

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.053
TRISTAN, WHY DON'T YOU
AND YOUR LITTLE SHOCK JOCK

00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:46.656
WORK ON CRACKING OPEN
THAT STONE

00:09:46.656 --> 00:09:48.893
AND LET ME DEAL
WITH 'OL GLASS-FACE!

00:09:48.893 --> 00:09:50.696
YOU CAN'T FIGHT
THAT THING ALONE!

00:09:50.696 --> 00:09:52.499
THIS IS NO TIME
TO ARGUE.

00:09:52.499 --> 00:09:53.566
NOW...

00:09:53.566 --> 00:09:56.538
FLAME SWORDSMAN,
ATTACK!

00:09:56.538 --> 00:09:57.674
AAH!

00:09:57.674 --> 00:10:01.579
WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME!

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:04.084
CLOSE CALL.
A FEW SECONDS LATER,

00:10:04.084 --> 00:10:05.720
AND THAT BEAM
WOULD'VE PUT
A HOLE IN ME

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.188
INSTEAD
OF THAT STONE!

00:10:07.188 --> 00:10:09.659
HUH? WAIT A SEC.

00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:12.396
IT PUT A HOLE
IN THIS STONE.

00:10:12.396 --> 00:10:15.401
THIS MIGHT WORK.

00:10:15.401 --> 00:10:20.776
JUST DO WHAT I DO.

00:10:20.776 --> 00:10:22.980
Tristan:
HEY! CHANDELIER BOY!

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.720
LET'S SEE HOW GOOD
YOUR AIM IS!

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:32.763
GIMME YOUR BEST SHOT,
PUNK!

00:10:32.763 --> 00:10:34.499
CAN'T YOU DO ANYTHING
BETTER THAN THAT?!

00:10:34.499 --> 00:10:36.702
EHH...EHH...

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:41.844
AH-HEH!

00:10:41.844 --> 00:10:43.880
YOU'RE PATHETIC,
DUDE!

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.152
THAT DOESN'T EXACTLY
LOOK PRODUCTIVE, TRISTAN!

00:10:47.152 --> 00:10:49.655
I HEAR
YOUR GRANDMA'S
A CHINA CABINET!

00:10:54.798 --> 00:10:56.834
HE'S STUCK
BETWEEN A ROCK
AND A HARD PLACE!

00:10:56.834 --> 00:10:58.504
JUST ONE ZAP,
AND HE'S DONE!

00:11:08.512 --> 00:11:11.217
YOU'LL NEVER ESCAPE!

00:11:13.554 --> 00:11:14.689
OH!

00:11:22.102 --> 00:11:24.605
HA HA HA!

00:11:24.605 --> 00:11:25.641
HA HA HA HA!

00:11:25.641 --> 00:11:27.042
AAH!

00:11:27.042 --> 00:11:28.311
NO! NO!

00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:33.319
UHH!

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:38.160
THAT DREAM AGAIN.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.396
HUH?

00:11:39.396 --> 00:11:42.066
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:11:42.066 --> 00:11:44.170
THOSE GUYS LEFT
IN SUCH A RUSH,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.407
THEY FORGOT TO TAKE
THE INSTRUCTIONS.

00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:47.942
WHAT INSTRUCTIONS?
OH!

00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:50.446
YOU'RE AWAKE!

00:11:50.446 --> 00:11:53.117
I GUESS ALL YOU NEEDED
WAS SOME REST.

00:11:53.117 --> 00:11:54.453
YEAH.
I'M TELLING YOU,

00:11:54.453 --> 00:11:56.923
A FEW Z's, AND I
FEEL LIKE A NEW MAN!

00:11:56.923 --> 00:11:58.359
GLAD TA HEAR IT!

00:11:58.359 --> 00:12:00.228
HEY,
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

00:12:00.228 --> 00:12:02.699
THEY WENT
TO TRY AND SOLVE
THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:04.803
SO WHATTA
THEY HAFTA DO?

00:12:04.803 --> 00:12:06.806
THIS.

00:12:06.806 --> 00:12:08.575
ANY IDEA
WHAT IT SAYS?

00:12:08.575 --> 00:12:10.011
NOT A WORD,

00:12:10.011 --> 00:12:15.553
BUT I KNOW SOMEONE
THAT DOES!

00:12:15.553 --> 00:12:18.257
"THE TRIAL OF LIGHT
AND SHADOWS.

00:12:18.257 --> 00:12:20.661
"ONCE A DAY,
THE UNBREAKABLE

00:12:20.661 --> 00:12:22.163
"IN THE VALLEY

WITH A POWER
THAT'S GREATER THAN
PHYSICAL MIGHT."

00:12:27.939 --> 00:12:30.877
SO, ANY IDEA WHAT
ALL THAT MEANS,
PHARAOH?

00:12:30.877 --> 00:12:32.379
[THINKING]
THIS IS ONLY HALF
OF THE RIDDLE.

00:12:32.379 --> 00:12:33.749
WHA--

00:12:33.749 --> 00:12:36.219
IT'S CALLED
"THE TRIAL OF LIGHT
AND SHADOWS,"

00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:38.590
YET THIS MESSAGE
SPEAKS ONLY
OF LIGHT,

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.059
SO THERE
MUST BE MORE.

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:42.162
YEAH, BUT WHERE?

00:12:42.162 --> 00:12:46.870
THE SECOND HALF
MUST BE HIDDEN
SOMEWHERE ON THIS PAGE.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.739
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS
IN THE SHADE

00:12:48.739 --> 00:12:50.074

YOU'RE A GENIUS!

00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:53.513
YOU SOLVED IT.

00:12:53.513 --> 00:12:54.581
[CHUCKLING]

00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:57.052
THANKS.
BUT REMIND ME HOW?

00:12:57.052 --> 00:13:00.190
ALL I REALLY DID WAS
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE HEAT.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.629
THAT'S NOT
ALL YOU DID.

00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:05.866
YOU SUGGESTED
WE READ THIS
IN THE SHADE,

00:13:05.866 --> 00:13:08.103
WHICH REVEALED
THE MISSING PIECE!

00:13:08.103 --> 00:13:10.072
OH, YEAH.
THOSE SYMBOLS CHANGED.

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:11.508
YES. OUT THERE,

00:13:11.508 --> 00:13:13.946
ONLY THE MESSAGE OF
LIGHT COULD BE SEEN,

00:13:13.946 --> 00:13:17.518
BUT BLOCKING THE SUN
REVEALED THE MESSAGE
OF THE SHADOWS.

00:13:17.518 --> 00:13:19.788
SO WHAT'S IT SAY?

00:13:19.788 --> 00:13:21.491
OH, NO.

00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:23.527

TAKE YOUR

BELOW YOUR EYE.

TO PUT SOME CRACKS
IN THAT ROCK,

00:16:34.463 --> 00:16:38.502
ACTIVATE DUEL ARMOR!

00:16:38.502 --> 00:16:41.641
AAH! HOLD ON!
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

00:16:50.622 --> 00:16:52.091
YUGI!
YUGI!

00:16:59.737 --> 00:17:02.875
LET THE FINAL PHASE
OF THIS TRIAL BEGIN!

00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:07.849
AAH!

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:12.523
[GRUNTING]

00:17:12.523 --> 00:17:17.898
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:17:17.898 --> 00:17:20.236
FLAME SWORDSMAN,
END THIS NOW!

00:17:20.236 --> 00:17:22.005
[ROARING]

00:17:22.005 --> 00:17:24.575
WAIT!

00:17:24.575 --> 00:17:25.577
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:27.113
WHY'D HE STOP IT?

00:17:27.113 --> 00:17:29.583
DON'T WE HAVE TO
DEFEAT THAT THING
TO CLEAR THIS LEVEL?

00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:32.488
Yami-Yugi: NO.
SEE FOR YOURSELVES.

00:17:32.488 --> 00:17:39.266
LOOK, GUYS.
WHAT'S WITH THAT BOX?

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:42.571
THE SECOND PART OF THAT
RIDDLE EXPLAINS IT ALL.

00:17:42.571 --> 00:17:44.140
WE'VE ALREADY PASSED!

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.141
HUH?

00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:46.310
THERE WAS MORE!?

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.379
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:17:47.379 --> 00:17:48.915
THE PART YOU READ
ONLY DESCRIBED

00:17:48.915 --> 00:17:51.118
THE FIRST HALF
OF THE CHALLENGE.

00:17:51.118 --> 00:17:52.821
BUT WHEN EXPOSED
TO THE DARKNESS,

00:17:52.821 --> 00:17:55.057
THE REST OF
THE MESSAGE APPEARED.

00:17:55.057 --> 00:17:57.228
AND THIS FINAL PIECE
OF THE PUZZLE

00:17:57.228 --> 00:17:59.298
WAS NECESSARY
IN ORDER TO SOLVE IT.

00:17:59.298 --> 00:18:01.468
THE RIDDLE CONTINUED
AS FOLLOWS:

00:18:01.468 --> 00:18:03.070
"WHEN LIGHT
IS EXTINGUISHED,

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.709
"THE TRUE TEST BEGINS
FOR A CREATURE OF
DARKNESS IT BRINGS.

00:18:06.709 --> 00:18:09.180
"BUT ONLY THE RIGHTEOUS
AND PEACEFUL SHALL PASS

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.684
AND RECEIVE
THE ENDOWMENT OF WINGS."

00:18:11.684 --> 00:18:15.056
OHH...

00:18:15.056 --> 00:18:16.892
ONCE THIS
TREASURE CHEST APPEARED,

00:18:16.892 --> 00:18:19.063
THE MONSTER WAS
NO LONGER A THREAT,

00:18:19.063 --> 00:18:20.664
SO I STOPPED
JOEY'S ATTACK,

00:18:20.664 --> 00:18:23.603
THUS PROVING WE WERE
"RIGHTEOUS" AND "PEACEFUL."

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.207
Voice: WELL PLAYED,
MY YOUNG FRIENDS.

00:18:26.207 --> 00:18:27.442
WHO'S THERE?!

00:18:27.442 --> 00:18:30.380
THIS TRIAL WAS A TEST
OF YOUR CHARACTER.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.918
HAD YOU GONE ON TO ATTACK
THE CREATURE OF DARKNESS,

00:18:32.918 --> 00:18:34.454
YOU WOULD HAVE FAILED.

00:18:34.454 --> 00:18:36.390
BUT BY CHOOSING
THE HIGHER PATH,

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.760
YOU HAVE PROVEN
YOUR WORTH ONCE AGAIN.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.563
WHO ARE YOU?

00:18:40.563 --> 00:18:43.334
AND WHY DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT THIS PLACE?

00:18:43.334 --> 00:18:46.071
MY NAME IS OF
NO CONSEQUENCE, PHARAOH,

00:18:46.071 --> 00:18:49.043
BUT I ASSURE YOU
I AM HERE AS A FRIEND.

00:18:49.043 --> 00:18:51.481
I OVERSEE THESE TRIALS.

00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:53.083
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:18:53.083 --> 00:18:55.387
YOU HAVE COMPLETED
LEVEL TWO.

00:18:55.387 --> 00:18:57.557
HUH?

00:18:57.557 --> 00:18:58.792
HE'S RIGHT, GUYS.

00:18:58.792 --> 00:19:01.095
THE SECOND PIECE
OF THE AMULET LIT UP.

00:19:01.095 --> 00:19:03.567
3 TRIALS NOW REMAIN,

00:19:03.567 --> 00:19:06.939
AND THE MOST DIFFICULT
TESTS ARE YET TO COME.

00:19:06.939 --> 00:19:08.908
Yami-Yugi: WAIT!

00:19:08.908 --> 00:19:10.911
YOU HAVE A QUESTION?

00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:14.217
YES. WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO US IF WE FAIL?

00:19:14.217 --> 00:19:16.253
YOU WILL
BE TRAPPED HERE

00:19:16.253 --> 00:19:18.524
UNTIL THE NEXT
WARRIOR COMES.

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:21.228
AND IF WE PASS
THESE TRIALS?

00:19:21.228 --> 00:19:23.899
WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN?

00:19:23.899 --> 00:19:26.669
YOU WILL HAVE
PROVEN YOURSELF
A TRUE KING,

00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:29.508
AND THE POWER
YOU DESERVE
SHALL BE YOURS.

00:19:29.508 --> 00:19:32.412
WAIT! BUT I DON'T
WANT ANY POWER!

00:19:32.412 --> 00:19:34.816
THERE ARE THOSE
THAT DO,

00:19:34.816 --> 00:19:38.221
AND YOU MUST CLAIM
THIS POWER
BEFORE THEY DO.

00:19:42.095 --> 00:19:44.465
WELL, I GUESS
WE EARNED OUR WINGS.

00:19:44.465 --> 00:19:46.768
SO WHERE ARE WE
OFF TO NEXT, GUYS?

00:19:46.768 --> 00:19:49.706
Tea: I'M ASSUMING THAT
BIG DOORWAY IN THE SKY?

00:19:49.706 --> 00:19:51.309
SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT.

00:19:51.309 --> 00:19:53.579
YOU BIRDIES
READY TO LEAVE
THE NEST OR WHAT?

00:19:53.579 --> 00:19:54.648
YUGI?

00:19:54.648 --> 00:19:55.650
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'VE GOT

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.151
THE ENERGY
TO DO THIS?

00:19:57.151 --> 00:19:58.987
I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER.

00:19:58.987 --> 00:20:02.594
I MUST SAY I WISH
I HAD HALF THE GUSTO
YOU HAVE!

00:20:02.594 --> 00:20:05.031
HEY, MAN...I'M SORRY
WE HAD TO RELY ON YOU

00:20:05.031 --> 00:20:07.267
TO BAIL US OUT AGAIN.

00:20:07.267 --> 00:20:09.170
I THOUGHT FOR ONCE
WE COULD GIVE YOU A BREAK

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.207
FROM ALWAYS HAVING
TO SAVE THE DAY,

00:20:11.207 --> 00:20:13.945
BUT I GUESS IN THE END,
WE'RE HELPLESS WITHOUT YOU.

00:20:13.945 --> 00:20:15.380
WHAT, ARE YOU NUTS?

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.118
THAT WAS A TOTAL
GROUP EFFORT
BACK THERE, TRISTAN!

00:20:18.118 --> 00:20:20.755
DID YOU FORGET
THOSE BRILLIANT IDEAS
YOU CAME UP WITH?

00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:21.891
TELL HIM, YUGE.

00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:23.560
YUP! WE'RE A TEAM, GUYS.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.561
RIGHT.

00:20:24.561 --> 00:20:26.730
ALL FOR ONE...

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.865
AND ONE FOR ALL!

00:20:38.609 --> 00:20:40.510
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.580
BEFORE THE GREATEST POWER
ON EARTH BELONGS TO ME.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.049
