LEARN ABOUT HIS PAST.

NOW THAT HE'S
IN THE REALM OF

00:16:36.876 --> 00:16:38.813
THE ONLY WAY
HE MAY RETURN

IS BY REIGNING

WAS DESTROYED

NAMED BAKURA.

ARE YOU SURE?

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.204
HE, TOO, IS
AN ANCIENT SOUL,

00:17:24.204 --> 00:17:26.475
A WANDERING SPIRIT
IF YOU WILL.

00:17:26.475 --> 00:17:27.811

TO RELEASE A CREATURE
OF ULTIMATE DARKNESS.

THERE WITH THE PHARAOH?!

00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:46.215
