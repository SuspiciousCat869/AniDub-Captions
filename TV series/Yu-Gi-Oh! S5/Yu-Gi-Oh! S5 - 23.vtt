00:00:00.862 --> 00:00:04.666
Narrator:
PREVIOUSLY ON YU-GI-OH...

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.803
YUGI, WATCH OUT!

00:00:07.803 --> 00:00:11.873
ACTIVATE
DARK EVOLUTION!

00:00:11.873 --> 00:00:14.176
NOW I ACTIVATE
MY DUEL ARMOR!

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:23.785
Yami-Yugi:
NOW, TO FINISH YOU OFF

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:26.321
WITH CHAOS SCEPTER BLAST!

00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:31.660
AH!
AH!

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.235
Grandpa:
WELL DONE!

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:42.471
I GUESS IT'S ON
TO LEVEL 5, HUH?

00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:43.472
1 MORE LEFT.

00:00:43.472 --> 00:00:44.573
AWESOME.

00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:46.041
Yugi: WELL,
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:48.076
LET'S FINISH THIS
THING AND GO HOME!

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:56.051
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,

00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:57.352

♪ YU-GI-OH ♪

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.011
I THINK
WE ENDED UP

00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:58.313
IN THE EXACT SAME
PLACE WE STARTED.

00:01:58.313 --> 00:01:59.648
ME, TOO.

00:01:59.648 --> 00:02:01.983
MAYBE WE TOOK
THE WRONG DOOR.

00:02:01.983 --> 00:02:05.454
NAH, THE WAY I SEE IT
WE'VE COME FULL CIRCLE.

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:06.888
RIGHT, CAUSE IF
THIS IS THE SPOT

00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:08.557
WE ENTERED FROM,
IT MAKES SENSE

00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:11.059
THAT THE EXIT
IS HERE, TOO.

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:16.932
Man:
A WISE DEDUCTION.

00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:18.834
BUT THERE IS STILL
A LONG WAY TO GO

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.635
BEFORE YOU MAY
RETURN HOME.

00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:22.337
YOUR FIFTH AND
FINAL CHALLENGE

00:02:22.337 --> 00:02:24.806
WILL PROVE TO BE THE
MOST DIFFICULT THUS FAR.

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:26.541
YEAH?
SAYS WHO?

00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:28.910
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU
IDENTIFIED YOURSELF!

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.879
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.215
MY FRIENDS...

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.650
MY NAME IS KING
ALEXANDROS THE THIRD

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.818
OF MACEDONIA.

00:02:36.818 --> 00:02:38.954
ALEXANDER THE GREAT?

00:02:38.954 --> 00:02:41.223
NO WAY!

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:43.725
SO, I TAKE IT YOU
HAVE HEARD OF ME.

00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:44.993
WHAT DO THEY SAY
ABOUT MY LIFE

00:02:44.993 --> 00:02:46.128
WHERE YOU LIVE?

00:02:46.128 --> 00:02:47.529
OH, ONLY THAT
YOU ALMOST

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.298
SINGLE-HANDEDLY
CONQUERED THE WORLD.

00:02:50.298 --> 00:02:51.533
I SEE.

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:53.034
WELL, THE EVENTS OF
WHICH YOU SPEAK

00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:56.371
OCCURRED MANY
LIFETIMES AGO.

00:02:56.371 --> 00:03:00.409
SO WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.043
HUH?

00:03:02.043 --> 00:03:03.044
YOU'RE WEARING
THE SAME

00:03:03.044 --> 00:03:04.880
DUEL ARMOR
THAT I AM!

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.048
CORRECT.

00:03:07.048 --> 00:03:09.785
Alexander: IT BEGAN
OVER 2 MILLENNIA AGO,

00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:11.286
AS THE WORLD'S MOST
POWERFUL EMPIRES

00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:13.054
FELL AT MY FEET.

00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:15.657
GREECE,
PERSIA, EGYPT.

00:03:15.657 --> 00:03:18.059
I WAS UNSTOPPABLE.

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.495
AND IT WAS ALL THANKS
TO A GOOD LUCK CHARM

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:22.531
I STUMBLED UPON.

00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:25.700
WHAT SORT OF
A CHARM?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.702
ACTUALLY,
IT WAS NOT UNLIKE

00:03:27.702 --> 00:03:30.038
THE ONE THAT
YOU WEAR.

00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:32.207
BUT THIS GIFT CAME
WITH A PRICE.

00:03:32.207 --> 00:03:34.543
ALTHOUGH IT BROUGHT ME
COUNTLESS VICTORIES,

00:03:34.543 --> 00:03:35.710
THE CHARM
AROUND MY NECK

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.046
SEEMED TO CLOUD MY MIND.

00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:40.315
AND BEFORE LONG
I LOST THE RESPECT

00:03:40.315 --> 00:03:43.285
AND LOYALTY OF MY MEN.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:46.221
I MUST FINISH THIS.

00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:47.556
EVEN IF IT MEANS
DOMINATING

00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:49.891
THE REST OF THE WORLD
ON MY OWN.

00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:51.893
SO, IT IS
ULTIMATE POWER

00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:53.028
THAT YOU SEEK,
IS IT?

00:03:53.028 --> 00:03:55.163
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU ARE WORTHY?

00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:56.798
WHO ARE YOU
TO QUESTION

00:03:56.798 --> 00:03:58.500
MY WORTH, STRANGER?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.101
I AM THE GUARDIAN

00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:01.703
OF THE SACRED
ITEM YOU WEAR!

00:04:01.703 --> 00:04:03.104
AND IF YOU TRULY
ARE DESERVING

00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:04.706
OF THE POWER WITHIN,

00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:06.374
THEN YOU MUST
PROVE IT BY FACING

00:04:06.374 --> 00:04:10.045
THE TRIALS OF
THE CAPSULE MONSTERS!

00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:16.718
ONLY A TRUE KING
CAN PASS THESE TESTS!

00:04:16.718 --> 00:04:17.886
Alexander:
AND SO I ENTERED

00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:20.889
THE STRANGER'S PYRAMID,
JUST AS YOU DID.

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.325
I TAKE IT
YOU DIDN'T SUCCEED?

00:04:23.325 --> 00:04:26.528
MY LUST FOR POWER
WAS MY DOWNFALL.

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:28.530
I'M SURE
YOU'RE ALL AWARE

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.131
OF WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER I FAILED.

00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:31.466
AH, NO IDEA.

00:04:31.466 --> 00:04:33.368
IF THE HISTORY BOOKS
ARE RIGHT,

00:04:33.368 --> 00:04:35.370
YOUR INVASION
OF INDIA WAS A BUST,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.205
AND YOUR WHOLE
EMPIRE FELL.

00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:39.474
Tea: ALL BUT A FEW OF
YOUR MEN DESERTED YOU,

00:04:39.474 --> 00:04:42.210
AND, WELL...

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.481
SOME HISTORIANS
THINK THE FAILURE

00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:48.116
IT'S TRUE.

00:04:48.116 --> 00:04:49.818
I FAILED THE
STRANGER'S TEST,

00:04:49.818 --> 00:04:52.554
AND LOST EVERYTHING.

00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:54.890
BUT IT WAS
MY OWN FAULT.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.460
AND NOW
IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.396
Alexander: THIS IS
THE FINAL TRIAL.

00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:04.332
"SLAY THEM ALL
IF YOU DARE.

00:05:04.332 --> 00:05:08.470
EARTH, FIRE, SKY,
WATER AND AIR."

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.305
SLAY THEM ALL?

00:05:10.305 --> 00:05:12.040
SOUNDS LIKE
A PLAN TA ME!

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.242
BUT WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHERE TO START.

00:05:14.242 --> 00:05:16.211
WELL, THEN,
IT'S LUCKY FOR YOU

00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.980
I SHOWED UP
WHEN I DID.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.651
HERE.

00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:23.718
THANKS.

00:05:23.718 --> 00:05:25.887
WHICH MONSTER'S
INSIDE?

00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:29.291
ONE THAT YOU'LL NEED IF
YOU EXPECT TO PASS THIS TEST.

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:32.394
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:34.763
Joey: YOU SURE
WE CAN TRUST THIS GUY?

00:05:34.763 --> 00:05:37.132
IT'S THE BEST
OPTION WE'VE
GOT.

00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:47.069
Joey: SO, ABOUT THIS
FINAL CHALLENGE...

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.539
GOT ANY HINTS, TIPS,
WORDS OF WISDOM?

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:51.741
Tristan:
YEAH, LIKE,

00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:53.843
WHAT'S UP
WITH THE GHOST TOWN?

00:05:53.843 --> 00:05:56.012
Alexander: WE HAVE ENTERED
A SETTLEMENT KNOWN AS

00:05:56.012 --> 00:05:58.447
VILLAGE OF
THE DIVINE DRAGON.

00:05:58.447 --> 00:06:00.416
I'M AFRAID THE REST

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:05.288
YOU MUST DISCOVER
ON YOUR OWN.

00:06:05.288 --> 00:06:07.623
Tristan: WELL, I CAN
TELL YOU 1 THING, GUYS.

00:06:07.623 --> 00:06:10.559
WE'RE NOT ALONE.

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:18.567
Townspeople:
[HUMMING]

00:06:21.437 --> 00:06:23.239
Joey:
WHO'S THAT KID?

00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:24.740
Tea: WELL,
WHOEVER SHE IS,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.911
SHE MUST BE
PRETTY IMPORTANT.

00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.913
FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S SO IMPORTANT,

00:06:30.913 --> 00:06:35.384
SHE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE TOO THRILLED.

00:06:35.384 --> 00:06:37.086
ARE YOU PREPARED
TO OFFER UP

00:06:37.086 --> 00:06:38.587
YOUR SOUL SO
THE DIVINE ONE

00:06:38.587 --> 00:06:40.189
MAY CONTINUE TO
OFFER PROTECTION

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:41.490
TO OUR PEOPLE?

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.159
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.527
POOR KID.

00:06:44.527 --> 00:06:46.228
I HAVE
A STRONG FEELING

00:06:46.228 --> 00:06:47.897
OUR CHALLENGE HAS
SOMETHING TO DO

00:06:47.897 --> 00:06:49.965
WITH SAVING
THIS GIRL.

00:06:49.965 --> 00:06:51.701
Joey:
I'M WITH YOU, YUGE.

00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:54.904
LET'S CRASH
THIS PARTY.

00:06:54.904 --> 00:06:56.339
Mayor:
STATE YOUR BUSINESS.

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.076
WE ARE IN THE MIDST
OF A SACRED CEREMONY.

00:07:00.076 --> 00:07:01.744
Joey: AND WE'RE HERE
TO PUT A STOP TO IT

00:07:01.744 --> 00:07:03.346
BEFORE SOMEONE
GETS HURT.

00:07:03.346 --> 00:07:05.848
YES,
BUT I'M FINE.

00:07:14.156 --> 00:07:16.058
YA CALL THAT FINE?

00:07:16.058 --> 00:07:17.293
DAT ROCK COULDA
BEEN YOU!

00:07:17.293 --> 00:07:18.894
DON'T YOU GET IT?

00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:20.963
WHO ARE YOU?

00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:22.565
WE'RE ON
A MISSION
TO DESTROY

00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:24.066
SOME MONSTERS
OR SOMETHING.

00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:25.568
IT'S YOU!

00:07:25.568 --> 00:07:28.337
THE LEGENDARY WARRIORS
OF THE PROPHESY!

00:07:28.337 --> 00:07:29.839
Woman: THE LEGENDARY
WARRIORS?

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:31.073
THEY EXIST?

00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:32.274
Man:
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:07:32.274 --> 00:07:36.512
ARE YOU SAYING YOU
WERE EXPECTING US?

00:07:36.512 --> 00:07:38.280
LET ME EXPLAIN.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.016
Mayor: LONG AGO,
THIS REGION WAS DOMINATED

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:42.918
BY 5 VICIOUS DRAGONS.

00:07:42.918 --> 00:07:44.854
HOWEVER,
THEY WERE BANISHED BY

00:07:44.854 --> 00:07:46.422
THE DIVINE WHITE DRAGON,

00:07:46.422 --> 00:07:47.556
WHO PROMISED
TO PROTECT US

00:07:47.556 --> 00:07:49.725
UNTIL THE LEGENDARY
WARRIORS ARRIVE.

00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:51.494
Joey: SOUNDS LIKE
A HAPPY ENDING.

00:07:51.494 --> 00:07:52.828
WRONG.

00:07:52.828 --> 00:07:55.498
Mayor: THE WHITE DRAGON
HAS A LIMITED ENERGY SOURCE.

00:07:55.498 --> 00:07:57.833
SO IN ORDER FOR IT
TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT

00:07:57.833 --> 00:07:59.735
THIS VILLAGE
FROM THE FIENDISH 5,

00:07:59.735 --> 00:08:01.871
IT HAS ALWAYS
BEEN OUR DUTY

00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:05.074
TO FEED THE WHITE DRAGON
WITH THE POWER THAT IT NEEDS.

00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:07.743
THAT'S WHY WE HOLD
THIS ANNUAL RITUAL--

00:08:07.743 --> 00:08:10.813
FOR THE WHITE DRAGON
FEEDS ON HUMAN SOULS!

00:08:10.813 --> 00:08:12.681
SO YOU PICKED
A DEFENSELESS
KID?

00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:15.251
ACTUALLY,
I VOLUNTEERED.

00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:18.120
IT'S MY DUTY AS
A CITIZEN OF THIS TOWN.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.688
IT DOESN'T NEED
TO BE THIS WAY,

00:08:19.688 --> 00:08:20.723
MY FRIENDS.

00:08:20.723 --> 00:08:22.625

A SACRIFICE MUST BE MADE.

00:09:13.309 --> 00:09:14.410

IT MAY BE
THE ONLY THING CAPABLE

00:10:15.004 --> 00:10:16.405
YES.

ONLY THE LEGENDARY

FROM THE STONE.

WELL, MAYBE
ONLY 1 OF YOU

00:10:35.691 --> 00:10:37.393
IS MEANT TO CONTROL
THAT SWORD.

IF I HEAR
1 MORE RIDDLE,

00:11:00.416 --> 00:11:02.251
MY HEAD'S GONNA
EXPLODE.

00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:03.419
BUT IT MIGHT BE
THE ONLY WAY

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:04.920
TO REMOVE THAT
SWORD.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.755
WELL, IT MIGHT,
BUT I THINK

A LITTLE MORE OF
MY BRUTE STRENGTH

WOULD WORK
JUST AS WELL.

00:11:09.458 --> 00:11:11.226
BUT IF BRUTE STRENGTH
IS THE ANSWER,

00:11:11.226 --> 00:11:14.330
WHY DON'T WE JUST SUMMON
A CAPSULE MONSTER?

WE CAN'T.

00:11:15.698 --> 00:11:17.032

THAT WE FIND

BEFORE THEY FIND US.

THEY REACH THIS TOWN,
