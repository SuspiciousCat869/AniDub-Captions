Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:06.275
MY DEAR FRIEND
HERR KAIBA

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:08.880
IS THROWING ANOTHER
TOURNAMENT IS HE?

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.618
WELL, LIKE I ALWAYS SAY,

00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:15.524
EVERY ROSE
HAS ITS THORN.

00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:18.696
SO, YOU'D BETTER
BE CAREFUL,

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:24.172
FOR EVEN THE MOST
DELICATE FLOWER CAN BE
QUITE DANGEROUS.

00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:26.877
Kaiba, voice-over:
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE
RUNNING SMOOTHLY.

00:00:26.877 --> 00:00:31.317
I WOULD'VE EXPECTED
MY LITTLE HACKER FRIEND
TO STRIKE AGAIN BY NOW.

00:00:31.317 --> 00:00:34.723
UNLESS HE'S ALREADY
IN KAIBA LAND!

00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:36.359
BEHOLD!

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.797
THE MOST DAZZLING
CREATURES IN
DUEL MONSTERS!

00:00:38.797 --> 00:00:44.139
AND ALSO
THE MOST DANGEROUS!

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:47.211
WEEVIL, TELL ME THAT
DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN.

00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.316
THAT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN!

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.785
Roland:
THE WINNER OF THIS BOUT,

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:55.424
AFTER ONLY ONE TURN,
IS ZIGFRIED LLOYD.

Roland: ROUND ONE
HAS COME TO A CLOSE

00:02:03.772 --> 00:02:07.679
AND HALF OF OUR
SUPER 16 COMPETITORS HAVE
BEEN SENT HOME.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.517
SO NOW I GIVE YOU
THE ELITE 8.

00:02:10.517 --> 00:02:13.321
AND FIRST UP,
IT'S OUR BOY-WONDER,

00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:17.929
THE UNDEFEATED LEON WILSON.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.202
BUT SOMEONE'S LOOKING
TO TAKE A BITE OUT
OF LEON'S WINNING STREAK.

00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:24.373
SO EVACUATE THE BEACH
AND CALL IN THE COAST GUARD,

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:29.214
IT'S THE MAN-EATER,
ETHAN SHARK.

00:02:29.214 --> 00:02:31.886
COME ON, ENOUGH WITH
THE FANCY INTROS.

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:33.788
LET'S GET TO
MY DUEL ALREADY!

00:02:33.788 --> 00:02:35.391
THAT'S JOEY,
ALWAYS A MODEL
OF PATIENCE.

00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:37.395
YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT WANNA
TAKE THIS TIME

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:40.400
TO RUN THROUGH
YOUR GAME STRATEGY.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.503
SOME LAST-MINUTE
STUDYING COULDN'T HURT.

00:02:42.503 --> 00:02:44.306
JOEY HATES CRAMMING.

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:45.842
WHICH IS TOO BAD,
'CAUSE HE'S ABOUT
TO GET SCHOOLED

00:02:45.842 --> 00:02:50.383
BY THAT FREAKAZOID
WHO TOOK OUT WEEVIL
AND REX IN ONE MOVE.

00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:53.722
ONLY THING I'M SCARED OF
IS DAT HAIRDO.

00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:55.458
HEY, BUDDY,
PINKY THE CLOWN CALLED!

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:57.295
HE WANTS HIS WIG BACK!

00:02:57.295 --> 00:03:00.900
LIKE YOU'RE IN ANY POSITION
TO BE MAKING FUN
OF ANYONE'S HAIRDO.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.403
I HEARD DAT.

00:03:02.403 --> 00:03:04.573
TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH,
WILL YA?

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:06.410
YOU'RE TOO
HIGH STRUNG TO DUEL.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.979
WHO ARE YOU CALLIN'
"HIGH STRUNG"?

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.682
I'M COOL AS A CUCUMBER.

00:03:09.682 --> 00:03:11.519
OH, YEAH, REAL COOL.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.586
I'M NOT IN DA MOOD.

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:13.889
YOU WANT A PIECE
'A ME?

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.263
Tea: CAN YOU TWO
GROW UP FOR, LIKE,
5 MINUTES?

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:20.667
I NEED SOME
FEMALE FRIENDS!

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.003
Both: HE STARTED IT!

00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:23.505
YOU OK, LEON?

00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:26.978
I GUESS I JUST HAVE A CASE
OF THE PRE-DUEL JITTERS.

00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:27.980
WE CAN'T ALL BE
AS CALM AS JOEY.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.816
HEY, SURE YA CAN.

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:33.823
YOU CAN'T BE TOO BAD
IF YOU MADE IT TO
THE FINAL 8, RIGHT?

00:03:33.823 --> 00:03:36.861
YOU JUST GOTTA DO
WHAT I DO AND BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONNA WIN.

00:03:36.861 --> 00:03:38.964
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT.

00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:42.771
I'M AFRAID TO WIN,
'CAUSE THEN I'LL HAVE TO
FACE OFF AGAINST YUGI.

00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:46.477
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT
FREAKS ME OUT.

00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:49.882
LISTEN, PAL,
JUST TAKE THIS ONE DUEL
AT A TIME, OK?

00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:51.619
JOEY'S GOT A POINT.

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.991
IT'S TOO SOON TO WORRY ABOUT
THE CHAMPIONSHIP DUEL NOW.

00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:58.730
BESIDES, YOU'RE GONNA
HAFTA DUEL AGAINST ME
BEFORE YOU CAN GET TO YUGI.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.935
WELL, JUST MAKE SURE
YOU GO EASY ON ME, OK, BEC?

00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:02.937
I'VE SEEN YOU IN ACTION.

00:04:02.937 --> 00:04:07.278
YOU CAN BE BRUTAL.

00:04:07.278 --> 00:04:09.883
OK, LET'S GET THIS SHOW
ON THE ROAD.

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:13.555
IT'S "WHEELER TIME," BABY.

00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:16.460
HEY, IT'S ZIGFRIED, RIGHT?

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.966
JUST WANTED TO WISH
YOU LUCK OUT THERE TODAY.

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.737
UNLIKE YOU,
I DON'T RELY ON LUCK.

00:04:22.737 --> 00:04:25.843
I WAS TRYIN' TA BE NICE!

00:04:25.843 --> 00:04:30.317
WHERE I COME FROM
YA SHOW YOUR OPPONENT
SOME RESPECT!

00:04:33.622 --> 00:04:37.295
HEY, ZIG-FREAK, MAYBE
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME!

00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:39.766
DON'T TOUCH
THE SUIT.

00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:40.901
OH, I'LL TOUCH
MORE THAN THAT.

00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:43.004
JOEY, DON'T!

00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:44.807
Zigfried:
IF I WERE YOU,
HERR JOSEPH,

00:04:44.807 --> 00:04:47.645
I'D LISTEN TO
MY LITTLE FRIEND.

00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:50.083
WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YA,
YOU'RE NOT ME!

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:52.821
TRUE, BECAUSE IF I WAS,

00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:55.558
I'D BE A WORTHLESS
STREET PUNK WITH NO TALENT,

00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:58.430
AND NOT TO MENTION
APPALLING TASTE
IN OUTERWEAR.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.899
DAT DOES IT!

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:02.904
NO ONE INSULTS
MY FASHION SENSE AND
GETS AWAY WITH IT,

00:05:02.904 --> 00:05:04.875
SO BRING IT ON!

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:07.813
I'VE WASTED
MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME
ON YOU ALREADY.

00:05:07.813 --> 00:05:11.085
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A DUEL TO WIN.

00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:13.523
HEY!

00:05:13.523 --> 00:05:15.559
HEY, MAN,
SAVE IT FOR
THE GAME.

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:17.562
GET OFF 'A ME!

00:05:17.562 --> 00:05:20.834
IT'S TIME TO
BEAT DA DESIGNER PANTS
OFF 'A DAT CHUMP.

00:05:20.834 --> 00:05:22.738
BE CAREFUL,
DUDE.

00:05:22.738 --> 00:05:25.341
HE BETTER
GET A GRIP
OR HE'S HISTORY.

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:27.412
THE MATCH DIDN'T
EVEN START YET

00:05:27.412 --> 00:05:29.582
AND JOEY'S
LETTING THIS GUY
MESS WITH HIS HEAD.

00:05:29.582 --> 00:05:32.453
WELL, I GUESS
I SHOULD BE HEADING OUT
TO MY MATCH NOW, TOO.

00:05:32.453 --> 00:05:33.789
ARE YOU OK?

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:34.824
IT'S JUST THAT
I KNOW JOEY REALLY

00:05:34.824 --> 00:05:37.563
NEEDS YOU OUT THERE
TO CHEER HIM ON,

00:05:37.563 --> 00:05:40.099
BUT THAT MEANS
YOU WON'T BE THERE
TO WATCH ME DUEL.

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.903
MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU.

00:05:41.903 --> 00:05:43.873
BUT YA KNOW,
THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDE
TO THIS WHOLE THING.

00:05:43.873 --> 00:05:46.711
I'M PLANNING TO
STAY IN THIS TOURNAMENT
'TIL THE VERY END,

00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:50.450
SO YOU'LL HAVE
PLENTY MORE CHANCES
TO ROOT FOR ME.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.354
GO GET 'EM, REBECCA!

00:05:52.354 --> 00:05:53.656
COME ON,
JOEY'S GONNA NEED

00:05:53.656 --> 00:05:54.824
ALL THE HELP
HE CAN IF GET

00:05:54.824 --> 00:05:56.695
IF HE PLANS ON
BEATING ZIGFRIED.

00:05:56.695 --> 00:05:59.465
Tea: YEAH,
NO JOKE.

00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:00.534
YUGI, WAIT.

00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:02.403
I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU
RIGHT AWAY.

00:06:09.371 --> 00:06:11.942
Mokuba:
SO HAVE YOU NOTICED
ANY STRANGE BEHAVIOR

00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:13.545
COMING FROM ANY OF
THE COMPETITORS?

00:06:13.545 --> 00:06:14.881
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:16.050
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.454
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
NOT TO TELL ANYONE.

00:06:18.454 --> 00:06:20.123
IF ANY WORD
OF THIS GETS OUT,

00:06:20.123 --> 00:06:22.126
IT COULD RUIN THE
GRAND CHAMPIONSHIP

00:06:22.126 --> 00:06:25.031
AND OUR WHOLE
COMPANY FOR GOOD.

00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:27.436
REMEMBER WHEN
THE DUELTEK COMPUTER
WENT BERSERK

00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:30.239
AND LOCKED US INSIDE
THE KAIBA DOME?

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:32.077
I'VE LOST CONTROL.

00:06:32.077 --> 00:06:34.981
STEP ASIDE, MOKUBA.

00:06:34.981 --> 00:06:36.083
Mokuba:
YOU GOTTA RELAX, BRO.

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:39.154
Kaiba: NOT UNTIL
WE FIND THAT HACKER.

00:06:39.154 --> 00:06:41.125
ISN'T THE SYSTEM
SECURE NOW?

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.495
WELL, I REINFORCED
THE KIABA CORP FIREWALL,

00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:46.801
SO NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO BREAK IN FROM
THE OUTSIDE AGAIN.

00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:48.370
UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.509
SOMEONE SABOTAGING
THIS TOURNAMENT
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:53.912
I HAVE A BAD FEELING
THAT THE PERSON
WE'RE AFTER

00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:55.515
IS ALREADY
ON THE INSIDE.

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:57.119
YOU'RE KIDDING.

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:00.022
HOW COULD SOMEONE
HAVE SNUCK IN
WITHOUT US NOTICING?

00:07:00.022 --> 00:07:03.095
I NEVER SAID
THEY SNUCK IN,
MOKUBA.

00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:04.598
WE INVITED THEM.

00:07:04.598 --> 00:07:06.234
AND WHEN I FIND OUT

00:07:06.234 --> 00:07:08.270
WHICH ONE OF
THOSE COMPETITORS
IS OUT TO RUIN ME,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.240
THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.244
RIGHT NOW
I'M CONDUCTING
BACKGROUND CHECKS

00:07:12.244 --> 00:07:13.446
ON ALL DUELISTS.

00:07:13.446 --> 00:07:16.116
AND I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO KEEP AN EYE OUT

00:07:16.116 --> 00:07:19.221
FOR ANY SUSPICIOUS
ACTIVITIES.

00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:21.826
Yugi:
SO WHO DO YA THINK
IT IS, MOKUBA?

00:07:21.826 --> 00:07:23.162
I DON'T HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST CLUE,

00:07:23.162 --> 00:07:25.231
AND THAT'S WHY
I NEED YOUR HELP.

00:07:25.231 --> 00:07:27.936
YOU GOTTA LET ME
KNOW IF YOU NOTICE
ANYTHING STRANGE.

00:07:27.936 --> 00:07:30.174
SURE, BUT YOU DO REALIZE

00:07:30.174 --> 00:07:31.442
THAT STRANGE THINGS
HAPPEN TO US

00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:32.577
ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.246
Tristan:
SHE'S GOT
A POINT THERE.

00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:37.953
BUT I WAS HOPING
THIS TIME WOULD BE
DIFFERENT,

00:07:37.953 --> 00:07:40.591
BUT SO MUCH FOR THAT, HUH?

00:07:40.591 --> 00:07:44.096
JUST ONCE I'D LIKE
TO DUEL IN A TOURNAMENT
FOR THE THRILL OF IT

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:47.635
AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT WHO'S TRYING
TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:49.506
YUGI, PLEASE.

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:51.342
WHY CAN'T THINGS
JUST BE EASY FOR A CHANGE?

00:07:51.342 --> 00:07:55.516
WE SHOULD BE HAVING FUN,
NOT HUNTING DOWN BAD GUYS.

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:57.385
DON'T WORRY.

00:07:57.385 --> 00:07:58.921
WE'LL FIND HIM SOON!

00:07:58.921 --> 00:08:01.626
I'M NOT GONNA
LET SOME PUNK RUIN
THIS TOURNAMENT!

00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:02.661
OH, YEAH!

00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:04.364

00:08:04.364 --> 00:08:06.300
NOW WHATTA YA SAY
WE GET OUT THERE,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.536

00:08:07.536 --> 00:08:09.005
AND DO WHAT
WE DO BEST--

00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:14.514
CHEER FROM
THE SIDELINES!

00:08:14.514 --> 00:08:15.883
Tea: LOOK AT
THE BRIGHT SIDE.

00:08:15.883 --> 00:08:17.151
THERE'S NEVER
A DULL MOMENT, RIGHT?

00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:20.658
Yugi: THAT'S FOR SURE!

00:08:20.658 --> 00:08:24.097
LET'S GET READY TO DUEL!

00:08:24.097 --> 00:08:29.038
THE NEXT 4
CHAMPIONSHIP BOUTS ARE
NOW UNDERWAY, FOLKS!

00:08:29.038 --> 00:08:31.876
FACING OFF IN
THE HOUSE OF HORROR,

00:08:31.876 --> 00:08:34.447
WHERE THE GHOULS
COME TO DUEL,

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:40.057
IT'S WONDER BOY
LEON WILSON VERSUS
MAN-EATER ETHAN SHARK.

00:08:40.057 --> 00:08:42.560
THEN IT'S SHOWTIME
AT THE KAIBA LAND THEATER

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.567
AS THE DUELIST DETECTIVE
FACES THE MASTER OF MAGIC.

00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:50.073
NOW LET'S MOVE ON
TO THE WHEEL OF WONDER

00:08:50.073 --> 00:08:52.945
AS THE GRAND CHAMPIONSHIP
TAKES TO THE SKIES.

00:08:52.945 --> 00:08:54.882
IN THIS BIZARRE MATCH-UP,

00:08:54.882 --> 00:09:00.223
REGIONAL CHAMP
REBECCA HAWKINS FACES
ABE THE MONKEY BOY.

00:09:00.223 --> 00:09:02.628
AND FINALLY,
IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE HEAT,

00:09:02.628 --> 00:09:04.898
GET OUT OF THE VOLCANIC PIT,

00:09:04.898 --> 00:09:07.536
'CAUSE IT'S HERE THAT
TRENDSETTER ZIGFRIED LLOYD

00:09:07.536 --> 00:09:13.079
SQUARES OFF AGAINST
JUMPIN' JOEY WHEELER!

00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:16.150
LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
WITH PLACE.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.920
NOW WHATTA YA SAY
WE GET DOWN TA BUSINESS,
ZIGGY?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.593
Tea: DON'T START
WITHOUT US.

00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:23.596
HEY, WE'RE HERE
FOR YA DUDE!

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.566
YEAH, NOW ROCK
HIS WORLD.

00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:27.603
'BOUT TIME
YOU GUYS SHOWED UP.

00:09:36.418 --> 00:09:39.490
MAY THE BEST-DRESSED
DUELIST WIN.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.093
I'LL HAVE YOU SHAKIN'
IN YOUR PATENT
LEATHER SHOES,

00:09:42.093 --> 00:09:44.297
AND THE WHOLE WORLD'S
GONNA SEE IT.

00:09:54.113 --> 00:09:56.551
AH, I THINK
THEY'RE SHUFFLED,

00:09:56.551 --> 00:10:00.224
SO QUIT STALLIN' PAL.

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:04.097
TAKE THEM.

00:10:04.097 --> 00:10:07.436
Tea: SO MUCH FOR
KEEPING HIS COOL.

00:10:07.436 --> 00:10:09.440
DON'T LET HIM
GET TO YA, JOEY!

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.512
YEAH, JUST STAY
CALM, PAL!

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:17.286
READY TO ROLL UP
THOSE FRILLY SLEEVES
AND GET DIRTY?

00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:20.424
PLEASE, I WON'T EVEN
BREAK A SWEAT ON YOU.

00:10:34.548 --> 00:10:37.119
All: LET'S DUEL!

00:10:44.359 --> 00:10:46.496
ALL RIGHT, HERR JOSEPH,

00:10:46.496 --> 00:10:50.436
SINCE YOU'RE CLEARLY
AT A DISADVANTAGE
IN SO MANY WAYS,

00:10:50.436 --> 00:10:52.606
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE?

00:10:52.606 --> 00:10:54.776
HE'S JUST MESSIN'
WITH YOUR HEAD, MAN!

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:56.613
YEAH, DON'T
FREAK OUT.

00:10:56.613 --> 00:10:58.850
REMEMBER,
STAY FOCUSED.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.520
TRY TO KEEP UP!

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.860
A'RIGHT,
LET'S SEE HERE.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.796
GEE, I WONDER IF
HE'S GOT A BAD HAND.

00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:10.068
I'M GONNA SAY "YES."

00:11:10.068 --> 00:11:12.673
Joey, voice-over:
I CAN'T PLAY
A SINGLE MONSTA.

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:15.077
Zigfried:
YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SWEAT.

00:11:15.077 --> 00:11:20.085
IS THE MOLTEN LAVA
GETTING TO YOU OR IS IT
SOMETHING ELSE?

00:11:20.085 --> 00:11:23.691
I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:11:23.691 --> 00:11:25.528
THAT'S ALL
HE'S GONNA PLAY?

00:11:25.528 --> 00:11:27.965
I HAVE A FEELING
THAT'S ALL HE CAN PLAY.

00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:29.634
I CAN'T WATCH!

00:11:29.634 --> 00:11:34.443
THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE,
SO WATCH AND LEARN.

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:37.882
I'LL START BY ACTIVATING
A MAGIC CARD,
GRACEFUL CHARITY.

00:11:37.882 --> 00:11:43.692
THIS LETS ME DRAW 3 CARDS
AS LONG AS I DISCARD TWO.

00:11:43.692 --> 00:11:47.598
AND THEN I'LL WRAP THINGS UP
BY PLACING ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.407
LOOKS LIKE ZIGFRIED
DOESN'T HAVE SUCH
A GREAT HAND EITHER.

00:11:53.407 --> 00:11:54.643
OH, YEAH!

00:11:54.643 --> 00:11:57.414
I TOLD YA WE HAD
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:11:57.414 --> 00:11:58.550
VERY STRANGE.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.786
I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY.

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:04.493
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT HE'S SETTING JOEY UP
FOR SOME KIND OF A TRAP.

00:12:04.493 --> 00:12:06.730
YES, I AGREE.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:12.806
LET'S JUST HOPE JOEY
FIGURES IT OUT.

00:12:12.806 --> 00:12:14.677
WHY, I ACTUALLY
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WIN IN ONE MOVE

00:12:14.677 --> 00:12:16.380
LIKE YOU DID LAST TIME,

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.483
BUT YOU COULDN'T EVEN
SUMMON A MONSTER.

00:12:18.483 --> 00:12:22.056
NOW DAT'S FUNNY.

00:12:22.056 --> 00:12:23.759
THE GUY CAN'T EVEN
SUMMON A MONSTER...

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:26.897
Zigfried: I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE ON TO ME
BY NOW, HERR KAIBA.

00:12:26.897 --> 00:12:28.566
PERHAPS YOU JUST NEED
A LITTLE HINT,

00:12:28.566 --> 00:12:35.010
SO ALLOW ME TO
SHAKE THINGS UP A BIT.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.548
IT'S SHOWTIME.

00:12:42.589 --> 00:12:45.127
IT'S TIME
TA TURN UP DA HEAT.

00:12:45.127 --> 00:12:48.767
READY?

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:52.573
NOT DAT HOT!

00:12:52.573 --> 00:12:54.643
Tea:
THIS IS A LITTLE
TOO REALISTIC.

00:12:54.643 --> 00:12:56.613
YEAH, WHY DON'T YA
TURN DOWN THE FLAMES?

00:12:56.613 --> 00:12:58.416
ONE SMALL PROBLEM.

00:12:58.416 --> 00:13:00.586
THIS ISN'T PART
OF THE ATTRACTION,
YOU GUYS!

00:13:00.586 --> 00:13:02.490
THAT'S NOT
FUNNY.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.491
IF KAIBA CORP'S
NOT CONTROLLING
THOSE FLAMES,

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.929
THEN WHO IS,
MOKUBA?

00:13:05.929 --> 00:13:10.670
THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:15.044
[CHUCKLING]

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:16.947
IF YOU WANNA BE TOP BANANA,

00:13:16.947 --> 00:13:19.885
YOU GOTTA STOP
MONKEYING AROUND.

00:13:19.885 --> 00:13:21.421
NOW THEN, MONKEY SEE?

00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:25.595
MONKEY,
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

00:13:25.595 --> 00:13:28.433
A'RIGHT, YOU'RE
THE SMART ONE, PAL.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:32.874
Rebecca: HEY,
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:13:32.874 --> 00:13:36.947
HELP US!

00:13:36.947 --> 00:13:41.221
I'M CLUED IN TO
YOUR STRATEGY BALFRY,

00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:44.560
BUT THIS IS A MYSTERY.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.996
THIS HOUSE,
IT'S HAUNTED--

00:13:45.996 --> 00:13:46.998
FOR REAL!

00:13:46.998 --> 00:13:49.067
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:13:49.067 --> 00:13:50.570
Roland:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.506
WE'RE EXPERIENCING
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

00:13:52.506 --> 00:13:55.645
PLEASE STAND BY.

00:13:55.645 --> 00:13:59.718
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:13:59.718 --> 00:14:01.054
MR. KAIBA,
WE'VE GOT TROUBLE.

00:14:01.054 --> 00:14:03.625
I'M ON IT.

00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:04.961
HOW COULD THIS
HAPPEN?

00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:10.069
THE ENTIRE UNITY
SYSTEM IS DOWN!

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:11.071
Computer: VIRUS ALERT!

00:14:11.071 --> 00:14:13.174
VIRUS ALERT!

00:14:13.174 --> 00:14:16.146
Kaiba, voice-over:
BUT I SECURED THE ENTIRE NETWORK
AFTER THE LAST ATTACK.

00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:18.250
THERE'S NO WAY SOMEONE
COULD BREAK IN AGAIN,

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.490
NOT EVEN A COMPUTER GENIUS.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.194
WAS IT THAT CYBER-GEEK
REBECCA HAWKINS?

00:14:25.194 --> 00:14:28.968
NO, NOT EVEN SHE
COULD PULL OFF SOMETHING
OF THIS MAGNITUDE.

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:31.137
THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW
WHO COULD ACCOMPLISH

00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:34.577
A BRILLIANT SCHEME
LIKE THIS IS ME.

00:14:34.577 --> 00:14:39.485
WAIT...

00:14:39.485 --> 00:14:41.923
THANK YOU FOR
THE INVITATION, MR. KAIBA.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:42.991
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW,

00:14:42.991 --> 00:14:45.595
YOUR SON SETO
IS TALK OF THE TOWN,

00:14:45.595 --> 00:14:49.101
AND BELIEVE ME,
I CAN RELATE.

00:14:49.101 --> 00:14:52.172
MY SON, TOO,
IS A CHILD PRODIGY.

00:14:52.172 --> 00:14:54.777
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE ABOUT AS THRILLED
TO BE HERE AS I AM.

00:14:54.777 --> 00:14:58.851
WHATTA YOU SAY
WE SPICE THINGS UP A BIT?

00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:00.787
Woman: OH, DEAR,
THE LIGHTS
ARE FLASHING!

00:15:00.787 --> 00:15:01.923
Man: THAT'S STRANGE.

00:15:01.923 --> 00:15:04.494
THERE MUST BE A SHORT.

00:15:04.494 --> 00:15:06.096
OUR MAINFRAME
IS INFECTED, SIR.

00:15:06.096 --> 00:15:07.097
NO, THERE MUST BE
SOME MISTAKE.

00:15:07.097 --> 00:15:09.068
CHECK IT AGAIN.

00:15:09.068 --> 00:15:13.575
THE K.C. MAINFRAME
IS PROTECTED BY
A FAILSAFE SYSTEM.

00:15:13.575 --> 00:15:17.515
NO ONE CAN GET IN.

00:15:17.515 --> 00:15:20.186
LET'S JUST SAY
I DABBLE IN TECHNOLOGY.

00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:22.924
I GUESS WHEN YOU SPEND
ALL YOUR TIME ALONE

00:15:22.924 --> 00:15:26.196
YOU TEND TO TINKER
IN YOUR OWN
LITTLE PROJECTS.

00:15:26.196 --> 00:15:30.136
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS,
HERR KAIBA.

00:15:30.136 --> 00:15:32.708
Kaiba: NO, IT CAN'T BE!

00:15:37.182 --> 00:15:39.085
I GUESS NOW'S
AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY

00:15:39.085 --> 00:15:41.956
TO TRY AND GET
MY "A" GAME
BACK ON TRACK.

00:15:41.956 --> 00:15:43.926
HERE GOES.

00:15:43.926 --> 00:15:46.998
NOW I SUMMON
BRIGADIER OF LANDSTAR
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:15:50.971 --> 00:15:52.640
NEXT, I THINK
I'LL JUICE HIM UP

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.884
WITH A MAGIC CARD
KNOWN AS LANDSTAR SHOT.

00:15:58.884 --> 00:16:02.557
NOT ONLY DOES DIS CARD
GIVE MY BRIGADIER
A FANCY NEW MUSKET,

00:16:02.557 --> 00:16:06.731
IT BOOSTS HIS POWER
BY 600.

00:16:06.731 --> 00:16:09.001
A'RIGHT, LITTLE BUDDY,
SHOW 'IM WHAT YA GOT.

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:11.873
ATTACK ZIGFRIED
DIRECTLY!

00:16:11.873 --> 00:16:13.976
HOLD YOUR FIRE,
YOU LITTLE MUNCHKIN.

00:16:13.976 --> 00:16:15.713
I HAVE A TRAP.

00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:17.716
IT'S CALLED
WOTAN'S JUDGMENT,

00:16:17.716 --> 00:16:20.888
AND IT STOPS
YOUR ATTACK INSTANTLY.

00:16:20.888 --> 00:16:21.923
THAT'S BECAUSE
IT LETS ME SWITCH

00:16:21.923 --> 00:16:25.128
ANY MAGIC CARD
I HOLD IN MY HAND

00:16:25.128 --> 00:16:30.136
WITH THE TOP CARD
OF MY DECK
AND THEN RESHUFFLE.

00:16:30.136 --> 00:16:32.741
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU CONSIDER
YOUR "A" GAME,

00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:35.345
THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
LAST TOO MUCH LONGER.

00:16:41.176 --> 00:16:44.581
Zigfried: IS IT ME,
OR IS IT GETTING
HOT IN HERE?

00:16:44.581 --> 00:16:45.750
JUST MAKE YOUR MOVE,
WISE GUY.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.755
WELL, SOMEONE'S
ALL FIRED UP.

00:16:48.755 --> 00:16:51.860
PERHAPS THIS
WILL COOL YOU OFF.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.962
I PLAY POT OF GREED.

00:16:52.962 --> 00:16:57.836
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
DON'T YOU?

00:16:57.836 --> 00:17:02.344
I CAN DRAW
TWO ADDITIONAL CARDS
FROM MY DECK.

00:17:02.344 --> 00:17:05.416
NEXT, I PLAY
ERDA'S GUIDANCE.

00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:09.690
AS THE GODDESS OF KNOWLEDGE,
SHE CONTROLS THE PAST,
PRESENT, AND FUTURE.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.361
THE HAND IS THE FUTURE,
THE FIELD IS THE PRESENT,

00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:16.835
AND THE GRAVEYARD
IS THE PAST.

00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:20.040
NOW, THANKS TO
MY FRAULEIN FRIEND...

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.246
I CAN MOVE ONE CARD
FROM MY HAND
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:17:23.246 --> 00:17:27.152
AND IN EXCHANGE,
I CAN TRANSFER ONE TRAP FROM
THE GRAVE TO THE FIELD.

00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:32.094
DAT'S WEIRD.

00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:35.132
HE WENT THROUGH
ALL 'A DAT JUST TO PLAY
SOME TRAP CARD?

00:17:35.132 --> 00:17:36.468
THAT'LL DO FOR NOW.

00:17:36.468 --> 00:17:37.703
DAT'S IT?

00:17:37.703 --> 00:17:40.207
HE'S NOT EVEN GONNA
SUMMON A MONSTER?

00:17:40.207 --> 00:17:43.078
WHATEVER ZIGFRIED'S
STRATEGY IS,
I DON'T GET IT.

00:17:43.078 --> 00:17:45.983
WHAT STRATEGY?

00:17:45.983 --> 00:17:46.985
THAT'S
THE SECOND TIME

00:17:46.985 --> 00:17:50.024
HE LEFT HIMSELF
WIDE OPEN.

00:17:50.024 --> 00:17:52.027
PERHAPS ZIGFRIED
IS JUST WAITING FOR
THE RIGHT CARD,

00:17:52.027 --> 00:17:56.034
LIKE THAT MAGIC CARD
HE PLAYED IN
HIS LAST DUEL.

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:59.072
YOU MEAN THE ONE
HE USED TO BEAT REX
AND WEEVIL IN ONE TURN?

00:17:59.072 --> 00:18:01.008
OH, NO.

00:18:06.451 --> 00:18:08.721
Zigfried:
I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING,
HERR KAIBA,

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:10.023
SO ENJOY THE SHOW
WHILE YOU CAN,

00:18:10.023 --> 00:18:13.296
BECAUSE SOON IT WILL BE
CURTAINS FOR YOU.

00:18:13.296 --> 00:18:17.235
AHEM!

00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:19.005
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU NOTICED,

00:18:19.005 --> 00:18:21.309
BUT DA DUEL'S OVA HERE!

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:24.781
YOU COULD AT LEAST
HAVE THE COURTESY
TO LOOK AT ME

00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:26.719
WHEN I'M ABOUT
TO KICK YOUR BUTT,
WISE GUY.

00:18:26.719 --> 00:18:27.886
YOU'LL HAVE TO
FORGIVE ME.

00:18:27.886 --> 00:18:30.458
I FORGOT YOU WERE
STANDING THERE.

00:18:30.458 --> 00:18:34.832
BUT WITH AN OPPONENT
AS DULL AND FORGETTABLE AS YOU,
CAN YOU BLAME ME?

00:18:34.832 --> 00:18:36.735
WHAT'D YOU CALL ME?

00:18:36.735 --> 00:18:40.441
DUELING YOU IS
ABOUT AS INTERESTING
AS WATCHING GRASS GROW.

00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:43.179
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM!

00:18:43.179 --> 00:18:46.084
SO THIS DUEL'S
TOO BORING FOR YA, HUH?

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:51.092
THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO
MAKE THINGS MORE
INTERESTING, WON'T I?

00:18:51.092 --> 00:18:56.935
NOW, I SACRIFICE
MY BRIGADIER OF LANDSTAR
SO I CAN SUMMON JINZO!

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:06.050
AND THANKS TO MY JINZO'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:13.029
ALL 'A YOUR TRAP CARDS
ARE USELESS.

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:14.498
OH, NO.

00:19:14.498 --> 00:19:17.470
NOW, JINZO,
ATTACK THIS CHUMP
DIRECTLY!

00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:25.183
HOW'S DAT FOR
A LITTLE EXCITEMENT?

00:19:25.183 --> 00:19:29.256
MAYBE NOW YOU'LL
SHOW JOEY WHEELER
SOME RESPECT.

00:19:29.256 --> 00:19:34.765
I'M NOT JUST ANOTHER
PRETTY FACE.

00:19:34.765 --> 00:19:37.203
THAT'S SHOWIN' HIM,
JOEY!

00:19:37.203 --> 00:19:38.939
YOU DA MAN, DUDE!

00:19:38.939 --> 00:19:41.042
I THINK I'VE EMBARRASSED
YOU ENOUGH FOR NOW.

00:19:41.042 --> 00:19:43.279
SO GO AHEAD, ZIGGY.

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:46.518
YOU WERE MUCH BETTER OFF
WHEN I WAS IGNORING YOU,

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:48.454
BUT THAT'S OVER,

00:19:48.454 --> 00:19:50.925
BECAUSE NOW YOU'VE
GOTTEN MY ATTENTION!

00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:52.928
SO NOT ONLY
WILL I DEFEAT YOU,

00:19:52.928 --> 00:19:55.566
BUT I'LL SEND YOU
DOWN IN FLAMES,

00:19:55.566 --> 00:20:00.475
AND IT ALL BEGINS NOW.

00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:02.845
THIS CARD SHOULD
LOOK FAMILIAR.

00:20:02.845 --> 00:20:05.383
IT'S THE SAME ONE
I USED TO DEVASTATE
THE LAST TWO FOOLS.

00:20:05.383 --> 00:20:08.054
OH, NO, NOT THAT.

00:20:08.054 --> 00:20:10.358
WE WERE RIGHT.

00:20:10.358 --> 00:20:14.865
NOW I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES!

00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:35.290

HERR JOSEPH!

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.926
HA HA HA HA!

00:20:42.998 --> 00:20:47.202
Zigfried, voice-over:
AND I'M AFRAID YOUR END
IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.
