00:08:04.487 --> 00:08:06.992
THEN HERE I GO! NOW...

00:08:06.992 --> 00:08:08.027
HOLD ON!

00:08:08.027 --> 00:08:09.530
I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
COUNTING ON

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.101
YOUR SILENT
SWORDSMAN'S STRENGTH
TO INCREASE AGAIN

00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:14.605
OTHERWISE YOU'D BE
QUITE DISAPPOINTED.

00:08:14.605 --> 00:08:16.843
FOR MY SPIRIT SWORD
PREVENTS THAT!

00:08:16.843 --> 00:08:18.713
I KNOW THE RULES.

00:08:18.713 --> 00:08:24.190
NOW I SUMMON MY BLOCKEN
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.994
BUT THAT THING'S
ONLY GOT
THREE HUNDRED POINTS!

00:08:26.994 --> 00:08:28.831
WHAT IS YUGI THINKIN'?

00:08:28.831 --> 00:08:30.901
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:32.805
SO...JUST WHEN
I THOUGHT

00:08:32.805 --> 00:08:34.341
YOUR DECK OF
MINIATURE MISFITS

00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:36.178

GET ANY WORSE...

00:08:37.614 --> 00:08:41.053
NOW...LET'S TURN UP
THE HEAT SHALL WE!?

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:42.890
ALRIGHT DISGRACED MAGE...

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.859
ROAST THAT MARSHMALLON
ON YOUR STICK!

NO, I CAN'T WATCH!

00:08:46.863 --> 00:08:48.968
FINE I WILL,
BUT DO SOMETHING YUGE!

00:08:48.968 --> 00:08:51.405
COME ON!

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:54.877
AND NOW TO ELIMINATE
THE REMAINDER OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:08:54.877 --> 00:08:56.381
NOT A CHANCE!

00:08:56.381 --> 00:09:01.155
'CAUSE BLOCKEN'S ABILITY
JUST KICKED IN!

00:09:01.155 --> 00:09:02.258
WHAT'S THIS!?

00:09:02.258 --> 00:09:04.562
WHEN ONE OF MY MONSTERS
IS UNDER ATTACK,

00:09:04.562 --> 00:09:06.899
BLOCKEN STEPS IN
AND TAKES THE HIT!

00:09:12.442 --> 00:09:13.711
AWESOME!

00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:16.216
NOW DAT A MONSTER WAS SENT
TO YUGI'S GRAVEYARD

00:09:16.216 --> 00:09:18.587
BAKURA'S SPIRIT SWORD
IS DEACTIVATED!

00:09:18.587 --> 00:09:22.528
SO YUGI'S SWORDSMAN
IS BACK IN PLAY!

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:24.765
AS USUAL YOU PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE A CLUE!

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:26.000

IN A BATTLE...

00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:32.713
THAT MONSTER GOES
BACK TO THE PLAYER'S DECK,

00:09:32.713 --> 00:09:34.349
NOT TO HIS GRAVE!

00:09:34.349 --> 00:09:37.354
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOUR SWORDSMAN
IS STILL TRAPPED!

00:09:37.354 --> 00:09:39.558
OH NO!
IF THIS KEEPS UP

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:40.960

HA HA HA!

00:09:56.088 --> 00:09:58.525
THAT'S THE WORST DECK
I'VE EVER SEEN!

THREE CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:06.674
THAT ENDS MY TURN!

00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:08.978
NOW IF YOU WERE
A MILLENNIUM ITEM...

00:10:08.978 --> 00:10:10.881
WHERE WOULD YOU BE?

00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:12.283
RIGHT THERE!

00:11:00.434 --> 00:11:03.172
OH!
EE! HE LOST!

00:11:03.172 --> 00:11:05.743

[SQUEAKING]

00:11:06.945 --> 00:11:10.185
I ACTIVATED MY LENGARD'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:11:10.185 --> 00:11:12.121
WHENEVER ONE OF
MY MONSTERS IS DAMAGED,

00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:14.793
THE RESULT IS AUTOMATICALLY
TRANSFERRED TO LENGARD!

00:11:14.793 --> 00:11:17.632
SO MY LIFE POINTS
ARE SAFE!

00:11:17.632 --> 00:11:19.201
AND NOW THAT
ONE OF MY MONSTERS

00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:20.370
WAS SENT TO
THE GRAVEYARD,

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.175

IS FREE!

WHENEVER IT'S DESTROYED,

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.402
I CAN AVOID LOSING
ANY LIFE POINTS

00:11:56.402 --> 00:11:59.039
BY RETURNING MY
ENTIRE HAND TO MY DECK.

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:00.409
OH GREAT.

NOW THEY'LL NEVER
ESCAPE FROM THIS TOMB!

WHICH MEANS THE PHARAOH WILL
NEVER LEARN HIS TRUE NAME.

00:12:08.857 --> 00:12:12.029
I NEED TO STAY FOCUSED
AND NEVER GIVE UP
NO MATTER WHAT!

00:12:12.029 --> 00:12:15.169

HE'D SAY THE SAME THING.

EACH ONE OF THESE
TWO PRECIOUS PLAYMATES

ABSORBED BY THE SHADOWS

00:16:19.241 --> 00:16:21.344
JUST LIKE
KARIM AND SHADA...

00:16:21.344 --> 00:16:24.015
BUT THERE IS A WAY
TO RESCUE THEM!

00:16:24.015 --> 00:16:25.552
HOW?

00:16:25.552 --> 00:16:28.624
BY DEFEATING ZORC.

00:16:28.624 --> 00:16:30.260
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.731
I'M BUYING
SOME MORE TIME.

00:16:32.731 --> 00:16:36.404
BEFORE SHADA,
I WAS THE GUARDIAN OF
THE MILLENNIUM KEY.

00:16:36.404 --> 00:16:38.174
BE CAREFUL.

00:16:38.174 --> 00:16:39.677
I'LL DO WHAT I MUST.

00:16:39.677 --> 00:16:41.213
NOW TAKE THESE
TO THE KING.

00:16:41.213 --> 00:16:44.051
[SNIFFLES] RIGHT!

00:16:44.051 --> 00:16:46.522
[PANTING]

00:16:46.522 --> 00:16:50.329
PLEASE GRANT THIS OLD MAN
STRENGTH ONE LAST TIME...

00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:52.700
IN THE NAME OF THE PHARAOH.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.407
AND NOW...WITH THE POWER OF
THE SACRED MILLENNIUM KEY...

00:16:56.407 --> 00:16:59.045
I CALL UPON
THE FORBIDDEN ONE!

00:17:01.582 --> 00:17:03.320
[ROARING]

00:17:13.638 --> 00:17:18.447
BEHOLD...THE GREAT
DEFENDER OF EGYPT...EXODIA!

00:17:40.382 --> 00:17:42.352
[ROARING]

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:44.690
[ALL CHEERING]

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.559
IT'S THE FORBIDDEN ONE!

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:48.028
A BEAST SO POWERFUL

00:17:48.028 --> 00:17:50.133
IT WAS ABLE TO DEFEAT
AN ARMY OF THOUSANDS

00:17:50.133 --> 00:17:51.468
IN A SINGLE NIGHT.

00:17:51.468 --> 00:17:52.704
EXODIA!

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:55.308
Shimon: HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR YOU, OLD FRIEND,

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:57.279
THIS LAND WOULD
SURELY HAVE FALLEN

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:59.750
AT THE HANDS OF ITS ENEMIES.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.720
DUE TO YOUR INCREDIBLE STRENGTH

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.957
I SEALED YOU WITHIN
FIVE STONE TABLETS,

00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:06.495
VOWING NEVER
TO RELEASE YOU AGAIN.

00:18:06.495 --> 00:18:08.933
NOW I LIFT THAT SEAL!

00:18:17.114 --> 00:18:21.489
[ROARING]

00:18:21.489 --> 00:18:27.199
[ALL CHEERING]

00:18:27.199 --> 00:18:29.036
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:18:29.036 --> 00:18:31.006
IT'S AS POWERFUL
AS ZORC!

00:18:31.006 --> 00:18:32.309
LET'S HOPE!

00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:37.918
[PANTING]

00:18:37.918 --> 00:18:40.456
[LAUGHS]

00:18:40.456 --> 00:18:41.859
EXODIA!

00:18:41.859 --> 00:18:44.730
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO OVERPOWER ME!?

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.267
YOU DRAW YOUR STRENGTH

00:18:46.267 --> 00:18:49.038
FROM THE LIFE FORCE
OF A SINGLE HUMAN.

00:18:49.038 --> 00:18:52.979
MY POWER IS DERIVED FROM
THE VERY DARKNESS ITSELF!

00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:54.681
IS THAT SO!?

00:18:54.681 --> 00:19:00.926
WELL OBSERVE WHAT
"THE LIFE FORCE OF
A SINGLE HUMAN" CAN DO!

00:19:00.926 --> 00:19:03.464
ALRIGHT.
TAKE THIS!

00:19:03.464 --> 00:19:07.639
EXODIA, OBLITERATE!

00:19:07.639 --> 00:19:08.874
SHIMON!

00:19:08.874 --> 00:19:14.517
CAN HE TRULY
DEFEAT ZORC?

00:19:14.517 --> 00:19:17.690
EXODIA...BURN THROUGH
THE DARKNESS.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:21.864
I IMPLORE THEE...
WITH EVERY OUNCE OF
MY SPIRIT!

00:19:21.864 --> 00:19:23.968
THERE IS NOT A CREATURE
IN EXISTENCE

00:19:23.968 --> 00:19:25.837
THAT CAN OVERCOME ME!

00:19:25.837 --> 00:19:28.409
MY POWER IS INFINITE!

00:19:28.409 --> 00:19:31.648
[ROARING]

00:19:31.648 --> 00:19:33.652
UHH.

00:19:38.293 --> 00:19:40.397
UHH.

00:19:40.397 --> 00:19:46.074
PHARAOH...
I FAILED YOU. UHH.

00:19:46.074 --> 00:19:47.544
NO. SHIMON.

00:19:47.544 --> 00:19:49.881
I'M AFRAID SO.

00:19:49.881 --> 00:19:50.882
PHARAOH!

00:19:50.882 --> 00:19:53.487
OPPOSING ME IS FUTILE!

00:19:53.487 --> 00:19:56.627
I AM THE EMBODIMENT OF
PURE DARKNESS...

00:19:56.627 --> 00:19:58.864
AND AS YOUR WORLD
IS ENVELOPED
BY THE SHADOWS

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.101
MY POWER SHALL GROW!

00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:04.007
NOW KNEEL BEFORE
YOUR NEW MASTER!!

00:20:04.007 --> 00:20:05.876
NO! THE LIGHT OF HOPE

00:20:05.876 --> 00:20:08.447
STILL SHINES UPON
THE PEOPLE OF EGYPT!

00:20:08.447 --> 00:20:12.021
AND THAT LIGHT
CAN ILLUMINATE EVEN
THE DARKEST OF SHADOWS!

00:20:12.021 --> 00:20:13.590
[PANTING] PHARAOH!

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.329
MANA!

00:20:16.329 --> 00:20:17.398
TAKE THIS.

00:20:17.398 --> 00:20:19.000
YOU FOUND MY PUZZLE!

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.403
ISIS AND SHIMON

00:20:20.403 --> 00:20:22.407
SURRENDERED THEIR SPIRITS
TO THE SHADOW REALM

00:20:22.407 --> 00:20:23.909
SO I COULD
BRING IT TO YOU.

00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:27.449
I ASSURE YOU THEIR ACTIONS
WILL NOT BE IN VAIN.

00:20:35.463 --> 00:20:36.799
[ROARING]

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:39.211
ZORC! I FACE YOU
NOT ALONE

00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:40.412
BUT WITH THE SPIRITS
OF THOSE

00:20:40.412 --> 00:20:43.182
WHO GAVE UP SO MUCH
TO RESTORE PEACE!

00:20:43.182 --> 00:20:45.084
IN THE NAME OF
THE PEOPLE OF EGYPT

00:20:45.084 --> 00:20:46.885
I SHALL PREVAIL!
