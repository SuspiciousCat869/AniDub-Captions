00:08:59.637 --> 00:09:01.874
IT'S PANTHER WARRIOR.

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:04.647
LOOKS LIKE I'M RIGHT!

00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:08.287
AWWW, PARTING IS SUCH
SWEET SORROW, ISN'T IT?

00:09:08.287 --> 00:09:09.590
[CHUCKLING]

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.596
FIRST HE TOOK OUT JINZO,
AND NOW IT'S PANTHER WARRIOR?

00:09:12.596 --> 00:09:14.967
BUT THOSE ARE JOEY'S
BEST MONSTERS!

00:09:14.967 --> 00:09:16.570
NOT ANYMORE.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.109
I THINK I'VE DONE
ENOUGH DAMAGE.

00:09:19.109 --> 00:09:20.811
SO GO.

00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:22.949
AND IF YOU COULD,
STEP IT UP A BIT.

00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:24.118
I'M GETTING BORED.

00:09:24.118 --> 00:09:25.588
IT'S OFFICIAL.

00:09:25.588 --> 00:09:27.892
HE IS THE MOST
ANNOYING OPPONENT
I'VE EVER FACED.

00:09:27.892 --> 00:09:29.461
NOW LOOK OUT--

00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:33.036
HOLD ON!
I ALMOST FORGOT
ABOUT MY GIFT!

00:09:33.036 --> 00:09:34.271
HUH? YOUR WHAT!?

00:09:34.271 --> 00:09:36.776
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
ABOUT THE RING I GAVE YOU?

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:40.082
IT ALLOWS YOU TO DRAW
AN EXTRA CARD EACH TURN.

00:09:40.082 --> 00:09:42.420
ANY REASON WHY
YOU'RE HELPIN' ME?

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.760
WELL, IT ALSO PREVENTS
THE MONSTER WEARING IT
FROM ATTACKING.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.663
[CHUCKLING]

00:09:47.663 --> 00:09:49.701
HOW'D I GUESS?

00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:51.771
ANYWAY,
ON WITH THE DUEL!

00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:53.107
NOW WHERE WAS I!?

00:09:53.107 --> 00:09:55.713
GETTING INTERCEPTED
BY ME AGAIN!

00:09:55.713 --> 00:09:56.781
HUH?

00:09:56.781 --> 00:09:57.883
YOU'VE ACTIVATED
THE CURSE!

00:09:57.883 --> 00:09:58.952
CURSE!?

00:09:58.952 --> 00:10:01.590
THE CURSE
OF NIBELUNG'S RING.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.563
IF EITHER OF THE TWO CARDS
YOU JUST DREW IS A MONSTER,

00:10:04.563 --> 00:10:07.302
THE RING FORCES YOU
TO SEND IT STRAIGHT
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:08.938
WAIT, HOLD ON!

00:10:08.938 --> 00:10:10.775
THERE'S NO NEED
TO CHECK.

00:10:10.775 --> 00:10:14.215
THANKS TO MY GODDESSES,
I ALREADY KNOW YOU DREW
A MONSTER!

00:10:14.215 --> 00:10:16.887
NAMELY, KNIGHT
OF DARK DRAGON!

00:10:16.887 --> 00:10:18.056
YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:19.525
YES.

00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:23.031
NOW OFF TO
THE GRAVE IT GOES.

00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:27.408
HE'S ELIMINATING
JOEY'S BEST MONSTERS
ONE BY ONE!

00:10:27.408 --> 00:10:30.413
I HAVE A FEELING THAT'S
BEEN ZIGFRIED'S STRATEGY

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:32.483
SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THE DUEL!

00:10:32.483 --> 00:10:34.821
HE'S USING HIS MAGIC RING
AND HIS THREE GODDESSES

00:10:34.821 --> 00:10:38.228
TO DISMANTLE JOEY'S DECK
ONE CARD AT A TIME!

00:10:47.508 --> 00:10:49.646
[THINKING]
THANKS TO THOSE
THREE GODDESSES 'A HIS,

00:10:49.646 --> 00:10:52.852
ZIGFRIED KNOWS
WHAT CARD I'M GONNA
DRAW BEFORE I DO!

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.556
BUT NOT FOR LONG!

00:10:54.556 --> 00:11:00.300
I ACTIVATE DANGEROUS
MACHINE TYPE-6!

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.604
THIS SHOULD KEEP
THINGS INTERESTING.

00:11:02.604 --> 00:11:04.875
SEE, I'M GONNA GIVE
THIS LITTLE GADGET
A SPIN

00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:06.779
BEFORE EACH ONE
'A MY TURNS.

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:09.484
AND WHAT IT DOES TO YOU
DEPENDS ON WHAT NUMBERS
COME UP.

00:11:09.484 --> 00:11:12.924
SO YOU'RE DEPENDING
ON LADY LUCK TO WIN
THIS DUEL FOR YOU.

00:11:12.924 --> 00:11:16.164
WELL, I GUESS
YOU CAN'T DEPEND
ON SKILL NOW, CAN YOU?

00:11:16.164 --> 00:11:19.270
IT TOOK MORE
THAN LUCK TO GET ME
WHERE I AM TODAY.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.739
AND I'M ABOUT
TO PROVE IT!

00:11:20.739 --> 00:11:23.845
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
MY MOVE.

00:11:23.845 --> 00:11:26.517
THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU SHOW ME
YOUR TOP THREE CARDS.

00:11:26.517 --> 00:11:29.689
EXCELLENT. NOW PLACE
THE SECOND CARD ON TOP.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.861

00:11:31.861 --> 00:11:33.797
NOW TO GUESS
YOUR TOP CARD.

00:11:33.797 --> 00:11:37.004
I'LL SAY GOBLIN
ATTACK FORCE.

00:11:37.004 --> 00:11:41.112
LOOKS LIKE LADY LUCK'S
ON MY SIDE.

00:11:41.112 --> 00:11:43.516
Yugi: IF HE DOESN'T
STOP ZIGFRIED SOON,

00:11:43.516 --> 00:11:45.520
HE'LL RUN OUT
OF MONSTERS!

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.662
Zigfried: I PLACE THIS
FACE DOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:11:49.662 --> 00:11:51.098
YA THINK
YOU'RE SO COOL?

00:11:51.098 --> 00:11:52.267
WATCH THIS!

00:11:52.267 --> 00:11:53.770
AH, AH, AH.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.976
THANKS TO MY RING,
THAT MONSTER IN YOUR HAND
IS DESTROYED!

00:11:56.976 --> 00:11:58.613
DAT MAY BE TRUE...

00:11:58.613 --> 00:12:01.786
BUT NOW IT'S TIME
TO GIVE THE OLD
ONE-ARMED BANDIT A SPIN

00:12:01.786 --> 00:12:03.455
AND SEE
WHERE THINGS LAND!

00:12:03.455 --> 00:12:06.061

YES!

00:12:07.463 --> 00:12:10.836
LOOKS LIKE I CAN
ACTIVATE SPECIAL EFFECT
NUMBER THREE.

00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:16.180
THIS LETS ME DRAW
AN EXTRA CARD, SO NOW

THAT SCRAWNY SWORDSMAN
CAN'T POSSIBLY GET PAST
THIS CARD!

00:12:31.342 --> 00:12:32.644
WHAT'S THAT?

00:12:32.644 --> 00:12:34.715
IT'S MY LOGE'S FLAME TRAP,

00:12:34.715 --> 00:12:36.719
AND AS LONG
AS IT STAYS IN PLAY,

00:12:36.719 --> 00:12:39.725
MONSTERS WITH 2,000 POINTS
OR FEWER CAN'T ATTACK ME!

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:42.631
OH, WELL.

AND YET ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS DISAPPEARS,

00:13:53.368 --> 00:13:56.307
THIS SEEMS LIKE
A GOOD TIME TO PLAY

WHEN IT'S TAKEN
OFF THE FIELD,

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:39.639
WHICH ALLOWS ME TO DRAW
ONE MORE CARD FORM MY DECK.

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:42.779
PLUS, WHEN MY LOGE'S FLAME
LEAVES THE FIELD,

IS MULTIPLIED BY 200
AND ADDED TO HIS
ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:21.938 --> 00:17:23.875
I'VE EMBARRASSED YOU
ENOUGH,

00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:26.814
SO I'LL PLACE THIS
FACE DOWN AND CALL IT
QUITS!

00:17:26.814 --> 00:17:30.521
WITH ONLY 100 POINTS
LEFT, THIS IS
YOUR LAST SHOT!

00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:31.623
NICE COMEBACK, DUDE!

00:17:31.623 --> 00:17:32.792
YOU ROCK!

00:17:32.792 --> 00:17:33.794
GOOD JOB!

00:17:33.794 --> 00:17:36.131
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:39.772
YOU SHOULD HAVE ENDED
THIS DUEL WHEN YOU HAD
THE CHANCE.

00:17:39.772 --> 00:17:42.277
NOW PREPARE
TO PAY THE PRICE!

00:17:46.615 --> 00:17:48.786
THIS DUEL'S GONE
ON LONG ENOUGH!

00:17:48.786 --> 00:17:51.325
SO...I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD

00:17:51.325 --> 00:17:53.696
ENCHANTED SWORD NOTHUNG!

00:17:53.696 --> 00:17:59.106
IT RAISES BRUNHILDE'S
ATTACK POINTS BY 400!

00:17:59.106 --> 00:18:01.879
ACCORDING TO
THE LEGEND OF NOTHUNG,

00:18:01.879 --> 00:18:04.150
IT WAS THE WORLD'S
GREATEST DRAGON-SLAYER!

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.020
SAY WHAT!?
IT'S TRUE.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.258
WITH ONE FELL SWOOP,

00:18:08.258 --> 00:18:11.764
THIS SWORD CAN REMOVE
EVERY SINGLE DRAGON FROM PLAY!

00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:19.679
NEXT I PLAY MY FINAL CARD
AND THE KEY TO MY VICTORY!

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:22.619
RAINBOW BRIDGE BIFROST!

00:18:22.619 --> 00:18:25.524
SO MY VALKYRIE GAINS
500 ATTACK POINTS

00:18:25.524 --> 00:18:28.029
FOR EVERY MONSTER
I REMOVED FROM THE GAME!

00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:30.000
NOW I GET IT!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.772
HE'S BEEN PLANNING THIS
FROM THE BEGINNING!

00:18:32.772 --> 00:18:35.810
THAT'S WHY ZIGFRIED REMOVED
ALL OF JOEY'S MONSTERS!

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.451
TO POWER-UP HIS OWN!

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:41.889
Yami-Yugi: NOW HIS VALKYRIE
IS STRONG ENOUGH

00:18:41.889 --> 00:18:46.866
TO WIPE OUT
JOEY'S LIFE POINTS!

00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:48.770
HOLD YOUR HORSEY!

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.608
I PLAY COMPENSATION
MEDIATION!

00:18:51.608 --> 00:18:54.781
SO...YOU'RE RELYING
ON LUCK AGAIN?

00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:56.851
LOOK, PAL, I THINK
YOU'RE SCARED

00:18:56.851 --> 00:18:58.922
'CAUSE I NEVER LOSE
AT THESE THINGS!

00:18:58.922 --> 00:19:01.493
NOW CHOOSE ANY TWO CARDS
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD

00:19:01.493 --> 00:19:05.134
AND SHUFFLE 'EM TOGETHER
WITH MY MEDIATION
TRAP CARD!

00:19:05.134 --> 00:19:08.040
Joey: THEN I GET
TO PICK ONE CARD.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.845
AND IF I CHOOSE MINE,
I'M SAVED!

00:19:10.845 --> 00:19:12.749
YES,
AND SHOULD YOU FAIL,

00:19:12.749 --> 00:19:17.291
THEN I WIN THE DUEL!

00:19:17.291 --> 00:19:19.796
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.

00:19:19.796 --> 00:19:22.601
AND THE CARD
I PICK IS...

00:19:22.601 --> 00:19:28.145
THE MIDDLE ONE!

00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:32.554
OH, NO!

00:19:32.554 --> 00:19:35.493
HMM. IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR LUCK HAS RUN OUT.

00:19:35.493 --> 00:19:39.167
NOW, HILDE, MY DEAR,
END THIS DUEL!

00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:47.750
OH!
OH!
OH!

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.186
NO WAY!

00:19:49.186 --> 00:19:51.724
THIS CAN'T BE!
HE LOST!

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:53.161
[GROANS]

00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:54.897
HERR JOSEPH,

00:19:54.897 --> 00:19:58.170
SOME THINGS IN LIFE
JUST NEVER CHANGE.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.344
A ROSE IS A ROSE,
AND A LOSER IS A LOSER.

00:20:02.344 --> 00:20:07.087
Rolan: AND THE WINNER OF
THIS BOUT IS ZIGFRIED LLOYD!

00:20:07.087 --> 00:20:12.231
AND WITH THAT, THE GRAND
CHAMPIONSHIP IS DOWN TO
ITS FINAL FOUR DUELISTS!

00:20:12.231 --> 00:20:14.468
Tristan:
BIG DEAL.

00:20:14.468 --> 00:20:16.071
SO YOU BLEW
THE ENTIRE
TOURNAMENT

00:20:16.071 --> 00:20:17.875
ON A LOUSY GAME
OF CHANCE.

00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:20.179
I GUESS YOU MUST'VE
JUST RUN OUT OF LUCK.

00:20:20.179 --> 00:20:21.281
NAH.

00:20:21.281 --> 00:20:22.952
JOEY WINS
HIS DUELS
WITH TALENT,

00:20:22.952 --> 00:20:24.421
NOT WITH
LUCK, GUYS.

00:20:24.421 --> 00:20:26.959
Tristan: OH, SO JOEY
DIDN'T LOSE 'CAUSE
HE HAS NO LUCK...

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:28.863
HE LOST 'CAUSE
HE HAS NO TALENT.

00:20:28.863 --> 00:20:31.335
SO DAT'S HOW YOU
CHEER ME UP!?

00:20:31.335 --> 00:20:34.340
THEN IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO SPREAD A LITTLE CHEER
'A MY OWN!

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.212
[ALL LAUGHING]
Joey: COME HERE, YOU!
IF I GET MY HANDS--

00:20:37.212 --> 00:20:39.316
[THINKING]
JOEY DID A GREAT JOB.

00:20:39.316 --> 00:20:41.287
AND SOONER OR LATER,
HE'S GONNA LEARN

00:20:41.287 --> 00:20:42.956
TO CONTROL
THAT TEMPER OF HIS.

00:20:42.956 --> 00:20:44.660
PROBABLY "LATER."

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.836
I TELL YA...I GET
NO RESPECT AT ALL!

00:20:46.836 --> 00:20:49.105
[LAUGHTER CONTINUING]
