PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:07.045
THE BATTLE TO DETERMINE
THEIR DESTINIES WILL NOW BEGIN.

00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:08.815
[THINKING]
THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME IN MY LIFE

00:00:08.815 --> 00:00:11.254
THAT I'VE HOPED
FOR MY OPPONENT'S VICTORY.

00:00:11.254 --> 00:00:14.963
BUT IN ORDER FOR THIS DUEL
TO TRULY TEST OUR READINESS
TO SEPARATE,

00:00:14.963 --> 00:00:18.303
I MUST FIGHT WITH ALL
MY STRENGTH.

00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:20.074
Both: LET'S DUEL!

00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:22.947
NOW I SACRIFICE 3
OF MY TOKENS,

00:00:22.947 --> 00:00:27.224
SO I CAN PLAY OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR!

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:29.161
I'LL TAKE THINGS
FROM HERE!

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.835
FIRST I'LL PLACE
THESE 3 CARDS
FACE DOWN.

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:35.142
AND THEN I SUMMON
MY SILENT SWORDSMAN
TO THE FIELD!

00:00:35.142 --> 00:00:36.479
NOT SO FAST!

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:38.951
I'M TAKING THIS DUEL
TO THE NEXT LEVEL!

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:41.991
SO I SUMMON SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON!

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:43.828
[ROARING]

00:00:43.828 --> 00:00:46.669
BEHOLD THE THIRD
EGYPTIAN GOD!

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:48.874
WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:55.655

BUT I'M NOT DONE YET.

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:18.206
NEXT I PLAY POT OF GREED!

00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:22.682
THIS ALLOWS ME TO TAKE
TWO CARDS FROM MY DECK
AND ADD THEM TO MY HAND.

[ROARING]

00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:27.159
Mokuba:
HOW'S YUGI GONNA GET
OUTTA THIS MESS?

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.830
THERE'S NO WAY!

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.903
YEAH, THAT DORK IS
DEFINITELY IN OVER
HIS HEAD.

00:02:31.903 --> 00:02:33.942
I CAN TELL YOU THIS MUCH.

00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:37.751
DUELING THE PHARAOH IS
TRULY THE ULTIMATE TEST
OF YUGI'S SKILLS.

00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:39.021
INCREDIBLE.

00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:41.293
YES, SINCE REGAINING
HIS ANCIENT MEMORIES,

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.631
THE PHARAOH IS STRONGER
THAN EVER.

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:46.203
JOEY?
WHAT'S YUGI GONNA DO?

00:02:46.203 --> 00:02:48.207
I DON'T KNOW, TEA,
'CAUSE EVEN THOUGH

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:51.014
HIS TRAP CARD WEAKENED
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR'S
ATTACK STRENGTH,

00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:55.491
DAT BIG BRUTE STILL HAS
2,500 POINTS!

00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:58.064
Mokuba: AND DON'T FORGET
ABOUT SLIFER.

00:02:58.064 --> 00:02:59.701
ONE LIGHTNING BLAST,

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:03.543
AND YUGI'S MONSTER TAKES
2,000 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:03:03.543 --> 00:03:05.314
AND WORST OF ALL,

00:03:05.314 --> 00:03:09.123
IF THE PHARAOH ACTIVATES
THE SPECIAL ABILITY OF
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA,

00:03:09.123 --> 00:03:14.736
HE CAN RAISE
ITS ATTACK POINTS
TO ALMOST 15,000!

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.776
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
BRAIN SURGERY HERE, FOLKS.

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:21.183
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
THAT ONLY ONE OF
THE TWO YUGI TWINS

00:03:21.183 --> 00:03:24.357
INHERITED THE DUELING
SKILLS, SO WHY EVEN WATCH?

00:03:24.357 --> 00:03:26.229
Kaiba: LOOKS LIKE HIS
LITTLE SECRET IS OUT.

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.801
YUGI CAN'T DUEL HIS WAY
OUT OF A PAPER BAG,

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:34.915
SO HE GOT HIS LOOK-ALIKE
TO DUEL FOR HIM.

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:36.585
GET BACK HERE,
RICH BOY!

00:03:36.585 --> 00:03:38.891
DIS DUEL AIN'T OVA
'TIL IT'S OVA!

00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:40.161
JOEY'S RIGHT!

00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:42.933
YEAH, HOW 'BOUT SHOWING
A LITTLE RESPECT?

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:46.642
DO YOU LOSERS HONESTLY
BELIEVE THAT YUGI
CAN STILL WIN?

00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:48.078
YOU BET!

00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:50.217
THEN ANSWER ME THIS!

00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:53.424
WHAT POSSIBLE
COMBINATION OF CARDS
WOULD YOU USE

00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:56.598
TO DEFEAT ALL 3
EGYPTIAN GODS?

00:03:56.598 --> 00:03:58.302
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:00.207
I REST MY CASE.

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:02.277
YOU'RE AS CLUELESS
AS YUGI IS.

00:04:02.277 --> 00:04:06.119
LOOK, PAL, I MAY NOT
HAVE THE ANSWER,
BUT THERE IS ONE!

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:08.325
COME ON, MARIK,
YOU'RE THE EXPERT HERE.

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:10.630
WHAT'S THEIR WEAKNESS?

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.069
Marik: WELL, INDIVIDUALLY
THEY HAVE DRAWBACKS,

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.606
BUT WHEN ALL 3
ARE TOGETHER,

00:04:14.606 --> 00:04:16.677
THEY'RE PRACTICALLY
INDESTRUCTIBLE.

00:04:16.677 --> 00:04:20.419
Ishizu: ONLY FATE CAN DECIDE
THE OUTCOME OF THIS RITUAL.

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.393
IF YUGI IS UNABLE
TO DEFEAT HIS ALTER EGO,

00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:26.734
THEN THE TWO ARE NOT YET
MEANT TO SEPARATE
FROM ONE ANOTHER.

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:29.406
IF THIS OCCURS,
THE PHARAOH WILL
BE TRAPPED HERE

00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:31.378
FOR ANOTHER
5,000 YEARS.

00:04:31.378 --> 00:04:33.283
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

00:04:33.283 --> 00:04:35.053
[THINKING]
I'M SO CONFUSED.

00:04:35.053 --> 00:04:36.957
I WANT THE PHARAOH
TO STAY,

00:04:36.957 --> 00:04:40.899
BUT NOT IF IT MEANS
TRAPPING HIM
AGAINST HIS WILL.

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:43.906
COME ON, MOKUBA.

00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:45.610
FINE! GO!

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.615
HEY, PHARAOH.

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:50.422
IF YOU END UP HAVING
TO STICK AROUND FOR
A FEW MORE YEARS,

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:52.359
THERE IS
A BRIGHT SIDE.

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:55.767
THE TWO OF US CAN
FINALLY HAVE
THAT REMATCH.

00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:59.241
AND BY THE LOOKS
OF THIS DUEL, YOU'RE
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

00:04:59.241 --> 00:05:02.182
Yami-Yugi:
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

00:05:02.182 --> 00:05:04.621
[GROWLING]

00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:06.626

00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:08.563
Yugi: KAIBA, WAIT!

00:05:08.563 --> 00:05:10.100
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.942
I THOUGHT YOU'D
LOVE THE CHANCE
TO WATCH ME LOSE, RIGHT?

00:05:13.942 --> 00:05:15.012
WRONG.

00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:16.949
I ONLY WANT TO SEE
YOU GET CRUSHED

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.021
IF I'M DOING
THE CRUSHING.

00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:23.598
YOU OWE IT TO
THE PHARAOH TO STAY.

00:05:23.598 --> 00:05:25.135
PLEASE, TAKE THIS.

00:05:25.135 --> 00:05:26.838
MY KING!

00:05:26.838 --> 00:05:30.614
IT IS YOU
WHO IS NOW KING.

00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:33.854
Yugi: YOU HAVE A BOND
THAT GOES BACK
THOUSANDS OF YEARS!

00:05:33.854 --> 00:05:39.133
AND YOU SHOULD BE HERE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO HIM
WHEN HE LOSES!

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:42.174
WHAT? YOU CAN'T
BE SERIOUS!

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:44.879
Yugi:
MORE SERIOUS THAN I'VE
EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE.

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:48.989
THOSE EGYPTIAN GODS MAY
BE STRONG, BUT THEY'RE
NOT UNDEFEATABLE,

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:52.062
AND I'M GONNA TAKE THEM
DOWN ONE BY ONE.

00:05:52.062 --> 00:05:53.365
YOU'RE NUTS!

00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:57.776
WOW.
COOL.

00:05:57.776 --> 00:06:01.217
NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I HAVE MYSELF
A DUEL TO WIN.

00:06:01.217 --> 00:06:04.090
I'M PROUD OF YOU, YUGI.
WELL DONE.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.660
COME ON.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.601
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A STRATEGY

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:11.941
IN MIND FOR
DEFEATING ALL 3
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS?

00:06:11.941 --> 00:06:13.311
MM-HMM.

00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:17.020
FINE. THEN THIS
I GOT TO SEE.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.125
AND WHEN YOU FAIL
MISERABLY,

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:22.266
I'LL STEP IN AND
SHOW YOU WHAT REAL
DUELING'S ALL ABOUT!

00:06:22.266 --> 00:06:24.303
ALL RIGHT.

00:06:24.303 --> 00:06:25.640
READY, YUGI?

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.645
READY, PHARAOH.

00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:30.317
[ROARING]

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.703
[THINKING]
IT WON'T BE EASY,

00:06:40.703 --> 00:06:44.478
BUT I NEED TO DEFEAT
ALL 3 EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS.

00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:49.556
[ALL ROARING]

00:06:49.556 --> 00:06:52.831
IT'S THE ONLY WAY FOR ME
TO PASS THIS TEST

00:06:52.831 --> 00:06:57.074
AND FREE THE PHARAOH
BY PROVING THAT I'M
READY TO BE ON MY OWN.

00:06:57.074 --> 00:06:59.814
EVER SINCE OUR SPIRITS
JOINED TOGETHER,

00:06:59.814 --> 00:07:04.090
I'VE ALWAYS LET
THE PHARAOH TAKE THE
LEAD DURING OUR DUELS.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.500
BUT EVERY OBSTACLE
WE FACED TOGETHER
PUSHED ME TO TRY HARDER.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.006
AND I ALWAYS KNEW
THAT SOMEDAY

00:07:11.006 --> 00:07:13.511
I'D BE GOOD ENOUGH
TO WALK BY HIS SIDE.

00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:15.650
I JUST HOPE
THAT DAY'S TODAY.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.823
YUGI, I CAN SEE
THE UNCERTAINTY IN YOUR EYES,

00:07:18.823 --> 00:07:21.062
AND IF YOU EXPECT
TO WIN THIS DUEL,

00:07:21.062 --> 00:07:24.937
YOU MUST FIRST OVERCOME
YOUR SELF-DOUBT.

00:07:24.937 --> 00:07:27.644
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHY FATE
BROUGHT US TOGETHER,

00:07:27.644 --> 00:07:30.083
SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN
TO TRUST IN YOURSELF

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:33.490
AND BE THE DUELIST
THAT YOU TRULY ARE INSIDE,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.101
AND SO THAT I COULD LEARN
FROM YOU!

00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:39.571
YA KNOW WHAT?

00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:42.077
WHAT THE PHARAOH'S SAYING
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

00:07:42.077 --> 00:07:45.150
I WOULDN'T BE WHO I AM
WITHOUT YOU.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.227
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT YOU TAUGHT ME WHEN I WAS
BUILDING MY DECK.

00:07:49.227 --> 00:07:52.568
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I
DID WHEN I BUILT MINE.

00:07:52.568 --> 00:07:54.873
YOU TAUGHT ME
ABOUT BRAVERY

00:07:54.873 --> 00:07:56.777
AND ABOUT HAVING
SELF-CONFIDENCE

00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:58.849
EVEN WHEN ALL HOPE
SEEMS LOST,

00:07:58.849 --> 00:08:01.989
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
WITH EVERY CARD
THAT I PICKED.

00:08:01.989 --> 00:08:04.294
AND YOU TAUGHT ME
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP

00:08:04.294 --> 00:08:07.101
AND HAVING COMPASSION
FOR OTHERS.

00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:08.772
IN DUELIST KINGDOM,

00:08:08.772 --> 00:08:11.945
YOU SHOWED ME
THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN WINNING,

00:08:11.945 --> 00:08:16.790
LIKE THE SAFETY
OF A FRIEND.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.363
EACH OF US HAS GIVEN
THE OTHER A GIFT.

00:08:19.363 --> 00:08:21.167
LIKE BRAVERY.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.140
YES, AND KINDNESS,
SYMPATHY, AND HEART.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.782
WOW! SO EVEN THOUGH OUR
MINDS HAVE SEPARATED,

00:08:27.782 --> 00:08:30.688
EACH OF US HAS
MAINTAINED THE OTHER
ONE'S STRENGTHS.

00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:34.665
AND THOSE STRENGTHS
ARE REPRESENTED
IN OUR DECKS,

00:08:34.665 --> 00:08:37.037
SO WE'RE PRETTY
EVENLY MATCHED!

00:08:37.037 --> 00:08:38.540
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.480
[THINKING]
THAT WAS JUST THE KIND
OF PEP TALK I NEEDED.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.685
I HAFTA ADMIT,
PART OF ME WAS WORRIED

00:08:43.685 --> 00:08:45.723
THAT THE SIDES OF
THIS DUEL WERE UNEVEN.

00:08:45.723 --> 00:08:47.360
BUT NOW I REALIZE

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.969
THAT EVEN THOUGH
THE PHARAOH HAS ALL 3
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS,

00:08:50.969 --> 00:08:53.908
I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED
TO STOP THEM!

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.915
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

00:08:56.915 --> 00:08:59.522
PHARAOH, I BELIEVE
IT'S MY MOVE.

00:08:59.522 --> 00:09:01.392
THAT'S RIGHT. NOW GO.

00:09:01.392 --> 00:09:03.931
DON'T MIND IF I DO!

00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:05.434
SWEET!
NICE!

00:09:05.434 --> 00:09:07.306
DO YOUR GRAMPS PROUD,
YUGI!

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:09.778
FIRST OF ALL, SINCE
IT'S MY TURN AGAIN,

00:09:09.778 --> 00:09:12.017
MY SWORDSMAN MOVES UP
IN THE WORLD,

00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:17.028
ADVANCING FROM LEVEL 3
TO LEVEL 4!

00:09:17.028 --> 00:09:20.269
COOL!
THAT BAD BOY'S GOT
3,000 POINTS NOW.

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:22.407
THAT'S ENOUGH
TO DEFEAT OBELISK!

00:09:22.407 --> 00:09:25.380
NEXT I'LL SEND
MY 3 MAGNET WARRIORS--

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.654
ALPHA, BETA, AND GAMMA--
STRAIGHT TO
MY GRAVEYARD!

00:09:28.654 --> 00:09:35.470
THAT LETS ME SUMMON
MY VALKYRION THE MAGNA
WARRIOR IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.976
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:09:37.976 --> 00:09:41.117
WHICH MEANS THAT
YOUR MAGNA WARRIOR
IS WEAKENED!

00:09:41.117 --> 00:09:43.054
[ROARING]

00:09:48.433 --> 00:09:51.106
NOT QUITE, 'CAUSE I HAVE
A BACK-UP PLAN!

00:09:51.106 --> 00:09:54.714
SO NOW I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
MIRAGE SPELL!

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:09.014
MIRAGE SPELL IS
ACTIVATED WHEN ONE OF
MY MONSTERS IS TARGETED.

00:10:09.014 --> 00:10:10.851
IT NEGATES
SLIFER'S BLAST

00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:16.932
AND INCREASES
MY LIFE POINTS BY 2,000!

00:10:16.932 --> 00:10:19.371
YES!
WAY TO PLAY,
YUGI!

00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:21.876
YOU GOT TO ADMIT
THAT WAS PRETTY
AWESOME.

00:10:21.876 --> 00:10:27.022
USING SLIFER'S ABILITY
TO RESTORE HIS LIFE POINTS
MAY HAVE BEEN A DECENT MOVE,

00:10:27.022 --> 00:10:31.399
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT
MORE THAN THAT TO DEFEAT
THE 3 EGYPTIAN GODS.

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:34.873
NEXT I PLACE TWO CARDS
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:10:34.873 --> 00:10:36.610
YOUR MOVE, PHARAOH.

00:10:45.357 --> 00:10:46.694
THAT'S STRANGE.

00:10:46.694 --> 00:10:48.798
WHY DIDN'T YUGI
JUST ATTACK
OBELISK?

00:10:48.798 --> 00:10:50.936
I GUESS HE DIDN'T WANNA
TAKE THE RISK.

00:10:50.936 --> 00:10:54.445
A CARELESS ATTACK ON
AN EGYPTIAN GOD COULD
EASILY BACKFIRE.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.883
BUT THERE'S STILL ONE THING
THAT I DON'T GET.

00:10:56.883 --> 00:11:01.026
WHY DID YUGI LEAVE ALL
HIS MONSTERS ON THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE?

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:05.536
IT'S NOT LIKE YUGI
TO LEAVE HIMSELF
WIDE OPEN TO AN ATTACK.

00:11:05.536 --> 00:11:10.815
IF YOU HAVE A STRATEGY,
THEN LET'S SEE YOU USE IT!

00:11:10.815 --> 00:11:12.619
[THINKING]
WHAT COULD HE BE PLANNING?

00:11:12.619 --> 00:11:15.226
FOR SOME REASON,
HE MUST WANT ME TO ATTACK.

00:11:15.226 --> 00:11:18.767
OTHERWISE HE WOULDN'T HAVE
LEFT HIS MONSTERS
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:11:18.767 --> 00:11:23.210
THEY MAY BE POWERFUL,
BUT THEY'RE NO MATCH
FOR MY EGYPTIAN GODS.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.384
I GUESS THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

00:11:26.384 --> 00:11:28.890
MY MOVE! I DRAW!

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.393
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:11:30.393 --> 00:11:32.565
SINCE I'M NOW HOLDING
4 CARDS,

00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:37.577
SLIFER'S ATTACK POINTS
INCREASE TO 4,000!

00:11:37.577 --> 00:11:40.984
NOW, SLIFER, ATTACK!
DESTROY HIS SWORDSMAN!

00:11:40.984 --> 00:11:43.958
WITH THUNDERFORCE STRIKE!

00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.530
YOU JUST TRIGGERED
MY TRAP!

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.005
BUT, YUGI,
TRAP CARDS DON'T WORK
AGAINST SLIFER!

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:55.685
Tristan:
IT'S JUST TOO STRONG!

00:11:55.685 --> 00:11:58.725
OF COURSE. I'VE BEEN
SAYING THAT ALL ALONG.

00:11:58.725 --> 00:12:00.797
[ROARING]

00:12:13.927 --> 00:12:16.064
THIS IS NOT LOOKING
HOPEFUL.

00:12:16.064 --> 00:12:19.606
YUGI! THIS WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME
FOR THAT STRATEGY!

00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:21.110
WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.983
ATTACK HIS MAGNA WARRIOR!

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.538
THERE GOES MONSTER
NUMBER TWO.

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:42.492
THANKS TO SLIFER
AND RA, YUGI'S OUT
OF MONSTERS NOW!

00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:45.800
AND THE PHARAOH CAN
STILL ATTACK WITH
HIS LAST EGYPTIAN GOD!

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.007
ONE SHOT FROM OBELISK
AND YUGI'S A GONER!

00:12:49.007 --> 00:12:50.877
COME ON.

00:12:50.877 --> 00:12:53.384
[GULPS]
IT'S DONE?

00:12:53.384 --> 00:12:55.789
OH, LIKE YOU'RE
SURPRISED?

00:12:55.789 --> 00:12:59.230
Yami-Yugi: YUGI, I KNOW
YOU TRIED YOUR BEST.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.268
FOR THAT,
I AM FOREVER THANKFUL.

00:13:01.268 --> 00:13:04.542
BUT NOW, THE TIME HAS COME
FOR ME TO END THIS DUEL.

00:13:04.542 --> 00:13:09.888
OBELISK, WIPE OUT
HIS LIFE POINTS WITH
YOUR FIST OF FATE!

00:13:14.165 --> 00:13:16.069
OH, NO!
YUGI!

00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:20.178
Yami-Yugi: VALKYRION?

00:13:20.178 --> 00:13:21.415
BUT HOW?

00:13:21.415 --> 00:13:26.560
THIS DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE!

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.736
YUGI, I ALREADY SENT
THOSE MONSTERS TO
THE GRAVEYARD!

00:13:30.736 --> 00:13:33.443
HOW WERE YOU ABLE
TO BRING THEM BACK?

00:13:33.443 --> 00:13:38.922
EASY. REMEMBER THE LAST
TRAP CARD I PLAYED?

00:13:38.922 --> 00:13:40.592
HIS LIFE POINTS
JUST CAME BACK!

00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:43.398
I KNEW YUGI HAD SOMETHING
UP HIS SLEEVE!

00:13:43.398 --> 00:13:46.538
MY MIRAGE RULER
TRAP CARD AUTOMATICALLY
ACTIVATES

00:13:46.538 --> 00:13:48.844
WHENEVER ALL
OF THE MONSTERS ON
MY SIDE OF THE FIELD

00:13:48.844 --> 00:13:51.784
ARE DESTROYED BY
MY OPPONENT IN ONE TURN.

00:13:51.784 --> 00:13:54.056
IT BRINGS MY MONSTERS
BACK TO THE FIELD

00:13:54.056 --> 00:13:56.094
AND RESTORES
MY LIFE POINTS
TO THE NUMBER I HAD

00:13:56.094 --> 00:13:58.031
BEFORE YOUR TURN BEGAN.

00:13:58.031 --> 00:14:02.777
PLUS IT ONLY COST ME
A THOUSAND POINTS!

00:14:02.777 --> 00:14:05.516
WELL DONE.
I'M IMPRESSED.

00:14:05.516 --> 00:14:08.389
[THINKING]
NOW OBELISK CAN'T DESTROY
YUGI'S LIFE POINTS.

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:11.730
LOOKS LIKE HE SAVED
HIMSELF...FOR NOW.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.436
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO END MY TURN NOW.

00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:16.440
WHEW!

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.014
DUDE, THAT WAS
TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT.

00:14:19.014 --> 00:14:21.319
HOW 'BOUT YOU?
YA HANGIN' IN
THERE, GRAMPS?

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.223
SO FAR SO GOOD,

00:14:23.223 --> 00:14:25.795
BUT MY TICKER CAN'T TAKE
MUCH MORE OF THIS.

00:14:25.795 --> 00:14:27.399
AW, COME ON.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:29.671
I'VE SEEN YOU DUEL,
AND YOU'RE STRONGER
THAN ANY OF US!

00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:31.742
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I DO KEEP MYSELF

00:14:31.742 --> 00:14:33.948
IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE,
DON'T I?

00:14:33.948 --> 00:14:39.627
WHO DO YOU THINK MR.
KING OF GAMES INHERITED
HIS STRENGTH FROM?

00:14:39.627 --> 00:14:44.505
YUGI, I'VE NEVER BEEN
MORE PROUD OF YOU
THAN I AM TODAY.

00:14:44.505 --> 00:14:47.111
[SIGHS]
THANK GOODNESS!

00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:51.120
[GASPS]
WHEN DID I START
ROOTING FOR YUGI?

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.592
HEY BRO,
IT LOOKS LIKE YUGI'S

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:56.399
HOLDING HIS OWN
AGAINST THOSE
EGYPTIAN GODS.

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:59.840
PLEASE, THE ONLY THING
THAT GEEK DID WAS STALL
FOR A LITTLE MORE TIME.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.611
IN ORDER FOR HIM TO WIN,

00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:04.652
HE NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT
THE WEAKNESS OF EACH
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:15:04.652 --> 00:15:06.822
SO WHAT ARE
THEIR WEAKNESSES?

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:09.229
THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT EVEN I'M NOT SURE OF,

00:15:09.229 --> 00:15:11.500
BUT I KNOW THEY EXIST.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.175
THE FIRST MAJOR WEAKNESS IS
THAT 3 SACRIFICES ARE REQUIRED

00:15:15.175 --> 00:15:18.382
IN ORDER TO SUMMON THEM,
BUT SINCE THEY'RE ALREADY
ON THE FIELD,

00:15:18.382 --> 00:15:20.387
THAT WEAKNESS WAS
ELIMINATED.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:23.461
NOW IT'S UP TO YUGI
TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE--

00:15:23.461 --> 00:15:27.370
FIND THE FATAL FLAWS
OF THE MOST POWERFUL
MONSTERS IN THE GAME!

00:15:32.714 --> 00:15:35.287
Kaiba: THERE'S NO WAY
YUGI CAN WIN THIS DUEL.

00:15:35.287 --> 00:15:37.525
HE'S NOT EVEN THE TRUE
KING OF GAMES!

00:15:37.525 --> 00:15:40.065
ALL THIS TIME,
SOMEONE ELSE HAS BEEN
DUELING FOR HIM

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:42.236
WHILE HE TOOK
THE CREDIT!

00:15:42.236 --> 00:15:46.613
I FEEL AS IF YUGI IS
GOING TO TURN THINGS
AROUND IN HIS NEXT MOVE.

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:49.118
HUH? HAVE YOU SEEN
THE FUTURE?

00:15:49.118 --> 00:15:51.792
I HAVEN'T HAD A VISION
OF THE FUTURE IN YEARS.

00:15:51.792 --> 00:15:54.297
LET'S JUST CALL THIS
A STRONG HUNCH.

00:15:54.297 --> 00:15:57.906
SO YOU THINK YUGI HAS
A CHANCE AGAINST
THE EGYPTIAN GODS?

00:15:57.906 --> 00:16:01.413
I'M NOT SURE, BUT SOMETHING
JUST OCCURRED TO ME

00:16:01.413 --> 00:16:03.819
THAT PERHAPS I HADN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE.

00:16:03.819 --> 00:16:07.461
MAYBE FATE CHOSE YUGI
AS THE VESSEL FOR
THE PHARAOH'S SPIRIT

00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:09.699
NOT BECAUSE HE NEEDED
THE PHARAOH'S HELP,

00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:13.508
BUT BECAUSE YUGI HIMSELF
IS THE MODERN-DAY
VERSION OF THE PHARAOH,

00:16:13.508 --> 00:16:15.379
EQUAL IN EVERY WAY.

00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:16.749
THE TWO WERE
BROUGHT TOGETHER

00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:20.257
BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT
OPPOSITE SIDES
OF THE SAME SOUL.

00:16:20.257 --> 00:16:22.461
YES, BUT THEY'RE
SO--
WHAT?

00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:25.335
THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT
FROM ONE ANOTHER
BECAUSE YUGI'S SHY,

00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:27.707
AND THE PHARAOH'S
ASSERTIVE AND CONFIDENT?

00:16:27.707 --> 00:16:31.182
WELL, THE TRUTH IS
THEY EACH HAD A QUALITY
THAT THE OTHER NEEDED,

00:16:31.182 --> 00:16:32.752
SO THEY LEARNED
FROM EACH OTHER.

00:16:32.752 --> 00:16:34.356
HOLD ON!

00:16:34.356 --> 00:16:36.694
ARE YOU SAYING
THEY'RE COMPLETE
NOW?

00:16:36.694 --> 00:16:38.698
Ishizu: WE'LL SOON FIND OUT.

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:41.205
IF THEIR JOURNEY TOGETHER
IS TRULY OVER,

00:16:41.205 --> 00:16:46.450
THEN FATE WILL ALLOW YUGI
TO DEFEAT ALL 3 EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS AND WIN THE DUEL.

00:16:51.328 --> 00:16:52.932
[THINKING]
ALL RIGHT.

00:16:52.932 --> 00:16:56.106
IF I EXPECT TO WIN THIS,
I NEED TO START THINKING
LIKE THE PHARAOH.

00:16:56.106 --> 00:17:00.014
FOR STARTERS, I NEED
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
HIS FACEDOWN CARD IS.

00:17:00.014 --> 00:17:03.088
FOR SOME REASON,
HE HASN'T
ACTIVATED IT YET.

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:05.327
WAIT!
COME TO THINK OF IT,

00:17:05.327 --> 00:17:08.501
I HAVEN'T LAUNCHED
ONE ATTACK SINCE HE
PLAYED THAT CARD.

00:17:08.501 --> 00:17:11.941
I BET HE'S PLANNING
TO USE IT TO MAKE ONE
OF MY ATTACKS BACKFIRE!

00:17:11.941 --> 00:17:14.013
SO IT MUST BE
MIRROR FORCE!

00:17:14.013 --> 00:17:16.185
IF I'M RIGHT, THEN THERE
MIGHT BE A WAY

00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:18.824
I CAN TAKE DOWN
THOSE EGYPTIAN GODS.

00:17:18.824 --> 00:17:20.862
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA
BE EASY!

00:17:20.862 --> 00:17:23.769
I NEED TO PLAY THE RIGHT
CARD COMBINATION,

00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:27.310
SO EVERYTHING IS RIDING
ON THIS NEXT DRAW.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.119
WELL, HEART
OF THE CARDS, YOU KNOW
THE DEAL--GUIDE ME!

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:32.890
ALL RIGHT!

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.598
NOW, MY MOVE!
AND I HAVE A PLAN!

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.135
GOOD. THEN GO!

00:17:38.135 --> 00:17:41.677
YUGI'S NOT GONNA
ATTACK, RIGHT? NAH!

00:17:41.677 --> 00:17:44.884
FOR STARTERS,
MY SILENT SWORDSMAN
JUMPS ONE MORE NOTCH

00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:49.026
FROM LEVEL 4
TO LEVEL 5!

00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:50.631
AND THEN I'LL ACTIVATE

00:17:50.631 --> 00:17:54.239
VALKYRION
THE MAGNA WARRIOR'S
SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:57.847
YOU SEE, WHENEVER ALPHA,
BETA, AND GAMMA
THE MAGNET WARRIORS

00:17:57.847 --> 00:18:00.286
ARE IN MY GRAVEYARD
AT THE SAME TIME,

00:18:00.286 --> 00:18:02.524
I CAN BRING THEM ALL
BACK TO THE FIELD

00:18:02.524 --> 00:18:05.431
BY SACRIFICING
MY VALKYRION!

00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:07.803
HE'S COMPLETELY LOST IT.

00:18:07.803 --> 00:18:11.946
WHY ON EARTH WOULD YUGI
DISMANTLE ONE OF HIS MOST
POWERFUL MONSTERS

00:18:11.946 --> 00:18:15.220
JUST TO SUMMON
3 WEAKER MONSTERS
TO TAKE ITS PLACE?

00:18:25.511 --> 00:18:27.315
WHENEVER YOU SUMMON
A NEW MONSTER,

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:29.586
SLIFER'S SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES!

00:18:29.586 --> 00:18:31.457
[ROARING]

00:18:31.457 --> 00:18:33.696
WHATTA YOU THINKIN',
YUGI?!

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:38.006
Joey: NOW EVERY ONE
'A YOUR MONSTERS GETS
BLOWN OFF DA FIELD!

00:18:38.006 --> 00:18:39.943
LIGHTNING BLAST!

00:18:39.943 --> 00:18:42.883
[ROARING]

00:18:42.883 --> 00:18:44.722
SO FAR SO GOOD!

00:18:44.722 --> 00:18:51.169
I ACTIVATE
MY MAGNET FORCE TRAP!

00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:52.439
WHAT'S THIS?

00:18:52.439 --> 00:18:54.543
I CAN ACTIVATE
MAGNET FORCE

00:18:54.543 --> 00:18:57.684
WHENEVER ONE OF MY ROCK
OR MACHINE MONSTERS
IS TARGETED

00:18:57.684 --> 00:19:00.591
BY THE SPECIAL ABILITY
OF ANOTHER MONSTER!

00:19:00.591 --> 00:19:02.428
ONCE ACTIVATED,
THIS TRAP CARD

00:19:02.428 --> 00:19:05.335
TRANSFERS SLIFER'S BLAST
TO YOUR MONSTERS!

00:19:05.335 --> 00:19:10.480
HE'S TURNING THE EGYPTIAN GODS
AGAINST THEMSELVES!

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.585
IS THIS MOVE REALLY
GONNA WORK!?

00:19:22.307 --> 00:19:25.047
HE WEAKENED THEM
BY 2,000 POINTS!

00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:29.256
NOW YUGI'S SWORDSMAN CAN
TAKE ON ANY ONE 'A THOSE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:19:29.256 --> 00:19:32.030
SILENT SWORDSMAN,
IT'S TIME TO ATTACK!

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:37.909
DESTROY OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR WITH
SILENT SWORD SLASH!

00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:39.614
NOT SO FAST, YUGI!

00:19:39.614 --> 00:19:42.220
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD!

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.692
BEHOLD!
MY MIRROR FORCE!

00:19:44.692 --> 00:19:46.195
NO WAY!

00:19:58.892 --> 00:20:02.232
IT'S OVER, YUGI.

00:20:02.232 --> 00:20:05.139
AW, MAN.
ALL HIS MONSTERS
ARE GONE.

00:20:05.139 --> 00:20:07.010
DUDE, THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.780
YUGI!

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.220
HE CAME CLOSER THAN
I THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.992
Kaiba: YEAH, WELL,
"CLOSE" DOESN'T COUNT,

00:20:13.992 --> 00:20:17.668
SO IN MY BOOK, YUGI'S
STILL THE SAME LOSER
HE ALWAYS WAS.

00:20:17.668 --> 00:20:19.371
WHAT A JOKE!

00:20:19.371 --> 00:20:22.345
ONCE AGAIN, YOU'VE
ALL WASTED MY TIME.

00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:24.350
THAT WAS
A VALIANT EFFORT, YUGI.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.022
IF ONLY YOU HAD PREDICTED
MY FACEDOWN CARD.

00:20:27.022 --> 00:20:30.479
I DID, AND THAT'S WHY
THIS DUEL'S NOT DONE!

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:33.816
AS SOON AS YOUR MIRROR FORCE
TRAP CARD WAS ACTIVATED,

00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:37.386
I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE
THE CARD COMBINATION
THAT I NEEDED.

00:20:37.386 --> 00:20:41.991
PHARAOH! IT'S ABOUT TIME
I ELIMINATED THOSE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.425
BUT HOW?!
