00:06:52.344 --> 00:06:53.446
IF THAT'S YOUR
CHALLENGE...

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:54.448
THEN I MUST ACCEPT.

00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:56.986
OH, GREAT.

00:06:56.986 --> 00:06:58.155
NO PROBLEM.

00:06:58.155 --> 00:06:59.624
RELAX, GUYS.

00:06:59.624 --> 00:07:01.561
YUGI CAN
DUEL CIRCLES
AROUND HER!

00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:03.831
I WOULDN'T COUNT
ON IT, LOSERS!

00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:05.200
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO UNLEASH

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.039
THE DEVASTATING FORCE
OF HURRICANE VIVIAN!

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:09.040
HOO!

00:07:12.647 --> 00:07:14.483
Both: IT'S TIME TO DUEL!

00:07:17.923 --> 00:07:19.625
Announcer: OUR
LAST SEMI-FINAL MATCH

00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:22.063
IS A CLOSE ONE, FOLKS...

00:07:22.063 --> 00:07:25.336
AS REBECCA FACES
LEON WILSON!

00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:28.341
ALL RIGHT, KID,
MY MOVE!

00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:31.948
I ACTIVATE MY POT
OF GREED MAGIC CARD!

00:07:31.948 --> 00:07:34.586
NOW I CAN DRAW TWO MORE
CARDS FROM MY DECK!

00:07:34.586 --> 00:07:36.990
THEN I'LL PLAY THIS!

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:42.333
MY WITCH OF
THE BLACK FOREST!

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:45.071
NOW, IT'S TIME TO TURN YOUR
CARRIAGE INTO PUMPKIN PIE!

00:07:50.013 --> 00:07:53.418
I GUESS CINDERELLA'S NOT
GOING TO THE BALL AFTER ALL!

00:07:53.418 --> 00:07:54.420
POOR LITTLE PRINCESS!

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.424
NOT EXACTLY!

00:07:56.424 --> 00:07:58.527
WATCH THIS!

00:07:58.527 --> 00:08:00.531
CINDERELLA, ATTACK HER
WITCH OF THE BLACK FOREST

00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:07.210
WITH SHATTER KICK!

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:12.185
AND HER SHOES COME
BACK WITHOUT A SCRATCH!

00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:14.990
BUT AT LEAST MY WITCH
WASN'T BLOWN UP FOR NOTHING!

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.026
WHEN SHE GOES TO
THE GRAVEYARD,

00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:19.331
HER SPECIAL
ABILITY ACTIVATES...

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:22.370
LETTING ME TRANSFER MY
RUBY DRAGON TO MY HAND!

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.606
NO BIG DEAL!

00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:27.446
NOW I SUMMON TOM THUMB,
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:27.446 --> 00:08:30.284
THEN I'LL PLACE THIS
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN!

00:08:30.284 --> 00:08:31.285
LETTING ME TRANSFER MY
RUBY DRAGON TO MY HAND!

00:08:31.285 --> 00:08:32.587
HOW WILL I
EVER FIGHT

00:08:32.587 --> 00:08:34.358
AGAINST A FAIRY
PRINCESS AND AN ELF!?

00:08:34.358 --> 00:08:35.560
WAIT, I KNOW!

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.363
I'LL JUST USE THIS!

00:08:37.363 --> 00:08:39.500
RUBY DRAGON!

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.503
BUT WAIT!

00:08:41.503 --> 00:08:43.040
BEFORE I ATTACK,

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.611
I'M GONNA ACTIVATE MY
DRAGON'S FIRE MAGIC CARD!

00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:49.150
[ROARS]

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.989
IT GIVES MY DRAGON
A BONUS POWER--

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:54.259
THE ABILITY TO WIPE
OUT ANY MONSTER

00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:56.564
THAT HAS 800 DEFENSE
POINTS OR LESS!

00:08:56.564 --> 00:09:00.204
[SCREAMS]

00:09:00.204 --> 00:09:03.275
[SCREAMING]

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:04.745
BLAST HIS LITTLE
GARDEN GNOME...

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:08.518
WITH CRIMSON COMBUSTION!

00:09:08.518 --> 00:09:09.520
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.624
WATCH THIS!

00:09:11.624 --> 00:09:15.564
GO, NEGATE ATTACK!

00:09:15.564 --> 00:09:17.200
AND JUST LIKE
ITS NAME SAYS,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.404
MY CARD NEGATES
YOUR ATTACK!

00:09:19.404 --> 00:09:21.374
YOU THINK
YOU'RE SO COOL.

00:09:21.374 --> 00:09:23.345
WELL, YOU'RE NOT, KID.

00:09:23.345 --> 00:09:26.350
[THINKING]
HE COUNTERACTS
MY MOVES EVERY TURN!

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.652
AND WITHOUT YUGI
TO CHEER ME ON,

00:09:27.652 --> 00:09:31.192
I DON'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE
I NEED TO STOP HIM!

00:09:31.192 --> 00:09:32.528
YOU CAN DO IT,
REBECCA!

00:09:32.528 --> 00:09:33.562
YOU'RE THE BEST!

00:09:33.562 --> 00:09:34.664
All: HAWKINS!

00:09:34.664 --> 00:09:35.666
HAWKINS!

00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:37.035
[THINKING]
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.738
I'M NOT ALONE AT ALL!

00:09:38.738 --> 00:09:39.973
I'VE GOT TONS OF
SUPPORT OUT THERE!

00:09:39.973 --> 00:09:42.478
WE'RE ALL
BEHIND YOU!

00:09:42.478 --> 00:09:43.747
Girl: YOU GO, GIRL!

00:09:43.747 --> 00:09:45.049
Boy: GO, REBECCA!

00:09:45.049 --> 00:09:47.087
I'D BE PAYING ATTENTION
IF I WERE YOU!

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:50.993
I ACTIVATE
GIANT'S TRAINING!

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:52.796
THIS CARD WILL
BE YOUR DOWNFALL!

00:09:52.796 --> 00:09:55.234
IT LETS ME SACRIFICE
TOM THUMB...

00:09:55.234 --> 00:09:58.039
IN ORDER TO SUMMON THIS:

00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:00.977
MY GOOD BUDDY GLOBERMAN
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:00.977 --> 00:10:03.582
NOW SHOW HER RUBY DRAGON
WHO'S BOSS!

00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:07.088
[GROWLS]

00:10:07.088 --> 00:10:08.090

00:10:19.143 --> 00:10:20.546
ACTIVATE TRAP CARD!

00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:21.747
ROPE OF LIFE!

00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:24.285
IT KICKS IN AS SOON
AS ONE OF MY MONSTERS

00:10:24.285 --> 00:10:25.387
IS SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:10:25.387 --> 00:10:28.159
AND ONCE I TOSS OUT
MY ENTIRE HAND,

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:30.296
IT LETS ME BRING
THAT MONSTER BACK!

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.365
OH, AND DID I MENTION

00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:34.203
IT GETS AN EXTRA
800 ATTACK POINT!?

00:10:34.203 --> 00:10:36.106
SO, THANKS FOR
THE POWER BOOST!

00:10:36.106 --> 00:10:39.212
[ROARS]

00:10:39.212 --> 00:10:41.716
NEXT, I'LL ACTIVATE
A MAGIC CARD!

00:10:41.716 --> 00:10:45.055
IT'S CALLED ADAMANTINE
SWORD REVIVAL,

00:10:45.055 --> 00:10:47.226
AND IT LETS ME
REPLACE THE DRAGON
I JUST BROUGHT BACK

00:10:47.226 --> 00:10:49.797
WITH AN EVEN
STRONGER ONE...

00:10:49.797 --> 00:10:52.268
MY DIAMOND HEAD DRAGON!

00:10:59.214 --> 00:11:00.716
[SNARLS]

00:11:00.716 --> 00:11:03.054
IT MAY START OUT

00:11:03.054 --> 00:11:04.456
WITH THE SAME NUMBER
OF ATTACK POINTS

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:05.525
THAT MY RUBY
DRAGON HAD...

00:11:05.525 --> 00:11:06.827
BUT THEN IT GETS
AN EXTRA THOUSAND

00:11:06.827 --> 00:11:10.167
THANKS TO MY MAGIC CARD.

00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:12.605
3,400 ATTACK POINTS?

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:13.639
YUP!

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.543
I END MY TURN.

00:11:15.543 --> 00:11:18.514
BUT WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT
I'VE GOT PLANNED NEXT!

00:11:25.024 --> 00:11:26.393
[BURP]

00:11:26.393 --> 00:11:27.462
Joey: EXCUSE ME.

00:11:27.462 --> 00:11:29.899

00:11:31.535 --> 00:11:33.371
HOW CAN YOU
BE EATING NOW!?

00:11:33.371 --> 00:11:34.607
YUGI NEEDS
US OUT THERE!

00:11:34.607 --> 00:11:38.414
HE DOESN'T NEED US
YELLING IN HIS EAR TO WIN!

00:11:38.414 --> 00:11:39.850
[MUNCHING]

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.085
NOW RELAX!

00:11:41.085 --> 00:11:42.387
AND TRY THE CHICKEN!

00:11:42.387 --> 00:11:43.423
[SIGHS]

00:11:43.423 --> 00:11:44.425
WHAT KIND?

00:11:44.425 --> 00:11:45.494
Both: SESAME!

00:11:45.494 --> 00:11:46.662
Duke: HEY, GUYS!

00:11:46.662 --> 00:11:47.898
All: HUH?

00:11:47.898 --> 00:11:50.603
THINGS AREN'T LOOKING
SO GOOD FOR YUGI!

00:11:50.603 --> 00:11:53.006
NOW I SACRIFICE
MY MASTER KYONSHEE

00:11:53.006 --> 00:11:57.715
AND MY
KUNG FU NYAN NYAN!

00:11:57.715 --> 00:11:58.850
THIS ALLOWS ME TO
SUMMON MY DRAGON LADY

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:59.886
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.490
NOT BAD, HUH?

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.926
AND NEXT...

00:12:03.926 --> 00:12:05.495
I HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING SPECIAL

00:12:05.495 --> 00:12:06.964
PLANNED JUST FOR YOU!

00:12:06.964 --> 00:12:08.801

00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:10.504

00:12:10.504 --> 00:12:12.775
LIGHTNING SABER!

00:12:12.775 --> 00:12:17.550
WHICH INCREASES
DRAGON LADY'S
STRENGTH BY 300!

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.453
HYAH!

00:12:19.453 --> 00:12:21.724

HOW'D SHE
ATTACK TWICE?!

00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:37.419
I ASSUME THAT YOU'VE
FIGURED THIS OUT BY NOW...

00:12:37.419 --> 00:12:38.854
BUT THANKS TO HER NEW SWORD,

00:12:38.854 --> 00:12:39.990
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.026
CUT MY DRAGON LADY'S
STRENGTH IN HALF

00:12:42.026 --> 00:12:43.028
AND SHE CAN
ATTACK TWICE!

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:47.770
VERY WELL.
MY MOVE!

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:48.938
NOW I PLAY

IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:53.013 --> 00:12:56.552
THEN I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN!

00:12:56.552 --> 00:12:58.856
EVEN IF
YUGI LOSES...

00:12:58.856 --> 00:13:00.025
AT LEAST HE
GETS A DATE.

00:13:00.025 --> 00:13:01.628
YUGI WON'T LOSE!

00:13:01.628 --> 00:13:03.365
SO DROP THE DATE THING!

TIME FOR ANOTHER
DOUBLE ATTACK!

00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:07.004
SO, FIRST,
I'LL RID THE FIELD

00:13:07.004 --> 00:13:09.508
OF THAT UNSIGHTLY
BIG SHIELD GARDNA!

00:13:09.508 --> 00:13:11.145

00:13:14.517 --> 00:13:16.086
BLOCK
HER ATTACK!

00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:18.424
THEN I'LL
PLAY THIS CARD!

00:13:18.424 --> 00:13:19.693
IT'S A HANDY
LITTLE NUMBER

00:13:19.693 --> 00:13:22.364
I LIKE TO CALL
MY SNOWFALL SWORD!

00:13:22.364 --> 00:13:23.833
AND IT CANCELS
OUT THE EFFECT

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:25.837
OF YOUR MIRROR FORCE!

00:13:35.955 --> 00:13:38.593
THIS ISN'T GOOD!

00:13:38.593 --> 00:13:40.663
YUGI'S GOT NO
MONSTERS ON THE FIELD

00:13:40.663 --> 00:13:42.467
TO PROTECT
HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:43.869
THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME

00:13:43.869 --> 00:13:46.674
TO ACTIVATE MY
FLYING DRAGON WHIRL!

00:13:46.674 --> 00:13:47.910
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.450
SEND 4 OF MY DRAGONS
TO THE CARD GRAVEYARD!

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.988
THAT RAISES MY DRAGON LADY'S
ATTACK POINTS BY 1,200!

00:14:00.098 --> 00:14:01.166
UH-OH.

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:02.168
HE'LL LOSE!

00:14:02.168 --> 00:14:03.170

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.075
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:07.644
I DID IT!

00:14:07.644 --> 00:14:12.018
I WON! I WON!

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:17.529
GUESS AGAIN!

00:14:17.529 --> 00:14:18.965
WHAT?!

00:14:18.965 --> 00:14:21.703
ALL I HAVE TO DO NOW
IS DISCARD MY KURIBOH...

00:14:21.703 --> 00:14:27.513
AND MY LIFE POINTS
REMAIN UNTOUCHED!

00:14:27.513 --> 00:14:30.084
HOW DARE YOU RUIN

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.824
JUST YOU WAIT!

00:14:33.824 --> 00:14:35.728
THERE IS NO
"NEXT TURN."

00:14:35.728 --> 00:14:36.862
BUT WHY?

00:14:36.862 --> 00:14:37.931
YOU'RE ABOUT TO
FIND OUT!

00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:39.935
'CAUSE I'M ENDING
THIS RIGHT NOW!

00:14:39.935 --> 00:14:41.938
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:14:41.938 --> 00:14:43.140
WE'LL SEE!

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.944
I DRAW!

00:14:44.944 --> 00:14:46.446
ALL RIGHT.

00:14:46.446 --> 00:14:47.816
FIRST I'LL SUMMON

00:14:47.816 --> 00:14:52.791
MY SKILLED DARK MAGICIAN
TO THE FIELD IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:55.529
SECOND, I ACTIVATE
POT OF GREED...

00:14:55.529 --> 00:15:00.170
WHICH LETS ME DRAW TWO
MORE CARDS FROM MY DECK!

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.174
THEN I'LL PLAY THIS!

00:15:02.174 --> 00:15:03.777
THE EMBLEM OF
DRAGON DESTROYER!

00:15:03.777 --> 00:15:10.488
IT LETS ME BRING BUSTER
BLADER BACK TO MY HAND!

00:15:10.488 --> 00:15:11.958
WHAT ARE THOSE LIGHTS?!

00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.695
THEY'RE
"SPELL COUNTERS."

00:15:13.695 --> 00:15:15.231
WITH EVERY
MAGIC CARD I PLAY,

00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:16.933
ANOTHER ONE LIGHTS UP.

00:15:16.933 --> 00:15:19.137
[GASPS]

00:15:19.137 --> 00:15:21.140
I'M AFRAID
THERE'S MORE!

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.178
MY FINAL MAGIC CARD!

00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:27.151
IT'S KNOWN AS
MONSTER REINCARNATION!

00:15:27.151 --> 00:15:32.160
SO DARK MAGICIAN'S
BACK IN MY DECK!

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.434
AND NOW ALL 3 OF MY
SPELL COUNTERS ARE GLOWING!

00:15:36.434 --> 00:15:39.607
SO I CAN SACRIFICE MY
SKILLED DARK MAGICIAN...

00:15:39.607 --> 00:15:42.078
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
DARK MAGICIAN!

00:15:42.078 --> 00:15:43.179
THERE'S MORE.

00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:45.751
I PLAY POLYMERIZATION!

00:15:45.751 --> 00:15:50.459
FUSING MY DARK MAGICIAN
WITH MY BUSTER BLADER!

00:15:55.168 --> 00:15:58.407
BEHOLD THE CREATURE
OF YOUR DEMISE...

00:15:58.407 --> 00:16:03.683
MY DARK PALADIN!

00:16:03.683 --> 00:16:06.587
AND THERE'S ONE MORE
THING YOU SHOULD KNOW.

00:16:06.587 --> 00:16:08.692
DARK PALADIN GETS
500 ATTACK POINTS

00:16:08.692 --> 00:16:10.662
FOR EVERY DRAGON
ON THE FIELD

00:16:10.662 --> 00:16:12.265
AND IN OUR GRAVEYARDS!

00:16:12.265 --> 00:16:13.667
THAT CAN'T BE!

00:16:13.667 --> 00:16:16.739
I JUST SENT 4 DRAGONS
TO MY CARD GRAVEYARD!

00:16:16.739 --> 00:16:19.110
IT'S NOT FAIR!

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.948
OH, IT'S QUITE FAIR.

00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:24.019
NOW, DARK PALADIN,

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:25.521
WIPE OUT
HER DRAGON LADY

00:16:25.521 --> 00:16:31.064
AND HER LIFE POINTS!

00:16:31.064 --> 00:16:33.569
[SCREAMS]

THAT WAS AWESOME!

00:16:38.611 --> 00:16:40.080
Duke: DID YOU SEE THAT!?

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.924
WHY TO GO, YUG!

00:16:45.924 --> 00:16:47.494
ALL RIGHT, VIV.

00:16:47.494 --> 00:16:49.998
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO PAY UP NOW.

00:16:49.998 --> 00:16:51.968
MY GRANDPA'S WAITING!

00:16:51.968 --> 00:16:54.172
THANKS, YUGI!

00:17:02.916 --> 00:17:05.086
Leon: WITH ONLY 100
LIFE POINTS LEFT,

00:17:05.086 --> 00:17:07.224
YOU BETTER MAKE
THIS ONE COUNT!

00:17:07.224 --> 00:17:08.226
Yugi: REBECCA!

00:17:08.226 --> 00:17:09.227
[GASPS]

00:17:09.227 --> 00:17:10.396
YOU SHOWED UP!

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:11.598
Joey: OF COURSE,
WE DID!

00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:12.600
HEY, BEC!

HEY, LET'S GO!

NO SLEEPING
ON THE JOB, REBECCA!

00:17:18.443 --> 00:17:20.447
NOT WITH ONLY
100 POINTS LEFT!

00:17:20.447 --> 00:17:22.450
NO BIGGIE!

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.454
I CAN'T LOSE

00:17:24.454 --> 00:17:26.190
GO GET HIM!

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.927
ALL RIGHT, KID!

00:17:27.927 --> 00:17:30.130
I'LL START BY
ATTACKING YOUR GLOBERMAN

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.401
WITH MY DIAMOND
HEAD DRAGON!

00:17:32.401 --> 00:17:35.406
[ROARS]

00:17:35.406 --> 00:17:37.511

00:17:41.417 --> 00:17:43.220
YOU CAN DO THIS, BEC!

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.589
STAY STRONG!

00:17:44.589 --> 00:17:47.228
Rebecca: I PLACE ONE CARD

00:17:47.228 --> 00:17:49.198
[THINKING]
THANKS TO MY NEW CARD,

00:17:49.198 --> 00:17:50.367
WHEN LEON SUMMONS A MONSTER...

00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:53.305
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
ITS DEFENSE POINTS

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:56.110
AND MY MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS
COMES OUT OF HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.982
SO, AS LONG AS HE
PLAYS SOMETHING

00:17:58.982 --> 00:18:01.520
WITH LESS THAN
2,500 DEFENSE POINTS,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.189
I AUTOMATICALLY
WIN THE DUEL!

00:18:03.189 --> 00:18:06.628
NOW, LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU'VE GOT, SHALL WE?

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:09.099
WELL, HERE GOES.

00:18:09.099 --> 00:18:13.308
MY MOVE.

00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:14.610
SO, THAT MEANS...

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.046
THE FIRST THING
I HAVE TO DO

00:18:16.046 --> 00:18:18.483
IS HAND OVER EVERY CARD
I'M HOLDING TO YOU!

00:18:18.483 --> 00:18:21.455
THEN I GET TO REPLACE
THE CARDS I JUST GAVE UP,

00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:24.293
BY DRAWING THE SAME NUMBER
OF CARDS FROM MY DECK.

00:18:24.293 --> 00:18:25.395
HMM?

00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:27.098
SPINNING WHEEL
SPINDLE!?

00:18:27.098 --> 00:18:29.369
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:31.573
YOU COULD HAVE DESTROYED
MY MONSTER WITH THIS.

00:18:31.573 --> 00:18:33.276
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

00:18:33.276 --> 00:18:36.247
BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE
WIPED OUT YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:18:36.247 --> 00:18:38.352
SO IT WAS STILL
TOO RISKY A MOVE.

00:18:38.352 --> 00:18:39.520
BUT I HAVE
A BETTER IDEA...

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.459
ONE THAT LETS ME WIN
THE DUEL RIGHT AWAY.

00:18:42.459 --> 00:18:43.494
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:18:43.494 --> 00:18:45.464

I DON'T KNOW.

00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:49.705
