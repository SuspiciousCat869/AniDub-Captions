MY PHARAOH,

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.569
ARE YOU READY FOR
YOUR FINAL TASK?

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.637
YES.

00:00:07.637 --> 00:00:09.240
MARIK AND I
CAN LEAD YOU

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.609
TO THE FINAL
RESTING PLACE

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.480
OF THE 7
MILLENNIUM ITEMS.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.082
BEFORE WE GO
ANY FURTHER,

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:16.854
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU
SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS.

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.458
IN ORDER FOR THE PHARAOH
TO ENTER THE SPIRIT WORLD,

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:20.794
HE MUST FIRST FACE OFF

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:23.265
AGAINST A WORTHY OPPONENT
IN BATTLE AND LOSE.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:25.135
I DON'T GET WHAT
THE CHALLENGE IS

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:26.904
IN LOSING A DUEL.

00:00:26.904 --> 00:00:28.273
Duke: THINK
ABOUT IT GUYS.

00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:30.377
WINNING IS EASY
FOR THE PHARAOH,

00:00:30.377 --> 00:00:31.913
BUT BEING ABLE
TO ACCEPT DEFEAT

00:00:31.913 --> 00:00:33.482
IS PROBABLY
THE GREATEST TEST

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:35.018
OF HIS CHARACTER
THERE IS!

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:37.823
I CHALLENGE YOU TO
THE ULTIMATE DUEL!

00:00:37.823 --> 00:00:39.727
I'VE ALREADY
MADE MY CHOICE.

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:41.329
I'M GONNA DUEL

IS GONNA BE AWESOME.

00:02:17.463 --> 00:02:19.299
Joey: YEAH, YUGI
VERSUS THE PHARAOH?

WHAT'S UP, TEA?

YOU GOTTA USE THE
LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM?

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.484
NOT QUITE.

00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:31.520
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHY WE HAD TO RUSH

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.591
INTO ALL THIS
SO SOON.

00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:35.194
THIS COULD BE
OUR FINAL CHANCE

00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:36.529
TO HANG OUT WITH
THE PHARAOH

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.432
BEFORE HE LEAVES
US FOR GOOD.

00:02:38.432 --> 00:02:39.701
THAT'S TRUE.

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:41.739
I WAS SO PUMPED UP
FOR THIS DUEL,

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.009
I FORGOT THIS MIGHT
BE HIS LAST ONE.

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:48.182
YEAH, ME, TOO.

00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:49.618
MY FRIENDS...

00:02:49.618 --> 00:02:52.056
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
THIS MUST BE,

HOWEVER, YUGI
AND THE PHARAOH

00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:55.095
MUST CARRY OUT
THIS BATTLE RITUAL

00:02:55.095 --> 00:02:56.831
AS QUICKLY
AS POSSIBLE.

00:02:56.831 --> 00:02:59.303
IF TOO MUCH TIME
SHOULD PASS...

00:02:59.303 --> 00:03:01.974
OUR WINDOW OF
OPPORTUNITY WILL CLOSE.

00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:04.244
WE ALL KNOW HOW
YOU FEEL, TEA...

00:03:04.244 --> 00:03:06.682
BUT THIS IS WHAT'S
BEST FOR THE PHARAOH.

00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:08.251
HE DOESN'T BELONG
IN OUR WORLD,

00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:12.024
AND NOW HIS SPIRIT FINALLY
HAS A CHANCE TO GO HOME.

LET'S DO THIS.

00:03:16.732 --> 00:03:18.101
I PROBABLY
DON'T SAY THIS

AS OFTEN AS
I SHOULD, TEA...

YOU'RE ONE OF
THE BRAVEST PEOPLE
I EVER MET.

I KNOW THIS IS
TOUGH FOR YOU,

TO SAY I'M PROUD.

00:03:26.817 --> 00:03:29.188
IF YOU DORKS START HOLDING
EACH OTHER'S HANDS,

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:30.557
THEN I'M OUT OF HERE.

00:03:30.557 --> 00:03:32.126
I DIDN'T COME
HERE TO LISTEN TO

YOU WOULDN'T
FEEL THAT WAY!

DID COME TRUE.

TO TRULY TEST OUR
READINESS TO SEPARATE,

00:07:36.172 --> 00:07:41.413

IF YOU TAUGHT ME
ANYTHING,

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:55.838
IT'S TO PUT YOUR
HEART INTO YOUR DECK

EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT.

I'LL START BY DISCARDING
ONE CARD FROM MY HAND

IN ORDER TO SUMMON A MONSTER
KNOWN AS THE TRICKY!

00:08:35.641 --> 00:08:40.016
THEN I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN!

HAVE 2,000 POINTS,

TO STOP IT!

00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:46.092
CHECK THIS OUT!

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.561

00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:57.045
NOW, THAT MONSTER CAN'T
ATTACK FOR 3 MORE TURNS!

00:08:57.045 --> 00:08:59.416
AND NEXT I'LL CALL
MY GREEN GADGET

00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:02.054
TO THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:02.054 --> 00:09:04.257

SPECIAL POWER...

00:09:04.257 --> 00:09:07.663
I CAN MOVE RED
GADGET TO MY HAND!

00:09:07.663 --> 00:09:10.435
THEN I PLACE ONE
CARD FACEDOWN.

00:09:10.435 --> 00:09:11.637
AND THAT'S
ALL FOR NOW!

00:09:11.637 --> 00:09:12.906

THAT'S GOOD?

[THINKING]
I MAY NOT BE ABLE

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.647
TO ATTACK YUGI
WITH MY MONSTER,

00:09:17.647 --> 00:09:19.918
BUT I CAN ATTACK
HIM WITH HIS OWN.

00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:23.123
I ACTIVATE THE MAGIC
CARD REBELLION!

00:09:23.123 --> 00:09:24.425
[GASPS]

00:09:24.425 --> 00:09:27.230
NOW, I CAN SELECT A MONSTER
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.735
AND FORCE IT TO
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:36.313
AND I CHOOSE YOUR
GREEN GADGET!

00:09:36.313 --> 00:09:37.315
[GASPS]

00:09:37.315 --> 00:09:38.951
HOLD ON!

00:09:38.951 --> 00:09:40.186
HUH?!

00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:42.089
YOU TRIGGERED MY TRAP!

00:09:42.089 --> 00:09:43.525
SO NOW...

00:09:43.525 --> 00:09:47.365
I ACTIVATE STRONGHOLD--
THE MOVING FORTRESS!

00:09:47.365 --> 00:09:51.005
[GASPS]

00:09:51.005 --> 00:09:53.376
[WHISTLING]

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:56.848
THIS TRAP IS ALSO A MONSTER
WITH 2,000 DEFENSE POINTS,

00:09:56.848 --> 00:10:02.726
SO MY LIFE POINTS
ARE SAFE!

00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:04.328
I'M AFRAID YOUR
LIFE POINTS

00:10:04.328 --> 00:10:08.903
AREN'T AS SAFE AS
YOU THINK, YUGI!

00:10:08.903 --> 00:10:10.138
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:10:10.138 --> 00:10:13.277
GREEN GADGET
WAS YUGI'S MONSTER!

00:10:13.277 --> 00:10:15.247
I CAN'T SAY I'VE
EVER SEEN A DUEL

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:17.117
AS EVENLY MATCHED
AS THIS ONE!

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.186
Joey: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

00:10:18.186 --> 00:10:22.259
THESE GUYS SHARED
A BRAIN FOR YEARS!

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:24.697
[THINKING]
WE NEVER HAD THOSE CARDS
IN OUR DECK BEFORE.

00:10:24.697 --> 00:10:26.467
I WONDER WHAT
OTHER SURPRISES

00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:30.640
YUGI HAS IN STORE.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.644
[THINKING]
WITH THIS NEW DECK
I'VE ASSEMBLED,

00:10:32.644 --> 00:10:36.985
THE PHARAOH'S
NEVER GONNA FIGURE
OUT MY STRATEGY!

00:10:36.985 --> 00:10:39.121
[THINKING]
HIS CARDS MAY
KEEP ME GUESSING,

00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:40.524
BUT DO THEY HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES

00:10:40.524 --> 00:10:42.695
TO STAND UP TO THE MOST
POWERFUL CREATURES

00:10:42.695 --> 00:10:44.231
IN DUEL MONSTERS:

00:10:44.231 --> 00:10:46.435
THE EGYPTIAN GODS?!

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.147
Yugi: ALL RIGHT,
PHARAOH...

00:10:55.147 --> 00:10:56.415
MY MOVE!

00:10:56.415 --> 00:10:57.985
[GASPS]

00:10:57.985 --> 00:10:59.187
I ACTIVATE...

00:10:59.187 --> 00:11:01.691
TIES OF
THE BRETHREN!

00:11:01.691 --> 00:11:04.463
FIRST, I PAY 1,000
LIFE POINTS!

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:05.999
AFTER THAT,
I'M ABLE TO SUMMON

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.737
TWO LEVEL-4 MONSTERS
FROM MY DECK!

00:11:08.737 --> 00:11:10.707
AND I KNOW JUST
WHAT I NEED!

00:11:10.707 --> 00:11:13.144
COME FORTH, RED GADGET

00:11:13.144 --> 00:11:14.981
AND YELLOW GADGET!

00:11:14.981 --> 00:11:19.756
TAKE THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:21.927
IT WILL TAKE MORE
THAN A STRONG DEFENSE

00:11:21.927 --> 00:11:23.563
TO WIN THIS DUEL, YUGI.

00:11:23.563 --> 00:11:25.165
I'M NOT DONE YET.

00:11:25.165 --> 00:11:26.167
HUH?!

00:11:26.167 --> 00:11:27.903
NOW, GADGETS...

00:11:27.903 --> 00:11:30.141
JOIN MY STRONGHOLD!

00:11:35.717 --> 00:11:40.091

[ROARING]

00:11:43.631 --> 00:11:45.634
Yugi: WHENEVER THESE
3 GADGET MONSTERS

00:11:45.634 --> 00:11:47.538
ARE ON THE FIELD
AT THE SAME TIME...

00:11:47.538 --> 00:11:49.441
THEY'RE ABLE TO RAISE
THE ATTACK STRENGTH

00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:52.847
OF MY MOVING FORTRESS'S
TO 3,000 POINTS!

00:11:52.847 --> 00:11:55.685
I TAUGHT THAT
KID EVERYTHING
HE KNOWS, FOLKS!

00:11:55.685 --> 00:11:56.787
[GIGGLES]

00:11:56.787 --> 00:12:00.093
STRONGHOLD THE MOVING
FORTRESS, ATTACK!

00:12:00.093 --> 00:12:06.771
STEEL GEAR CRUSH!

00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:09.943
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY STRONGHOLD?!

00:12:09.943 --> 00:12:12.748
HE'S TRAPPED--THANKS
TO MY BOUNCE SPELL!

00:12:12.748 --> 00:12:15.586
THIS MAGIC CARD ALLOWED
ME TO TRANSFER THE EFFECT

00:12:15.586 --> 00:12:18.859
OF YOUR SWORDS OF REVEALING
LIGHT TO YOUR MONSTER!

00:12:18.859 --> 00:12:21.931
NOW, IT CAN'T ATTACK
FOR 3 MORE TURNS.

00:12:21.931 --> 00:12:23.333
[THINKING]
WHOA!

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:24.802
NOW WHAT
AM I GONNA DO?

00:12:24.802 --> 00:12:26.405
I WASN'T
EXPECTING THAT.

00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:27.640
I GUESS THE PHARAOH
REALLY IS

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.380
TRYING HIS HARDEST
TO DEFEAT ME.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.085
I SWITCH MY GREEN GADGET
INTO DEFENSE MODE

00:12:34.085 --> 00:12:35.621
AND END MY TURN.

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:38.426
[THINKING]
YUGI, IN MY HEART,
I HOPE YOU WIN.

00:12:38.426 --> 00:12:41.999
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I PLAN TO GO EASY ON YOU.

00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:44.470
IT'S MY MOVE.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.742
AND I'LL START BY SENDING
MY MONSTER TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:12:47.742 --> 00:12:51.649
IN ORDER TO ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
TRICKY SPELL 4!

00:12:51.649 --> 00:12:52.651
THIS ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON

00:12:52.651 --> 00:12:54.187
AS MANY TRICKY TOKENS

00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:56.758
AS YOU HAVE MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD.

00:12:56.758 --> 00:12:59.663
THAT GIVES ME 4
MONSTERS AS WELL!

00:12:59.663 --> 00:13:02.267
WHOA, THE TALLER YUGI
JUST EVENED IT ALL UP!

00:13:02.267 --> 00:13:03.570
NOT EXACTLY.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.941
IF HE'S ABOUT TO DO
WHAT I THINK HE IS,

00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:10.048
THEN HE'S WAY AHEAD
OF THE GAME.

00:13:10.048 --> 00:13:11.817
I'M NOT FINISHED YET.

00:13:11.817 --> 00:13:13.620
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.958
I'M TAKING THIS DUEL
TO THE NEXT LEVEL!

00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:16.960
NO WAY.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.129
I KNEW IT.

00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:21.200
NOW I SACRIFICE
3 OF MY TOKENS!

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:27.979
SO I CAN PLAY OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR!

00:13:27.979 --> 00:13:31.017
[ROARING]

00:13:31.017 --> 00:13:32.119

00:13:38.664 --> 00:13:40.634
THIS COULD PRESENT
A PROBLEM.

00:13:40.634 --> 00:13:43.205
WELL, MAYBE FOR YOUR
AVERAGE DUELIST.

00:13:43.205 --> 00:13:45.643
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
YUGI HERE, REMEMBER?

00:13:45.643 --> 00:13:46.978
I KNOW YUGI'S GOOD,

00:13:46.978 --> 00:13:49.516
BUT HE'S UP AGAINST
AN EGYPTIAN GOD HERE!

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:51.586
OBELISK, ATTACK!

00:13:51.586 --> 00:13:54.826
DESTROY HIS FORTRESS

[GRUNTS]

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:09.718
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN

Tristan:
YOU GOTTA HANG
IN THERE, DUDE!

00:14:12.756 --> 00:14:14.526
THE PHARAOH
MEANS BUSINESS.

00:14:14.526 --> 00:14:15.561
NO JOKE.

00:14:15.561 --> 00:14:16.864
POOR GUY.

00:14:16.864 --> 00:14:19.067
NOT ONLY DID HE GET
CLOBBERED BY OBELISK,

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.804
BUT THANKS TO SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT,

00:14:20.804 --> 00:14:23.342
HE CAN'T STRIKE BACK.

00:14:23.342 --> 00:14:29.051
I TOLD YOU
I WOULDN'T GO
EASY ON YOU.

00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:30.721
[GASPS]

00:14:30.721 --> 00:14:31.923

CHECK IT OUT, GUYS!

00:14:31.923 --> 00:14:33.692
YUGI'S BACK
ON HIS FEET!

00:14:33.692 --> 00:14:34.928
Seto: BIG DEAL.

00:14:34.928 --> 00:14:38.134
THERE'S STILL NO WAY HE
CAN STAND UP TO OBELISK.

00:14:38.134 --> 00:14:40.104
THEN WHY IS HE SMILING?

00:14:40.104 --> 00:14:41.840
PERHAPS YUGI
WANTS TO LOSE

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.710
SO THE PHARAOH
DOESN'T HAVE TO GO.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.380
NO WAY, BAKURA.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.516
YUGI MAY NOT WANT
TO SAY GOOD-BYE,

00:14:47.516 --> 00:14:50.087
BUT THERE'S NO WAY HE'D
BE HAPPY ABOUT LOSING.

00:14:50.087 --> 00:14:51.824
SO WHY THE SMILE?

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:53.827
HE'S HAVING THE TIME
OF HIS LIFE.

00:14:53.827 --> 00:14:55.230
THINK ABOUT IT, TEA.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.770
THIS IS YUGI'S SHOT TO
FINALLY PROVE HIMSELF.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.641
HE USUALLY TAKES
A BACKSEAT DURING DUELS.

00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:02.977
BUT THIS TIME,

00:15:02.977 --> 00:15:05.548
YUGI'S IN CONTROL
OF HIS OWN DECK!

00:15:05.548 --> 00:15:08.153
SO, NOW INSTEAD OF STANDING
BEHIND THE PHARAOH...

00:15:08.153 --> 00:15:09.655
THE TWO OF 'EM
ARE STANDING

00:15:09.655 --> 00:15:12.293
FACE TO FACE
FOR ONE LAST DUEL.

00:15:12.293 --> 00:15:14.163
YEAH, BUT CAN YUGI WIN?

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:15.632
[THINKING]
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.

00:15:15.632 --> 00:15:17.869
BUT IF ANYONE
CAN DO IT, YUGI CAN.

00:15:17.869 --> 00:15:19.806
I'LL TAKE THINGS
FROM HERE!

00:15:19.806 --> 00:15:23.679
FIRST I PLACE THESE
3 CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:26.317
AND THEN I SUMMON
MY SILENT SWORDSMAN

00:15:26.317 --> 00:15:28.087
TO THE FIELD!

00:15:28.087 --> 00:15:29.289
YEAH!

00:15:29.289 --> 00:15:31.260
THAT'S HOW HE KICKED
BAKURA'S BUTT!

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.062
HUH?!
YOU KNOW--
THE EVIL ONE.

00:15:33.062 --> 00:15:36.702
NOW, LET'S SEE IF
YOU CAN GET PAST HIM!

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.639
WHAT'S HE THINKING?

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.876
ONE ATTACK BY OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR,

00:15:40.876 --> 00:15:42.579
AND YUGI LOSES THE DUEL!

00:15:42.579 --> 00:15:44.750
[THINKING]
THAT GEEK IS
UP TO SOMETHING.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.254
THIS COULD JUST
BE MY LAST MOVE!

00:15:47.254 --> 00:15:50.559
TO BEGIN, I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:51.628
AND, NEXT, I'LL PLAY

00:15:51.628 --> 00:15:54.733
MY CARD OF SANCTITY
MAGIC CARD!

00:15:54.733 --> 00:15:56.002
NOW, WE BOTH DRAW

00:15:56.002 --> 00:16:01.045
UNTIL WE'RE EACH HOLDING
6 CARDS IN OUR HAND!

00:16:01.045 --> 00:16:02.314
READY?

00:16:02.314 --> 00:16:04.583
AS READY
AS I'LL EVER BE.

00:16:04.583 --> 00:16:06.287
WELL, HERE GOES.

00:16:06.287 --> 00:16:07.990
I'M AFRAID IF
THIS WORKS,

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.426
THE DUEL IS OVER.

00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:12.397
MAY THE HEART OF THE CARDS
GUIDE YOU, YUGI.

00:16:12.397 --> 00:16:13.733
THANK YOU.

00:16:13.733 --> 00:16:15.636
NOW, LET'S SEE IF
YOU CAN WITHSTAND

00:16:15.636 --> 00:16:18.508
THE GREAT FURY
OF AN EGYPTIAN GOD!

00:16:18.508 --> 00:16:20.845
GO AHEAD, GIVE ME
YOUR BEST SHOT, PHARAOH!

00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:21.880
HUH?

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.916
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR,

00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:25.354
ATTACK HIS SILENT

00:16:25.354 --> 00:16:27.123
[ROARING]

00:16:27.123 --> 00:16:30.462
END THIS DUEL WITH
YOUR FIST OF FATE!

00:16:37.771 --> 00:16:39.307
LOOK OUT!
[GASPS]

00:16:39.307 --> 00:16:41.210
I REVEAL MY TRAP!

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.981
GROUND EROSION!

00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:45.317
THEN I ACTIVATE
A MAGIC CARD

00:16:45.317 --> 00:16:47.021
KNOWN AS TURN JUMP!

00:16:47.021 --> 00:16:49.993
IT FORCES EACH PLAYER
TO JUMP AHEAD 3 TURNS--

00:16:49.993 --> 00:16:51.428
DURING WHICH
NEITHER OF US

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:56.103
IS ALLOWED TO
MAKE A MOVE.

00:16:56.103 --> 00:16:57.405
THIS LETS MY SWORDSMAN

00:16:57.405 --> 00:16:59.776
INCREASE FROM LEVEL
ZERO TO LEVEL 3!

00:17:04.785 --> 00:17:06.755
WELL DONE, YUGI.

00:17:06.755 --> 00:17:09.894
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO DEFEAT OBELISK!

00:17:09.894 --> 00:17:11.163
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:13.500
THANKS TO THE EFFECT OF MY
GROUND EROSION TRAP CARD,

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.706
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD IS WEAKER
THAN YOU THINK, PHARAOH!

00:17:16.706 --> 00:17:18.876
TRAPS DON'T WORK
ON OBELISK!

00:17:18.876 --> 00:17:20.913
I'M NOT USING
IT ON HIM!

00:17:20.913 --> 00:17:22.949
I'M USING IT ON
THE FIELD UNDER HIM!

00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:24.085
BUT HOW?!

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.154
IT'S SIMPLE.

00:17:25.154 --> 00:17:27.123
AFTER GROUND
EROSION IS PLAYED,

00:17:27.123 --> 00:17:29.361
THE MONSTER STANDING ON MY
OPPONENT'S SIDE OF THE FIELD

00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:32.633
LOSES 500 POINTS WITH
EACH PASSING TURN.

00:17:32.633 --> 00:17:33.702
[GASPS]

00:17:33.702 --> 00:17:35.404
AND, THANKS TO
MY MAGIC CARD,

00:17:35.404 --> 00:17:37.375
3 TURNS HAVE
JUST GONE BY!

00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:40.780
SO, OBELISK LOSES
1,500 ATTACK POINTS!

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.153
MAKING ITS STRENGTH
EQUAL TO MY SWORDSMAN'S.

00:17:44.153 --> 00:17:45.622
BIG DEAL, YUGI,

00:17:45.622 --> 00:17:47.692
SO NOW THE DUEL'S
AT A STANDSTILL.

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:48.761
WAIT!
HUH?!

00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:50.163
NOT SO FAST!

00:17:50.163 --> 00:17:53.770
I ACTIVATED
A TRAP CARD OF MY OWN.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.141
BEHOLD MY
SUMMONING CLOCK!

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:58.311
[GASPS]

00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:01.116
IT'S AUTOMATICALLY
TRIGGERED

00:18:01.116 --> 00:18:02.719
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO

00:18:02.719 --> 00:18:04.188
IS SACRIFICE MY CLOCK

00:18:04.188 --> 00:18:06.592
AND ONE MONSTER
FROM THE FIELD!

00:18:06.592 --> 00:18:08.496
THEN I CAN SUMMON
ONE NEW BEAST

00:18:08.496 --> 00:18:09.965
FOR EACH TURN
THAT'S PASSED!

00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:10.967
WHAT?!

00:18:10.967 --> 00:18:12.636
3 NEW MONSTERS!?

00:18:12.636 --> 00:18:14.539
EXACTLY!

00:18:14.539 --> 00:18:17.577
AND I'LL START WITH QUEEN'S
KNIGHT AND KING'S KNIGHT,

00:18:17.577 --> 00:18:21.117
WHICH LETS ME AUTOMATICALLY
SUMMON JACK'S KNIGHT!

00:18:21.117 --> 00:18:22.787
ONE LEFT.

00:18:22.787 --> 00:18:26.026
SO, I SUMMON SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON!

00:18:26.026 --> 00:18:27.395
NO WAY!

00:18:27.395 --> 00:18:28.964
ANOTHER EGYPTIAN GOD?!

00:18:28.964 --> 00:18:30.066
[GASPS]

00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:47.229
[ROARS]

00:18:47.229 --> 00:18:48.264
[GASPS]

00:18:48.264 --> 00:18:49.333
Pharaoh: AS YOU KNOW,

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:51.102
SLIFER RECEIVES
1,000 ATTACK POINTS

00:18:51.102 --> 00:18:53.106
FOR EVERY CARD
IN MY HAND...

00:18:53.106 --> 00:18:57.247
AND I'M HOLDING 3 CARDS.

00:18:57.247 --> 00:18:59.450
YOU JUST TRIGGERED
MY TRAP!

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.953
IT'S CALLED
AMBUSH SHIELD!

00:19:00.953 --> 00:19:03.725
AND I'LL ACTIVATE IT
BY SACRIFICING THIS CARD--

00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:05.828
MY RED GADGET!

00:19:05.828 --> 00:19:07.966
SO, NOW I GET TO ADD
ITS DEFENSE POINTS

00:19:07.966 --> 00:19:09.969
TO MY SOLDIER'S
ATTACK POINTS!

00:19:09.969 --> 00:19:12.139
THAT IS ONE
POWERFUL KNIGHT.

00:19:12.139 --> 00:19:13.242
IT EVEN HAS
ENOUGH POINTS

00:19:13.242 --> 00:19:15.545
TO DEFEAT SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON NOW!

00:19:15.545 --> 00:19:16.914
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:19:16.914 --> 00:19:19.018
HOWEVER, YOUR TWO
GADGET MONSTERS

00:19:19.018 --> 00:19:20.487
ARE STILL
VULNERABLE.

00:19:20.487 --> 00:19:27.499
NOW, MY KNIGHTS,
ATTACK!

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:30.638
[GASPS]

00:19:30.638 --> 00:19:32.408
MY TURN'S JUST
ABOUT DONE.

00:19:32.408 --> 00:19:34.077
ALL I NEED TO DO NOW IS

00:19:34.077 --> 00:19:36.415
CALL ONE FINAL MONSTER
TO THE FIELD.

00:19:36.415 --> 00:19:37.884
[GASPS]

00:19:37.884 --> 00:19:38.852
I SACRIFICE...

00:19:38.852 --> 00:19:40.522
MY QUEEN'S KNIGHT,

00:19:40.522 --> 00:19:44.295
MY JACK'S KNIGHT
AND MY KING'S KNIGHT!

00:19:44.295 --> 00:19:46.432
IS HE...
HE IS!

00:19:46.432 --> 00:19:49.537
ALMIGHTY PROTECTOR OF
THE SUN AND THE SKY,

00:19:49.537 --> 00:19:52.510
I BEG OF THEE,
PLEASE, HEED MY CRY.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.711
THE ANCIENT CHANT!

00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:55.147
HE KNOWS IT!

00:19:55.147 --> 00:19:57.384
TRANSFORM THYSELF
FROM ORB OF LIGHT

00:19:57.384 --> 00:19:59.789
AND BRING ME VICTORY
IN THIS FIGHT.

00:19:59.789 --> 00:20:01.291
I BESEECH THEE,

00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:02.961
GRACE OUR HUMBLE GAME.

00:20:02.961 --> 00:20:04.396
BUT FIRST I SHALL

00:20:04.396 --> 00:20:06.367
CALL OUT THY NAME!

00:20:06.367 --> 00:20:12.344
WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:18.955
BEHOLD, THE THIRD
EGYPTIAN GOD!

00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:21.259
[THINKING]
NOW WHAT'S YUGI
GONNA DO?!

00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:30.843
[ROARING]

00:20:30.843 --> 00:20:35.217
[GASPING]

00:20:35.217 --> 00:20:37.235
UNBELIEVABLE!

00:20:37.235 --> 00:20:41.039
HE PLAYED
ALL 3 EGYPTIAN
GODS AT ONCE!

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:44.475
YUGI, THE TRUE TEST
WILL NOW BEGIN!
