00:18:37.045 --> 00:18:38.846
SAY SOMETHING, YUGI.

00:18:38.846 --> 00:18:40.381
YOU ALL RIGHT,
PAL!?

00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:42.517
HE'S EXHAUSTED!

00:18:42.517 --> 00:18:43.785
TRISTAN'S RIGHT.

00:18:43.785 --> 00:18:45.219
WHY DON'T YA
GET SOME REST

00:18:45.219 --> 00:18:46.821
AND LET ME TAKE IT
FROM HERE?

00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:52.560
[THINKING]
THANK YOU, YUGI.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.695
Yugi: WOW.

00:18:53.695 --> 00:18:55.129
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT
AT THE TIME,

00:18:55.129 --> 00:18:56.297
BUT I GUESS THAT BATTLE

00:18:56.297 --> 00:18:58.833
REALLY TOOK ITS TOLL
ON ME, GUYS.

00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:00.301
YES, AND IF I
HAD TO GUESS,

00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:02.070
I'D SAY THAT
ACTIVATING THAT ARMOR

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.440
MAY HAVE DRAINED
SOME OF YOUR ENERGY
AS WELL.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.808
Tristan:
HEY. IS IT ME,

00:19:06.808 --> 00:19:10.111
OR DID THAT VILLAGE
SOMEHOW EVAPORATE
INTO THIN AIR!?

00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:12.213
MAYBE THAT SAND STORM
BLEW IT AWAY.

00:19:12.213 --> 00:19:13.514
OH! LOOK, GUYS!

00:19:13.514 --> 00:19:15.016
HUH?
HUH?

00:19:15.016 --> 00:19:18.186
Tea: THOSE STATUES
LOOK ODDLY FAMILIAR,
DON'T THEY?

00:19:18.186 --> 00:19:20.254
THE VISITORS ARE HERE.

00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:34.902
THE ELDER WANTS YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

00:19:34.902 --> 00:19:36.571
IF THIS WHOLE THING IS A GAME,

00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:40.174
MAYBE THOSE TWO WERE JUST HERE
TO HELP US WIN OR SOMETHING.

00:19:40.174 --> 00:19:45.480
HUH?

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.814
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:19:46.814 --> 00:19:50.351
ONE OF THE 5 SHAPES
ON THIS PENDANT JUST LIT UP.

00:19:50.351 --> 00:19:51.486
[GASP]

00:19:51.486 --> 00:19:55.890
Joey:
NOT ANOTHER WORM!

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:56.958
Tristan: NOPE.

00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:59.827
IT LOOKS MORE LIKE
A GIANT ELEVATOR.

00:19:59.827 --> 00:20:01.362
AND IF I HAD TO GUESS,

00:20:01.362 --> 00:20:04.198
I'D SAY IT WAS HERE
TO TAKE US TO
THE SECOND TRIAL.

00:20:04.198 --> 00:20:07.235
GUESS THAT MEANS
WE PASSED
THE FIRST ONE, HUH?

00:20:07.235 --> 00:20:10.738
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY THE JEWEL AROUND MY NECK
STARTED GLOWING!

00:20:10.738 --> 00:20:11.806
AWESOME!

00:20:11.806 --> 00:20:14.275
ONE LEVEL DOWN
AND 4 MORE TA GO!

00:20:14.275 --> 00:20:16.210
IF WE KEEP KICKING BUTT
AT THIS RATE,

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.813
THE 5 OF US'LL BE BACK HOME
IN NO TIME!

00:20:18.813 --> 00:20:21.282
YEAH. THERE'S NOT
A MONSTER AROUND
WE CAN'T CRUSH,

00:20:21.282 --> 00:20:23.217
THANKS TO YOU
AND THIS SUIT
OF ARMOR!

00:20:23.217 --> 00:20:25.019
DON'T FORGET THE MASKED MAN!

00:20:25.019 --> 00:20:27.221
I AM HERE TO GUIDE YOU.

00:20:27.221 --> 00:20:33.094
THE SECRET TO THIS TRIAL
LIES WITHIN THE SACRED ARMOR
YOU NOW WIELD.

00:20:33.094 --> 00:20:34.395
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,

00:20:34.395 --> 00:20:40.635
TIME TA MOVE ON TO LEVEL TWO!

00:20:40.635 --> 00:20:41.769
Joey: WHOEVER DESIGNED
THIS GAME

00:20:41.769 --> 00:20:44.138
HAD A THING FOR WALKING
INTO BRIGHT LIGHTS.

00:20:44.138 --> 00:20:46.808
WELL, YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
IT IS DRAMATIC.
