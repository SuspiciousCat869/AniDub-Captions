HE'S AHHH...NOW HOW
SHALL I PUT THIS?

A COLLEAGUE OF MINE,

AND ON OUR LATEST
EXPEDITION TOGETHER,
HE DISAPPEARED.

IT'S ALL TOO CONVENIENT.

WHY OUR PUZZLE'S

BUT AREN'T PYRAMIDS
USUALLY IN EGYPT?

00:09:57.548 --> 00:09:59.050
GOOD POINT.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.419
DAT MAKES THIS
EVEN COOLER!

00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:03.888

IT CREEPIER, TOO.

AS FASCINATED AND CONFUSED

BY THIS FINDING

WITH THIS THING?

Alex: WELL,
IF MY THEORY IS CORRECT,

00:10:24.508 --> 00:10:27.778
IT'S THE LEGENDARY
"PYRAMID OF ALEXANDER."

A LITTLE MORE INFO.

FOR STARTERS, WHO'S
THIS ALEXANDER GUY?

ALEXANDER THE GREAT,
OF COURSE.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.556
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO,
HE WAS THE LEADER

OF THE GREATEST
EMPIRE EVER KNOWN.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.230

MAKING HIM ONE
OF THE GREAT PHARAOHS.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.576
OOOOH. WELL I GUESS
THAT EXPLAINS

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.912
THE WHOLE PYRAMID
THING.

00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:04.147

EXPLAIN WHY IT WAS BUILT

FROM EGYPT.

REALLY!?
YA COULDA
FOOLED ME!!

00:11:48.892 --> 00:11:51.762
CAREFUL! IF YOU TOUCH
THE STAIRS THEY'LL COLLAPSE!

00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:57.134
CAN'T WE EVER
JUST HANG OUT
LIKE NORMAL KIDS?

00:11:57.134 --> 00:12:01.271
OK. THIS ISN'T
EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT
BY "HANGING OUT!"

00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:03.106
IT ISN'T TOO FAR NOW.

00:12:03.106 --> 00:12:05.509
YOU KNOW AN AWFUL LOT
ABOUT THIS PYRAMID.

00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:07.044
ARE YOU POSITIVE YOU'VE
ONLY BEEN THROUGH

00:12:07.044 --> 00:12:09.112
THIS THING ONE TIME?

00:12:09.112 --> 00:12:13.317
YES. I'VE LEARNED
TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION
TO MY SURROUNDINGS.

00:12:17.087 --> 00:12:20.390
THIS IS WHERE I LAST SAW
YOUR GRANDFATHER, YUGI.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.626
HEY, GRANDPA,
ARE YOU
IN HERE!?

00:12:22.626 --> 00:12:25.128
MR. MUTO!

00:12:25.128 --> 00:12:26.897
IT'S NO USE, MY FRIENDS.

00:12:26.897 --> 00:12:29.800
I DID THAT FOR HOURS,
AND THERE WAS NO REPLY.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.835
Yugi: DID YOU SEE
HIM DISAPPEAR!?

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:35.872
NO. WE SPLIT UP.

00:12:35.872 --> 00:12:37.874
WHY DON'T I
SEE WHAT'S UP
THESE STAIRS.

00:12:37.874 --> 00:12:39.910
IN THE MEANWHILE
YOU CHECK
THIS LEVEL.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.746
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

00:12:42.746 --> 00:12:44.281
Alex, voice-over:
I CAME TO A LOCKED DOOR

00:12:44.281 --> 00:12:45.816
AND COULDN'T PROCEED
ANY FURTHER.

00:12:45.816 --> 00:12:48.852
SO I RETURNED
TO JOIN DR. MUTO.

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:51.622
HOWEVER, WHEN I CAME
BACK DOWN...

00:12:51.622 --> 00:12:54.491
MY COLLEAGUE WAS
NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:57.461
JUST THEN I NOTICED
A STAIRWELL LEADING BELOW.

00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:00.330
SO I FOLLOWED IT
DOWN ONE LEVEL.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.736
BUT WHEN I REACHED
THE BOTTOM ALL I FOUND
WAS DR. MUTO'S HEADBAND.

00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:08.939
AND JUST LIKE THAT,
HE WAS GONE.

00:13:08.939 --> 00:13:12.275
YUGI...YOUR GRANDFATHER
SEEMS TO HAVE EVAPORATED

00:13:12.275 --> 00:13:15.912

LOOK...I MAY NOT HAVE
A COLLEGE DEGREE YET...

00:13:19.216 --> 00:13:20.951
BUT I KNOW THIS MUCH!

00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:23.954
PEOPLE DON'T JUST
VANISH INTO THIN AIR!

00:13:23.954 --> 00:13:26.323
JOEY'S RIGHT. HE MUST
BE HERE SOMEWHERE!

00:13:26.323 --> 00:13:28.191
AGREED!

00:13:28.191 --> 00:13:29.826
LET'S GO.

FORGET TO MENTION

00:13:48.945 --> 00:13:50.013
THERE'S A ROOM
THE SIZE

00:13:50.013 --> 00:13:52.182
OF CLEVELAND
DOWN HERE!?

00:13:52.182 --> 00:13:54.284
AND CHECK OUT THE FLOOR.

00:13:54.284 --> 00:13:56.720
IT LOOKS LIKE
A MAP OR SOMETHING.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.591
YEAH. BUT OF WHAT?

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.727
I WONDER IF MR. MUTO
FOUND THIS ROOM

00:14:03.727 --> 00:14:05.395
BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED.

00:14:05.395 --> 00:14:06.430
WELL IT'S
DEFINITELY
BIG ENOUGH

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.764
TO GET LOST IN.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.700
A'RIGHT. THEN LET'S
STOP STANDIN' AROUND

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.134

HUH? WHAT'S GOIN' ON!?

00:14:15.072 --> 00:14:16.039
AAH!

00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:17.708
LOOK HE'S GONE!

00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:19.609
JOEY! NO!

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.012
WHERE'D HE GO!?

00:14:22.012 --> 00:14:24.581

PLACE YUGI'S

WHAT'S UP, MAN?

00:14:27.584 --> 00:14:28.885
THE TILE
THAT JOEY STEPPED ON

00:14:28.885 --> 00:14:30.854
LOOKS LIKE A MOUNTAIN.

00:14:30.854 --> 00:14:33.256
AND THAT'S A JUNGLE!

00:14:33.256 --> 00:14:34.324
AND THERE'S
A DESERT

00:14:34.324 --> 00:14:36.059

BACK THERE.

DIFFERENT LAND-TYPES.

SEEN THIS BEFORE?

00:14:41.665 --> 00:14:44.367
WELL, ACCORDING
TO MY RESEARCH...

00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:45.502
THIS PYRAMID IS
SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN

00:14:45.502 --> 00:14:48.572
SOME SORT OF ANCIENT GAME.

AN ANCIENT GAME?

00:14:49.873 --> 00:14:51.808

REAL OLD

AND IT NEVER WORKS.

00:15:19.102 --> 00:15:21.671

WHERE ARE WE?

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:40.357
LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE BACK

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:44.227
IN THE FOREST AGAIN.

00:15:44.227 --> 00:15:46.463
HEY, WHERE DID THIS
THING COME FROM?

I'VE GOT ONE TOO.

00:15:48.999 --> 00:15:51.835

ARE YOU GUYS
OUT HERE!?

00:16:00.977 --> 00:16:02.879
SO I THINK MAYBE WE
NEED A PLAN

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.848
OTHER THAN JUST
YELLING THEIR NAMES.

00:16:04.848 --> 00:16:07.150
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR CLUES OR SOMETHING.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.119

BUT THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.
LOOK!

00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:16.293
HEY YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:16:16.293 --> 00:16:19.062
WELL THEY MUST'VE
BEEN PUT HERE
FOR A REASON.

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:22.966
HEY, PHARAOH, I WONDER IF
THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE.

00:16:22.966 --> 00:16:24.568
Tristan: WAIT!

00:16:24.568 --> 00:16:27.604
I HEAR SOMETHING,
GUYS.

00:16:27.604 --> 00:16:29.372
IT'S GETTING CLOSER.

00:16:29.372 --> 00:16:30.874
I DON'T HEAR IT.

00:16:30.874 --> 00:16:32.542
NEITHER DO I, TRISTAN.

00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:35.779
MAYBE IT'S NOTHING.

00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:37.180
AAH!

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.715
IT'S DEFINITELY
NOT NOTHING!

00:16:38.715 --> 00:16:41.818
LET'S GO!

00:16:41.818 --> 00:16:43.787
I RECOGNIZE
THOSE THINGS!

00:16:43.787 --> 00:16:49.526
THEY'RE FROM
THE CAPSULE MONSTERS
BOARD GAME!

00:16:49.526 --> 00:16:51.161
THAT LOOKS
FAMILIAR, TOO!

00:16:51.161 --> 00:16:53.763
LET'S NOT STAY
AND REMINISCE!

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:57.868
YUGI!

00:16:57.868 --> 00:16:59.703
TEA! TRISTAN!

00:16:59.703 --> 00:17:05.375
[ECHOING]

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:10.480
WAIT A SEC.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE YUGI.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:16.152
YUUUU-GI!

00:17:16.152 --> 00:17:20.323
UNH! PUT ME DOWN!

00:17:20.323 --> 00:17:22.692
HURRY!!
THEY'RE GAINING ON US!

00:17:36.106 --> 00:17:37.841
I'VE NEVER BEEN
A BIG FAN OF BUGS

00:17:37.841 --> 00:17:40.844
AND THIS DEFINITELY
ISN'T HELPING!

00:17:40.844 --> 00:17:42.979
QUICK!
DUCK IN THAT CAVE!

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.314
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S
IN THERE!

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:45.482
IT CAN'T BE
MUCH WORSE

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:46.983
THAN WHAT'S
OUT HERE, RIGHT!?

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.486
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.021
SAFE!

00:17:51.021 --> 00:17:53.456
NOT REALLY! AAH!

00:17:59.629 --> 00:18:03.566
THAT WAS WAY TOO
CLOSE FOR COMFORT.

00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:06.970
I JUST HOPE TEA
AND TRISTAN ARE OKAY.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.805
AAH!
AAH!

00:18:08.805 --> 00:18:12.842
UNH!
UNH!

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:16.079
I THINK
THE COAST IS CLEAR.

00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:19.215
COOL! WHAT'S NEXT!?

00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:20.317
HEY SPEAKING
OF THE "COAST..."

00:18:20.317 --> 00:18:22.886
HOW DID WE END UP
ON A BEACH?

00:18:22.886 --> 00:18:25.755
WHY YOU WANNA GRAB
A BOARD AND HANG TEN?

00:18:25.755 --> 00:18:26.990
AAH!

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.558
I TAKE IT YOU'RE
NOT A SURFING FAN?

00:18:28.558 --> 00:18:29.726
TRISTAN...

00:18:29.726 --> 00:18:31.728
WE'VE GOT COMPANY.

00:18:31.728 --> 00:18:33.930
SHOULD WE RUN
OR HELP THEM OUT?

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:39.669
[GROANING]

00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:41.304
HEY! I KNOW YOU!

00:18:41.304 --> 00:18:42.973
FRIEND OF YOURS?

00:18:42.973 --> 00:18:46.142
UH-HUH. IT'S THAT MONSTER
FROM THE BOARD GAME.

00:18:46.142 --> 00:18:47.510

MUTANT LIZARD...

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.849
NOT SO MUCH.

00:18:52.849 --> 00:18:55.151
TRISTAN WAS JUST
KIDDING, WASN'T HE?

00:18:55.151 --> 00:18:56.586
OF COURSE.

00:18:56.586 --> 00:18:59.255
YA SEE.

00:18:59.255 --> 00:19:02.525
TEA! TRISTAN!

00:19:07.097 --> 00:19:09.099

00:19:09.099 --> 00:19:12.369

00:19:30.987 --> 00:19:37.927
CELTIC GUARDIAN!?

[GRUNTING]

00:19:43.867 --> 00:19:46.436
HYAH!

00:19:51.808 --> 00:19:53.643
HYAAAH!

00:19:53.643 --> 00:19:56.079
[THINKING]
WHY IS THIS ALL
SO FAMILIAR?

00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:58.181
HOLD ON!

00:19:58.181 --> 00:20:01.117

00:20:10.527 --> 00:20:12.462
FOR THE DURATION
OF THIS GAME,

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:15.165
I SHALL PROTECT YOU,
MASTER.

00:20:31.281 --> 00:20:33.483
I WAS RIGHT.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.952
I DON'T KNOW HOW
OR WHY BUT...

00:20:35.952 --> 00:20:38.922
WE'VE ENTERED THE WORLD
OF CAPSULE MONSTERS!!!
