00:09:45.736 --> 00:09:47.472
BUT I CALL IT FATE.

00:09:47.472 --> 00:09:52.884
AND THANKS TO POT OF GREED,
I CAN DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:54.419
Leon, thinking:
THAT'S THE CARD!

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:05.676
MAKE YOUR
FAMILY PROUD, LEON,
AND ACTIVATE THAT CARD!

00:10:08.347 --> 00:10:11.153
Zigfried: LOVELY
DAY FOR A DUEL,
ISN'T IT?

00:10:11.153 --> 00:10:13.659
I HOPE YOU BROUGHT
EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

00:10:13.659 --> 00:10:17.967
ZIGFRIED? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

00:10:17.967 --> 00:10:19.871
[ZIGFRIED CHUCKLES]

00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:23.110
HERE. TAKE IT.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.851
IT MIGHT BRING YOU LUCK.

00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:28.789
THAT-A BOY.

00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:31.360
[ZIGFRIED CHUCKLES]

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.999
I'VE NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF THIS CARD.

00:10:33.999 --> 00:10:35.970
THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE
IT'S ONE OF A KIND.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.511
I'VE BEEN SAVING IT
JUST FOR YOU, LEON.

00:10:40.511 --> 00:10:43.952
WHEN YOU DRAW THIS CARD,
I WANT YOU TO
PLAY IT IMMEDIATELY.

00:10:43.952 --> 00:10:47.760
DO THAT AND THE ENTIRE
SCHROEDER FAMILY
WILL HAVE YOU TO THANK.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.029
REALLY? WOW.

00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:52.637
I PROMISE I WON'T
LET YOU DOWN.

00:10:52.637 --> 00:10:54.841
Zigfried, thinking:
EVERYTHING
WE'VE DONE SO FAR

00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:56.711
HAS BEEN LEADING UP
TO THIS MOMENT.

00:10:56.711 --> 00:11:01.253
DON'T SCREW IT UP.

00:11:01.253 --> 00:11:03.190
GO ON, LEON.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.194
DO THIS FOR OUR FATHER

00:11:05.194 --> 00:11:06.865
AND HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM.

00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:12.142
MAKE "SCHROEDER"
A HOUSEHOLD NAME.

00:11:12.142 --> 00:11:15.148
ALL RIGHT. THIS IS
FOR MY FAMILY!

00:11:15.148 --> 00:11:18.154
I PLAY GOLDEN CASTLE
OF STROMBERG!

00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:38.962
Joey:
ANYONE KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

00:11:38.962 --> 00:11:39.964
Hawkins: I DO.

00:11:39.964 --> 00:11:41.233
ME, TOO.

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:45.208
ZIGFRIED, HOW DID YOU
GET YOUR HANDS ON THAT?

00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:48.013
Yami-Yugi: I'VE
HEARD STORIES
ABOUT THAT CARD,

00:11:48.013 --> 00:11:50.151
BUT I THOUGHT IT
WAS NEVER RELEASED.

00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:58.435
HOLD ON!

00:11:58.435 --> 00:11:59.670
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.208
I'M GETTING
SOME INTERFERENCE.

00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:04.914
STRANGE. THE MAINFRAME'S
RUNNING FINE.

00:12:04.914 --> 00:12:06.785
SIGNAL STRENGTH
LOOKS FINE, TOO.

00:12:06.785 --> 00:12:08.355
THAT MAKES
NO SENSE.

00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:12.162
OH, WELL. WHATEVER IT
WAS, IT'S OVER NOW.

00:12:12.162 --> 00:12:14.166
I ACTIVATE THE SPECIAL EFFECT

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.936
OF MY GOLDEN CASTLE NOW!

00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:18.140
IT LETS ME SUMMON
ANY MONSTER
TO THE FIELD

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.813
WITH 4 STARS OR LESS.

00:12:20.813 --> 00:12:24.921
SO I PLAY CINDERELLA
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:12:24.921 --> 00:12:28.995
[CHUCKLING]

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.477
Leon: AND WHERE
WOULD SHE BE WITHOUT
HER PUMPKIN CARRIAGE

00:12:36.477 --> 00:12:41.421
AND HER GLASS SLIPPERS?

00:12:41.421 --> 00:12:43.692
HEY, WATCH OUT!

00:12:43.692 --> 00:12:45.329
THAT PRINCESS
IS TOUGHER
THAN SHE LOOKS!

00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:46.364
DID I MENTION,

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:47.766
WHENEVER PUMPKIN CARRIAGE IS

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:48.935
ON THE FIELD,

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.272
CINDERELLA'S ALLOWED TO GO

00:12:50.272 --> 00:12:52.276
STRAIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE POINTS?

00:12:52.276 --> 00:12:55.883
NOW, CINDERELLA,
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:13:02.061 --> 00:13:04.533
AFTER CINDERELLA
ATTACKS,
SHE TRANSFERS

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:09.377
HER GLASS SLIPPERS
TO ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS.

00:13:09.377 --> 00:13:11.514
BUT THAT FOOTWEAR
DOESN'T COME CHEAP.

00:13:11.514 --> 00:13:12.950
SHE'S GOTTA COUGH UP

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.822
1,000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:13:15.822 --> 00:13:17.426
Duke: YUGI'S
GETTING CRUSHED!

00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:19.130
Joey:
HE'S DA KING
OF GAMES!

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.699
YA THINK
HE'S SCARED OF
SOME PRINCESS?

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:24.206
Rebecca: THAT'S NO PRINCESS,
THAT'S A MONSTER IN HEELS!

00:13:24.206 --> 00:13:27.613
ZIGFRIED, WHERE DID
HE GET THAT CARD?

00:13:27.613 --> 00:13:30.786
HA HA! AND WHAT
CARD WOULD THAT BE?

00:13:30.786 --> 00:13:33.425
I'M NOT IN
THE MOOD FOR GAMES.

00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:35.095
IS THAT REALLY IT?

00:13:35.095 --> 00:13:36.698
SURE IS.

00:13:36.698 --> 00:13:39.437
Tea: WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

00:13:39.437 --> 00:13:41.407
Rebecca: YEAH.
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
WHISPERING ABOUT?

00:13:41.407 --> 00:13:43.044
WAIT. IT'S THAT
CASTLE, ISN'T IT?

00:13:43.044 --> 00:13:45.115
YES. YOU SEE, KIDS,

00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:48.321
THERE ARE SEVERAL
DUEL MONSTERS CARDS
THAT PEGASUS CREATED,

00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:50.125
BUT NEVER
FULLY DEVELOPED,

00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:52.096
AND THEREFORE NEVER
OFFICIALLY RELEASED.

00:13:52.096 --> 00:13:56.004
AND THE GOLDEN CASTLE OF
STROMBERG IS ONE OF THEM.

00:13:56.004 --> 00:13:58.641
Joey: THEN HOW
DID LEON GET
HOLD OF IT?

00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:01.848
I RECALL A TOURNAMENT
SEVERAL YEARS
AGO THAT OFFERED

00:14:01.848 --> 00:14:04.387
THE GOLDEN CASTLE CARD
AS THE GRAND PRIZE,

00:14:04.387 --> 00:14:06.391
BUT IT WAS NEVER
MEANT TO BE USED.

00:14:06.391 --> 00:14:07.893
Hawkins: THAT'S RIGHT.

00:14:07.893 --> 00:14:10.198
BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY
A TEST SAMPLE, IT
WAS FORBIDDEN

00:14:10.198 --> 00:14:12.202
FROM TOURNAMENT PLAY.

00:14:12.202 --> 00:14:15.108
AND SINCE ONLY
ONE COPY WAS EVER MADE,

00:14:15.108 --> 00:14:16.844
IT REMAINS ONE OF
THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER CARDS

00:14:16.844 --> 00:14:18.916
IN THE GAME.

00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:21.821
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT LEON HAS IT
IN HIS DECK.

00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:24.260
ZIGFRIED, YOU REALIZE
YOUR BROTHER JUST PLAYED

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.497
AN ILLEGAL CARD, RIGHT?

00:14:26.497 --> 00:14:28.501
I BEG TO DIFFER,
HERR KAIBA.

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:31.074
IF THAT'S REALLY
A NON-REGISTERED CARD,

00:14:31.074 --> 00:14:34.647
LEON'S DUEL DISK
SHOULDN'T HAVE
RECOGNIZED IT, RIGHT?

00:14:34.647 --> 00:14:36.484
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:40.225
THE CARD LIMITER
MUST'VE BEEN
DEACTIVATED.

00:14:40.225 --> 00:14:42.296
AND I THINK
I KNOW HOW.

00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:43.598
HOLD ON!

00:14:43.598 --> 00:14:45.469
SO THAT MEANS THAT
LEON IS CHEATING!

00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:46.637
I AM?

00:14:46.637 --> 00:14:48.308
THAT'S THE REAL REASON

00:14:48.308 --> 00:14:51.047
YOU HACKED INTO
MY COMPUTER SYSTEM,
ISN'T IT?

00:14:51.047 --> 00:14:52.616
HOW DARE YOU?!

00:14:52.616 --> 00:14:54.153
THE KING OF GAMES
IS ABOUT TO BE
DETHRONED

00:14:54.153 --> 00:14:55.655
BY A SCHROEDER,

00:14:55.655 --> 00:14:57.159
SO YOU ACCUSE
ME OF CHEATING?

00:14:57.159 --> 00:15:00.031
LEON SIMPLY PLAYED
A STRONG CARD.

00:15:00.031 --> 00:15:02.703
DON'T BLAME ME
'CAUSE YOUR CHEAP
COMPUTER NETWORK

00:15:02.703 --> 00:15:04.507
DECIDED
TO MALFUNCTION.

00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:07.146
BLAME YOUR
POOR EXCUSE
FOR A COMPANY.

00:15:07.146 --> 00:15:10.485
FACE IT! KAIBACORP'S
HEYDAY IS OVER!

00:15:10.485 --> 00:15:13.525
COME ON. NO ONE'S
GONNA BUY THAT.
IT'S A FACT

00:15:13.525 --> 00:15:15.695
LEON BROKE THE RULES.

00:15:15.695 --> 00:15:18.836
HE PLAYED A NON-REGISTERED
CARD IN AN OFFICIAL DUEL.

00:15:18.836 --> 00:15:21.374
FINE. THEN WHY
DON'T YOU JUST
GO RIGHT AHEAD

00:15:21.374 --> 00:15:23.044
AND CANCEL
THE MATCH,

00:15:23.044 --> 00:15:25.716
EVEN THOUGH YOU
PROMISED THE WORLD
A WINNER?

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:29.089
NO MATTER WHAT,
THIS DUEL WILL GO ON!

00:15:29.089 --> 00:15:30.760
Zigfried, thinking: PERFECT.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.901
KAIBA KNOWS IF HE
DISQUALIFIES LEON,
HIS ENTIRE TOURNAMENT

00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:39.310
WAS POINTLESS AND HIS
REPUTATION WILL PLUMMET!

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.748
IS THIS REALLY
A FORBIDDEN CARD?

00:15:41.748 --> 00:15:43.051
NO WAY.

00:15:43.051 --> 00:15:46.524
MY BROTHER WOULD NEVER
LIE TO ME LIKE THAT.

00:15:46.524 --> 00:15:49.230
Zigfried: LEON,
JUST CONTINUE
YOUR MOVE!

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.135
THE GOLDEN CASTLE
OF STROMBERG WAS
ACCEPTED

00:15:52.135 --> 00:15:55.676
BY YOUR DUEL DISK,
SO IT CAN'T
BE ILLEGAL!

00:15:55.676 --> 00:15:59.216
NOW SHOW THESE
PEOPLE WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE A SCHROEDER!

00:15:59.216 --> 00:16:01.220
ALL RIGHT.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.524
HOW COULD YOU?

00:16:03.524 --> 00:16:06.330
I KNEW YOU WERE
A JERK, BUT LYING
TO YOUR OWN BROTHER?

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.270
POOR GUY.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.540
DON'T LISTEN
TO THEM, LEON!

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.311
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOU.

00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:15.916
THESE FRIENDS
OF HERR KAIBA JUST
WANT TO TEAR

00:16:15.916 --> 00:16:17.552
OUR FAMILY APART!

00:16:17.552 --> 00:16:21.127
NOW WHO ARE YOU
GOING TO BELIEVE:
THESE STRANGERS

00:16:21.127 --> 00:16:22.997
OR YOUR OWN FLESH
AND BLOOD?

00:16:22.997 --> 00:16:26.571
IT'S JUST I DON'T
WANNA WIN BY CHEATING.

00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:28.876
I TOLD YOU
THAT CARD IS LEGAL.

00:16:28.876 --> 00:16:30.378
DON'T TRUST HIM.

00:16:30.378 --> 00:16:32.650
WHY NOT?

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.420
HE'S JUST USING YOU.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.527
HE REPROGRAMMED
KAIBACORP'S
DUELING SYSTEM,

00:16:37.527 --> 00:16:41.133
FORCING OUR DUEL DISKS
TO ACCEPT AN ILLEGAL CARD.

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:43.104
IS THIS TRUE?

00:16:43.104 --> 00:16:45.710
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
I'VE BEEN FIGURED OUT.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.047
BUT IT'S TOO LATE
TO STOP ME NOW!

00:16:48.047 --> 00:16:50.151
THE MOST POWERFUL CARD
NEVER RELEASED IS

00:16:50.151 --> 00:16:52.089
ALREADY ON THE FIELD!

00:16:52.089 --> 00:16:55.028
AND NO ONE CAN STOP IT!

00:16:59.501 --> 00:17:01.973
THERE'S
ONLY ONE TRUE VICTOR HERE

00:17:01.973 --> 00:17:03.877
AND THAT'S SCHROEDER CORP,

00:17:03.877 --> 00:17:06.081
FOR WHEN MY BROTHER LEON
IS CROWNED WORLD CHAMPION,

00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:10.490
WE'LL BE THE NUMBER ONE
GAMING COMPANY ON EARTH!

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.296
NOT IF YOU
FORCE HIM TO WIN
BY CHEATING.

00:17:13.296 --> 00:17:14.899
HEH HEH!

00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:17.504
YOU SAY
"CHEATING," I SAY
"CREATIVE DUELING."

00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:19.341
ZIGFRIED,

00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:21.345
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO WIN FAIR
AND SQUARE!

00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:23.516
THAT WAS THE PLAN,
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

00:17:23.516 --> 00:17:27.390
IT TURNS OUT THE RULES
DIDN'T FIT MY NEEDS.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.698
NOW USE THE CARD I GAVE YOU,
AND LET ME HANDLE THE REST.

00:17:30.698 --> 00:17:33.770
ALL YOUR DREAMS ARE
ABOUT TO BE REALIZED.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.643
DON'T LET THEM
PASS YOU BY!

00:17:36.643 --> 00:17:39.081
YOU'RE RIGHT.
MY DREAM HAS ALWAYS BEEN
TO WIN IN A DUEL

00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:40.851
AGAINST YUGI.

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:45.026
BUT I REFUSE TO DO IT
BY BREAKING THE RULES.

00:17:45.026 --> 00:17:51.005
NOW I ACTIVATE
MYSTICAL SPACE TYPHOON.

00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:55.380
AND I'LL USE IT
TO DESTROY MY GOLDEN
CASTLE OF STROMBERG!

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.317
Joey: WAY
TO GO, LEON!

00:17:57.317 --> 00:17:59.154
YOU DON'T NEED
THAT HUNK OF JUNK
WEIGHIN' YA DOWN!

00:17:59.154 --> 00:18:00.557
Tristan: THAT'S RIGHT!

00:18:00.557 --> 00:18:05.166
ESPECIALLY A HUNK
OF JUNK THAT'S ILLEGAL!

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:08.774
[ZIGFRIED CHUCKLING]

00:18:08.774 --> 00:18:12.682
Zigfried: I HAD A FEELING
I COULDN'T TRUST YOU.

00:18:12.682 --> 00:18:15.921
THEREFORE I'VE TAKEN
MATTERS INTO MY OWN HANDS.

00:18:15.921 --> 00:18:18.960
YOU SEE, SINCE
THE CASTLE OF STROMBERG CARD

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.167
WAS NEVER FINISHED,
I WAS ABLE TO ADD
A FEW TWISTS OF MY OWN.

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:25.774
BUT A DUELIST CAN'T CHANGE
THE ATTRIBUTES OF A CARD.

00:18:25.774 --> 00:18:29.515
UNLESS HE'S ABLE
TO REWRITE THE FILE
AND ALTER THE DATA.

00:18:29.515 --> 00:18:30.951
HEY, FREAK!

00:18:30.951 --> 00:18:32.555
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

00:18:32.555 --> 00:18:34.759
TA-DA!

00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:38.065
WITNESS, IF YOU WILL,
THE FINAL PHASE
OF MY REVENGE.

00:18:38.065 --> 00:18:39.736
OH, MAN! LOOK!

00:18:39.736 --> 00:18:40.738
WHAT'S UP
WITH THE RECEPTION?

00:18:40.738 --> 00:18:41.906
NO FAIR! THIS
IS THE BEST PART!

00:18:41.906 --> 00:18:43.175
SPILL IT!

00:18:43.175 --> 00:18:46.014
WELL, IF YOU THINK
I HACKED INTO YOUR
DUELING PROGRAM

00:18:46.014 --> 00:18:48.487
JUST TO STRENGTHEN
ONE CARD,
THEN YOU'RE WRONG.

00:18:48.487 --> 00:18:50.891
IN FACT,
THAT CARD WAS
NOTHING MORE THAN A KEY,

00:18:50.891 --> 00:18:52.428
IF YOU WILL.

00:18:52.428 --> 00:18:55.300
AND AS SOON AS IT
WAS PLAYED,
IT UNLOCKED

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.272
THE MOST DEVASTATING
VIRUS EVER CONSTRUCTED.

00:18:58.272 --> 00:19:01.913
LAUNCH THE ANTIVIRAL
PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY.

00:19:01.913 --> 00:19:03.015
YES, SIR!

00:19:03.015 --> 00:19:04.519
Zigfried:
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:07.591
EVERY ONE OF KAIBACORP'S
PROGRAM FILES

00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:10.264
AND DATA BANKS ARE BEING
DELETED AS WE SPEAK.

00:19:10.264 --> 00:19:12.468
AND WHEN YOUR
EMPIRE CRUMBLES,

00:19:12.468 --> 00:19:15.440
MAXIMILLION PEGASUS
WILL HAVE NO CHOICE

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.246
BUT TO NEGOTIATE
A PARTNERSHIP
WITH ME.

00:19:18.246 --> 00:19:19.582
YOU SNAKE!

00:19:19.582 --> 00:19:21.118
ALL RIGHT.

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:22.988
HE MUST BE STOPPED.

00:19:22.988 --> 00:19:24.559
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:27.498
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED
HIM, AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

00:19:27.498 --> 00:19:29.235
NO, THERE'S
STILL TIME!

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:33.175
I JUST WANTED
THE CHANCE TO FACE YOU
IN A FAIR DUEL.

00:19:33.175 --> 00:19:35.514
BUT THAT CHANCE IS GONE.

00:19:35.514 --> 00:19:37.218
SO I QUIT!

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.755
Zigfried:
IT'S NOT THAT EASY!

00:19:39.755 --> 00:19:42.995
YOU SHOULD KNOW
ME BETTER THAN THAT!

00:19:42.995 --> 00:19:45.601
MY VIRUS CAN'T
BE STOPPED
BY SURRENDERING.

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:47.103
IT CAN'T?

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:49.976
COME, NOW, THERE'S
ONLY ONE WAY YOU

00:19:49.976 --> 00:19:51.479
CAN PUT AN END
TO ALL THIS.

00:19:51.479 --> 00:19:53.048
AND IT'S RIGHT
THERE.

00:19:53.048 --> 00:19:55.687
DESTROY THE GOLDEN
CASTLE OF STROMBERG

00:19:55.687 --> 00:19:58.727
AND THE VIRUS
WILL CEASE!

00:19:58.727 --> 00:20:01.699
Tea: HOW? MAGIC AND TRAP
CARDS ARE USELESS

00:20:01.699 --> 00:20:03.203
AGAINST IT, RIGHT?

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:05.107
Joey: YEAH.
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT
OTHER ABILITIES

00:20:05.107 --> 00:20:08.012
ZIGFRIED ADDED
TO THAT THING!

00:20:08.012 --> 00:20:09.582
NOW WHAT?

00:20:09.582 --> 00:20:12.221
WE CONTINUE THE DUEL,
THAT'S WHAT!

00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:13.990
BUT, YUGI,
IT'S NO USE.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.231
MY BROTHER MADE THAT
CARD INDESTRUCTIBLE.

00:20:17.231 --> 00:20:19.568
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE LEON I MET

00:20:19.568 --> 00:20:21.673
WHEN THIS TOURNAMENT
FIRST BEGAN?

00:20:21.673 --> 00:20:24.111
HE WOULDN'T
BE GIVING UP.

00:20:24.111 --> 00:20:26.950
HE'D BE FIGHTING
FOR HIS DREAM.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.188
NOW DUEL AGAINST
ME WITH EVERYTHING
YOU HAVE

00:20:29.188 --> 00:20:31.125
AND SHOW ZIGFRIED
WHAT THE HEART OF
THE CARDS

00:20:31.125 --> 00:20:33.997
IS ALL ABOUT!

00:20:33.997 --> 00:20:36.436
AND TOGETHER
YOU AND I
WILL PUT AN END

00:20:36.436 --> 00:20:38.173
TO YOUR BROTHER'S
SELFISH SCHEME.

00:20:38.173 --> 00:20:40.110
ARE YOU SURE?

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.481
JUST TRUST ME.

00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:44.488
EVERY CARD
HAS ITS WEAKNESS.

00:20:44.488 --> 00:20:45.856
WE JUST NEED
TO FIGURE OUT
THIS ONE.

00:20:45.856 --> 00:20:48.325
AND WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME.
