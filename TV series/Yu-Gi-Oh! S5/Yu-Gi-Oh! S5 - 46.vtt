00:19:58.464 --> 00:20:00.266
IS THAT YOU?

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:05.638
NO HARM SHALL COME
TO YOU, MY KING!

00:20:05.638 --> 00:20:08.107
IT'S YOU! SHADI!

00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:11.077
YOU MUST NEVER SURRENDER
TO THE DARKNESS.

00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:13.012
THE LIGHT OF HOPE
WILL SOON ARRIVE

00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:15.948
BEARING THE INFORMATION
THAT YOU NEED.

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:20.920
THE LIGHT OF HOPE?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.689
SHADI! THANK YOU.

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:27.593
Shadi: DO NOT GIVE UP.

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:32.932
EXACTLY AS I PREDICTED,
EVERYTHING SHALL RETURN
TO DARKNESS,

00:20:32.932 --> 00:20:35.868
JUST AS IT ALWAYS DOES.

00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:43.509
[THINKING]
HANG IN THERE, PHARAOH!

00:20:43.509 --> 00:20:46.445
HELP IS ON THE WAY!
