[LAUGHING]

00:19:52.634 --> 00:19:53.937
WE MEET AGAIN.

00:19:53.937 --> 00:19:54.939
ONLY, THIS TIME,

00:19:54.939 --> 00:19:56.042
YOU DIDN'T BRING ALONG

00:19:56.042 --> 00:19:58.714
ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS
TO FIGHT BY YOUR SIDE.

00:19:58.714 --> 00:20:00.685
I, ON THE OTHER
HAND, DID.

[LAUGHING]

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:15.649
YOU'RE NOT QUITE
AS IMPRESSIVE

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:17.353
WITHOUT YOUR YOUNGER
COUNTERPARTS

00:20:17.353 --> 00:20:19.557
TO HIDE BEHIND, ARE YOU?

00:20:19.557 --> 00:20:21.395
I COULD SEIZE YOUR
MILLENNIUM EYE

00:20:21.395 --> 00:20:22.731
IN AN INSTANT...

00:20:22.731 --> 00:20:26.405
BUT I HAVE SOMETHING
MORE AMUSING IN MIND.

00:20:26.405 --> 00:20:27.469
AFTER ALL...

00:20:27.469 --> 00:20:29.737
WE STILL HAVE
A SCORE TO SETTLE.

00:20:29.737 --> 00:20:31.806
PERHAPS YOU RECALL
A LITTLE INCIDENT

00:20:31.806 --> 00:20:35.176
OCCURRING THE VILLAGE OF
KUL ELNA A FEW YEARS AGO?

00:20:35.176 --> 00:20:37.979
YOU CRUSHED MY PEOPLE
AND ABANDONED YOUR SON--

00:20:37.979 --> 00:20:40.148
A YOUNG BOY NAMED SETO!

00:20:40.148 --> 00:20:41.850
