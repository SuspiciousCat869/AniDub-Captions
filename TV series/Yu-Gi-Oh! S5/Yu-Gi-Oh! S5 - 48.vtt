PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:03.193 --> 00:00:04.830
OPEN YOUR EYES, PHARAOH!

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.934
YOUR REIGN IS OVER!

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:08.870
NEVER!!

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.477
I'M AFRAID I DISAGREE!

00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:15.483
NOW I GIVE YOU
THE CREATOR OF LIGHT!

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:18.722
WHAT!? IMPOSSIBLE!

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.993
DARKNESS, BE GONE!!

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.735
NO!!

00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:28.240
I SHALL TAKE YOU WITH ME!

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.779
[ROARING]

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.848
GUESS AGAIN, ZORC!

00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:38.426
YOU HAVE CONQUERED
THE EMBODIMENT OF PURE DARKNESS

00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:40.396
FROM WHICH ALL EVIL
IS BORN.

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:42.032
SO I'M DONE?

00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:44.236
NO, BUT YOU ARE CLOSE.

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:45.540
WITH THE HELP
OF YOUR FRIENDS,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.911
YOU'VE NEARLY FULFILLED
YOUR DESTINY.

00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:49.613
AND NOW THERE IS
BUT ONE TASK

00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:50.916
LEFT FOR YOU TO CARRY OUT

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:54.055
BEFORE YOUR SPIRIT MAY
RETURN TO ITS RESTING PLACE.

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:02.538
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE ♪

00:01:02.538 --> 00:01:03.974

♪ YU-GI-OH! ♪

00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:11.467

WE'RE BACK.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.440
THEN I GUESS
IT'S OVER.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.644
THE TABLET
RETURNED US ALL
TO THE PRESENT.

00:02:16.644 --> 00:02:18.480
LET'S HOPE SO.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.284
ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THE PHARAOH?

00:02:20.284 --> 00:02:21.653
I MEAN ATEM.

00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:23.122
YEAH, YOU DON'T
THINK HE'S STILL
STUCK

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:25.126
IN THE ANCIENT PAST,
DO YOU?

00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:31.472
PHARAOH, ARE YOU THERE?

00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:33.141
Pharaoh: I'M RIGHT
WHERE I BELONG.

00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:34.143
WITH US!

00:02:34.143 --> 00:02:35.445
YOU DID IT!

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:37.249
WE ALL DID IT
TOGETHER.

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.818
AND NOW THE DARKNESS
UNLEASHED

00:02:38.818 --> 00:02:41.023
BY THE SHADOW GAMES
SO LONG AGO

00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:42.660
IS FINALLY OVER.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.531
IT ONLY TOOK YOU
5,000 YEARS.

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:46.933
AND I'M GLAD
I WAS HERE TO HELP.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:48.002
ME, TOO.

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:49.606
I MEAN, A GUY CAN
GET PRETTY USED

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:51.877
TO THIS WHOLE
SAVING-THE-WORLD
THING.

00:02:51.877 --> 00:02:53.513
NOW REMIND ME
HOW GETTING POSSESSED

00:02:53.513 --> 00:02:55.717
BY AN EVIL SPIRIT
WAS HELPING?

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:58.288
I HAVE NO FURTHER
COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.

00:02:58.288 --> 00:03:00.225
EMBARRASSED BECAUSE
YOU NEARLY DESTROYED

00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:01.962
THE WORLD
AS WE KNOW IT?

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:05.169
OH, LIKE YOU'VE NEVER
GOTTEN POSSESSED
BEFORE, JOEY?!

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.238
[THINKING] I'M REALLY
GOING TO MISS THEM.

00:03:07.238 --> 00:03:10.478
Yugi: PHAR--AH,
I MEAN, ATEM.

00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:11.613
I PROMISE
ONE OF THESE DAYS

00:03:11.613 --> 00:03:13.984
I'LL GET USED
TO THAT NAME OF YOURS.

00:03:13.984 --> 00:03:15.755
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:17.424
YOU HAVE
YOUR MEMORY BACK!

00:03:17.424 --> 00:03:18.426
THANKS TO YOU.

00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:19.495
Tea: COME ON, JOEY.

00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:20.597
YOU CHAINED YUGI
TO AN ANCHOR

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:22.133
AND THREATENED
TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD.

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:23.302
RINGING ANY BELLS?!

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:25.206
Joey: I HAVE NO FURTHER
COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.

00:03:25.206 --> 00:03:27.510
PHARAOH, TELL JOEY
HE WAS POSSESSED.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:38.831
HEY, YUGI.

00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:41.236
I BELIEVE
YOU'LL BE NEEDING THAT.

00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:42.773
Tea: THE MILLENNIUM EYE?

00:03:42.773 --> 00:03:45.477
Joey: AND WHERE DID YOU
GET YOUR HANDS ON THAT,
RICH BOY?

00:03:45.477 --> 00:03:46.479
Pharaoh: KAIBA.

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.581
YOU DON'T JUST CHUCK

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.654
A MILLENNIUM ITEM AT
SOMEONE AND WALK AWAY!

00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:57.332
I'M SICK OF YOUR SILENT
TREATMENT ROUTINE!

00:03:57.332 --> 00:04:01.240
Joey: HEY! IT'S YOU!

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.711
Bakura: HELLO.
WHERE ARE WE?

00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:05.114
WAIT A SECOND, GUYS.

00:04:05.114 --> 00:04:07.318
I HAVE A HUNCH
THIS IS THE GOOD BAKURA.

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:09.556
NOW...LET ME SEE.

00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:10.691
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER

00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:15.634
WAS HEARING A STRANGE VOICE
AND THEN...

00:04:15.634 --> 00:04:17.370
WHOA.
TAKE IT EASY, PAL.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.372
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:04:18.372 --> 00:04:20.844
I NEED SOME FOOD.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.914
SO DO I. YOU DON'T
SEE ME PASSING OUT!

00:04:22.914 --> 00:04:23.983
JOEY!

00:04:23.983 --> 00:04:25.719
LOOK, WE COULD
ALL USE A BITE.

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.458
IT HAS BEEN
5,000 YEARS!

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:31.698
HUH?

00:04:31.698 --> 00:04:32.700
I THINK
HE'S GOT SOMETHING

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.937
THAT BELONGS TO YOU,
YUGE.

00:04:34.937 --> 00:04:37.342
RIGHT.

00:04:37.342 --> 00:04:38.644
[THINKING] NOW THAT
ZORC HAS VANISHED,

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:41.215
SO HAS THE EVIL
SPIRIT OF THE RING.

00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:45.524
SO BAKURA
IS FINALLY FREE.

00:04:45.524 --> 00:04:49.999
Joey: HEY, GUYS!
A LITTLE HELP HERE?!

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.069
THANKS, TEA.
GRAB A LEG,
WILL YOU?

00:04:57.847 --> 00:04:59.216
[THINKING] SHADI.

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:02.722
PLEASE KNOW THAT YOUR ITEMS
WILL FINALLY BE LAID TO REST.

00:05:02.722 --> 00:05:09.735
AND THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.

00:05:09.735 --> 00:05:10.871
SETO,

00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:13.275
ACCORDING TO THE INSCRIPTION
ON THIS TABLET,

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:16.748
YOU WENT ON TO BE A GREAT
PHARAOH IN YOUR OWN RIGHT.

00:05:16.748 --> 00:05:21.257
YOU KEPT MY FATHER'S DREAM ALIVE
BY MAINTAINING PEACE IN EGYPT.

00:05:21.257 --> 00:05:22.559
AND KNOWING THIS,

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:26.233
MY SPIRIT CAN FINALLY
ENTER ITS RESTING PLACE.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:28.538
WAIT, SO WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING?

00:05:28.538 --> 00:05:30.875
I THINK YOU KNOW, YUGI.

00:05:36.014 --> 00:05:37.383
Ishizu: MY PHARAOH,

00:05:37.383 --> 00:05:39.487
WERE YOU ABLE TO RECOVER
YOUR LOST MEMORIES?

00:05:39.487 --> 00:05:40.489
Pharaoh: YES.

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:42.459
THEN AFTER 5,000 YEARS,

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:45.264
OUR FAMILY'S TASK
IS FINALLY COMPLETE.

00:05:45.264 --> 00:05:46.733
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:49.639
AND THE 7 MILLENNIUM
ITEMS ARE GATHERED
TOGETHER AT LAST.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.008
MY KING...

00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:52.210
I KNOW.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.947
NOW I MUST SEAL THEM
AWAY FOREVER

00:05:53.947 --> 00:05:56.118
SO I CAN ENTER
THE SPIRIT WORLD.

00:05:56.118 --> 00:05:57.654
YOU'RE LEAVING US?!

00:05:57.654 --> 00:06:01.662
THIS IS THE FINAL TASK
OF MY MISSION, TEA.

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:03.732
I GUESS I ALWAYS KNEW.

00:06:03.732 --> 00:06:06.070
I MEAN, YOU CAME BACK
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.473
SO YOU COULD REGAIN
YOUR MEMORIES

00:06:07.473 --> 00:06:09.544
AND SAVE THE WORLD.

00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:11.280
AND NOW THAT
YOU'VE DONE THAT,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.020
YOU CAN FINALLY REST.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.326
PHARAOH, IF YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS
WOULD LIKE US TO,

00:06:18.326 --> 00:06:20.932
MARIK AND I CAN LEAD
YOU TO THE FINAL
RESTING PLACE

00:06:20.932 --> 00:06:23.135
OF THE 7 MILLENNIUM
ITEMS.

00:06:23.135 --> 00:06:27.110
YOU MEAN
THE MILLENNIUM STONE?

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.080
AND THE INSCRIPTION
ABOVE THIS ANCIENT STONE

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.219
READS AS FOLLOWS:

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.058
"TO THE SPIRIT WORLD
THOU MAY PROCEED,

00:06:35.058 --> 00:06:38.231
"BUT FIRST THOU MUST
COMPLETE THIS DEED.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.468
"RETURN THE ITEMS
WHENCE THEY CAME

00:06:40.468 --> 00:06:42.806
AND SPEAK ALOUD
THE PHARAOH'S NAME."

00:06:42.806 --> 00:06:45.144
ARE YOU READY
FOR YOUR FINAL TASK?

00:06:45.144 --> 00:06:49.418
YES.

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:50.954
THEN ALLOW ME
TO BE YOUR GUIDE

00:06:50.954 --> 00:06:53.292
TO THE SHRINE
OF THE NEXT WORLD.

00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:10.624
Joey: COULDN'T WE ZIP
OVER TO THIS SHRINE
IN A PLANE?

00:07:10.624 --> 00:07:13.997
I'M AFRAID THIS
SANCTUARY CAN ONLY
BE REACHED BY BOAT.

00:07:13.997 --> 00:07:15.434
WE DON'T WANT
TO RUSH THIS.

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:17.070
THIS IS THE LAST
TRIP WE'LL EVER TAKE

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.639
WITH THE PHARAOH,
DUDE.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.043
SINCE WHEN
ARE YOU SO SAPPY?

00:07:20.043 --> 00:07:21.245
AHEM.

00:07:21.245 --> 00:07:25.219
EH? OHH.

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:26.754
BOATS RULE!
I LOVE BOATS.

00:07:26.754 --> 00:07:27.823
WHO DOESN'T
LOVE BOATS?

00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:31.464
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:34.336
AGES AGO, IT WAS BELIEVED
THAT BOATS WERE THE ONLY VESSELS

00:07:34.336 --> 00:07:37.775
ABLE TO TRANSPORT SPIRITS
TO THE WORLD BEYOND.

00:07:37.775 --> 00:07:39.879
THE WORLD BEYOND?

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:41.349
THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS
BELIEVED

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:43.854
THAT THIS SPIRIT WORLD
EXISTED IN THE WEST,

00:07:43.854 --> 00:07:47.461
WHERE THE SUN SETS.

00:07:47.461 --> 00:07:50.165
AND SO THE PHARAOH'S COURT
ORDERED THIS SANCTUARY

00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:53.405
TO BE BUILT ON AN ISLAND
WEST OF EGYPT.

00:07:53.405 --> 00:07:55.509
Grandpa:
AHOY THERE, MATEYS!

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:58.214
ALL RIGHT, YOU LANDLUBBERS!
CLIMB ABOARD!

00:07:58.214 --> 00:08:00.018
HA HA HA!

00:08:00.018 --> 00:08:01.320
NO WAY!

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.958
WHERE DID YOU GUYS
COME FROM?!

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.797
Duke: ABOUT TIME
YOU GOT HERE.

00:08:06.797 --> 00:08:07.799
Joey: HEY!

00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:09.168
SETO!

00:08:09.168 --> 00:08:10.470
MOKUBA.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.241
WE'VE BEEN BORED
OUT OF OUR MINDS

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:13.777
WAITING FOR YOU GUYS
TO GET HERE!

00:08:13.777 --> 00:08:15.546
Yugi: I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING!

00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:17.083
WELL EVER SINCE
YOU LEFT FOR EGYPT,

00:08:17.083 --> 00:08:19.254
THERE WAS THIS VOICE
INSIDE MY HEAD SAYING,

00:08:19.254 --> 00:08:22.192
"HOW CAN MISS SUCH
A MOMENTOUS EVENT IN
YOUR GRANDSON'S LIFE,

00:08:22.192 --> 00:08:23.595
YOU OLD FOOL?!"

00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:25.565
AND WITH GRAMPS HEARING
VOICES IN HIS HEAD,

00:08:25.565 --> 00:08:27.402
I THOUGHT I SHOULD
COME ALONG, TOO.

00:08:27.402 --> 00:08:29.673
JUST TO KEEP AN EYE
ON THINGS.

00:08:29.673 --> 00:08:33.013
AND WHEN WE GOT HERE,
WE RAN INTO MOKUBA
AT THE AIRPORT.

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.250
YEAH, YOU TOOK OFF
WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE,

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.153
SO ROLAND AND I
TRACKED YOU DOWN.

00:08:37.153 --> 00:08:38.490
I SEE.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.861
I DIDN'T KNOW I NEEDED
TO REPORT EVERY MOVE I MAKE

00:08:40.861 --> 00:08:43.099
TO MY LITTLE BROTHER.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:45.102
WELL, YOU BETTER NOT
DO IT AGAIN.

00:08:45.102 --> 00:08:46.739
OR I'LL TAKE OVER
KAIBA CORP

00:08:46.739 --> 00:08:50.545
AND MAKE YOU
WORK FOR ME!

00:08:50.545 --> 00:08:53.485
Joey: TELL ME
THE TRUTH, DUKE.

00:08:53.485 --> 00:08:55.555
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
ANYONE INVITED ME

00:08:55.555 --> 00:08:57.325
SO I INVITED MYSELF!

00:08:57.325 --> 00:08:58.762
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

00:08:58.762 --> 00:09:00.798
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE
TO GET A PHONE CALL!

00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:03.102
SORRY, DUKE, BUT I HAD
A LOT GOING ON.

00:09:03.102 --> 00:09:05.073
YOUR GRANDFATHER FILLED ME IN
ON THE FLIGHT OVER,

00:09:05.073 --> 00:09:06.609
SO I UNDERSTAND.

00:09:06.609 --> 00:09:08.679
AND WHILE WE WERE WAITING
FOR YOU TO SHOW UP,

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.283
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF EXPLAINING THINGS

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:13.990
TO EVERYONE ELSE
YOU FORGOT TO CALL.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.895
YOU'VE FINALLY DONE IT,
YUGI BOY.

00:09:16.895 --> 00:09:18.832
EVERYTHING I SPENT
MY LIFE CREATING

00:09:18.832 --> 00:09:21.003
HAS BEEN LEADING
UP TO THIS.

00:09:21.003 --> 00:09:23.942
FROM THE MOMENT I RECEIVED
THE MILLENNIUM EYE...

00:09:23.942 --> 00:09:25.378
AAH!

00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:28.116
...TO THE MOMENT I RECREATED
THE ANCIENT SHADOW GAMES

00:09:28.116 --> 00:09:32.992
IN THE FORM OF DUEL MONSTERS.

00:09:32.992 --> 00:09:35.897
IT WAS FATE'S HAND GUIDING ME
TO SET THE STAGE

00:09:35.897 --> 00:09:39.839
FOR THE PHARAOH'S
FINAL JOURNEY HOME.

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:43.045
BUT I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
LED BY FATE.

00:09:43.045 --> 00:09:45.950
EVERY PERSON THE PHARAOH
ENCOUNTERED ALONG THE WAY

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.189
WAS DESTINED TO PLAY
A ROLE IN HIS JOURNEY.

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:52.929
AND I'M WILLING TO BET MOST
OF THEM DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

00:09:57.771 --> 00:10:01.144
Pegasus: BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL,
NO MATTER HOW UTTERLY CLUELESS,

00:10:01.144 --> 00:10:02.982
WAS A NECESSARY PIECE

00:10:02.982 --> 00:10:07.724
NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE PUZZLE
OF THE PHARAOH'S LIFE.

00:10:07.724 --> 00:10:10.663
BE THEY WEIRD FISHERMAN DUELISTS

00:10:10.663 --> 00:10:14.403
OR ANNOYING, MOUSY LITTLE GIRLS,

00:10:14.403 --> 00:10:17.609
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE
HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON:

00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:21.650
EACH ONE IS CONNECTED
BY A YOUNG MAN NAMED YUGI BOY

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.624
AND THAT MYSTERIOUS
ALTER-EGO OF HIS.

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:29.031
AND NOT ONLY DID
THESE INDIVIDUALS HELP YUGI,

00:10:29.031 --> 00:10:33.205
BUT IN TURN, YUGI TOUCHED
EACH OF THEIR LIVES AS WELL.

00:10:37.212 --> 00:10:38.816
I KNOW I'VE SAID IT
A MILLION TIMES,

00:10:38.816 --> 00:10:40.519
BUT THANKS FOR
BEING THERE, GUYS.

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:41.888
OF COURSE.

00:10:41.888 --> 00:10:43.758
Kaiba: ENOUGH ALREADY.

00:10:43.758 --> 00:10:46.563
WHAT ARE YOU STILL HANGING
AROUND FOR ANYWAY, RICH BOY?!

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:48.334
WE HAVE OUR REASONS!

00:10:48.334 --> 00:10:51.773
WHAT ARE
OUR REASONS AGAIN?

00:10:51.773 --> 00:10:53.510
YEAH, WHY DID YOU COME?

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.280
Ishizu: ALTHOUGH
HE'D NEVER ADMIT IT,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.686
KAIBA IS HERE FOR THE SAME
REASON WE'RE ALL HERE:

00:10:58.686 --> 00:11:02.293
TO WITNESS THE PHARAOH'S
FINAL RITE OF PASSAGE.

00:11:02.293 --> 00:11:04.797
SO HE DOES BELIEVE.

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:07.269
Marik: YUGI,
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER,

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:10.776
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU
SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS.

00:11:10.776 --> 00:11:12.445
THERE'S ANOTHER
ANCIENT PASSAGE

00:11:12.445 --> 00:11:14.716
INSCRIBED ABOVE
THE MILLENNIUM STONE.

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.954
IT MENTIONS A BATTLE RITUAL.

00:11:16.954 --> 00:11:19.291
DID YOU SAY "BATTLE"?!

00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:21.796
IN ORDER FOR THE PHARAOH
TO ENTER THE SPIRIT WORLD,

00:11:21.796 --> 00:11:23.033
HE MUST FIRST FACE OFF

00:11:23.033 --> 00:11:26.639
AGAINST A WORTHY OPPONENT
IN BATTLE AND LOSE.

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:28.677
WHAT KIND OF BATTLE
DO YOU MEAN?!

00:11:28.677 --> 00:11:31.415
IN ANCIENT TIMES,
THIS REFERRED TO
A DUEL WITH SWORDS.

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:32.884
BUT, LUCKILY FOR US,

00:11:32.884 --> 00:11:35.021
TODAY WE DUEL
ONE ANOTHER WITH CARDS.

00:11:35.021 --> 00:11:36.524
A DUEL?

00:11:36.524 --> 00:11:38.027
EXACTLY, YUGI.

00:11:38.027 --> 00:11:41.400
I MUST LOSE IN A GAME
OF DUEL MONSTERS.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.370
I DON'T MEAN TO BE
DISRESPECTFUL, MARIK,

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.676
BUT I DON'T GET
WHAT THE CHALLENGE
IS IN LOSING A DUEL.

00:11:46.676 --> 00:11:48.480
Duke:
THINK ABOUT IT, GUYS.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.250
WINNING IS EASY
FOR THE PHARAOH,

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.853
BUT BEING ABLE
TO ACCEPT DEFEAT

00:11:51.853 --> 00:11:55.259
IS PROBABLY THE GREATEST
TEST OF HIS CHARACTER
THERE IS!

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:57.297
YOU MAY HAVE
A POINT THERE, DUKE.

00:11:57.297 --> 00:11:59.300
BUT WHERE ARE
WE GONNA FIND A DUELIST

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.437
WHO'S GOOD ENOUGH
TO BEAT THE PHARAOH?

00:12:14.026 --> 00:12:16.498
YOU KNOW THIS BOAT RIDE
REALLY TAKES ME BACK, YUGE.

00:12:16.498 --> 00:12:18.001
DOESN'T IT SEEM
LIKE JUST YESTERDAY

00:12:18.001 --> 00:12:19.503
WE WERE ALL
ON A BOAT LIKE THIS

00:12:19.503 --> 00:12:22.209
HEADED FOR DUELIST KINGDOM?

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:23.378
YEAH.

00:12:23.378 --> 00:12:24.780
NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN,

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.352
BUT I'VE COME
A LONG WAY SINCE THEN.

00:12:27.352 --> 00:12:28.587
AND IF GIVEN THE CHANCE,

00:12:28.587 --> 00:12:30.524
I COULD KICK
THE PHARAOH'S ANCIENT BUTT!

00:12:30.524 --> 00:12:31.593
WHA...?

00:12:31.593 --> 00:12:33.329
All: HUH?

00:12:33.329 --> 00:12:35.835
Joey: ALL RIGHT,
SO MAYBE I CAME ON
A LITTLE STRONG THERE.

00:12:35.835 --> 00:12:37.337
A LITTLE STRONG?!

00:12:37.337 --> 00:12:38.806
NOW I MEANT TO SAY...

00:12:38.806 --> 00:12:40.911
I'D LIKE A SHOT
AGAINST THE PHARAOH.

00:12:40.911 --> 00:12:41.913
IT'S TOO RISKY!

00:12:41.913 --> 00:12:43.115
Tea: YOU'LL LOSE!

00:12:43.115 --> 00:12:44.117
Duke:
THERE'S NO CHANCE!

00:12:44.117 --> 00:12:45.286
THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT,

00:12:45.286 --> 00:12:46.655
BUT SOMEONE'S GOTTA
BEAT THE PHARAOH,

00:12:46.655 --> 00:12:47.924
SO WHY NOT ME?

00:12:47.924 --> 00:12:50.295
Kaiba: BECAUSE YOU'RE
A JOKE, WHEELER.

00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:51.597
YOU TALKING TO ME?!

00:12:51.597 --> 00:12:53.434
DON'T YOU LOSERS REALIZE

00:12:53.434 --> 00:12:56.139
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
THIS MOMENT FOR YEARS?

00:12:56.139 --> 00:12:59.178
I CHALLENGE YOU
TO THE ULTIMATE DUEL!

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:00.782
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

00:13:00.782 --> 00:13:02.885
NOW, WAIT A SECOND HERE!

00:13:02.885 --> 00:13:06.058
I WAS IN LINE FIRST!

00:13:06.058 --> 00:13:07.695
HEY! YOU'RE--

00:13:07.695 --> 00:13:09.564
I'M GONNA
MAKE THIS BRIEF.

00:13:09.564 --> 00:13:12.103
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN ALL THIS ANCIENT
EGYPTIAN NONSENSE

00:13:12.103 --> 00:13:13.772
AND I NEVER DID.

00:13:13.772 --> 00:13:16.243
BUT I DESERVE
A SHOT AGAINST YOU!

00:13:16.243 --> 00:13:18.247
YOU MEAN THE PHARAOH.

00:13:18.247 --> 00:13:20.485
IT DOES MAKE SENSE.

00:13:20.485 --> 00:13:22.756
AFTER ALL, YOU GUYS HAVE
HAD A RIVALRY GOING ON

00:13:22.756 --> 00:13:25.227
EVER SINCE HE SHOWED UP
IN THIS WORLD.

00:13:25.227 --> 00:13:27.665
THEN LET'S DO THIS.

00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:29.836
ACTUALLY...NO.

00:13:29.836 --> 00:13:31.740
I'VE ALREADY
MADE MY CHOICE.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.376
I'M GONNA DUEL
THE PHARAOH.

00:13:33.376 --> 00:13:34.879
YOU'RE WHAT?!

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:36.648
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN.

00:13:36.648 --> 00:13:37.650
DON'T YOU SEE, GUYS?

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.652
THIS DUEL WILL BE

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.957
A TEST FOR ME TOO.

00:13:40.957 --> 00:13:43.595
HOW DO I PUT THIS?

00:13:43.595 --> 00:13:46.934
YOU CAN'T PLAY A DUEL
AGAINST YOURSELF, YUGE.

00:13:46.934 --> 00:13:47.936
I DON'T PLAN TO.

00:13:47.936 --> 00:13:49.305
THAT'S IT!

00:13:49.305 --> 00:13:50.776
I'M NOT GONNA
STAND HERE

00:13:50.776 --> 00:13:54.081
AND WATCH YOU
GIVE A TITLE SHOT TO
YOUR IMAGINARY FRIEND!

00:13:54.081 --> 00:13:55.651
DROP HIM, RICH BOY.

00:13:55.651 --> 00:13:58.791
TRUST ME, THIS IS SOMETHING
I KNOW I NEED TO DO!

00:13:58.791 --> 00:14:05.035
AND DEEP DOWN,
YOU KNOW IT, TOO.

00:14:05.035 --> 00:14:06.304
YUGE!

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:10.546
MOKUBA.

00:14:10.546 --> 00:14:12.148
ALL RIGHT, YUGI.

00:14:12.148 --> 00:14:14.252
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF STUNT YOU'RE
PULLING...

00:14:14.252 --> 00:14:15.621
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA
BE DUELING,

00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:18.160
THEN YOU MAY AS WELL
BUILD YOURSELF
A REAL DECK,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.800
NOT THAT
BARGAIN-BASEMENT
DECK YOU USE.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.305
WOW, THAT'S A PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION...

00:14:24.305 --> 00:14:26.509
BUT I WON'T BE
NEEDING IT, KAIBA.

00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:27.978
NO WAY!

00:14:27.978 --> 00:14:29.782
I'LL BE STICKING
WITH MY USUAL DECK.

00:14:29.782 --> 00:14:31.719
THE PHARAOH AND I
BUILT IT TOGETHER,

00:14:31.719 --> 00:14:34.090
SO IT'S ONLY FITTING
THAT I USE THAT ONE.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.192
MAKES SENSE.

00:14:35.192 --> 00:14:36.561
IF YOU WANT TO LOSE!

00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:38.197
WHAT A WASTE
OF TIME!

00:14:38.197 --> 00:14:40.201
SETO! WAIT!

00:14:40.201 --> 00:14:42.072
ENJOY THE CRUISE.

00:14:48.316 --> 00:14:49.452
Yugi: COME IN.

00:14:49.452 --> 00:14:51.189
Tea: HEY, YUGI.
HAVE A SEC?

00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:52.591
SURE, TEA.

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:54.261
SO, WHAT'S UP?

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.365
AS THE SELF-APPOINTED
CRUISE DIRECTOR,

00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:58.702
I THOUGHT I'D TELL YOU
WE ARRIVE TOMORROW.

00:14:58.702 --> 00:15:01.073
COOL. THANKS.

00:15:01.073 --> 00:15:02.977
I GUESS YOU'RE
GETTING READY

00:15:02.977 --> 00:15:05.750
FOR YOUR BIG DUEL
AGAINST THE PHARAOH,
HUH?

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.454
YEAH. IT'S SORT OF
LIKE MY FINAL GIFT TO HIM

00:15:08.454 --> 00:15:09.857
BEFORE HE LEAVES US
FOREVER.

00:15:09.857 --> 00:15:14.032
I GET IT!

00:15:14.032 --> 00:15:17.205
I GUESS I DON'T
WANT TO SEE HIM GO,
THAT'S ALL.

00:15:17.205 --> 00:15:18.674
NEITHER DO I,

00:15:18.674 --> 00:15:21.011
BUT IT'S TIME FOR HIM
TO MOVE ON, TEA.

00:15:21.011 --> 00:15:22.715
BESIDES IF I WIN,

00:15:22.715 --> 00:15:25.620
THAT MEANS I'M READY
TO SEPARATE FROM HIM, TOO.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.122
OH.

00:15:27.122 --> 00:15:28.793
[THINKING]
YUGI'S RIGHT,

00:15:28.793 --> 00:15:30.997
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE
THIS ANY EASIER.

00:15:30.997 --> 00:15:32.666
YOU OK?

00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:34.904
OH, YEAH,
EVERYTHING'S GREAT!

00:15:34.904 --> 00:15:38.244
I SHOULD REALLY LET
YOU GET BACK TO DOING
YOUR THING NOW.

00:15:38.244 --> 00:15:41.550
ALL RIGHT, SO...GREAT,
THEN I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.123
GOOD NIGHT, TEA.

00:15:45.123 --> 00:15:46.693
PHARAOH, I HAVE A FEELING

00:15:46.693 --> 00:15:50.133
SHE WANTED TO SAY
GOODBYE TO YOU.

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:52.671
SORRY.

00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:55.644
[THINKING] I KNOW THIS IS
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PHARAOH.

00:15:55.644 --> 00:15:57.914
HE DOESN'T BELONG IN THIS WORLD

00:15:57.914 --> 00:15:59.917
AND NOW THAT HE HAS
HIS MEMORY BACK

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.289
HE CAN FINALLY BE FREE.

00:16:02.289 --> 00:16:04.927
BUT SECRETLY,
I KEEP HOPING YUGI'S GONNA LOSE

00:16:04.927 --> 00:16:10.805
SO THE PHARAOH HAS TO STAY.

00:16:10.805 --> 00:16:12.374
[THINKING] BEFORE I SOLVED
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:16:12.374 --> 00:16:15.280
I WAS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON:

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:22.093
TIMID...SHY...LONELY.

00:16:22.093 --> 00:16:25.700
AAH!

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.202
[THINKING]
BUT EVER SINCE THAT DAY,

00:16:27.202 --> 00:16:29.239
WHEN THE PHARAOH AND I
JOINED TOGETHER,

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:32.312
I'VE BEEN STRONG AND CONFIDENT.

00:16:32.312 --> 00:16:34.283
AND IF I WIN THAT DUEL
TOMORROW...

00:16:34.283 --> 00:16:37.889
I'LL PROVE THAT I'M READY
TO FACE THE WORLD ON MY OWN.

00:16:37.889 --> 00:16:40.761
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS REMEMBER
EVERYTHING THE PHARAOH TAUGHT ME

00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:42.331
AND I CAN DO THIS!

00:16:50.145 --> 00:16:52.282
Duke: THERE HE IS.

00:16:52.282 --> 00:16:54.586
DUDE, WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.

00:16:54.586 --> 00:16:56.257
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
STILL DOWN IN THE DUMPS

00:16:56.257 --> 00:16:59.095
ABOUT NOT GETTING
TO DUEL AGAINST
THE PHARAOH.

00:16:59.095 --> 00:17:02.234
JUST LET GO, MAN.

00:17:02.234 --> 00:17:03.938
YOU KNOW,
BEING ON THIS BOAT

00:17:03.938 --> 00:17:05.340
HAS MADE ME DO
A LOT OF THINKING

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.078
ABOUT THE LAST FEW
YEARS OF MY LIFE.

00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:09.414
LET ME TELL YOU,

00:17:09.414 --> 00:17:11.986
A LOT'S CHANGED
SINCE I MET THE PHARAOH.

00:17:11.986 --> 00:17:14.224
HE TAUGHT ME THAT
EVEN WHEN THE ODDS
ARE AGAINST YOU,

00:17:14.224 --> 00:17:15.259
YOU HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING

00:17:15.259 --> 00:17:17.997
AND NEVER GIVE UP
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:17:17.997 --> 00:17:21.237
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE WHOSE
LIFE HE CHANGED EVEN MORE.

00:17:21.237 --> 00:17:23.208
YEAH, YUGI'S.

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:26.513
AND THAT'S WHY YUGI NEEDS
TO BE THE ONE TO DUEL HIM.

00:17:26.513 --> 00:17:29.519
TO SEE IF HE'S FINALLY
READY TO BE ON HIS OWN.

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:31.990
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A LOT
SMARTER THAN YOU LOOK.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.631
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:38.336
[THINKING] SO LET'S SAY
THIS PHARAOH DOES EXIST.

00:17:38.336 --> 00:17:41.709
AND HE'S THE REASON
YUGI'S BEEN WINNING
DUELS ALL THESE YEARS.

00:17:41.709 --> 00:17:43.813
THEN HOW ON EARTH
IS A TWERP LIKE YUGI

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.651
GONNA DEFEAT
THE TRUE KING OF GAMES?!

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.558
THAT WAS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

00:18:07.558 --> 00:18:09.627
[SIGHS]

00:18:09.627 --> 00:18:11.298
IS IT SAFE
TO COME OUT NOW?

00:18:11.298 --> 00:18:12.700
HAVE YOU CHOSEN
YOUR CARDS?

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.404
YUP, MY DECK'S COMPLETE.

00:18:14.404 --> 00:18:16.106
WAIT, SO IS THAT WHY
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU

00:18:16.106 --> 00:18:17.743
IN THE PAST FEW HOURS?

00:18:17.743 --> 00:18:18.879
YES.

00:18:18.879 --> 00:18:21.083
I TRAVELED TO A DISTANT
CORNER OF YOUR MIND

00:18:21.083 --> 00:18:23.321
TO GIVE YOU SOME PRIVACY.

00:18:23.321 --> 00:18:25.290
IT'S ONLY FAIR.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.231
THE CARDS IN MY OPPONENT'S
DECK SHOULD BE A MYSTERY.

00:18:29.231 --> 00:18:31.001
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

00:18:31.001 --> 00:18:33.907
I DON'T PLAN
ON GOING EASY ON YOU
IN TOMORROW'S DUEL.

00:18:33.907 --> 00:18:35.643
GOOD.

00:18:35.643 --> 00:18:38.849
PLUS I'VE GOTTEN TO
KNOW YOUR STRATEGIES
PRETTY WELL.

00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:42.824
HEY, WHEN YOU SHARE
A MIND WITH SOMEONE
FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE,

00:18:42.824 --> 00:18:44.193
YOU TEND TO LEARN
A THING OR TWO

00:18:44.193 --> 00:18:47.699
ABOUT HOW
THE OTHER ONE THINKS.

00:18:47.699 --> 00:18:50.739
WELL, I GUESS
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO PICK YOUR DECK.

00:18:50.739 --> 00:18:53.510
AND DON'T WORRY,
I PROMISE I WON'T PEEK.

00:19:01.692 --> 00:19:04.665
[THINKING] THIS IS BY FAR
THE TOUGHEST DUEL OF MY LIFE.

00:19:04.665 --> 00:19:07.704
NOT JUST BECAUSE THE PHARAOH
IS SUCH A GREAT DUELIST,

00:19:07.704 --> 00:19:11.711
BUT BECAUSE WINNING THIS DUEL
MEANS LOSING MY CLOSEST FRIEND.

00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:18.357
[THINKING] I FEEL AS THOUGH
EVERY OPPONENT I'VE EVER FACED

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:21.596
WAS PREPARING ME
FOR THIS MOMENT.

00:19:21.596 --> 00:19:25.236
THE MOMENT THAT WILL DECIDE
THE FATE OF MY SPIRIT.

00:19:25.236 --> 00:19:27.941
IF I WIN, I REMAIN HERE,

00:19:27.941 --> 00:19:29.745
SEALED WITHIN
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:19:29.745 --> 00:19:31.214
BUT IF I LOSE,

00:19:31.214 --> 00:19:35.389
I'M FREE TO ENTER
THE SPIRIT WORLD WHERE I BELONG.

00:19:35.389 --> 00:19:37.760
WITHIN THAT BOX
LIES YUGI'S DECK,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.233
CHOSEN FROM A COLLECTION
THAT WE CREATED TOGETHER...

00:19:41.233 --> 00:19:44.439
BUT BUILT COMPLETELY ON HIS OWN.

00:19:44.439 --> 00:19:47.445
AND NOW IT IS MY TURN
TO DO THE SAME.

00:19:58.532 --> 00:20:01.471
Pharaoh: IT IS NOW COMPLETE!

00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:04.744
I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN BUILDING
MY STRONGEST DECK EVER.

00:20:04.744 --> 00:20:08.384
AND NOW THE TIME HAS COME
TO PUT IT TO THE TEST.

00:20:08.384 --> 00:20:11.223
YUGI! IT'S TIME TO DUEL!

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:24.347
OH!

00:20:24.347 --> 00:20:28.889
Joey: LOOK WHO DECIDED
TO ROLL OUT OF BED.

00:20:28.889 --> 00:20:30.593
GOOD LUCK.

00:20:30.593 --> 00:20:33.331
Joey: I SAY WE GET
THIS DUEL ON THE ROAD!

00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:34.617
LET'S GO.
