WHEN WE FIRST
ARRIVED HERE...

00:18:23.719 --> 00:18:26.856
THERE WERE THREE APPLES
RESTING UPON THREE PILLARS.

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:29.992
BUT WHEN WE RETURNED
THERE WERE ONLY TWO APPLES.

00:18:29.992 --> 00:18:31.260
WASN'T ME!

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.129
I ALREADY HAD
A SNACK IN THE MAZE!

00:18:33.129 --> 00:18:35.898
I KNEW ALL THREE APPLES
HAD TO HAVE BEEN PUT
THERE FOR A REASON,

00:18:35.898 --> 00:18:38.434
BUT THE RIDDLE
ONLY MENTIONED ONE.

00:18:38.434 --> 00:18:40.336
WE WERE ASKED TO
"CHOOSE THE APPLE

00:18:40.336 --> 00:18:42.672
THAT GIVES YOU A RAISE."

00:18:42.672 --> 00:18:44.006
YES BUT HOW?

00:18:44.006 --> 00:18:45.508
ALL THREE OF THOSE
APPLES LOOKED

00:18:45.508 --> 00:18:47.543
EXACTLY THE SAME
TO ME.

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:50.179
THEY WERE.
EACH ONE OF THEM HAD
THE ABILITY TO RAISE

00:18:50.179 --> 00:18:52.048
A MONSTER'S STRENGTH.

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:54.083
BUT EACH HAD ITS OWN JOB.

00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:56.986
THE FIRST APPLE WAS CONSUMED
BY THAT CATERPILLAR,

00:18:56.986 --> 00:19:00.857
CAUSING IT TO EVOLVE
INTO A GREAT MOTH!

00:19:00.857 --> 00:19:03.092
I GET IT!
SO THAT'S WHY
IT WAS CALLED

00:19:03.092 --> 00:19:05.494
THE "APPLE THAT GIVES
YOU A RAISE" RIGHT?

00:19:05.494 --> 00:19:07.296
MAKES SENSE.
I KINDA NOTICED

00:19:07.296 --> 00:19:08.798
THAT ALL THE FRUIT
AROUND THESE PARTS

00:19:08.798 --> 00:19:10.766
PACKS A BIT
OF A PUNCH.

00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:12.335
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND I KNEW IF I ATE

00:19:12.335 --> 00:19:14.904
THE SECOND APPLE
MY STRENGTH WOULD GROW.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:17.039
SO THAT LEAVES ONE LEFT.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.407
THAT MUST BE
THE APPLE YOU NEED

00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:20.443
TO "OFFER UP" TO
COMPLETE THE CHALLENGE.

00:19:20.443 --> 00:19:22.979
AWESOME!
SO YOU ACED THE TEST!

00:19:22.979 --> 00:19:25.514
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
LEFT TO DO NOW.

00:19:25.514 --> 00:19:27.884
GIVE THAT GOLDEN
DELICIOUS BACK.

00:19:27.884 --> 00:19:29.418
NICE WORK,
YOU GUYS.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:32.722
BY THE WAY, TRISTAN,
HOW DID YOU GUYS MISS
ALL THE ACTION?

00:19:32.722 --> 00:19:34.123
AND WHERE'S
YOUR MONSTER?

00:19:34.123 --> 00:19:35.825
HE'S SLEEPING.

00:19:35.825 --> 00:19:38.127
I GUESS CAREENING
AROUND LIKE
A LUNATIC

00:19:38.127 --> 00:19:39.462
AND BUSTING THROUGH
EVERYTHING IN SIGHT

00:19:39.462 --> 00:19:41.530
FINALLY
TOOK ITS TOLL
ON THE BIG BRUTE.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.167
[SNORING]

00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:46.736
I HAVE
A DUMB QUESTION.

00:19:46.736 --> 00:19:48.638
WHATTA YOU THINK
THE RIDDLE MEANT

00:19:48.638 --> 00:19:50.640
WHEN IT SAID
TO "OFFER UP"
THE APPLE?

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.774
Grandpa: HMM.

00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:02.418
SO THAT'S WHERE
THESE STAIRS LEAD.

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:13.529
[GROANING]

00:20:20.036 --> 00:20:21.337
WELL DONE!

00:20:21.337 --> 00:20:23.706
I GUESS IT'S ON TO
LEVEL FIVE, HUH.

00:20:23.706 --> 00:20:24.974
ONE MORE LEFT.

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.075
AWESOME!

00:20:26.075 --> 00:20:27.209
WELL WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR?!

00:20:27.209 --> 00:20:28.711
LET'S FINISH THIS
THING AND GO HOME!

00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:29.812
RIGHT, GUYS!?

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:36.719
RIGHT!
RIGHT!

00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:38.888
Joey: I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET BACK
TO THE REAL WORLD.

00:20:38.888 --> 00:20:40.990
YEAH. WHERE YOU
CAN SIT DOWN
AND EAT A MELON

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.959
WITHOUT IT
RUNNING AWAY!
