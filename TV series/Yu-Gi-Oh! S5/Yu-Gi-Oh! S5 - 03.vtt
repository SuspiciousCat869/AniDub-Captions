IS WEAKER THAN HIS, MAN!

GRACEFUL DICE!

00:13:56.978 --> 00:13:59.416
NOW MY MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS
WILL INCREASE

00:13:59.416 --> 00:14:04.892
DEPENDING ON
THE NUMBER I ROLL.

00:14:04.892 --> 00:14:07.898
AHA! I HAD A HUNCH
YOU MIGHT TRY THAT!

00:14:07.898 --> 00:14:10.236
AND THAT'S WHY
I PLAYED THIS.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.324
THIS TRAP CARD
AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATES

00:14:22.324 --> 00:14:24.761
WHENEVER MY OPPONENT
ROLLS A DIE.

00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:27.233
SO IF I ROLL A HIGHER
NUMBER THAN YOU,

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:28.735
YOUR CARD
IS CANCELED OUT!

00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:32.142

TOO BAD!

00:14:37.284 --> 00:14:42.193
SO WHAT!
JOEY ALWAYS HAS
A BACK-UP PLAN!

00:14:42.193 --> 00:14:44.931
NOW SKULL DICE
WILL LOWER YOUR
MONSTER'S STRENGTH

00:14:44.931 --> 00:14:50.807
DEPENDING ON
WHAT I ROLL!

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:54.614
THE LEGENDARY GAMBLER
IS A CONTINUOUS TRAP CARD

00:14:54.614 --> 00:15:00.625
WHICH MEANS
I ALSO ROLL AGAIN!

00:15:00.625 --> 00:15:02.228

00:15:02.228 --> 00:15:04.666
OH, WELL!
READ IT AND WEEP!

00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:05.801
NO!

00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:07.772
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE BACK
WHERE WE STARTED!

00:15:07.772 --> 00:15:13.748
SO, WANDERING MUMMY,
ATTACK HIS SWORDSMAN!

00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:17.889
UGH!

00:15:17.889 --> 00:15:19.726

00:15:19.726 --> 00:15:21.897
BETTER THAN
YOU KNOW YOURSELF.

00:15:21.897 --> 00:15:23.499
HEH...

00:15:23.499 --> 00:15:25.102
LOOK,

YOU JUST GOT LUCKY,
DAT'S ALL.

00:15:26.671 --> 00:15:28.074
SO I'LL SWITCH
MY LITTLE WINGUARD

00:15:28.074 --> 00:15:30.678
TO DEFENSE MODE
AND END MY TURN.

00:15:30.678 --> 00:15:32.916
GO, SHORT STUFF.

00:15:32.916 --> 00:15:35.254

BY HIS TEACHER.

00:15:35.254 --> 00:15:37.157

NON-AGGRESSION AREA!

00:15:46.207 --> 00:15:48.143
OF COURSE,
IN ORDER TO ACTIVATE IT,

00:15:48.143 --> 00:15:51.449
I NEED TO DISCARD ONE CARD
FROM MY HAND.

00:15:51.449 --> 00:15:53.987
SORRY, BUT I'VE
RENDERED YOU UNABLE

00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:56.659
TO SUMMON ANY MONSTERS
IN YOUR NEXT TURN.

00:15:56.659 --> 00:15:57.961
NO WAY!

00:15:57.961 --> 00:16:00.766
I'M AFRAID
IT GETS WORSE, JUNIOR!

00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:03.604

OF NIGHTMARE!

00:16:03.604 --> 00:16:06.042

CONTINUE TO DRAW

00:16:06.042 --> 00:16:10.149
UNTIL I'M HOLDING
4 CARDS IN MY HAND!

00:16:10.149 --> 00:16:12.320
IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE YOUR KEISTER

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.691
IS REMOVED
FROM THIS TOURNAMENT!

00:16:20.599 --> 00:16:22.770
NO ONE CAN SURVIVE
THE WRATH OF GRANDPA!

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.874
I MEAN, APDNARG!

00:16:24.874 --> 00:16:27.779
SO CONSIDER YOURSELF
WARNED, WHIPPERSNAPPER!

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:31.319
I DON'T THINK SO...PAL!

00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:34.157
I HOPE THIS
ISN'T A BAD TIME,

00:16:34.157 --> 00:16:38.297
BUT I SHOULD REMIND YOU
THAT MY MAGIC CARD
ACTIVATES NOW!

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:40.068
THIS LETS ME DRAW
3 CARDS,

00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:42.939
GIVING ME A TOTAL
OF 4 IN MY HAND.

00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:45.711
I KNOW HOW YOUR
MAGIC CARD WORKS,
APDNARG!

00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:49.284
IT ALSO MEANS
YOU HAVE TO THROW OUT
3 CARDS NEXT TURN!

00:16:49.284 --> 00:16:50.853
OR DO I?!

00:16:50.853 --> 00:16:54.426
TA-DA! REVEAL
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS!

00:16:54.426 --> 00:16:57.098
THIS ALLOWS ME
TO SEND ONE MAGIC
OR TRAP CARD

00:16:57.098 --> 00:16:59.702
ON MY SIDE OF THE FIELD
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:16:59.702 --> 00:17:03.376
OH, AND I GAIN 1,000
EXTRA LIFE POINTS
FOR GOOD MEASURE.

00:17:03.376 --> 00:17:05.446
WHY I OUGHTTA...

00:17:05.446 --> 00:17:07.816
AND, OF COURSE,
THE CARD I'M REMOVING IS...

00:17:07.816 --> 00:17:10.454
MIRAGE OF NIGHTMARE!

00:17:10.454 --> 00:17:12.292
NOT ONLY TO I GET
TO KEEP MY HAND,

00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:15.965
BUT I GET SOME
BONUS POINTS TO BOOT!

00:17:15.965 --> 00:17:18.403
AH, SO YOU WANNA
PLAY ROUGH, DO YA?!

00:17:18.403 --> 00:17:22.510
WELL, WAIT'LL YA SEE
WHAT I'VE GOT!

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.313
OH, UH-UH-UH...

00:17:24.313 --> 00:17:26.150
HOW QUICKLY WE FORGET.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.521
MY TRAP CARD
IS STILL IN EFFECT,

00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:32.962
SO I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T
SUMMON A MONSTER,
MY ADOLESCENT FRIEND!

00:17:32.962 --> 00:17:36.201
YA DON'T HAFTA
REMIND ME HOW TO PLAY
THE GAME, JUST GO!

00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:39.874
APPARENTLY I DO,
JOSEPH.

00:17:39.874 --> 00:17:41.978
NOW I PLAY...

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:45.551
A MAGIC CARD
KNOWN AS ANCIENT CITY!

00:17:56.036 --> 00:17:57.572
WHAT IS DAT THING?

00:17:57.572 --> 00:17:59.275
WELL, AS THE CARD'S
NAME SUGGESTS,

00:17:59.275 --> 00:18:00.611
IT'S AN ANCIENT CITY,

00:18:00.611 --> 00:18:02.814
BUT THAT'S JUST
THE BEGINNING

00:18:02.814 --> 00:18:06.121
OF MY ARCHEOLOGICAL
ASSAULT!

00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:10.128
NEXT I SACRIFICE
WANDERING MUMMY...

00:18:10.128 --> 00:18:16.139
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
MY ANCIENT GIANT!

00:18:16.139 --> 00:18:19.244
OF COURSE, IT COMES
WITH A SLIGHT CATCH.

00:18:19.244 --> 00:18:22.050
AS LONG AS IT REMAINS
FACE UP ON THE FIELD,

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.921
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO ATTACK YOU WITH IT.

00:18:24.921 --> 00:18:28.594
AND IF I DON'T ATTACK,
THEN I LOSE 300
OF MY LIFE POINTS!

00:18:28.594 --> 00:18:29.863
[GRUMBLING]

00:18:29.863 --> 00:18:33.102
JOEY DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST THAT THING!

00:18:33.102 --> 00:18:35.106
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
A MAGIC CARD

00:18:35.106 --> 00:18:37.309
KNOWN AS ANCIENT KEY!

00:18:42.418 --> 00:18:44.456
THIS KEY LETS ME
UNLOCK THE POWER

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:47.294
OF MY STONE GIANT TOKENS!

00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:58.380
AND THEY COME
WITH A TWIST, ALSO.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.687
IF I LEAVE THEM
BOTH FACE UP
AND DON'T ATTACK,

00:19:01.687 --> 00:19:04.925
THEN 1,000
OF MY LIFE POINTS
GET TAKEN AWAY.

00:19:04.925 --> 00:19:06.394
[GRUMBLING]

00:19:06.394 --> 00:19:10.335
NOW, ANCIENT GIANT,
ATTACK HIS LITTLE WINGUARD!

00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:15.544
UGH! UNH!

00:19:15.544 --> 00:19:17.114
THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:21.522
NEXT MY STONE GIANTS
WILL ATTACK YOUR
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:19:26.297 --> 00:19:30.871
AAH!

00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:33.509
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW
THAT I'M DONE...

00:19:33.509 --> 00:19:35.580
FOR NOW.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.520
SO I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.591
NOT TOO SHABBY, HUH?

00:19:41.591 --> 00:19:43.127
ONE MORE DIRECT ATTACK,

00:19:43.127 --> 00:19:45.698
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS
GO DOWN TO ZILCH!

00:19:45.698 --> 00:19:49.252
I'D SUGGEST YOU COME UP
WITH A STRATEGY
PRETTY QUICKLY,

00:19:49.252 --> 00:19:53.022
OR I'M AFRAID
YOUR TOURNAMENT DAYS
ARE OVER!

00:19:53.022 --> 00:19:54.557
OH, NO.

00:19:54.557 --> 00:19:58.027
YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR AN OLD PRO LIKE ME.

00:19:58.027 --> 00:19:59.395
WE'LL SEE.

00:19:59.395 --> 00:20:03.032
WITH NO MONSTERS
TO PROTECT YOU
FROM MY GIANTS,

00:20:03.032 --> 00:20:06.102
YOU WON'T MAKE IT
PAST THE NEXT TURN!
