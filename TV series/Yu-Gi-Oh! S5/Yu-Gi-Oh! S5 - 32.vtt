WEBVTT

00:00:00.064 --> 00:00:04.065
PREVIOUSLY ON YU-GI-OH...

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:08.607
IF I'M UNABLE TO SAVE
MANKIND FROM THE EVIL
THAT'S ABOUT TO UNFOLD

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:10.676
WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE FUTURE?

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:14.451
THE SAFETY OF MY FRIENDS DEPENDS
UPON MY VICTORY.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:19.460
IN ORDER TO DEFEAT BAKURA,
I MUST RELEASE THE POWER
I SEALED AWAY SO LONG AGO.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.866
SACRED MILLENNIUM RING
I CALL UPON THEE.

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.704
UNLOCK THE GREAT FORCE
I BURIED HERE!

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:26.706
FOLLOW ME!

00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:31.081
NOW!

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.019
BEST OF LUCK, MASTER MAHAD.

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.392
I GUESS
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME NOW.

00:00:36.392 --> 00:00:42.136
COME OUT, COME OUT
WHEREVER YOU ARE!

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:44.874
LET THE FESTIVITIES COMMENCE.

00:00:44.874 --> 00:00:47.011
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:48.681
LET'S DUEL!!

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:55.493

♪ YU-GI-OH ♪

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:58.745
SIR, BAKURA'S HENCHMEN
ARE GROWING RESTLESS!

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:00.949
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:03.086
THEIR MASTER IS TRAPPED
IN THIS CAVERN.

00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:05.257
YES AS IS
OUR OWN MASTER.

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:11.202
RAISE THE TABLET!

00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:16.779
AS SOON AS BAKURA'S DIABOUND
APPEARS ON THIS STONE, WE'LL
KNOW THE DEED IS DONE.

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.152
THAT SHADOW CREATURE
WILL BE SEALED FOR ETERNITY!

00:02:20.152 --> 00:02:24.025
NOW IN THE NAME OF OUR KING LET
US FIGHT TO PROTECT THE PEACE!

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:25.829
LONG LIVE THE PHARAOH!

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.932
LONG LIVE
THE PHARAOH!

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.360
YOU HAVE DISHONORED
MY KING

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.633
AND THREATENED
THE SAFETY OF MY PEOPLE!

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:48.304
NOW IT IS TIME FOR YOU
TO PAY THE PRICE!

00:02:48.304 --> 00:02:49.840
OH PLEASE.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.510
YOU ALREADY
HAD YOUR CHANCE.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.313
NOW HAND OVER
THE MILLENNIUM RING

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.417
AND YOU'LL MAKE IT HOME
WITH YOUR SOUL INTACT!

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:58.189
I SHALL NEVER HAND IT
TO THE LIKES OF YOU!

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.627
IN FACT IT IS I
WHO SHALL SEE TO IT

00:03:00.627 --> 00:03:02.898
THAT YOUR SOUL IS
THE ONE SEALED AWAY!

00:03:02.898 --> 00:03:04.935
HA HA HA!

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:08.709
YOU COULDN'T EVEN DEFEAT ME
WITH YOUR SIX FRIENDS
AT YOUR SIDE!

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.585
YES, BUT NOW
I AM MORE POWERFUL
THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.

00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:17.391
LONG AGO
I BURIED A MIGHTY FORCE
UPON THESE GROUNDS.

00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:20.397
AND NOW I'VE GAINED
IT BACK!

00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:22.602
NONSENSE.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.806
GENERATIONS OF EGYPT'S
ROYAL MAGICIANS

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:27.110
WERE TRAINED
IN THIS VERY SANCTUARY

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.550
AND IT IS HERE THAT
I LOCKED AWAY MY TRUE
POWER!

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.052
THEN LET'S SEE YOU
USE IT!

00:03:32.052 --> 00:03:33.288
HA HA!

00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:36.527
COME FORTH...
ALMIGHTY DIABOUND!

00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:45.845
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOUR CREATURE LOOKED LIKE
IN OUR LAST ENCOUNTER!

00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:47.949
AS THE DARKNESS
WITHIN ME GROWS,

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.854
MY BEAST
CONTINUES TO EVOLVE!

00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:54.227
MY MONSTER'S STRENGTH
HAS ALSO GROWN
SINCE LAST WE MET!

00:03:54.227 --> 00:03:56.998
ILLUSION MAGICIAN,
COME HITHER!

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.850
LET THE SHOWDOWN
COMMENCE!

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.486
HA HA HA!

00:04:13.424 --> 00:04:15.861
WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S TIME
TO DUEL, ISN'T IT!?

00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:17.698
OR AS YOU SAY HERE
IN EGYPT...

00:04:17.698 --> 00:04:18.833
Both: DIAHA!

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:21.706
NOW, MIGHTY BEAST,
ATTACK HIS MAGICIAN!

00:04:21.706 --> 00:04:27.516
POISON FANG STRIKE!

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:30.622
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT!

00:04:30.622 --> 00:04:35.531
NOW ILLUSION MAGICIAN,
IT IS TIME FOR YOU
TO COUNTER ATTACK!

00:04:41.008 --> 00:04:45.884
AND NEXT...
I SHALL GATHER UP
MY OWN MAGICAL ENERGY.

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:48.322
AND TRANSFER IT
TO MY MAGICIAN,

00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:50.659
INCREASING HIS
ATTACK STRENGTH!

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:06.856
HOW CAN A MERE "SPELLCASTER"
DAMAGE MY DIABOUND!?

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:12.167
I REFUSE TO ALLOW BAKURA
TO THREATEN MY PEOPLE.

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:15.005
EVEN IF IT
MEANS DEPLETING
MY OWN POWERS...

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:20.949
I MUST STOP HIM...
IN THE NAME OF
THE PHARAOH!

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.853
OH NO.

00:05:22.853 --> 00:05:25.124
I SENSE GREAT DANGER.

00:05:34.107 --> 00:05:37.379
IT'S AS IF ONE OF MY SACRED
GUARDIANS IS IN JEOPARDY.

00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:44.994
MAHAD'S TABLET SHRINE
IS ACTIVATING!

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:48.968
COULD THIS MEAN HE'S ENGAGING
HIS CREATURES IN A SHADOW GAME!?

00:05:56.048 --> 00:05:57.217
MAHAD!

00:05:57.217 --> 00:06:01.358
NO!

00:06:01.358 --> 00:06:05.499
DONATING YOUR OWN ENERGY TO YOUR
MAGICIAN WAS QUITE FOOLISH.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:09.673
SURE YOUR MONSTER MAY BE
A BIT STRONGER...

00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:12.913
HOWEVER YOU'VE LEFT YOURSELF
SOMEWHAT VULNERABLE HAVEN'T YOU?

00:06:12.913 --> 00:06:14.348
WRONG!

00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:16.419
MY LOYAL CREATURES
WILL PROTECT ME.

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.996
AND TOGETHER
WE SHALL WIN!

00:06:21.996 --> 00:06:24.200
MAGICIAN ATTACK!

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.003
DIABOUND!

00:06:26.003 --> 00:06:31.113
STRIKE HIS CREATURE DOWN
AT ONCE!

00:06:31.113 --> 00:06:32.616
NOW SHADOW GHOUL!

00:06:32.616 --> 00:06:35.755
AMBUSH ATTACK!

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:41.066
SO THE VIRTUOUS MAHAD
FIGHTS DIRTY.

00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:44.539
YOU'RE JUST UPSET
BECAUSE MY MONSTERS
HAVE THE UPPER HAND!

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.412
AND NOW...
ILLUSION MAGICIAN
ATTACK!

00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:54.925
GO SHADOW GHOUL!

00:06:54.925 --> 00:06:59.165
IT'S YOUR TURN!

00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:01.837
NO, MY DIABOUND!

00:07:01.837 --> 00:07:03.140
ONE MORE TIME!

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.614
AMBUSH ATTACK!

00:07:07.614 --> 00:07:09.151
WHAT?!

00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:11.422
A VALIANT EFFORT,
MAHAD.

00:07:11.422 --> 00:07:14.895
HOWEVER YOU CAN'T USE
THE SAME TRICK TWICE!

00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:16.531
MY GHOUL!

00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:17.967
IT'S GONE!

00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:21.006
AND WITH IT GOES
A PIECE OF YOU!

00:07:21.006 --> 00:07:22.242
MAGICIAN!

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:26.650
ATTACK!

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.424
I AM AFRAID
IT'S ALL OVER
FOR YOU BAKURA.

00:07:30.424 --> 00:07:32.061
THE SHADOW GAME
HAS ENDED

00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:34.331
AND YOUR DIABOUND
IS NO MORE.

00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:37.871
ARE YOU SURE!?

00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:40.543
AND WHAT'S THAT I SEE
CREEPING UP BEHIND YOU!?

00:07:48.057 --> 00:07:50.060
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.999
ONLY MY SHADOW GHOUL
CAN PASS THROUGH WALLS!

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:56.038
OH, I MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN
TO MENTION THIS:

00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:58.409
MY DIABOUND HAS
THE UNIQUE ABILITY

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:02.083
TO INHERIT THE POWERS
OF EVERY MONSTER HE
DEFEATS IN BATTLE!

00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:03.519
THAT CANNOT BE!

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:05.122
IT'S TRUE.

00:08:05.122 --> 00:08:06.925
I GUESS YOU CAN SAY
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE

00:08:06.925 --> 00:08:08.428
WITH A KNACK
FOR STEALING THINGS!

00:08:08.428 --> 00:08:12.536
HA HA HA!

00:08:12.536 --> 00:08:16.543
TELL ME, MANA...
WHY HAVE YOU COME TO
MAHAD'S TABLET SHRINE?

00:08:16.543 --> 00:08:18.012
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS WEIRD...

00:08:18.012 --> 00:08:20.417
BUT I HAD THIS
REALLY BAD DREAM

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.822
THAT MASTER MAHAD
WAS IN TROUBLE
AND NEEDED HELP.

00:08:22.822 --> 00:08:26.862
HE WAS STRUGGLING PHARAOH
AND I COULD SWEAR THAT
HE WAS CALLING MY NAME!

00:08:26.862 --> 00:08:29.200
I WASN'T SURE
WHAT ELSE TO DO

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.937
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
IF CAME TO HIS SANCTUARY

00:08:30.937 --> 00:08:33.508
I COULD HELP HIM
OR SOMETHING!

00:08:33.508 --> 00:08:37.315
I BELIEVE I HAD
THE SAME DREAM.

00:08:37.315 --> 00:08:39.052
LOOK!

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:41.690
IT'S MAHAD'S
ILLUSION MAGICIAN!

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.395
HE MUST HAVE CALLED IT
INTO BATTLE!

00:08:44.395 --> 00:08:45.630
OH NO!

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.901
BUT IT LIVES
INSIDE MAHAD'S SOUL!

00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:51.241
IF HE LOSES IT,
THEN MY MASTER CAN'T
EXIST IN THIS WORLD!

00:08:55.749 --> 00:08:59.089
ALL GOOD SHADOW GAMES
MUST COME TO AN END!

00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:00.893
NO!
NOT MY MAGICIAN!

00:09:00.893 --> 00:09:02.028
TOO LATE!

00:09:02.028 --> 00:09:03.598
GOODBYE!

00:09:03.598 --> 00:09:05.902
HA HA HA!

00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:16.622
WE HAFTA SAVE HIM!

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:18.692
YES BUT HOW!?

00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:27.872
HEY PHARAOH!

00:09:27.872 --> 00:09:30.343
YOU OUT THERE, MAN!?

00:09:30.343 --> 00:09:31.512
NO!

00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:33.014
SAY IT AIN'T SO!

00:09:33.014 --> 00:09:34.383
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
DUDE!?

00:09:34.383 --> 00:09:36.220
DAT'S THE PROBLEM!

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.558
A BAD DRAWING
OF A FACE?

00:09:38.558 --> 00:09:39.794
HEL-LO?

00:09:39.794 --> 00:09:41.296
I MARKED THAT DOOR

00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:43.467
SO WE'D KNOW THAT WE
ALREADY WENT DOWN THIS PATH.

00:09:43.467 --> 00:09:44.969
GOOD IDEA JOEY!

00:09:44.969 --> 00:09:47.074
YEAH, WHO KNEW
YOU HAD IT IN YA!?

00:09:47.074 --> 00:09:50.513
BUT IF WE
EVER GET OUTTA HERE,
INVEST IN AN ART CLASS.

00:09:50.513 --> 00:09:51.916
Shadi: GOOD ONE.

00:09:51.916 --> 00:09:53.419
WHO ASKED YOU, "SNOTTY!?"

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:54.955
IT'S SHADI.

00:09:54.955 --> 00:09:56.692
ALRIGHT BREAK IT UP,
YOU TWO!

00:09:56.692 --> 00:09:59.831
WE HAVE TO
FIND THE RIGHT DOOR
AND THAT'S NOT HELPING!

00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:02.068
WE'LL NEVER FIND
DAT DOOR!!!!!

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.406
NOT IF WE KEEP WALKIN'
IN CIRCLES!

00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:07.412
HE'S GOTTA POINT.

00:10:07.412 --> 00:10:09.181
Joey: FACE IT!

00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:11.920
WE'RE GONNA BE STUCK
IN DIS PLACE WITH DAT GHOST
IN A BATHROBE

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.790
FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES!

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.261
Tea: OH, WAY TO KEEP
A POSITIVE ATTITUDE!

00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:18.432
Shadi: FOR YOUR INFORMATION
IT'S A SACRED CLOAK.

00:10:18.432 --> 00:10:20.736
Joey : BATHROBE...
CLOAK...WHATEVER!

00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:22.473
THE POINT IS,
WE'RE TRAPPED!

00:10:22.473 --> 00:10:25.980
Tea: AND YOU'RE MAKING
IT WORSE!

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.048
Tristan: WAIT GUYS!

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:28.951
CHECK OUT YUGI!

00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:30.355
HUH?

00:10:30.355 --> 00:10:31.891
EH?

00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:33.895
MAYBE HE FOUND
THE RIGHT DOOR.

00:10:33.895 --> 00:10:35.664
WELL I CAN'T BE SURE...

00:10:35.664 --> 00:10:40.306
BUT I GET THE FEELING
SOMETHING ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THIS ONE.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.712
BE CAREFUL DUDE.

00:10:43.712 --> 00:10:45.917
Tea: YUGI!

00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:47.119
WAIT!

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:49.190
PHARAOH!?

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.659
IS THAT YOU!?

00:10:50.659 --> 00:10:54.934
Tea:
HELLO!?

00:10:54.934 --> 00:10:56.169
HEY!

00:10:56.169 --> 00:11:01.479
BAKURA!

00:11:01.479 --> 00:11:03.115
Joey:
WHAT'S HE DOIN' HERE?

00:11:03.115 --> 00:11:06.288
HEH HEH HEH!

00:11:06.288 --> 00:11:12.199
ARGH!

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:15.037
I SAY WE TRY
DA NEXT DOOR!

00:11:26.092 --> 00:11:28.630
HEY, IS EVERYONE OKAY?

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:34.540
YOU MEAN BESIDES
THE REALLY BAD SUNBURN?

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.546
IT'S GONE.

00:11:37.546 --> 00:11:39.216
Joey: WELL
IT'S A GOOD THING,

00:11:39.216 --> 00:11:41.287
'CAUSE I WAS ABOUT
TA FIGHT FIRE WIT FIRE!

00:11:41.287 --> 00:11:45.895
YOU HAVE NOW SEEN
THE PHARAOH'S ENEMY
IN HIS TRUE FORM.

00:11:45.895 --> 00:11:47.398
HIS TRUE ENEMY?

00:11:47.398 --> 00:11:49.735
YOU MEAN BAKURA?

00:11:57.317 --> 00:12:00.289
NOW THAT MY DIABOUND
HAS PICKED UP
A FEW NEW TRICKS,

00:12:00.289 --> 00:12:02.627
YOU MAY AS WELL BID YOUR
ILLUSION MAGICIAN FAREWELL.

00:12:02.627 --> 00:12:05.498
AND ONCE HE'S GONE,
HE'LL BE SEALED IN STONE!

00:12:05.498 --> 00:12:07.669
AND YOU'LL BE SEALED
IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:12:07.669 --> 00:12:08.905
NEVER!

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:11.609
YOU CAN'T DENY
YOUR DESTINY MAHAD.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.358
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME!?

00:12:19.358 --> 00:12:20.793
IS IT NOT OBVIOUS?

00:12:20.793 --> 00:12:23.766
THIS SANCTUARY IS
HOME TO SEVERAL TRAPS!

00:12:23.766 --> 00:12:27.940
SO I USED MY MAGIC TO
CONCEAL THEM AND LET YOU
TAKE CARE OF THE REST.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.879
YOU'LL NEVER CONTAIN ME!

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:32.181
REALLY?

00:12:32.181 --> 00:12:34.085
BECAUSE BY THE LOOKS
OF YOU

00:12:34.085 --> 00:12:36.089
IT APPEARS THAT
I ALREADY HAVE!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:39.028
NOW TO FINISH THIS.

00:12:39.028 --> 00:12:42.634
IT IS OVER, MY PHARAOH.

00:12:42.634 --> 00:12:47.744
OH NO!

00:12:47.744 --> 00:12:51.151
WHY THANK YOU, MAHAD.

00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:53.588
BE CAREFUL.

00:12:53.588 --> 00:12:56.293
I HEAR THIS PLACE CONTAINS
SOME TRAPS.

00:12:56.293 --> 00:12:57.896
HA HA!

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.546
PARDON ME!

00:13:06.546 --> 00:13:08.750
BUT DO YOU MIND
IF I CUT IN!?

00:13:15.763 --> 00:13:18.034
NOW FOR YOUR MAGICIAN!

00:13:18.034 --> 00:13:19.236
DIABOUND!

00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:22.309
ANNIHILATE HIM WITH
YOUR HELICAL SHOCKWAVE!!

00:13:33.162 --> 00:13:34.498
WHERE CAN HE BE!?

00:13:34.498 --> 00:13:35.900
WE'LL FIND HIM.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.242
WE JUST NEED A SIGN.

00:13:40.242 --> 00:13:41.979
LIKE THAT!

00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:44.283
TELL ME...I SEEM TO
HAVE FORGOTTEN...

00:13:44.283 --> 00:13:46.721
WHAT LIES
BEYOND THOSE HILLS?

00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:49.592
IT'S THE SPELLCASTERS'
TRAINING GROUNDS.

00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:51.396
THAT'S SO WEIRD!

00:13:51.396 --> 00:13:53.600
WHY WOULD MAHAD
HAVE GONE THERE?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.871
THERE'S ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

00:14:08.093 --> 00:14:09.730
YOU POOR FOOL.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.873
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.

00:14:14.873 --> 00:14:16.577
Captain: STAY BACK!

00:14:16.577 --> 00:14:18.279
Yami-Yugi: OVER HERE!

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.300
WHERE'S MAHAD?

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.036
HE'S BATTLING BAKURA,
MY PHARAOH.

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.138
WHAT!?

00:14:32.138 --> 00:14:33.341
WELL HE NEEDS HELP!

00:14:33.341 --> 00:14:35.445
MANA, WE MUST SEND WORD
TO THE OTHERS!

00:14:35.445 --> 00:14:39.786
RIGHT.

00:14:39.786 --> 00:14:42.091
ANZU!

00:14:42.091 --> 00:14:44.695
TAKE THIS TO THE PALACE!

00:14:51.107 --> 00:14:53.077
NOW TO DEAL
WITH THESE THUGS.

00:14:53.077 --> 00:14:54.246
MANA, GET DOWN.

00:14:54.246 --> 00:14:55.415
BE CAREFUL.

00:14:55.415 --> 00:14:56.651
ALRIGHT!

00:14:56.651 --> 00:14:58.688
TODAY YOU HAVE
MET YOUR MATCH!

00:15:05.367 --> 00:15:10.276
Bakura: LOOKS TO ME LIKE
YOU COULD USE SOME REST.

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.314
WHY DON'T YOU AND I
MAKE A LITTLE DEAL?

00:15:12.314 --> 00:15:13.883
IT'S SIMPLE.

00:15:13.883 --> 00:15:16.722
BRING THE MILLENNIUM RING TO ME
AND I'LL SPARE YOU!

00:15:16.722 --> 00:15:18.893
STAY AND FIGHT
AND I'LL SEE TO IT

00:15:18.893 --> 00:15:22.533
THAT YOUR SOUL IS REMOVED
FROM THIS WORLD...PERMANENTLY!

00:15:34.081 --> 00:15:35.416
Karim: HURRY!

00:15:35.416 --> 00:15:36.919
MAHAD NEEDS US!

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:38.154
WHY WOULD HE DO THIS!?

00:15:38.154 --> 00:15:41.094
HE CANNOT DEFEAT BAKURA ALONE!

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.540
MAHAD.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.911
I SHALL NEVER
GIVE IN TO YOU!

00:15:50.911 --> 00:15:52.147
FINE.

00:15:52.147 --> 00:15:53.651
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:57.257
BAKURA...
IT MUST BE DIFFICULT
FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU

00:15:57.257 --> 00:15:58.993
TO UNDERSTAND
LOYALTY.

00:15:58.993 --> 00:16:01.031
BUT I HAVE TAKEN A VOW.

00:16:01.031 --> 00:16:03.001
TO PROTECT MY KING.

00:16:03.001 --> 00:16:05.005
THEN YOU'RE A FOOL.

00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:06.875
WELL PERHAPS
IN YOUR EYES,

00:16:06.875 --> 00:16:10.148
BUT I KNOW MY PHARAOH
WOULD DO THE SAME
THING FOR ME.

00:16:14.589 --> 00:16:15.925
MAHAD!

00:16:15.925 --> 00:16:17.328
ARE YOU ALRIGHT!?

00:16:17.328 --> 00:16:18.563
DO NOT WORRY
ABOUT ME.

00:16:18.563 --> 00:16:20.067
DON'T MOVE!

00:16:20.067 --> 00:16:21.903
NO, MY PRINCE!

00:16:21.903 --> 00:16:24.107
THE FUTURE PHARAOH
NEED NOT DO THIS!

00:16:24.107 --> 00:16:28.215
YOU WERE BIT BY A SNAKE
AND I'M GETTING
THE POISON OUT!

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.760
MY PHARAOH...
IT IS NOW TIME!

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.866
I SHALL FINALLY
REPAY MY DEBT!

00:16:46.515 --> 00:16:48.052
WHAT IS GOING ON!?

00:16:48.052 --> 00:16:50.490
HE HAS BEEN SEPARATED
FROM HIS ITEM!

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.863
I SENSE IT!

00:16:53.863 --> 00:16:58.538
MAHAD!

00:16:58.538 --> 00:17:00.575
THE MILLENNIUM RING
IS MINE!

00:17:00.575 --> 00:17:02.712
BAKURA!

00:17:02.712 --> 00:17:05.084
YOU'RE TREADING DOWN
A DANGEROUS PATH.

00:17:05.084 --> 00:17:07.655
ILLUSION MAGICIAN!?

00:17:07.655 --> 00:17:09.558
IT CAN'T BE!

00:17:09.558 --> 00:17:14.200
I'VE ALREADY
DESTROYED YOU!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.837
MAHAD!

00:17:15.837 --> 00:17:19.076
WHAT SORT OF
CHEAP MAGICIAN'S TRICK
ARE YOU PLAYING ON ME!?

00:17:19.076 --> 00:17:20.546
IT IS NO TRICK!

00:17:20.546 --> 00:17:22.081
I USED
MY REMAINING POWER

00:17:22.081 --> 00:17:25.721
TO MERGE TOGETHER WITH
MY ILLUSION MAGICIAN
AND DEFEAT YOU!

00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:27.058
FAREWELL.

00:17:27.058 --> 00:17:28.594
DIABOUND!

00:17:28.594 --> 00:17:31.834
FINISH HIM OFF WITH
YOUR HELICAL SHOCKWAVE!

00:17:31.834 --> 00:17:33.703
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:17:39.514 --> 00:17:42.920
WHAT!?

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.459
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.246
NO!

00:17:56.246 --> 00:17:57.948
MASTER MAHAD!

00:17:57.948 --> 00:18:03.960
CAN YOU HEAR ME!?

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.569
WATCH OUT!

00:18:08.569 --> 00:18:10.605
MY MASTER!

00:18:10.605 --> 00:18:12.509
MANA!
COME BACK!

00:18:18.387 --> 00:18:19.822
OH NO!

00:18:19.822 --> 00:18:22.394
HIS SOUL IS SEALED
IN THAT STONE!

00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:24.665
THAT MEANS HE LOST!

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:32.112
MAHAD.

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.915
BUT WHY?

00:18:33.915 --> 00:18:36.219
WAIT GUYS!

00:18:36.219 --> 00:18:37.423
D'YOU FEEL THAT?

00:18:37.423 --> 00:18:38.925
HUH?

00:18:38.925 --> 00:18:40.294
FEEL WHAT?
YOU ALRIGHT?

00:18:40.294 --> 00:18:42.332
THE ROOM JUST GOT COLD.

00:18:42.332 --> 00:18:44.569
AND IT'S SHAKING.

00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:52.584
PHARAOH!

00:18:52.584 --> 00:18:53.987
WHAT'S THIS?

00:18:53.987 --> 00:18:55.556
IT'S NOT FAIR!

00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:56.658
IT'S MAHAD.

00:18:56.658 --> 00:19:01.735
HE'S SEALED.

00:19:01.735 --> 00:19:03.537
MY PHARAOH.

00:19:03.537 --> 00:19:05.808
I HAVE MADE
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

00:19:05.808 --> 00:19:09.916
NOW I AM ABLE TO BECOME
YOUR ETERNAL SERVANT.

00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:15.861
THANK YOU.

00:19:15.861 --> 00:19:17.830
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.734
IT JUST GOT WARM
IN HERE AGAIN.

00:19:19.734 --> 00:19:21.170
YES.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.473
THAT IS BECAUSE
THIS LABYRINTH

00:19:22.473 --> 00:19:24.911
IS A REFLECTION OF
THE PHARAOH'S HEART.

00:19:24.911 --> 00:19:28.183
THE TEMPERATURE
CHANGES ACCORDING
TO HIS EMOTIONS.

00:19:28.183 --> 00:19:30.922
AS FOR YOU...
YOU MUST LISTEN.

00:19:30.922 --> 00:19:34.529
AND IF YOU DO SO
CAREFULLY ENOUGH
YOU WILL LOCATE HIM.

00:19:34.529 --> 00:19:36.131
OF COURSE!

00:19:36.131 --> 00:19:39.137
THIS WHOLE TIME WE THOUGHT
WE HAD TO KNOCK ON HIS DOOR.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:43.044
BUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO
IS WAIT FOR THE PHARAOH
TO KNOCK FOR US!

00:19:43.044 --> 00:19:44.380
Sadi: YES.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.683
BUT IT NOT EASY.

00:19:45.683 --> 00:19:47.519
YOU MUST LISTEN
WITH YOUR HEART.

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.523
THEN LET'S DO DIS!

00:19:49.523 --> 00:19:51.828
I BET IF WE ALL CONCENTRATE
AT THE SAME TIME

00:19:51.828 --> 00:19:55.601
WE'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR HIM
SO LET'S STOP YAPPIN'
AND START LISTENIN'!

00:19:55.601 --> 00:19:57.037
YEAH!

00:19:57.037 --> 00:19:58.941
THANKS GUYS!

00:19:58.941 --> 00:20:00.543
HANDS IN!

00:20:00.543 --> 00:20:02.547
Joey: DO WE ALWAYS HAVE
TO DO THE HAND THING?

00:20:02.547 --> 00:20:05.787
JOEY, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE YOUR OWN ADVICE
AND CONCENTRATE.

00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:07.089
Sadi: SHE'S RIGHT.

00:20:07.089 --> 00:20:09.862
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND LISTEN.

00:20:09.862 --> 00:20:11.698
THE PHARAOH CRIES OUT TO YOU.

00:20:11.698 --> 00:20:17.475
LISTEN.

00:20:17.475 --> 00:20:19.346
Yami-Yugi: YUGI.

00:20:19.346 --> 00:20:22.151
YOU GUYS HEARD THAT,
RIGHT!?

00:20:22.151 --> 00:20:23.653
IT SOUNDED LIKE
THE PHARAOH.

00:20:23.653 --> 00:20:24.956
YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:26.526
THEN WE MUST
BE CLOSE!

00:20:26.526 --> 00:20:32.003
AWESOME!

00:20:32.003 --> 00:20:33.939
YUGI.

00:20:33.939 --> 00:20:35.843
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:20:35.843 --> 00:20:38.114
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:20:38.114 --> 00:20:40.769
Joey: I THINK
IT'S WORKING!

00:20:40.769 --> 00:20:42.637
WHAT'S GOING ON!
