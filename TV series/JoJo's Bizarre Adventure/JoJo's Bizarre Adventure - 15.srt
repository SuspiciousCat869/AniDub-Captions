1
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:08,203
You monsters!

2
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:10,419
Don't turn your backs on me!

3
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:11,753
Hmm?

4
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:13,580
Fine then.

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:15,543
I'll savor this one!

6
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:18,021
Hamon bubble launcher!

7
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:01,791
Could... could this be... is this what I think?

8
00:02:01,816 --> 00:02:05,915
Nice work. Caesar may be a narcissist,
but his hamon skills are solid.

9
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:10,810
These bubbles may look harmless,
but prepare for a bombardment!

10
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,930
He... he popped them all.

11
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:23,812
How on earth did he do that?

12
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:25,250
That's not his hair.

13
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:28,300
Those are wires attached to his head he's manipulating.

14
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:31,479
He popped my bubbles with the wind that they created.

15
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:32,900
But then that means

16
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,711
they were designed to be anti‐hamon weapons.

17
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,294
Somehow they're already familiar
with the principles of hamon.

18
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:44,259
They must have faced hamon at
some point over 2,000 years ago.

19
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,299
What is that?

20
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:49,659
What's happening to the air around them?

21
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:51,674
Caesar, look out!

22
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,884
Get down!

23
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,520
Wh... what the...

24
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:03,178
Cover your eyes! That wasn't just wind! It was the
aftermath of a powerful vortex that's still active!

25
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:06,553
Caesar!

26
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:09,633
These humans know hamon.

27
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:14,159
I thought we destroyed all the members
of the hamon tribe 2,000 years ago.

28
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:18,489
And yet here they are, ready to
welcome us at our own awakening.

29
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,246
Damn... you.

30
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,042
You killed him.

31
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,923
You killed my friend.

32
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:30,102
Do you think losing an eye will stop me?!

33
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,006
Stop.

34
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,476
Why are you laughing? What's so funny?!

35
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:41,623
You all have memorized your hamon handbook very well.

36
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:43,903
You always say the same thing.

37
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:48,571
It was that way when we crossed from the
western continent, and it is that way now still.

38
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,763
"You think losing an arm or an eye or a leg will stop me?

39
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:56,426
"How dare you take my friend's life?
Don't you know how much I loved him?"

40
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,848
That's why we laugh, human.

41
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:01,010
You... you bastards!

42
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:01,796
Ignore him.

43
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,823
We're on a quest to find the stone.

44
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:06,039
What? Where are you going?!

45
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:07,787
Face me, cowards!

46
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:13,961
You're most vulnerable in your throat and your lungs.

47
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:17,996
We know that if you can't breathe,
then your hamon is rendered useless.

48
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,714
But because I cannot resist a worthy opponent, hear me.

49
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:27,585
I shall spare you, because I long for the
opportunity to meet you again when you are stronger.

50
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:31,345
The next time we meet, I want to admire your strength.

51
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:33,831
I want you to become worthy of my time

52
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:36,946
so that I might destroy you with great honor.

53
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,455
It appears that he was the only hamon user.

54
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:49,226
Hmm. Let's move.

55
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:58,032
Sorry. I just can't seem to shake this cough.

56
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:00,606
Maybe it's the hamon training that's making me ill.

57
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:01,678
What do you think?

58
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:04,965
Hmm.

59
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:06,650
He only sliced your eyelid.

60
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:08,972
The actual eyeball itself is just fine.

61
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:11,354
Perhaps you should sit this one out.

62
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,327
I think we've all seen enough of
the bubble launcher for one day.

63
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:17,050
Watch and learn as I take care of this one myself.

64
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:17,750
JoJo!

65
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:19,284
Just calm down, Speedwagon.

66
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:21,459
This guy is asking for it.

67
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:24,597
It's time for me to show off the
brand‐new technique I've been working on.

68
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:25,200
What?

69
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:27,698
Please allow me to introduce myself.

70
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:33,663
My name is Joseph Joestar, and these are the
hands known for defeating your mate, Santviento.

71
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:42,939
I call this move my hamon clacker volley.

72
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:47,219
I start off by filling these little
clacker balls here with a bit of hamon.

73
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:53,999
Wuh... whah!

74
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:56,493
Oh, no!

75
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:58,803
JoJo, what the hell do you think you're doing?

76
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:00,392
This is no time for games.

77
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:05,038
What are you doing? Are you trying to
disrespect my friend by playing the fool?

78
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,819
Not intentionally.

79
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:08,519
I'm trying to be serious.

80
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,975
Caesar, I am truly sorry for the loss of your friend.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,564
I understand both your pain and your anger.

82
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:20,598
Additionally, these guys may be the biggest group
of egotistical jackasses I've ever seen in my life.

83
00:06:20,623 --> 00:06:22,599
I may not be a master of this yet,

84
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:26,360
but I'll still knock you into
next Tuesday with my clacker volley!

85
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,604
I hate to admit it, but I know
that my hamon is relatively weak.

86
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,199
I'm pretty sure I can make up for what I'm lacking

87
00:06:36,224 --> 00:06:37,254
with these steel clackers.

88
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,668
If I can just break open your skin
even a little and fill you with hamon,

89
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:43,194
that should even up my handicap, don't you think?

90
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,935
I can tell you're nervous.

91
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,706
Take that!

92
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:56,594
Well, that was fun.

93
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:57,786
Let us keep moving.

94
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:01,693
Apparently the human race has
regressed rather than evolved.

95
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,432
Quite an understatement.

96
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:07,856
Amusing, though.

97
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:11,240
JoJo, what are you doing?

98
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,094
Your childish little games are going to get us all killed.

99
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,349
He's playing coy,

100
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:17,944
but this may actually be the best JoJo's got.

101
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:20,982
He'd be fine if he was facing some common street punk,

102
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,390
but I don't think he realizes that these
opponents are on a completely different level.

103
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,357
It would be comical if it weren't so tragic.

104
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:31,590
Why isn't anyone taking my little metal balls seriously?

105
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:34,845
That's far enough. Don't make
me clack you into the ground.

106
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,814
Stop.

107
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:39,094
Don't you feel that human lives are short enough?

108
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,970
There's no need to sprint to your death.

109
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:46,761
Silence. If you've ever had spaghetti al nero di
seppia, you know it looks bad, but it's delicious.

110
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:50,026
You should taste my clacker volley before you judge it.

111
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,248
The clackers, they vanished.

112
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:04,540
I've been training on my hamon all the live-long day.

113
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:05,948
He's insane.

114
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:08,171
Hmm?

115
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:10,879
Well, look it, ma. No hands.

116
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,237
Where are the clackers?

117
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:14,978
A true magician...

118
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:18,474
Never reveals his secret! Eat this!

119
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:27,296
How can anything move like that?

120
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:30,735
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
He's faster than Santviento.

121
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,832
I don't think those idiotic
clackers did so much as graze him.

122
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:39,361
I admire your weapon, your
courage, and your creativity, human.

123
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:42,833
I'm actually enjoying your company.

124
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:44,056
You deserve time.

125
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,956
One minute, but only one,

126
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:50,785
that is how much time I will
allow you to fight the mighty Wamuu.

127
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:54,607
JoJo!

128
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:57,244
I shall use your wound as a timer.

129
00:08:57,618 --> 00:09:00,526
Your wrist will work well as a timekeeping device,

130
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:04,998
and you will lose consciousness due to
a loss of blood in exactly one minute.

131
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,923
Show me what you can do, human.

132
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:12,458
This is what I often told the members of the hamon tribe,

133
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:15,978
"your life is now my hourglass measured in blood."

134
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,265
Wamuu, we'll be waiting outside.

135
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,076
Now, boy, go ahead, and retrieve your weapon quickly.

136
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:25,595
What? I'm sorry. I'm growing deaf in this ear.

137
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,292
It almost sounded like you said, "go ahead, and
retrieve your weapon," which would be ridiculous.

138
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:34,611
I mean, why would you retrieve
something that comes right back to you?

139
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:35,911
Hmm?

140
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,795
Looks like my clacker boomerang worked pretty well.

141
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,575
I shouldn't even need the full minute to destroy you now.

142
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,850
That's for killing Caesar's friend,
that's for not taking me seriously,

143
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,394
and that's because I'm sick of looking at your ugly face!

144
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:01,111
Do what you must.

145
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:02,596
I deserve as much.

146
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:07,267
No opponent has ever struck my face,
and this is the price for my carelessness.

147
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:11,811
I shall take this beating in order to
properly honor you before I destroy you.

148
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:23,967
You say that no one has ever
hit you in that ugly mug of yours?

149
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:26,222
What an honor.

150
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:32,537
You didn't even stop to blink when you killed
Caesar's friend mark, did you? You monster!

151
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:34,817
Do you not value life at all?!

152
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,429
JoJo, watch yourself!

153
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:39,339
His arm isn't broken! He's getting ready to use it!

154
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:48,609
Whoa. I have a feeling this isn't good for me.

155
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:51,253
A charming observation, human.

156
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,914
I'm now scarred due to my carelessness.

157
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:58,699
It was my duty to allow you to pummel me
as punishment for my own lack of judgment.

158
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,770
That has now ended, however.

159
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:03,314
JoJo, finish him now while you still can!

160
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:05,657
My ultimate technique,

161
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:08,080
the Divine Sandstorm!

162
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:10,225
Guhh! I don't like the sound of that.

163
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:15,682
He starts by spinning his left arm clockwise
and then his right arm counterclockwise.

164
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:21,355
JoJo is unprepared to counter a technique like
this, as Wamuu's fists seem to grow before his eyes.

165
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:29,460
The air between Wamuu's arms transforms
into a powerful vortex of destruction.

166
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,211
This vacuum creates a highly
pressurized, deadly maelstrom.

167
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:38,002
Great, if he can tear through marble pillars,

168
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:41,402
I don't see myself having much of a
chance against a windstorm like this.

169
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,934
I don't think I've ever seen anything this powerful!

170
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,420
Uhh. JoJo.

171
00:11:57,637 --> 00:11:59,937
I call that Divine Sandstorm.

172
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,549
No! JoJo!

173
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:04,122
Don't be a damn fool.

174
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:07,317
Run, Speedwagon. Get out of here before it's too late.

175
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:09,398
I'll try and distract him somehow.

176
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:12,981
Curse this blood in my eye. Threw off my aim.

177
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:16,644
But it proved enough when you made
the choice to hide behind a pillar.

178
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:20,607
Hmm. You died quickly.

179
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:24,987
Normally I would ignore human
onlookers such as yourselves.

180
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:27,564
However, you witnessed my shame,

181
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,063
so unfortunately I must take the time to destroy you both.

182
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,375
You may pray now if you wish.

183
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:37,029
Eh?

184
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,853
Hmm. Must be the light.

185
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:50,157
What does he think he's doing?

186
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,103
I don't believe it.

187
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:54,200
He's actually trying to escape.

188
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:55,654
Huh?

189
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,034
Hmm.

190
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,806
That coward has no shame playing dead like that.

191
00:13:03,831 --> 00:13:07,334
I understand leaving me, but what about Speedwagon?

192
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,350
I knew he was spineless.

193
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:13,003
This guy is the most powerful foe I've ever faced.

194
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:14,791
My breathing is out of control.

195
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:16,803
I can't control my hamon.

196
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:19,400
I don't really have any other option left.

197
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:22,785
Luckily, my specialty is running away.

198
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,325
Behold our now‐broken hero,

199
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:29,932
JoJo, forced to play dead, crawling for his life,

200
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:33,468
and now leaving Speedwagon behind to face certain death.

201
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:38,599
Even with all of this, JoJo remains
dedicated, a hero worthy of this tale.

202
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,624
How is that, you ask?

203
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,469
Nice try there, human.

204
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:48,748
You coward.

205
00:13:49,074 --> 00:13:52,497
No true warrior would ever
feign death just to save himself.

206
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:54,498
Hmm?

207
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:01,220
That may be true, though my intention
was not to escape, but to distract.

208
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:04,863
Truth be told, I was just trying
to get you onto this mine cart.

209
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:06,703
You are clever indeed.

210
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:11,413
So you were only playing the part of the coward
to lure me away from your friends. Is that right?

211
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:13,053
I'm surprised you fell for it.

212
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:14,989
That trick is probably older than you.

213
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,387
Get out now, Speedwagon. Run!

214
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:20,072
Caesar, go! What are you guys doing?

215
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,417
JoJo.

216
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,237
That bastard. What a noble move.

217
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:28,393
Now that I've painted myself into a corner here,

218
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,966
I need to come up with a second part to my plan,

219
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,362
which would be...

220
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:37,557
The unflappable hero.

221
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:42,675
He calmly searches for options, not knowing
what to do next, but his will remains unbroken.

222
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:45,076
JoJo!

223
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:47,157
Damn you, JoJo.

224
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,547
He's in far worse shape than I am.

225
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:53,472
I should have been the one to lure Wamuu away.

226
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:57,420
I see now that JoJo only acts
foolishly to confound his opponent.

227
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:01,050
He must actually have a good plan to beat those monsters.

228
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,388
Although you are quite confident for
someone who is knocking on death's door,

229
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,985
I must tell you that your plan is a poor one.

230
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,583
You're quite tough. I'll give you that.

231
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:19,975
Softheaded, but tough nonetheless.

232
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,231
Tell me, how do you remain unyielding
in the moments before your death?

233
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,378
Is it because you have bricks for brains,
or do you still have another trick for me?

234
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,128
Do you really want to know?

235
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,310
Actually, no. Let me guess.

236
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:34,204
Because you're so obviously clever,

237
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:35,796
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt

238
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,952
that you wouldn't be stupid enough to be
holding a stick of dynamite behind your back.

239
00:15:39,977 --> 00:15:41,367
Damn. He's onto me.

240
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:45,476
And I know you wouldn't insult my intelligence
by thinking you could quickly throw the brake

241
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:47,665
and send the mine cart flying off the tracks,

242
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,754
maybe like this!

243
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,534
Damn. He got me there, too.

244
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,399
Hmm?

245
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,882
The time on your hourglass wrist is just about up.

246
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:05,806
There is absolutely no chance that
you will survive this any longer.

247
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:09,412
I found your tricks to be very quaint.

248
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,282
Before you die, tell me, why do I
still not see defeat in your eyes?

249
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:19,486
I'll tell you if you want, but you're
gonna have to say, "please," first.

250
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,774
More games. You've tested me long enough. Prepare to die.

251
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,982
Such a shame, because a month from now, I can
guarantee that I would be able to destroy you.

252
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,383
What was that?

253
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,822
With just one more month of
training, I would annihilate you.

254
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:39,132
I was the first person to hit, as
well as the first to scar your face.

255
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:42,994
When I put my mind to something, I
can accomplish pretty much anything.

256
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:48,577
Oh, well. I guess none of that really matters now.

257
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:51,287
So can we just get this over with?

258
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:55,611
It will be an honor to be killed by
a warrior like you, blah, blah, blah.

259
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:58,249
What do you mean by this?

260
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:00,909
Oh, I'm sick and tired of all this talking.

261
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,254
Just hurry up, and make it painless, Wamuu.

262
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,059
Explain yourself. What are you trying to get at?

263
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,853
I don't know how, but he's still alive.

264
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:20,602
Is it true that you pillar men often live for millennia?

265
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:26,091
That's a long time to be walking around with the
shame of having your face rearranged by a lowly human.

266
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:31,115
It seems to me that the only way you could
regain your honor would be by defeating me in a fight

267
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,210
after I've undergone proper hamon training.

268
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:37,501
I do not have to defeat you in order to maintain my honor.

269
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:40,662
His entire body is shaking with rage.

270
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:44,189
I have a chance if I can make
him think his integrity is at stake.

271
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:48,486
He gave himself away as the proud warrior
type the moment he called me a coward.

272
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:50,520
Pride is his Achilles heel.

273
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:53,570
I don't know if you noticed, but I'm still new at this.

274
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:59,399
However, if I trained with my hamon for a month, I know I
could give you the fair fight a warrior like you deserves.

275
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:02,992
The first person who ever hit you
in the face gave you a nasty scar.

276
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:06,275
It would be a shame if you killed
that person before he's worthy.

277
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:12,590
But if you feel the need to kill me before
I have a chance to battle you as an equal,

278
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,917
then go ahead and do whatever you need to do.

279
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,148
You bastard!

280
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:20,029
Wamuu.

281
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,642
Master Esidisi.

282
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,557
You gave this human one minute.

283
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:26,654
Why must you insist on letting him toy with you? Eh?

284
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:29,202
Just go away. I almost had him.

285
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:33,188
Hmm.

286
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:44,765
Master Esidisi, I have grown fond of
this particular member of the hamon tribe.

287
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:46,395
I got him.

288
00:18:46,482 --> 00:18:50,755
JoJo, you will be happy to know that I
have decided to accept your proposition.

289
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:54,335
If you swear that you will train
your hardest to fulfill your potential,

290
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,883
then I will give you exactly one month to do so.

291
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:59,203
So you're not going to kill me now?

292
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,311
That's right.

293
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:02,121
But we're going to fight again?

294
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,242
We are.

295
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:05,164
Are you sure you want to do this?

296
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:06,997
I'll give you a chance to take it back.

297
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:09,673
Yes. I can't believe it's working.

298
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:10,994
However...

299
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:15,331
I will need assurances that you will
not try to run away again, of course.

300
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:16,847
Heh heh. Nice, Wamuu.

301
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:19,357
I was wondering when you would finally propose.

302
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:21,933
Say hello to the wedding ring of death.

303
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:23,317
Guess where it goes.

304
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:25,303
A hint, not on your finger.

305
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,003
W... what are you doing with that?!

306
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:33,667
This ring will start to dissolve in 33 days.

307
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:38,656
It's impossible to remove, and once
dissolved, it will release a virulent poison.

308
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:43,359
Any attempt to remove or damage it
will also release the lethal poison.

309
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:48,897
However, there is one certain way
to dissolve the ring without harm.

310
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:52,010
Simply battle and defeat me within 33 days,

311
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:56,175
and I shall give you the antidote that
I keep inside the hollow of my lip ring.

312
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,452
JoJo!

313
00:19:57,477 --> 00:20:01,300
The vow on that wedding ring
states, "till death do us part," JoJo.

314
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,873
Be at the Colosseum in 33 days.

315
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:07,425
Meet me there at midnight, and
we shall battle as equals, JoJo.

316
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,668
I hope you didn't think your paltry
tricks would help you escape, human.

317
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,603
I don't imagine the two of us will fight,
but just in case, here's a gift for you...

318
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:20,962
One that fits perfectly around your windpipe!

319
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,339
Agh!

320
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:25,205
My heart and my throat!

321
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,850
My poison is quite different from Wamuu's,

322
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,179
and I keep the antidote for that poison in my nose ring.

323
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:34,636
Kars? Would you like to go next?

324
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:35,653
I don't think so.

325
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,606
Immortality can be boring at times.

326
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:43,909
To encounter a worthy opponent, that is
both such a rare and tantalizing thought,

327
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:46,285
a gift that would give our lives meaning.

328
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:48,516
I can see why you do this.

329
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:52,101
However, do not forget that our
goal is to obtain the Red Stone of AJA.

330
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,595
We must stay focused. Let's go.

331
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,121
Train long and hard, JoJo,

332
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:59,894
so you can challenge my Divine Sandstorm.

333
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:05,313
I... I can't believe that.

334
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:07,203
Two wedding rings with poison?

335
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:10,134
Is that supposed to be some
kind of sick joke or something?

336
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,987
I've got one around my throat and one around my heart.

337
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:16,253
Do these guys think I'm some kind of bigamist, or maybe...

338
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,482
Well, at least Speedwagon and Caesar are safe.

339
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:25,102
That's what's important.

340
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:27,937
No sense in feeling sorry for myself.

341
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:34,592
JoJo.

342
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:36,402
You fool.

343
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:40,454
That was one hell of a bluff you just pulled there.

344
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:43,823
The best con man couldn't have done it better than you.

345
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:47,900
You acted bravely, but now you'll need to back it up.

346
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:50,505
We don't have much time to work,

347
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,418
and we have serious hamon training ahead.

348
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:59,115
In and around the lake

349
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,237
mountains come out of the sky

350
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:06,005
they stand there

351
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:13,113
24 before my love and I'll be there

352
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:31,823
When I said I needed a month, I only meant it as a bluff!

353
00:23:31,848 --> 00:23:34,007
Well, from up here, it's really more deep than tall.

354
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:35,508
Coach, wait! Please don't do this!

355
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:38,362
Because you're a girl, doesn't mean
that I won't give you what you deserve.

356
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:39,621
Welcome to Venice.
