1
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:06,911
JoJo won his battle against that demon.

2
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:08,268
Poor sod.

3
00:00:08,553 --> 00:00:10,366
He lost everything in the process.

4
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:12,870
That's why I brought him here three days ago.

5
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:16,469
And now, bereft of father and home alike,

6
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:18,854
how's he gonna muster up the will to live?

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,123
Don't give up on the world yet, JoJo!

8
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:55,291
Spirit...

9
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,181
That's what he needs, so I'm gonna give it to him.

10
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,349
Huh?

11
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,399
It's the dead of night,

12
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:04,685
but there's a lamp burning in his room.

13
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:09,922
What do we have here?

14
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,761
How long's she been at it?

15
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:20,534
Don't tell me she's been watching over him all this time.

16
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,187
Her fingers,

17
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,316
cracked from the damp, I'd wager.

18
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:28,821
She must have been cooling his burns round
the clock for them to get like that.

19
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:43,560
Thank goodness.

20
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:45,410
He's awake.

21
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,157
You're through the worst of it.

22
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:48,641
You should be fine.

23
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:51,397
So you've been tending to my injuries?

24
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:56,428
But how can... how can you be standing here?

25
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,095
You're the image of...

26
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,891
But no. I'm sorry.

27
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,943
Your face reminds me of a girl I used to know.

28
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:10,427
Her name wouldn't happen to be Erina Pendleton, would it?

29
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:12,217
It's you.

30
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,317
It's been a long time, Jonathan Joestar...

31
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:16,495
JoJo.

32
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,213
Erina, you've really grown up.

33
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:22,388
Me? But you've grown a fair sight more.

34
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:24,860
Yet...

35
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:29,188
You're still the boy you were.

36
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:31,567
Yeah.

37
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,759
She makes a better Florence nightingale than I do anyhow.

38
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:42,130
You rest up, JoJo.

39
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:45,570
Time for Speedwagon to make his exit.

40
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,265
I... I must have fainted for a moment.

41
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:58,997
But your arm, it's broken. You shouldn't have caught me.

42
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:02,169
You caught me long ago.

43
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:08,047
I daresay oi' JoJo won't be lacking
a reason to live after this reunion.

44
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:15,015
You should have made an early night of it, you harlot.

45
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:16,197
Big mistake.

46
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:23,170
Most men shackle themselves to petty morality.

47
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:23,845
Huh?

48
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,523
They fear the consequences of their evil.

49
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,513
But some are unfettered by
man's laws in all their tyranny.

50
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:33,282
They are the vanguard.

51
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,109
Become my servant, Jack the Ripper.

52
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:38,681
You've no further need for free will.

53
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:43,202
I will make you an instrument of death,

54
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:45,901
the likes of which you can't begin to imagine.

55
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:46,625
Do it.

56
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:49,514
As for what I shall take in return...

57
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:01,961
Only Speedwagon and I know what
truly took place here that night.

58
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:05,468
Dio was consumed in the inferno,

59
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,777
but what of the accursed mask?

60
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,890
No sign of it in the rubble.

61
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:12,785
Smashed by falling masonry?

62
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:16,698
I hope so. I want to put this nightmare behind me.

63
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:17,532
JoJo.

64
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:20,071
Erina.

65
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:31,064
Hmm?

66
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:36,148
That man, he haunts our steps.

67
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:37,941
Is something wrong?

68
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,925
No. All is well.

69
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:50,176
Ah, signore Joestar.

70
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:54,591
And the lass at your side is signorina Pendleton.

71
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,220
Who are you?!

72
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:59,162
You survived against the mask.

73
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,091
Not many men can claim that.

74
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:06,707
JoJo!

75
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:09,782
That's right.

76
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:13,128
Let the shock of that impact
push all the air from your body.

77
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:15,300
JoJo!

78
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:18,192
Why? He was already hurt, you cad!

79
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:23,085
It's true I knocked the air out
of him, but he'll thank me for it.

80
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:26,349
My arm!

81
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:31,431
What is this? My broken bones...

82
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:33,725
Feel like they're mending!

83
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,064
Baron Zeppeli, at your service.

84
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,303
Courage alone will not be enough to beat the mask.

85
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:41,773
My arm was shattered, but now...

86
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,116
The pain has subsided.

87
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:48,460
Lifting this rock is nothing.

88
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:50,025
That's incredible.

89
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:52,733
Sir, why are you here?

90
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:54,834
And what is happening to me?

91
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:58,212
Please, try to limit yourself to one question at a time.

92
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,148
You healed yourself, JoJo.

93
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:04,144
How you breathed after I poked you was the key.

94
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,379
But why did you go to the trouble in the first place?

95
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:13,862
And how do you know who I...

96
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:15,484
He's gone.

97
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,512
What part of "one question at a time" eluded you?

98
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:23,001
You'll get the answers you desire, amico. Follow me.

99
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:29,350
This day, I will show you things the likes
of which will change your destiny forever.

100
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:36,461
It was with good reason that
I struck you in the diaphragm.

101
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:39,221
The shock of the impact altered your breathing.

102
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,287
But how did that heal my arm?

103
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:44,526
With the energy I am about to demonstrate for you.

104
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:49,154
Wait. What mischief is he planning?

105
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:06,614
Look at him, Erina.

106
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:09,367
His legs. Those ripples.

107
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:12,021
I've never seen water do that.

108
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:16,835
What you see is the force that eased your pain
and healed your broken bones, signore Joestar.

109
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,284
Don't do it!

110
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:34,906
That frog seems none the worse.

111
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,012
That was sendo you saw.

112
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:38,882
Wait. "Sendo"?

113
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:42,123
It's ripple energy created by hamon.

114
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:48,108
I sent my hamon coursing harmlessly through
froggy to split my real target, the rock below.

115
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:51,659
JoJo, I know for a fact,

116
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:54,082
the stone mask was not destroyed.

117
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:57,298
Dio Brando keeps it close to him even now.

118
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:58,601
No, it can't be.

119
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:01,133
Baron, is Dio still alive?

120
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:05,463
Indeed, and he holds the mask
I have sought for decades now.

121
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,911
That mask must be destroyed,

122
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:11,081
and its master must be reduced to ash.

123
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:14,513
It is your destiny to fight for this righteous cause.

124
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:17,996
You will learn to wield sendo, or you will die.

125
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:20,582
The future of humanity is at stake!

126
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,215
My destiny?

127
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:24,290
What is he talking about?

128
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:26,366
None of it makes any sense.

129
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:28,301
Erina.

130
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:31,741
She's already suffered enough at Dio's hands.

131
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,951
I can't drag her into this.

132
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:38,629
Incredible.

133
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:40,527
It's blossoming!

134
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:45,993
He's passing the spare hamon energy from his
healed arm into the branch and sending it into bloom.

135
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:49,601
And amazingly he doesn't even realize he's doing it.

136
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:51,566
This boy, he is a natural.

137
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:56,017
Of what might he be capable, with
the proper refinement of his abilities?

138
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,545
Rejoice, mankind.

139
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,260
This day, I may have found your champion.

140
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:09,764
Mmm.

141
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,524
With every meal, I feel my strength returning.

142
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:16,578
What a simple thing, the food chain.

143
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:20,734
As pigs feed on grass, so does man feed upon them,

144
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:24,459
and I, at the top of it all, feed upon the humans.

145
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:28,618
They exist to serve me and quell my thirst.

146
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:31,406
Go, Jack. It's suppertime.

147
00:10:33,142 --> 00:10:38,385
Now to swell the ranks of my
diabolical army and send it hence.

148
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:40,736
I will stand astride this world.

149
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:44,171
Humanity will kneel at Dio Brando's feet.

150
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:52,039
And so I began to study hamon under
the tutelage of the mysterious Zeppeli.

151
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:55,838
The training was spartan, but I had no choice.

152
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:58,140
Here's how it came about.

153
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:03,614
JoJo, my history with the
stone mask has been a long one.

154
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:05,895
I was your age.

155
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,572
Hard to believe that was ever the case now.

156
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:12,711
I harbored a great thirst for
adventure, as the young so often do.

157
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:18,723
It was my good fortune to travel the world
as a member of my father's archaeological team.

158
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:23,425
Would that we had never lain
eyes on those aztec ruins that day.

159
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,765
You're saying...

160
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:25,823
Yes.

161
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:30,928
The hands that pulled that evil artifact
into the light of day belonged to me.

162
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,915
One ill‐fated night during the voyage home,

163
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,871
a man of our number succumbed to his curiosity

164
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:39,865
and donned the mask.

165
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:44,977
The change in him was immediate.

166
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:50,365
Rampaging through the ship, he ripped his
companions' heads off in a bacchanalia of blood.

167
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,725
58 crewmen butchered in a matter of minutes.

168
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:58,832
I dove into the sea to escape, but the fiend gave chase.

169
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:05,762
Suddenly dawn broke.

170
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:09,735
As he crumbled to dust in the sunlight,

171
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,271
I saw his face...

172
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,436
And to my utter horror,

173
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:20,125
the demon was my father.

174
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:25,080
The crewless ship drifted away with the mask still aboard.

175
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:28,302
I had survived, but it was cold comfort,

176
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,131
knowing the mask's dreadful
power could be unleashed again.

177
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:35,884
I dedicated my life to finding a way to stop its evil.

178
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:39,197
That pledge led to my discovery of hamon.

179
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:43,773
The energy we call hamon is
created by the flow of one's blood.

180
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:48,932
Those who wear the mask feed on the
blood of others to consume that energy.

181
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:53,061
Hamon and the mask, they are two sides of the same coin.

182
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:54,143
Of course.

183
00:12:54,244 --> 00:12:56,923
We can overload Dio with that which animates him.

184
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:57,761
Correct.

185
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:02,340
If we can hit Dio with enough hamon
energy, that devil will burst asunder.

186
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:07,097
Hamon's ripples are the same form as the
waves of light sent out by the sun itself,

187
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,478
the bane of all vampires.

188
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,324
Baron Zeppeli, I beg of you,

189
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:15,031
teach me how to wield it.

190
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:17,566
I promise I'll give it my all.

191
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:20,214
You don't get a choice in the matter, amico.

192
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:25,326
Given your contentious history with Dio,
I'm sure he will be coming for you.

193
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,426
There is a poetry to this, JoJo.

194
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,825
Breathing oxygenates your blood.

195
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,625
Your blood carries the oxygen throughout your body.

196
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:41,405
It enriches the cells, giving
them the power to keep on living.

197
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:44,292
Those cells combine to form you.

198
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:49,153
Like ripples in the water, your body thrums
with the hamon created by proper breathing.

199
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:51,437
All that is left is to use it!

200
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:55,487
There's no way he could have reached me from there.

201
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:56,975
How did he do that?

202
00:13:57,757 --> 00:13:59,738
Zoom punch is a useful one.

203
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:02,027
I merely dislocated my shoulder.

204
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:05,633
Hamon dulls the pain, and the
surprise is well worth the effort.

205
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:09,976
You must maintain the rhythm of
your breath, even when taking a hit.

206
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:14,249
If your mind or heart are tempestuous,
the caliber of your hamon will suffer.

207
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:15,022
Yes, sir.

208
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:15,807
Oi!

209
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,320
I found something!

210
00:14:17,697 --> 00:14:19,068
Eh? Speedwagon.

211
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:22,503
So the village is called wind knights lot?

212
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:23,463
Right.

213
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:27,389
They've had a string of disappearances
lately, people vanishing after dark,

214
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:30,817
and folks have caught glimpses
of a fella who looks like Dio.

215
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:32,186
We're out of time now.

216
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:34,966
Your final test will be one of life or death, my pupil.

217
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:38,543
Yes, sir. I'll meet him in combat and lay him low.

218
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:40,033
Give him hell.

219
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:41,972
Look, gents.

220
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:44,004
The entrance to wind knights lot.

221
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,296
We'll attack Dio while there's
still plenty of light left in the sky.

222
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,956
Erina. I left without giving you a proper farewell.

223
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:59,493
I swear I will return to her.

224
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:05,612
Huh?

225
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:08,804
Why did we stop?

226
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:10,773
Oi, mate! Hurry it up!

227
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:12,756
Keep an eye out.

228
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,729
Sunlight can't protect us in here.

229
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:16,133
Well? What's wrong?

230
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:27,529
Is it Dio?

231
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:29,205
It has to be him.

232
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,244
Listen, both of you.

233
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,575
Step away from the horses.

234
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:40,433
What in the blue hell?!

235
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,901
That crazy blighter's inside our horse!

236
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:47,653
Good god, this one's mad as a hatter!

237
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:48,940
Dio's evil, yeah,

238
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,829
but I ain't seen him jump out of any animals so far.

239
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:55,106
He must be gathering minions, and
who knows how many he might have?

240
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:59,684
Stand aside, my young friends.

241
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,281
I will do the fighting.

242
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:04,049
He is a zombie.

243
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,496
They must feed on living flesh to survive.

244
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:11,358
However, they are in constant thrall to their master,

245
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:13,319
not unlike marionettes.

246
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:16,348
Oh, you lads is both as white as a sheet.

247
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,714
All the blood is drained from your faces.

248
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:21,732
Maybe I should cut off those useless heads of yours,

249
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:23,997
and watch it spray outta your necks.

250
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:31,544
Now, you mewling corpses‐to‐be, prepare for the carnage!

251
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,843
Tell me, what's his next move?

252
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,161
You must think as he does.

253
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:40,019
JoJo, this strategy will serve you in good stead.

254
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:45,264
Ask yourself, "what would be the most
advantageous thing for my foe to do next?"

255
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,243
Him, for example.

256
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:49,666
If he blocks off the tunnel entrance,

257
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:51,782
we can't retreat to the sunlight.

258
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,206
Just as I predicted, he's blocked our retreat!

259
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,763
Speedwagon, jump!

260
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:13,598
Try harder.

261
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:21,095
Knives are coming out of him.

262
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,534
Baron Zeppeli,

263
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:25,587
you didn't say nothing about fighting a pincushion.

264
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:31,370
Hamon cutter!

265
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,968
Hah hah hah hah!

266
00:17:34,376 --> 00:17:35,202
Eh?

267
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:39,478
I'm afraid your blades are rather
dull compared to my hamon cutter.

268
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:42,786
JoJo, this creature illustrates a principle.

269
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,696
Imagine a minuscule flea,

270
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:47,114
so small that it's barely visible.

271
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:53,325
Why is it they bite humans who tower over
them without a single thought to their own safety?

272
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,949
Would you call their behavior courageous?

273
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:58,712
Of course not. It's hunger compelling them.

274
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,178
I will tell you what courage is, JoJo.

275
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:03,719
Courage is to look your fear in the eye

276
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:06,472
and know that it has no dominion over you!

277
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,726
Fear scatters your breathing.

278
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:11,058
When you toss your fear into the dust,

279
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,421
breathing is the sword ever at your hip.

280
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,467
Breathe with courage, and you will never want for hamon.

281
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,868
Bravery is our birthright, lads!

282
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:22,390
And for all the abilities they may bring into a battle,

283
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:25,770
courage is something a zombie
relinquished when he took this form!

284
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:27,618
They're no better than fleas!

285
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:30,450
Sendo wave kick!

286
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:38,493
A knee full of hamon to the head seems
to have cured this one's braggadocio.

287
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,231
I don't believe it. He didn't even spill any wine.

288
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:44,815
JoJo, you finish the creature off.

289
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:47,221
Destroy the brain. It's the only way.

290
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:49,936
Anything else, and you risk it coming back.

291
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:56,868
Time for the slaughter, naughty little pigs.

292
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,329
I'll cut you to shreds one by one.

293
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,486
Don't tell me we're following him into that passageway.

294
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,314
It has to be destroyed,

295
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:10,752
but we will be doing no such thing.

296
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,682
JoJo...

297
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:17,228
I expect you to finish off this
abomination without spilling a single drop.

298
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,668
All right, one last bit of advice before you go.

299
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,681
There were no vikings in the land of Norway,

300
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:27,027
until the north wind blew in and created them.

301
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,430
If even one drop of that vino goes to waste,

302
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:33,562
I don't care how utterly you defeat the zombie.

303
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:36,020
I will abandon you here and now.

304
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:38,275
Oi!

305
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:41,012
Listen to yourself. Have you gone insane?

306
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:42,687
I know what I'm doing!

307
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,194
I will do my best.

308
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,188
Like the vikings, I will be strengthened by hardship.

309
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:53,563
It's a labyrinth.

310
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:57,527
Even with this torch, all it's
doing is casting shadows to bedevil me.

311
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:01,872
The torch!

312
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:03,271
I'm bright as day to him!

313
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,980
All this does is illuminating my position,

314
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:19,171
but without it, I haven't a clue where
he's lurking, or from where he'll strike.

315
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:29,539
Even in the dark, I can smell the blood from his arm.

316
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:34,257
I must think like my foe, just as the baron commanded.

317
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:35,894
I'm sure he's close.

318
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,220
Next, I must master my fear, lest it sap my hamon.

319
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,432
Breathing is the sword at my hip.

320
00:20:41,997 --> 00:20:44,482
That's it. A little closer,

321
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,506
and I'll be picking my teeth with your bones, boy.

322
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:52,908
The harsh wind blowing down off of the
arctic ocean birthed the fearsome vikings.

323
00:20:53,071 --> 00:20:58,116
Only when we are tossed headlong into the
crucible of adversity do we rise to the challenge.

324
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,919
What will a glass of vino create this night?

325
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:05,073
If he should fail, Dio has already won.

326
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:07,700
What? The wine is rippling.

327
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,629
Of course. Just like when we were training in the stream.

328
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:13,542
It's conducting the hamon.

329
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:18,789
It passes through the glass, my arm,
my body, the ground itself!

330
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,757
I can feel his vibrations in the wine.

331
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,480
With hamon, all is made clear to me now.

332
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,149
My spirit trembles!

333
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:28,855
My heart is ablaze!

334
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,959
I've found you, zombie!

335
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:33,549
These stones offer no protection!

336
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,623
Sendo Hamon Overdrive!

337
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:39,953
Turn the corner so I can feast on you.

338
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:49,298
Sounds like you passed the test
with flying colors, JoJo.

339
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:50,314
Excellent.

340
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:52,982
Adversity has made the lad a viking.

341
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:14,543
I'll be the roundabout

342
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,495
the words will make you out and out

343
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:23,924
I spend the day your way

344
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:31,020
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

345
00:22:38,473 --> 00:22:41,513
The music dance and sing

346
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:45,583
they make the children really ring

347
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:50,884
I spend the day your way

348
00:22:50,909 --> 00:23:00,161
call it morning driving through the sound
and in and out the valley in and around the lake

349
00:23:01,068 --> 00:23:05,457
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

350
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:12,061
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

351
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,533
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

352
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:24,057
24 before my love you'll see

353
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:27,878
I'll be there with you

354
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,296
this time, I break you.

355
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:34,400
Curses on you, queen!

356
00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:36,512
Can he overcome this delusion?!

357
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:37,846
A duel between heroes.

358
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:40,308
I'm ending your reign of terror here and now!
