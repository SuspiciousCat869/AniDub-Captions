1
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:23,895
All right, enough.

2
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:25,554
Something's going on here.

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,883
I've felt like someone's eyes have been
on me all morning watching my every move.

4
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:35,761
Why? Clearly I'm alone.

5
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,864
Nobody could have followed me all the way out here.

6
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:42,643
I'm out in the middle of nowhere.

7
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:46,433
But I can't shake the feeling that someone's here!

8
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,115
Damn my imagination.

9
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:51,989
Must be the heat playing tricks with my mind.

10
00:00:58,694 --> 00:01:00,282
Well, aren't you a sharp one?

11
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:05,501
You somehow sensed my presence although I was
engaging my skills of stealth this entire time.

12
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:07,511
Even wild bats can't do that.

13
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:11,405
Why the hell are you following
me? I've got no business with you.

14
00:01:11,683 --> 00:01:13,130
Oh, I'm not following.

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,569
I'm in the business of capturing, see?

16
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:20,552
Our army would like to ask you some
questions about Straizo, Joseph Joestar!

17
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:24,225
Straizo? Why would you be interested in him?

18
00:01:24,697 --> 00:01:26,691
And who is "our army"?

19
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:02,551
By your accent, the cut of your face,
and your smell, I'd guess you're German.

20
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:07,722
I want to know what business a thug like
you has with either Straizo or Speedwagon.

21
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,137
But if you're not gonna say anything,

22
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:12,450
I don't mind having to beat some answers out of you.

23
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:17,844
You think you can take on the blade of s. S.
Commander Donovan with just your bare hands, little boy?

24
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:20,331
I'm almost insulted.

25
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:23,279
But since you insist, I'm happy to oblige!

26
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:26,877
Great, but how 'bout I give you
back your flea‐ridden magic rag?

27
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:37,486
Cactus needles.

28
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:46,635
Victory.

29
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:52,148
I really thought that you were going to give me
more of a challenge there. What happened, little boy?

30
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,258
Repeat after me. "I never should have challenged

31
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,816
your superior power, herr Donovan."

32
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:02,477
I... I never should have
challenged your... superior power.

33
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:05,347
What's that? I can't hear you.

34
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,913
I underestimated your etiquette.

35
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:08,430
Huh?

36
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:14,140
You really are quite the gentleman for letting me rest
right here and giving me these moments to recover safely.

37
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:17,707
What are you talking about? Recover safely?

38
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,962
Have you lost your mind, little boy?

39
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:21,336
Wait a sec. What's this?

40
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,559
What's up with this cactus?

41
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:24,268
You should take a closer look.

42
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:39,098
That cactus was my goal all along, herr Donovan.

43
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:45,450
Cacti are made up of nearly 95% water, and
they're known to be fabulous conductors of hamon.

44
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:48,656
Now then, repeat after me, herr Donovan.

45
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:51,881
"I promise to tell Joseph Joestar everything."

46
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:56,956
Okay, then.

47
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:59,321
When Speedwagon's body disappeared,

48
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:02,973
I swore to myself that I would
never give up hope, no matter what.

49
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:06,772
Turns out he was safe all along.

50
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:10,054
Man, it's nice to hear some good news for a change.

51
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:15,313
I can't wait to tell granny Erina.
She'll be so happy to hear about this.

52
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:20,928
Although, there's no way of telling how
the Germans have actually been treating him.

53
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:27,318
Regardless, I'll bring him home, and granny
Erina's smile will shine like the midday sun.

54
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,272
Hey, don't leave!

55
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:45,615
Look, major Von Stroheim! The
pillar's shell is starting to crack.

56
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:48,484
It's currently holding the blood of five prisoners.

57
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:51,614
We still don't know what its full capabilities are.

58
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,268
Feeding it any more could push it
beyond our established safety zone.

59
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:55,864
Hmm.

60
00:05:57,326 --> 00:06:00,354
I'm curious how the blood was
extracted in the first place.

61
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:05,699
No, wait! I don't want to know. I can
imagine what sort of things you came up with.

62
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:15,619
Oh, Speedwagon.

63
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,947
No need to look so pale.

64
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,751
I told you from the start there was nothing to fear.

65
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:26,288
Stop being so arrogant! You've
no idea what he's capable of!

66
00:06:26,414 --> 00:06:28,106
Relax, old man.

67
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:30,561
That test chamber is impenetrable.

68
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:34,954
It has iron walls nearly 20 inches thick.

69
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:39,419
It's equipped with flamethrowers, machine
guns, und explosives if we need them.

70
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,530
I shouldn't be surprised that all of your courage
doesn't even add up to what I have in my little finger.

71
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:46,825
You coward!

72
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:49,526
Want to know what I think, Speedwagon?

73
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:55,030
I think that thing is simply a statue of
petrified caveman bones that's wasting my time!

74
00:06:58,257 --> 00:06:59,884
Major! He's erupting!

75
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:00,847
Hmm?

76
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,144
It's blood!

77
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:06,003
That blood it took in is spraying out everywhere!

78
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:07,640
I can't see a thing!

79
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,721
Activate the sprinkler system!

80
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:38,228
His outer layer is transforming.

81
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:40,437
It looks like it's morphing into flesh.

82
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:42,590
He's trying to move.

83
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:44,717
I... I think he's alive!

84
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,614
Then, he'll need a name,

85
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,139
something better than "the pillar man."

86
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:57,245
As his new godfather, I suppose this task falls onto me.

87
00:07:57,551 --> 00:07:58,698
Let me see.

88
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:04,054
I'll name him after the Mexican
winds. He shall be known as Santviento.

89
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,630
Look. He's trying to stand.

90
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:11,706
Rise before us.

91
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,271
Rise up, und show us what you are made of...

92
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,463
Santviento!

93
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:24,133
Hmm?

94
00:08:58,841 --> 00:08:59,921
You see that?

95
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:04,161
Santviento might have a future
doing comedy in the cabaret.

96
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:08,447
The ultimate organism? More like the ultimate idiot.

97
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:10,431
What do you think there, Speedwagon?

98
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,945
He's got the brains of a feral animal.

99
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,113
He's trying to smell his way around.

100
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,547
He's really just a primitive man.

101
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,626
This is a farce.

102
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:25,501
Regardless, let's just move
on und assume he made the masks.

103
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,726
You there, start the experiment.

104
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:30,514
Somebody open the door to the next chamber.

105
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:31,467
Yes, sir!

106
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,809
What... what's that supposed to be?

107
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:42,714
A prisoner.

108
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:45,081
Well, a prisoner with a mask, actually.

109
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:47,616
Is... is that a vampire?

110
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:53,618
Only a few days ago, that thing was a feeble,
toothless old man knocking on death's door.

111
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:57,310
We still haven't fed him today, so he must be thirsty.

112
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:59,439
I think he'll go straight for the attack.

113
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:01,219
Who will win?

114
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:03,602
I can hardly wait.

115
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:10,646
What? That's all? He didn't even put up a fight.

116
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:13,243
He's an ordinary man after all.

117
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:16,922
We don't have any other subjects
for this test, major Von Stroheim.

118
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,480
We planted explosives in the
prisoner's head for this exact situation.

119
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:23,301
Just give us the word, and
we'll activate them immediately.

120
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:24,111
Major?

121
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:24,819
Fine.

122
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,997
Wait! Stop!

123
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:38,680
I rescind the order!

124
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:39,904
His jaw, look.

125
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,993
What's happening there with his jaw?

126
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,108
His hands, his arms.

127
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,101
What's going on with his arms?

128
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:54,276
I'd given him up for dead in the beginning, but
look, Santviento is somehow absorbing the prisoner.

129
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:02,292
He's pulling him straight into his body.

130
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,953
He's devouring him!

131
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,800
What a marvelous creature.

132
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:12,938
The masked man was no more than fodder for him.

133
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:17,849
Santviento feeds with his entire
body, so... so nothing is lost.

134
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:21,844
He can absorb every bit of his
prey's life force down to the last drop.

135
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:24,967
He ate him!

136
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:27,104
He actually ate the masked man.

137
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:29,447
How is that even possible?!

138
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:33,711
Und now look! He's... he's grown something.

139
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:35,572
Get a grip.

140
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:38,345
As long as he's still in that chamber, he can't hurt you.

141
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,704
He just gained a little weight
after his feeding. That's all it is.

142
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:43,634
His... his intelligence?

143
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:46,076
And what about his intelligence?

144
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:48,919
What level of thought is he capable of?

145
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:49,642
Huh?

146
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:57,706
Ma... major Von stro... Stroheim.

147
00:11:57,972 --> 00:11:58,735
What?!

148
00:11:58,854 --> 00:11:59,854
But how did he...

149
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,380
He said... how did he know my name?

150
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:06,166
He's not even supposed to be
able to hear anything from in there!

151
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:18,530
There it is.

152
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:21,320
According to my dangling cactus pal Donovan,

153
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:24,886
the underground facility I'm looking
for is hidden down there somewhere.

154
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:29,238
If he was telling the truth, Speedwagon should be inside.

155
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,758
So now how am I supposed to get in there?

156
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:36,214
Vegetables, canned goods, meat, ham, eggs.

157
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:39,532
Looks like you've got a nice
basket of food there, all right.

158
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:44,772
Now then, it's time for the frisking.

159
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:51,748
Aw, come on now. Stop making that
face. You can give me a little smile.

160
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,027
Lift up your skirts, and smile.

161
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:55,686
Hmm.

162
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,058
You're cleared to go. Next!

163
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,944
All I've got under my skirt is more Tequila, big boy.

164
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:10,117
Is it all right to bring that through, too?

165
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:10,994
Hmm?

166
00:13:13,498 --> 00:13:15,323
Hands up in the air!

167
00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:17,278
Any funny moves, and we shoot you dead!

168
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:20,162
What? Put your guns down. I haven't done anything.

169
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:21,776
That's a funny move there.

170
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:22,961
Fire.

171
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:27,932
No! Please don't shoot! I'm not
moving, and I've got my hands in the air!

172
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,905
All right. Damn. You Germans are so smart.

173
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,669
You saw through my disguise almost immediately.

174
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:34,972
Are you crazy?

175
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,523
Of course we saw through that thing.

176
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:37,793
You're disgusting.

177
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:42,933
Even my big sister isn't as ugly as you, and
we used her to plow the fields. She was an ox.

178
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,619
You should've spent more time in front
of the mirror this morning, big sissy!

179
00:13:46,644 --> 00:13:48,025
What was that?

180
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:52,707
Hamon!

181
00:13:57,442 --> 00:13:58,506
Oh, jeez.

182
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:04,981
Well, that was disappointingly easy.

183
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:09,515
If I can get this thing to fit,
this uniform should work nicely.

184
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,996
What... what's going on?

185
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:13,409
I... I don't know.

186
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:16,254
You don't know? Weren't you watching?

187
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:19,296
Major Von Stroheim, I only looked away for a moment.

188
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:20,607
Surely you understand.

189
00:14:21,117 --> 00:14:23,039
I mean, you were here as well, right?

190
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:24,589
Everybody here was watching.

191
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,854
It just happens that nobody saw anything.

192
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:33,685
Put that coffee down!

193
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:37,857
It... it was only for a moment.

194
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:40,755
I took my eyes off him for just a few seconds.

195
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,139
That's all. I swear.

196
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:47,793
It makes no sense. I mean, my vision is perfect, we
all have a clear view, but we don't know what happened!

197
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,445
This is unbelievable!

198
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:55,506
The chamber is completely sealed,
und still the subject managed to escape!

199
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:57,906
None of the walls show any sign of damage.

200
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,490
I don't care what you saw. I want him found.

201
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:05,471
Keep in mind that he may have concealed
himself somewhere inside the chamber.

202
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:10,570
Simply cut off the oxygen supply in there.
He'll turn up when he finds out he can't breathe.

203
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:15,178
The recorded film is now ready
for your viewing, major Von Stroheim.

204
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:16,712
What are you waiting for? Set it up.

205
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:17,309
Yes, sir.

206
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:20,646
Roll the film.

207
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,470
See that? He's running towards the wall.

208
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,300
Ja, but why?

209
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:50,048
Was ist los?

210
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:53,614
He's squeezing himself into the ventilation ducts!

211
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:56,484
Those slats are less than two inches tall.

212
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:01,597
How the hell could anyone possibly stuff
an entire body through a gap that small?!

213
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:03,144
Incredible.

214
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,809
He didn't simply dislocate his joints.

215
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:11,538
He somehow disassembled his entire skeleton so
that he could completely alter his shape at will.

216
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:23,638
You know what this means.

217
00:16:23,702 --> 00:16:28,094
He is now wandering around freely
somewhere in your base's ventilation system.

218
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:33,734
Santviento already knew your name somehow,
major Von Stroheim, and I think I might know how.

219
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,414
The only way that would be possible is
if he heard your name through the vents.

220
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:44,036
The vents lead directly into this room?

221
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:48,006
You, soldier, turn around, and
move away from that vent immediately.

222
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:49,349
Go, you idiot!

223
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,023
Uh...

224
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,626
It's him, it's Santviento!

225
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:06,605
What's happening to me?

226
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,243
Major Von Stroheim!

227
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:11,491
What's happening?! Where did everybody go?!

228
00:17:11,516 --> 00:17:15,557
And why is it so dark in here?! Why can't I see anything?!

229
00:17:15,645 --> 00:17:19,560
Somebody, please help me! I
can't see! What's he doing to me?!

230
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:22,811
Santviento is trying to take
control of that soldier's body.

231
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:26,815
Someone, anyone, please don't leave me alone!

232
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:30,835
You can't abandon me. Don't
leave me here with him inside...

233
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:38,547
Well, well,

234
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:45,140
I don't fully understand what's happening here, but
I feel like I'm practically bursting with new life.

235
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:46,918
What a catastrophe.

236
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:52,510
If this thing escapes, I'll be known for
creating the fatherland's most powerful enemy.

237
00:17:52,535 --> 00:17:53,963
We must destroy him.

238
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:56,703
At this point, it's either him or us.

239
00:17:56,728 --> 00:18:01,261
Very well! Take him out! Open fire,
and shred that monster to pieces!

240
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,519
Ooh. Heh.

241
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:06,522
Stop. That tickles.

242
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,470
He's still alive!

243
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,256
Impossible!

244
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:20,330
The bullets, they have no effect on him.

245
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:26,941
He's an abomination.

246
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,269
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

247
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:37,405
Why is he pointing at us?

248
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:38,603
Nobody move.

249
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,376
Don't you see he's imitating one of your machine guns?

250
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:44,172
Look. He's just copying what he's seeing.

251
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,858
So when he spoke earlier, he only said my name,

252
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:49,900
but did not understand it,

253
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:52,250
which means he's not intelligent.

254
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:54,268
He just apes what he sees,

255
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:56,838
und that gives me a great idea.

256
00:18:56,863 --> 00:19:01,978
If he's only capable of acting like a monkey, we
should start preparations for using him like one.

257
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:04,321
You...

258
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:09,192
Which one of you...

259
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:12,704
Was fool enough to disturb my slumber?

260
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:14,092
He... he spoke.

261
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,287
He's clearly capable of higher thought.

262
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:18,853
I'd bet he possesses a great intelligence.

263
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:20,599
He just learned our language.

264
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:23,476
Don't you understand that he did that in almost no time?

265
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:26,646
Die.

266
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:30,801
What the...

267
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:40,004
That must have been one of our bullets.

268
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:42,783
He's shooting at us. He's gonna kill us all!

269
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,800
Let's go, old man.

270
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:46,381
We better get you to safety.

271
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:49,853
There's no telling how many more bullets
that monster might have inside of him.

272
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:54,223
Just leave me. The last thing I need
right now is help from a German flunky.

273
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,590
What a pain.

274
00:19:58,498 --> 00:19:59,785
You never change.

275
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,265
I'm glad to see that you're
still just as stubborn as ever.

276
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:21,548
S... somebody do something! Open fire!

277
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:23,541
No! Stay away!

278
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,957
Pardon me. I'll need a bit of your hair.

279
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:28,835
Just a small handful or two.

280
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,202
What do you think you're doing?! Let me go!

281
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,116
The more you fight, the more it'll hurt.

282
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:35,992
You're assaulting a superior officer! Ow!

283
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:37,341
Who are you?

284
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:40,318
I know that demeanor, but it couldn't be.

285
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,532
I call this one, the old hamon hair attack!

286
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:55,883
But that means... that means you're...

287
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,910
Joseph Joestar!

288
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:05,396
Barrier up!

289
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:29,900
You're gonna lose your hair if
you're not careful, Mr. German army man.

290
00:21:29,963 --> 00:21:31,678
That felt like sandpaper.

291
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:34,356
You should consider investing in a decent moisturizer.

292
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,170
But how long have you been here, Joseph?

293
00:21:37,442 --> 00:21:39,101
Eh, just got here.

294
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:45,272
H... hair.

295
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:47,767
Sorry I took so long.

296
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:52,055
I'd have been here sooner if i'd
known what kind of party was going on.

297
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:13,676
I'll be the roundabout

298
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:17,553
the words will make you out and out

299
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:22,974
I spend the day your way

300
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:30,070
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

301
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,563
The music dance and sing

302
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:44,633
they make the children really ring

303
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:49,934
I spend the day your way

304
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:59,211
call it morning driving through the sound and
in and out the valley in and around the lake

305
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:04,518
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

306
00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:11,100
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

307
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:17,488
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

308
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,296
24 before my love you'll see

309
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:25,480
I'll be there with you

310
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:31,971
he's using his advanced intellect to learn everything.

311
00:23:32,884 --> 00:23:35,205
Work with me here. Make some love to the camera.

312
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,650
You lowly primitive.
