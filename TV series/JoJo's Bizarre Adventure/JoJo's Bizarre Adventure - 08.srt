1
00:00:01,817 --> 00:00:03,500
Poco, where you been?

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,644
How dare you leave the house like this?

3
00:00:06,804 --> 00:00:08,734
But please, papa.

4
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:12,182
Papa, I'm sorry I left the house,

5
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:14,380
but wh‐where's my sister?

6
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:17,550
Well, where do you think? She's out lookin' for you.

7
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:18,629
Wha?!

8
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:22,404
No, papa. Don't say that. Tell me she didn't go out.

9
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:25,614
Poco, what's ailin' you?

10
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,352
You're not behavin' right.

11
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,973
My sister!

12
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:33,438
My sister!

13
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:15,073
Consider this, dear.

14
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:18,576
Examine this rose in bloom for but a moment,

15
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:20,545
vibrant, fresh, and young.

16
00:02:20,627 --> 00:02:23,103
What you see is a mirror of your youth.

17
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:26,916
Consider this fact carefully, mademoiselle.

18
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,851
From the first moment this flower
fully blooms, it begins to wither.

19
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:34,123
A shame, don't you think?

20
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,596
Only 16, so sweet, so innocent and pure now,

21
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:42,184
so full of delicious life energy.

22
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,013
Wonderful, lord Dio.

23
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:54,516
Those lacking in manners are not fit to exist.

24
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:56,774
Now, mademoiselle,

25
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:59,164
I offer unto you a choice.

26
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:04,926
Would you not care to enjoy your
youth and beauty for all eternity?

27
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:06,767
Fret not, my dear.

28
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:10,749
I shall not force my friendship
upon you, like others might do.

29
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:12,606
You control your life.

30
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:15,666
You hold your destiny in your own hands.

31
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:17,715
You fiend.

32
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,908
Eh? How's that again?

33
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:31,476
You wear the flesh, but you're not a man. Devil, go away!

34
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:58,116
Alas, although your acquaintance will
be brief, let me introduce my companion.

35
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:03,845
I present unto you doobie.

36
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:09,016
As regrettably I am not to your
taste, enjoy your time with him.

37
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:11,264
Au revoir, mademoiselle.

38
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:31,123
Oi! Who hit me?!

39
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:33,065
Who's there?!

40
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:35,592
Doesn't matter, does it?

41
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,562
You're a zombie.

42
00:04:37,713 --> 00:04:40,551
Your kind don't deserve any introductions.

43
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:41,670
Sister!

44
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:42,701
Poco!

45
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:00,070
Bit you. Bit you on your pretty little face!

46
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,269
What did that?

47
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,153
What's he got under there?

48
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,163
His mask. Look at it.

49
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:10,969
Look out!

50
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:14,268
Run, run, run.

51
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:23,427
That zombie, he's chock‐a‐block with serpents, all
sorts, venomous cobras, flesh‐eating asps and vipers.

52
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:25,694
Bit surprised, are you?

53
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:28,093
They sank their fangs in his face,

54
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,846
and more than just once.

55
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,111
How wearisome.

56
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:37,014
I haven't the time to deal with
any more of Dio's foolish games.

57
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,898
Damn. Very well done.

58
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:50,143
He squeezed out the poison. Good control.

59
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:54,310
He's learned a great deal about blood
flow in a very short amount of time.

60
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:59,695
Baron Zeppeli, he's helpin' our boy after
giving Jonathan his life energy when he died.

61
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:07,133
I'll use a bit of the great hamon I possess
to turn these serpents back on their master.

62
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,493
Sister!

63
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:16,576
Poco!

64
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,431
Sister!

65
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:54,683
Guess who survived his time in hell, Dio.

66
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,069
You are alive, JoJo.

67
00:06:57,577 --> 00:06:58,696
Curious.

68
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:05,411
I suppose logically that would then
indicate you have killed my two knights.

69
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:10,615
Lord Dio, we await your order to
reduce him to a pile of bloody flesh.

70
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,618
Lord, let my fangs make an impression on him.

71
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:14,991
Dio!

72
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:16,410
No.

73
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:18,144
This one is for me.

74
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:20,586
He falls by my hand alone.

75
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,440
Don't misunderstand me, JoJo.

76
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:29,589
Honestly this is something in
which I will take no pleasure.

77
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,461
We were raised in the same house, and the
prospect of turning you into an undead thing

78
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,166
is not a happy one for me.

79
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:40,074
That's why I wanted you to be
quickly dispatched by my knights.

80
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:43,294
But it would seem, in the end,

81
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,263
I underestimated you.

82
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:53,105
Seeing you here alive brings me to the realization
that, as an emperor, I was being far too soft.

83
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:58,539
But now, now I'll put you to death
without a moment's thought or compunction.

84
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,350
I could say the same.

85
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:03,440
I will feel no hint of guilt for your death.

86
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,405
But first I have a question, JoJo.

87
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:10,244
Whatever happened to that mustachioed charlatan of yours?

88
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:11,998
You seem to have lost him.

89
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,402
Hear me, Dio.

90
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,898
It shames me as a gentleman to say this,

91
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:21,270
but I can no longer hold back the truth. I,
Jonathan Joestar, have such hatred for you,

92
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:23,444
vengeance consumes me.

93
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,885
I swear I will kill you!

94
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,706
Come, JoJo!

95
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:38,216
Come, JoJo!

96
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:43,801
What are you doing?

97
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:45,867
JoJo, please step aside.

98
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,971
I have a prior claim.

99
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,666
It is my right to avenge my friend's killing.

100
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:53,873
Zeppeli was a brave man and boon companion

101
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:56,298
through two decades of harsh training.

102
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:58,625
Dio, for his life,

103
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:01,820
I shall now send you to the bowels of hell itself.

104
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:04,077
No. Wait, Dire. Listen to me.

105
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,954
Dio has hidden abilities for which you are not prepared.

106
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:12,252
Hmm? Ah.

107
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,360
There's an interesting walk.

108
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,586
Apparently with decades of the proper training,

109
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:22,136
mere humans can enable themselves
to float through the air.

110
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:24,604
But in only a single night,

111
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,564
I attained power far surpassing that of any human guru.

112
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:35,945
You truly think you can defeat me in this manner,

113
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,868
like you were sleepwalking?

114
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:45,083
Fell for it, didn't you, fool?

115
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:48,523
Thunder cross split attack!

116
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:52,890
Uncanny. In crossing his arms, he can mount an attack

117
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:55,417
while still keeping his guard up for protection,

118
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:57,465
an incredible strategy.

119
00:09:57,504 --> 00:10:00,422
No fighter has ever been able to escape this move.

120
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:09,866
Oh, no!

121
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:13,418
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

122
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:16,170
I can't, I can't move.

123
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:18,569
He froze Dire.

124
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:22,535
Dio must have somehow chilled all
the moisture in his body at once,

125
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:24,470
turning him to ice in an instant.

126
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:26,959
Dire can't control his hamon.

127
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:30,088
He can't send it into Dio unless his blood is flowing.

128
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:34,146
'Strewth, that Dio's a fearsome creature right enough.

129
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,858
He froze Dire's whole body at once.

130
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:39,298
How did you do this?

131
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,182
Oh, we are feeble, aren't we?

132
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:46,010
You imbecile, you dare think
you could lay a finger on me?!

133
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:50,833
You're the one who's going to
give up your life like some mongrel.

134
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:54,401
Let's endeavor to give them a good show, shall we?

135
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:55,290
No. Dire, no!

136
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:56,933
Dio, stop it now!

137
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:09,017
It's time, JoJo.

138
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:12,213
You're the next I shall dispatch to oblivion.

139
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:19,099
Dire!

140
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:24,082
Those hamon‐filled rose's thorns do sting a bit.

141
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,577
Dire!

142
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:31,932
Insect. How dare,,,

143
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:34,021
how dare you wound me,

144
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:35,695
wound my face?!

145
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,024
Dire, no.

146
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:42,797
Speedwagon, my sword.

147
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:43,680
Catch!

148
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:47,686
Dio!

149
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,529
I know exactly how to deal with you.

150
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,412
Dire gave up his life,

151
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,987
which showed me just how vulnerable you are.

152
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:57,053
It will be very easy for me now.

153
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:58,739
You won't be able to stop it.

154
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:02,407
All I need to do is fill Blueford's
sword of luck and pluck with hamon

155
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:04,054
and slice you with it.

156
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:14,085
You dare to touch me, filthy human?

157
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,643
You dare to touch me with your hamon,

158
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:19,534
more disgusting than frog urine?!

159
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,652
Your string of luck's run out.

160
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:26,507
Now shall you be fodder for my zombies.

161
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:29,802
They will gnaw the faces right off your skulls.

162
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:34,589
Now we see. He shows his true colors as
someone fit only to rule over a dung heap.

163
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:38,993
His cool toff's sophistication, nothing but a cheap mask.

164
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:42,955
Now that he's had himself a
nice humiliating taste of hamon,

165
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,303
he reveals his true filthy self.

166
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:50,568
Straizo's my name.

167
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,957
No mercy.

168
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:55,024
Page would be my name.

169
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,064
Jones.

170
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:57,445
Plant.

171
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:58,751
Bonham.

172
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:00,928
Needle vein strike!

173
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,944
Roses are alive and vital,

174
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,981
so hamon will remain inside them,
flowing along with their life force,

175
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,444
but the same thing can not be said for steel.

176
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:20,211
It's necessary to make contact.

177
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:24,941
A great many of them are coming.

178
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:28,428
If you wish, I shall handle them for you.

179
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,001
From all the indications I've seen,

180
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:42,045
that bloke Dio's more swift than any leopard.

181
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,445
But with Zeppeli's hamon,

182
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:47,264
Jonathan just might keep up.

183
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:54,860
Though Dio is strong enough to pulverize
flesh and bone with a flick of his wrist.

184
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,683
For the both of them, it could be up
to what happens in the very first moment.

185
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:12,437
I will squeeze the life out of you with my own hands.

186
00:14:12,575 --> 00:14:16,096
I will cleanse the world of your evil influence!

187
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,399
What?

188
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:21,189
He snatched up some roses when I wasn't looking.

189
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,905
Come now!

190
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:27,566
Wait. That's good.

191
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:29,561
He circled around to the right.

192
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,061
Dio is blind on that side.

193
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,720
Take this, Dio!

194
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:33,915
No! Damn it all!

195
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:35,885
He knows exactly what he's doing!

196
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:49,258
Yes! Kill him!

197
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:56,948
He finally defeated Dio!

198
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:00,403
Defeated?

199
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:02,690
You fools.

200
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:03,629
Oh, no.

201
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,583
I‐i can't move.

202
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:08,096
I'm frozen.

203
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:10,749
You're so feeble, JoJo.

204
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,753
Now, weakling, you shall join
my other children of the night.

205
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:24,746
I've got your rubbery little carotid between my fingers.

206
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:26,924
So warm and springy.

207
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:29,181
A strangely pleasant feeling.

208
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,786
A kick.

209
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,608
My legs have been frozen, too.

210
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:43,967
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

211
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:46,438
Enjoying this anguish, JoJo?

212
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:48,470
One tiny little move,

213
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,309
and this delicate blood vessel
snaps in two like a wet ribbon.

214
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:55,854
With your carotid open, all your blood will be mine.

215
00:15:55,975 --> 00:16:01,882
Then I shall fill the vacancy with my own
vampiric essence, and you will be my thrall.

216
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:04,282
We have to help him.

217
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:06,623
Zombies, to me!

218
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:09,198
Keep those peasants back.

219
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:10,621
I'm rather busy.

220
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:14,688
Nothing seems to stem this tide of zombies.

221
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:17,198
We cannot provide any help.

222
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,343
Now, JoJo, in your last moment of free will,

223
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,703
realize that the victory was mine.

224
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:26,814
No, Dio. You've not won yet.

225
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:29,315
You've made a fatal mistake.

226
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,308
How so?

227
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,623
You see, Dio, if you freeze me completely,

228
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:37,713
you'll not be able to continue feeding on my life energy.

229
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:41,220
This means, however, that my hamon is unaffected.

230
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:44,498
You can't block it as long as I remain partially unfrozen.

231
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:48,272
Your tactics, to say the least, are somewhat flawed.

232
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:52,268
How long has the sword been in those flames?

233
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:55,169
The metal blade is conducting heat from the fire

234
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,155
faster than I can freeze it.

235
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,546
Hamon is flowing up the blade.

236
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:08,134
Sunlight yellow overdrive!

237
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,555
Now!

238
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:11,081
He's done it!

239
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:12,273
Huh?

240
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:14,687
Not exactly correct.

241
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:17,841
It's quite evident the hamon did not make it through.

242
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:20,015
My arm.

243
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,828
My arm is frozen solid again!

244
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:25,434
I only briefly touched his face.

245
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:28,557
This isn't over, JoJo.

246
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:38,950
I have to admit I must admire your tenaciousness.

247
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:40,284
Really, I do.

248
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:42,970
And your ingenious use of the flame,

249
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:45,861
truly marvelous example of quick thinking.

250
00:17:46,895 --> 00:17:47,490
Hmm.

251
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:50,618
But really, JoJo,

252
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:53,287
an emperor's reach should exceed his grasp.

253
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:56,204
Just a touch on the arm is all it takes.

254
00:17:56,362 --> 00:17:59,906
I can turn your whole body to ice in two seconds.

255
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:07,533
The vampire essence, he squeezed it out.

256
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:08,652
He's not done.

257
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,303
Jonathan won't give up.

258
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:16,541
Really? The "let's do battle" stance?

259
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,406
You're not serious.

260
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,490
No matter how you prepare,

261
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:23,811
human ability is extremely limited and finite.

262
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:27,165
Your hamon training avails you nothing.

263
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,836
It's useless, useless, useless, useless, useless, useless!

264
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,069
A mere monkey can never defeat a lion.

265
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,748
In comparison to my power,

266
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,942
you are but a mere monkey, JoJo!

267
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:45,660
You're wrong! With true conviction,
the human race can overcome anything!

268
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:49,609
Let me demonstrate to just what
heights a human being can rise.

269
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:51,079
Don't waste your time.

270
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:53,748
A zombie is all you'll ever be!

271
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,565
'Strewth! His hand is burning!

272
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:04,602
Flame's coming from his glove.

273
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:08,233
That might just have the power to get through Dio's ice.

274
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:11,616
When this business is done,
which one of us will have fallen?!

275
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:13,777
We'll find out, Dio!

276
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,079
Dio's blocking JoJo.

277
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:26,472
But, no...

278
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,530
It's breaking through.

279
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:44,834
I'm disintegrating.

280
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:45,993
It can't be!

281
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:50,778
The pain. The burning.

282
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,825
I can't...

283
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,046
My reign was to have lasted forever,

284
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,805
for centuries uncounted by man.

285
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:08,000
You had to be destroyed, Dio.

286
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:11,496
I will not die!

287
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:25,108
How did...

288
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:27,426
He shot energy from out of his eye.

289
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:30,867
He came to within only mere
inches of incinerating my brain!

290
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,464
Far too close.

291
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:34,663
The last act.

292
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,523
The demon refuses to acknowledge his death.

293
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:40,581
Dio has fallen from the parapet.

294
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,871
Dio.

295
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:10,582
Look! He fainted!

296
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:11,671
He's worn out.

297
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:16,517
Too right. He's been in more fatal fights
tonight than a man should have in a lifetime.

298
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:20,440
But why would he shed tears
for an evil creature like that?

299
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:26,321
He weeps because they spent their youth together.

300
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,490
Dio was like a brother to him.

301
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:33,148
But as for me, I could sing a song of joy.

302
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:37,714
Baron Zeppeli, were you watching?!

303
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,889
He did it!

304
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,605
Jonathan Joestar did it.

305
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:44,817
Dio is dead.

306
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:47,621
It may sound an exaggeration,

307
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:50,704
but JoJo saved the world tonight!

308
00:22:05,096 --> 00:22:08,232
I'll be the roundabout

309
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:12,195
the words will make you out and out

310
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,445
I spend the day your way

311
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:23,674
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

312
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:26,044
in and around the lake

313
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:31,444
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

314
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:38,120
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

315
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,293
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

316
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:46,071
with you

317
00:22:47,105 --> 00:22:54,865
24 before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

318
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,659
What a beautiful sight.

319
00:23:30,697 --> 00:23:32,991
These tears that I'm crying are from joy,

320
00:23:33,016 --> 00:23:34,789
you must leave, Erina.

321
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,647
I want to stay like this.

322
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:39,831
Where is my body?
