1
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:10,288
Battle for the Red Stone of Aja,

2
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:14,165
JoJo versus Wamuu

3
00:00:14,377 --> 00:00:16,659
in a one‐on‐one chariot duel.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,011
The time is upon us.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,078
When the full moon once again
emerges from behind that cloud,

6
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:26,714
the battle will begin!

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,882
Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu...

8
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,741
I wish they wouldn't make all that noise.

9
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:38,340
Why is it that the bad guys get all the fans?

10
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:40,897
One lap is 960 meters.

11
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:45,402
It takes approximately one minute
for these beasts to complete a lap.

12
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:47,330
Do you see that column over there?

13
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:51,422
On each lap, a different weapon will be hanging from it.

14
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:52,622
Weapons?

15
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:54,518
No.

16
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,781
One weapon at a time.

17
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:02,984
Whichever of us can capture that column before the
other will then have the opportunity to wield the weapon.

18
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,440
Do you see the first one up there?

19
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:07,371
It's a giant sledgehammer.

20
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:14,624
That thing could smash right
through a chariot in one blow.

21
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:17,413
If Wamuu is able to get his hands on it,

22
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:20,011
my situation isn't just going to be bad,

23
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:21,774
it could be terminal.

24
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:26,190
But if I can get to it first,

25
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:28,946
cover it with oil, and fill it with hamon,

26
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:30,711
then victory will be mine.

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,910
I am looking forward to an excellent,
fulfilling fight from you, JoJo.

28
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:35,926
Get ready.

29
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:43,932
The moon approaches the cloud's edge.

30
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:47,298
When its light falls upon us, the contest begins.

31
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:51,638
JoJo, what are you doing there?

32
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:53,562
The race is about to start.

33
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:56,149
Heh. I'm well aware of that.

34
00:01:56,525 --> 00:02:00,086
The start will be the key, and I
sure don't want to mess that up.

35
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:02,983
That's why I'm checking the rubble under my wheels.

36
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,826
Look at that, Wamuu.

37
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:07,161
You've got quite a big pile under your buggy.

38
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:09,060
Are you going to take care of it?

39
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:16,972
Hurry! Come on! Get up there!

40
00:02:25,624 --> 00:02:26,592
JoJo!

41
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,235
Begin now!

42
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:08,577
Begin now!

43
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:09,347
Hyah!

44
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:10,934
Hyah!

45
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:14,097
What's this now?

46
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:16,609
Lord Wamuu is having trouble.

47
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:18,747
His chariot is just standing there.

48
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,107
Look at that. His wheels are blocked.

49
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:24,998
JoJo, he did this.

50
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,786
That cheeky little devil.

51
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:31,915
You bastard. You piled them there while we
turned our attention to watching the moon.

52
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:36,613
You're nothing but a cheater. A rotten human cheater.

53
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,846
Show me in the handbook where it
says I can't do something like that.

54
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:44,127
All you told me was to lose means to die,
and that was the only rule in this fight.

55
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:47,615
When it comes to my survival, I don't care who I offend.

56
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:48,997
Beep beep!

57
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:50,027
Hyah!

58
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,170
Hyah!

59
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,389
The human's getting close to the column!

60
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:03,402
Yeah! Get him!

61
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:04,874
Don't let him get it!

62
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,875
JoJo will be the first one to the hammer.

63
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:12,260
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

64
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:14,739
I can't wait to have you in my grasp.

65
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:18,345
I've got ya. You're mine.

66
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,624
Damn, I'm going a lot faster than I thought I was.

67
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:24,927
No, stay there.

68
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:25,724
JoJo!

69
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:28,122
Eh? It snagged my ring.

70
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:29,703
Couldn't have predicted that.

71
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,182
Great. That was lucky.

72
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,454
Now the fight is in the bag. I've got this.

73
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:37,393
You can have the hammer.

74
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:40,325
That was my plan from the very beginning.

75
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:45,885
I see Wamuu has a plan in mind.

76
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:49,850
Let me see it now, your fighting genius.

77
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:53,521
A little oil up here. Add some hamon.

78
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:57,611
I've got a little medicine for you right here, Wamuu.

79
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:04,728
Wamuu's starting to lose speed.

80
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:06,475
It's not a race.

81
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,507
They are in a fight to the death.

82
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:11,487
The keys to winning are tactics and strategy,

83
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:15,648
the right weaponry, control of the environment.

84
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:21,314
All right then. I'll just slow down and
introduce him to my little friend here, the hammer.

85
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:25,747
JoJo, listen! You mustn't slow down any more!

86
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:29,149
Since you're the one with the
hammer, I'll just get something else.

87
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:37,568
So, Wamuu, are you ready to see
exactly what this thing can do?

88
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:39,658
Then here we go! Hah...

89
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:44,929
Look there.

90
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,527
He was so happy with his hammer at first, but not anymore.

91
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:50,091
He sure plans ahead...

92
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:51,393
Better than I do.

93
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:55,579
Hurry up! Go faster, and get away from him, JoJo.

94
00:06:56,526 --> 00:06:57,488
Too late.

95
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:06,426
So now you will no longer have your chariot.

96
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:13,908
Down already? Things seem to be over a bit early.

97
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,823
He might want to rethink his plan. Heh.

98
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,041
JoJo!

99
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:29,341
The probability of him being
trampled by my vampire horses is 90%,

100
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,278
the chance of him attempting to break left is 5%

101
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:36,089
and breaking to the right is 5%.

102
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,452
So, now then,

103
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:40,589
what is our little human warrior going to do?

104
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,709
M... my hammer.

105
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:45,274
Where is my hammer?

106
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,689
He wants his hammer?

107
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:48,366
Did he hit his head too hard?

108
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:50,898
That hammer's not going to save you now.

109
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,758
JoJo must not dodge.

110
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:58,424
If he does, Wamuu will stop and
finish him with his Divine Sandstorm.

111
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:03,910
But what JoJo did was grab the hammer
and head straight for Wamuu's chariot.

112
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:07,445
Well done, JoJo. Great thinking.

113
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,004
That's exactly right.

114
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:13,493
What?

115
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:16,463
He struck the yoke midway between the horses!

116
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:19,253
As the horses ran on,

117
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:23,232
JoJo used the hammer's force
to launch himself into the sky.

118
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:24,784
Hmm?

119
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:27,008
That move was unbelievable.

120
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:31,134
The hammer's length kept him from being
trampled under the hooves of the horses.

121
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,759
How was that?!

122
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:39,015
And now for that big hammer
whack you've worked so hard to earn.

123
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,349
Huh? Wh...

124
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:43,201
He's gone. W... where'd he go?

125
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:48,301
Heh heh. You can clearly see that
Wamuu is a step ahead of his quarry.

126
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:53,317
Wait. That's right.

127
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:56,428
These fellas can hide themselves inside other creatures.

128
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,432
That was close.

129
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,190
His boot came off his foot.

130
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:05,675
That boot saved him.

131
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,859
If he only had on some other kind of footwear.

132
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,871
I've got luck on my side,

133
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:15,588
for example, the way the handle of
that hammer got caught on my ring.

134
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:17,894
Luck helps with effectiveness.

135
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,364
Now let's take a look at your situation.

136
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:26,211
Wamuu, your own power has trapped you
inside of that horse. That's not very lucky.

137
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:30,776
And here we go!

138
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:34,421
A little hamon for you and the horse you rode in on!

139
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:36,566
You fool. You don't see the trap.

140
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:38,535
Careful, JoJo.

141
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,920
You need to keep at arm's length from him!

142
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:48,761
Now that Wamuu has merged with
that horse, he's free to use his hands

143
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:52,549
without worrying about vibration
or speed, which means that...

144
00:09:52,574 --> 00:09:55,426
No one has survived a direct hit by that attack!

145
00:09:55,564 --> 00:09:57,016
Caesar couldn't.

146
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,885
And now you will taste Divine Sandstorm!

147
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:22,109
Even if it lasted only the distance of half a lap,

148
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:26,002
it was a battle filled with many twists and surprises.

149
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:32,237
But in the end, Wamuu proved the superiority
of both his thinking and his fighting prowess.

150
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:38,237
I think the next battle is
going to be quite a test of will.

151
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,740
Truly, it is not my preference to fight a woman.

152
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:44,481
Wamuu dislikes it even more.

153
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:49,709
Notwithstanding, all users of
hamon must be done away with.

154
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,926
Drink that.

155
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:55,334
It will provide a painless death.

156
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,983
Thanks. That's quite considerate of you,

157
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:02,071
but JoJo seems to be a little less dead than you thought.

158
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:02,954
Huh?

159
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,248
Uh, lord Kars,

160
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,084
look out there in the arena.

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,336
It can't be!

162
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:14,849
Lord Wamuu's arms, they look
like they're about to fall off.

163
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,677
Madness.

164
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:24,555
How could this have possibly happened to me?

165
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:26,678
What's wrong?

166
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:28,910
What is happening to Wamuu out there?

167
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:31,389
Look! There, it's JoJo.

168
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:33,627
He's alive. He's moving.

169
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,469
He's not even hurt.

170
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,551
Well, I apparently managed to survive once again.

171
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:45,835
But Wamuu hit him directly
with his Divine Sandstorm attack.

172
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:47,423
How could he...

173
00:11:47,646 --> 00:11:49,464
Directly? Heh.

174
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:53,554
JoJo was cunning enough to make
it look like it was a direct hit.

175
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:57,325
He is an absolute genius at trickery and misdirection,

176
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:00,350
but I'm not sure I should be giving him praise for that.

177
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:01,358
Hmm?

178
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,653
Take a close look at Wamuu's arms.

179
00:12:07,404 --> 00:12:09,481
Oh. Wait. Now I see.

180
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:17,053
He wrapped the reins around Wamuu's
arms after filling them with hamon.

181
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:21,186
Wamuu's Divine Sandstorm was short‐circuited.

182
00:12:21,337 --> 00:12:24,484
Wamuu was already sticking one hand out of the horse.

183
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:27,224
He was going to try to use his Divine Sandstorm.

184
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:31,299
However, in order to do so, I knew he'd
have to stick his other hand out, too,

185
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:34,206
and I had the perfect counter for that move.

186
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,741
Lord Wamuu's face, look at him.

187
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:38,853
He's in agony. See that?

188
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:42,157
He doesn't seem to know where
he's going. His eyes are vacant.

189
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:43,771
What should we do?

190
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,583
It's the second lap.

191
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:47,458
But what's going to happen?

192
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:50,326
Lord Wamuu can't hold a weapon like that.

193
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:53,017
Is it even possible for him to fight?

194
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,235
It's not a surprise.

195
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:56,768
Right in midattack,

196
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:59,849
Wamuu was struck with a lethal dose of hamon.

197
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:04,574
The confidence built up over
millennia of triumph has crumbled.

198
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:10,232
The quiet, calm intensity his
victories gave him has vanished.

199
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:13,476
A tragic shock for him.

200
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:16,034
But it matters not at all!

201
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,275
Put out the next set of weapons, and do it now!

202
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:24,876
Lord Kars has given the order.

203
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:27,401
When he speaks, we must obey.

204
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:34,959
For the second lap, both warriors will receive crossbows.

205
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:38,072
Each comes with ammunition for two shots.

206
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:42,164
The first warrior there has the
choice of the small or large bow.

207
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,261
What's this now? There's two weapons.

208
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:58,492
There's a large one and another that's smaller.

209
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,558
Lisa Lisa, this is what's going through your thoughts now.

210
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,101
"Wamuu's mind is in no condition to entertain a fight.

211
00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:13,498
"So why then would Kars be deploying these
new weapons and with such apparent confidence?"

212
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:16,109
It's very unsettling, is it not?

213
00:14:16,364 --> 00:14:21,616
Well, the reason is that, at his core,
Wamuu is a warrior of legendary mental power.

214
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:26,986
The very best athletes use a psychological
technique called the switch comeback.

215
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:31,904
When these champions are brought low by
the pressure of shock, failure, or fear,

216
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:37,385
they can flip a mental switch and bring out
their fighting spirit for one last herculean effort.

217
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:40,032
Desperate times call for desperate measures,

218
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,340
and Wamuu will win at any cost.

219
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,985
No, I don't believe it.

220
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,653
Did he really just do that?

221
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:50,473
What? No, lord Wamuu.

222
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:52,284
Look! His eyes are gone.

223
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:54,810
He poked out his eyes!

224
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:03,081
I foolishly relied on my eyes, because I was
able to see, and JoJo exploited my weakness.

225
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,358
Now I will use this horn to see
things outlined in wind instead of light.

226
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,109
Hyah!

227
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:17,850
He flipped the switch by
removing his eyes from the equation.

228
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:20,884
Now he is once again psychologically invincible.

229
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:24,961
He senses the wind with that horn on his forehead.

230
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,805
He sees air better than he did light.

231
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,038
Huh? What is that supposed to be?

232
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:33,731
That's not going to have any effect on me.

233
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,745
Because of you, I lost my friend Caesar.

234
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,137
Try any trick you want.

235
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:41,716
I'll do whatever it takes to finish the fight.

236
00:15:42,612 --> 00:15:45,046
JoJo, which crossbow will you take?

237
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:46,253
Yeah, which one?

238
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,009
You need to ask? You know the answer to that.

239
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:52,346
The large one, you stupid morons.

240
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:54,046
Power is what I want.

241
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:58,081
You gotta admit that one does have power.

242
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:00,178
Yeah, lots of power.

243
00:16:01,356 --> 00:16:05,612
Oh, come on. I can't even draw this thing.

244
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:09,768
It's so tight. I can't get the
string to go anywhere at all.

245
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:11,812
You like it?

246
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,336
You got greedy, didn't ya?

247
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:17,548
Even a normal crossbow takes a huge
amount of strength to draw back. Ha ha.

248
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:19,683
You had to have the big one, huh?

249
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,748
That's what greed gets you!

250
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:31,170
I will use the first ball to paint a picture of the wind.

251
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,143
Whoa!

252
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:43,586
Now that I know what the range
is, the next shot will not miss.

253
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:47,253
How am I supposed to defend
myself if I can't shoot this thing?

254
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,957
Lord Wamuu, shoot him!

255
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:50,690
Blow him to smithereens.

256
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:53,861
Let us snack on whatever small pieces remain.

257
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:01,746
Hyah!

258
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,357
Right. Just as I thought.

259
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:14,438
The wind stirred up by these fires makes
it hard for him to figure out where I am.

260
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:16,098
This is the spot.

261
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:20,303
That's an error, underestimating Wamuu.

262
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:27,674
What? Lord Wamuu's pointing away from JoJo.

263
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,260
He's turned this way. He's aiming at us!

264
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:40,078
JoJo is staying on the opposite side from
Wamuu, thinking to shelter behind the flame.

265
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:43,328
Actually he has only served to point out his position.

266
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:45,561
I see what Wamuu is doing.

267
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,229
He's banking it like it's a billiard shot.

268
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:51,168
What?!

269
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,710
He hit me from behind!

270
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:11,100
I was examining the terrain while we were circling.

271
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:14,609
I had to find the proper wall
placement to use as a weapon.

272
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:18,834
Can't breathe.

273
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:23,420
The ball lost some of its momentum,
so it did not pierce JoJo's skin.

274
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,915
But he's spitting up a lot of blood,

275
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:28,337
which would then betoken some injury.

276
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:31,580
Finish him now, Wamuu!

277
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:35,767
But remember how wily and full of tricks JoJo is.

278
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:37,895
Be on your guard!

279
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:40,850
Has he set another trap?

280
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:47,492
When I hit the ground,

281
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:50,671
the impact cocked my crossbow.

282
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:53,818
I can't let him know that.

283
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:58,091
I can't kill him from this distance.

284
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:01,960
Closer. A little closer.

285
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:04,749
That's it.

286
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:06,188
He did.

287
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:19,221
Hmm?

288
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,462
Huh. Almost made it.

289
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,551
His aim was off, though, unfortunately for him.

290
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:31,428
But I really must commend him for
staying in the fight until the very last.

291
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:35,767
It's over, JoJo.

292
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:37,903
No. Stay away.

293
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,884
Ohh. Don't come any closer.

294
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,147
Go away. Leave me alone.

295
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:44,570
Please, I just can't take any more!

296
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:46,541
You've gotta spare me!

297
00:19:47,877 --> 00:19:48,796
Shameful.

298
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,791
Look at him. The sniveling coward's throwing rocks.

299
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,016
He's just a pathetic loser.

300
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:58,163
Try to go down like a man, you disgusting little worm!

301
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,500
Listen, Wamuu.

302
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,916
Here is the very next thing
that will come out of your mouth.

303
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:06,951
"Don't you dare dishonor our battle here, JoJo."

304
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,199
Don't you dare dishonor our battle here, JoJo.

305
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:12,344
Want some more?

306
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:15,294
That bother you?

307
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:20,267
You know that a bat could simply fly right
between all those rocks and avoid every little piece.

308
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:22,544
Why can't you avoid them like that, Wamuu?

309
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:26,729
An iron ball!

310
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:29,666
It showed up out of nowhere!

311
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:32,469
You bastard.

312
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:36,976
I guess the human just took you down again.

313
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:41,327
You see, I banked the shot just like you did earlier.

314
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:46,716
The arena went silent.

315
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:49,789
Not one individual made a sound.

316
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:52,370
There wasn't even a moan.

317
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:57,338
Wamuu's injury peered out like the
sneering face of a jack‐o'‐lantern.

318
00:20:57,751 --> 00:21:01,674
The iron ball carried with it a small amount of hamon.

319
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:04,383
The wound began to fester.

320
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:07,783
Wamuu's damaged arms grew even worse.

321
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:12,557
No more divine sandstorms now or ever.

322
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:24,894
I... I've got to try to breathe
again, get my hamon in balance.

323
00:21:28,464 --> 00:21:31,267
You're trying a kick after faking a fall?

324
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,586
All right. If you still think you can do this.

325
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:38,065
Rebuff overdrive!

326
00:21:48,493 --> 00:21:51,714
It's over! Wamuu won't be getting up again.

327
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:54,433
How can this be?

328
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:56,925
What has become of the great Wamuu?

329
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,895
The mighty warrior is no more.

330
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:05,569
12,000 years of victory reduced to this.

331
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,877
His arms.

332
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,735
His arms are gone.

333
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:15,953
It is not Wamuu's way to give up an easy win.

334
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:18,575
My wounds are only to flesh.

335
00:22:18,742 --> 00:22:21,229
My losses are a path to ability.

336
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:25,352
I will use all of these things for victory!

337
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:28,738
His arms,

338
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:31,071
he threw them using his chest wound.

339
00:22:31,171 --> 00:22:33,377
They grabbed JoJo and are choking him.

340
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,757
What's this? I can't breathe.

341
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,085
I can't gather my hamon.

342
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:54,579
What's going on?

343
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,685
That wind, it's flowing towards Wamuu.

344
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,143
The wind obeys me. This is my ultimate mastery!

345
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:05,478
Ultimate mastery?

346
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:06,924
No, you shouldn't!

347
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:10,324
Stop it, Wamuu! It must not be done!

348
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:15,074
The wind is going into those pipes.

349
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:17,728
Ultimate mastery,

350
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:19,467
atmospheric rift!

351
00:23:27,154 --> 00:23:30,837
I will remember you

352
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:34,466
your silhouette will charge the view

353
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:39,668
of distant atmosphere

354
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:46,049
call it morning driving through
the sound and even in the valley

355
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:48,708
in and around the lake

356
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:53,942
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

357
00:23:57,358 --> 00:24:00,907
one mile over, we'll be there and we'll see you

358
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:07,108
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

359
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:09,469
doo doo doo yeah

360
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:12,749
24 before my love you'll see

361
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:18,698
I'll be there with you

362
00:24:37,795 --> 00:24:43,264
Along the drifting cloud the
eagle searching down on the land

363
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:50,215
catching the swirling wind the
sailor sees the rim of the land

364
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:55,881
the eagle's dancing wings
create as weather spins out of...

365
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,917
You cowardly animals!

366
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:02,689
No matter the method utilized...

367
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:03,540
Remarkable.

368
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,098
You crossed a line.

369
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:07,472
No honor earns you no consideration.

370
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:11,023
This world and all in it belong to me.
