282
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:01,248
Eh?

10
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:09,420
Hmm.

14
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:19,236
Pow.

42
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:12,884
Huh?

45
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:19,027
Huh?

58
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,449
Huh?

61
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:05,470
Dio.

104
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:41,225
Dio!

150
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:24,756
Huh?

32
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,296
Hyah.

135
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:29,552
JoJo!

308
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:19,502
JoJo!

345
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,287
There!

30
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,172
Agreed.

81
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:12,929
Lead on.

100
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:29,354
Tell me.

169
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,733
Uh..huh.

322
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:10,767
Go, boy.

362
00:22:45,128 --> 00:22:46,152
With you

16
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,326
uh, well,

77
00:06:05,294 --> 00:06:06,519
Uh, Poco.

247
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:48,978
Go ahead.

53
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,369
This is...

110
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:10,296
He did it.

124
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,199
And now...

33
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:30,035
What the...

44
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,287
Molto bene.

82
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,365
Zoom punch!

83
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:33,843
Dio Brando.

129
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:15,992
Your blood,

192
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:51,840
Zoom punch!

52
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:33,160
Look around.

54
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:37,357
A graveyard.

127
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:11,274
Think again.

206
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:33,691
Mi dispiace.

299
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,478
What's this?

338
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:01,724
What's this?

102
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:34,904
I don't know.

139
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,452
It's useless!

172
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:52,243
Heed me well.

195
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:03,172
Speedwagon...

307
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,465
Have at thee!

15
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:21,454
What happened?

46
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:20,305
What happened?

148
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:14,920
Baron Zeppeli!

157
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:42,643
What do we do?

283
00:18:01,273 --> 00:18:02,542
He is our foe.

304
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:08,286
No. But how...

329
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:29,334
Can I make it?

80
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:12,052
JoJo, this way!

89
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:53,682
Come and fight.

175
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,573
I care not how.

281
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,026
Another zombie?

295
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:43,105
He and Tarukus,

59
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:00,721
the sun is gone.

65
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,437
I'm all a sweat.

86
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:44,017
I say only this.

98
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:24,096
Come, charlatan.

106
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,179
I will take him.

241
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,680
I've no regrets.

113
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:23,009
Uhh. Your hand...

114
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,526
It's freezing me.

182
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:18,943
Then what, baron?

202
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:22,892
Nothing happened.

225
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:41,022
They were adrift.

328
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:27,611
Act, and quickly!

331
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:33,633
I get one chance.

28
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:03,992
Oi! Bring it back!

41
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:10,017
£2 says I'm right.

97
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:22,455
All save this one.

116
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:33,907
For hamon to work,

164
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:05,792
Tarukus, Blueford,

170
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:43,517
These are knights,

271
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:24,407
Scarlet overdrive!

288
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,104
As you will, then.

349
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:37,686
That's impossible.

20
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:34,745
Did my finger slip?

22
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,269
In English, please.

34
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,339
He's walking on it!

43
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:16,611
Why'd it shock me?!

69
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:35,912
This is Dio Brando.

105
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:43,417
What are you doing?

189
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:40,670
You selfless idiot.

272
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:29,421
Look at that power.

364
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,401
Blueford is a mess!

115
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,963
It's simple, really.

168
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:39,998
Poco, get to safety.

311
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:29,979
We have to help him.

176
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:01,847
Tell me I'm dreaming.

197
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:06,393
With all due respect,

253
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:15,903
Curses on you, queen!

312
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,483
What? Now this brute?

321
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:09,967
Just a single breath.

341
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,715
Change your strategy.

366
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,792
This pain is nothing!

12
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:15,248
Thus far, all is well.

57
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:52,071
There, JoJo! It's him!

151
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,865
My hand's cold as ice.

185
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:29,483
If it's heat you need,

236
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:16,510
So fearsome were they,

242
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,731
They went to Elizabeth

243
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:37,271
and sealed their fate.

273
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:31,510
Huh? He looks so calm,

325
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:19,697
A duel between heroes.

354
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:08,450
I'll be the roundabout

358
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:26,151
In and around the lake

48
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,106
lad, are you all right?

79
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,653
It's time for us to go.

87
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,095
This time, I break you.

107
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,631
Your doom is nigh, Dio.

138
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:38,435
JoJo, now!
Baron, now!

179
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:09,058
He's their main target.

250
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,029
Elizabeth, you serpent!

314
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,451
JoJo's as good as dead.

319
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,154
I... I need to breathe.

351
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,167
The tables have turned.

143
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,958
You are sorely mistaken.

154
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,551
He removed the moisture.

218
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:19,809
In the mid‐16th century,

19
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:33,387
it seems I was too rough.

50
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,927
Did I use too much hamon?

112
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,959
Consider this an eclipse.

162
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:59,024
Huh? Is it an earthquake?

249
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:54,758
Not so royal now, is she?

297
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:48,676
Relax your muscles, JoJo.

320
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:07,980
I need to generate hamon.

368
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:39,630
Life magnetism overdrive!

62
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:10,918
Why are they crawling out?

78
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:09,280
Well, Poco, hang on tight.

109
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:08,637
Sunlight yellow overdrive!

149
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:21,506
Cor, this ain't happening!

178
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:07,429
They are waiting for JoJo.

196
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:04,981
You don't have to do this.

201
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:20,280
Sunlight yellow overdrive!

231
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:01,859
Seeing a chance to strike,

305
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:13,588
You've a keen eye, my boy.

356
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:17,137
You spend the day your way

24
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:54,520
his crime was well planned.

76
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,269
What do they call you, lad?

125
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:03,669
Time for the coup de grâce.

132
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,745
Masterful block, by the by.

173
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:54,195
I find these humans vexing.

302
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:03,616
Which one is his sword arm?

91
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:59,108
I, the pinnacle of creation?

159
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:47,180
How do we stand against him?

161
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:55,093
You should save your breath.

174
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,030
I order you to destroy them.

262
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:50,827
In life, they were fearsome.

276
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:40,135
Godspeed, you brave bastard.

25
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:56,547
I salute the boy's ingenuity.

137
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,131
I'm liable to lose my temper.

208
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:46,955
I need to get my arm working!

212
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,643
Look at the face on that one.

223
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,553
They had lost their families.

285
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,733
He moves with infernal speed.

342
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,099
Try giving it to him instead.

11
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,685
Farmers seeing to the harvest.

108
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:05,619
Solar hamon, pierce the night!

214
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,481
I can read people like a book,

228
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,871
In Mary, they found just that.

263
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:52,774
In death, they are invincible!

289
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,668
Tarukus, this one here's mine.

165
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:08,514
Arise, and fight at my command!

187
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:34,567
What? So you have a plan, then?

233
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:06,889
The people turned against Mary.

269
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,722
Keep your wits about you, JoJo!

279
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,901
This one's flesh belongs to me!

335
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:50,799
But JoJo knew better than that.

37
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:59,722
Ahh. That was a nice diminuendo.

75
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:03,553
Even moldering knights obey him!

119
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:42,000
Rendering your attack powerless.

254
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:21,037
And thus they went to their end.

261
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:48,126
Such is the power at my command.

270
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:20,166
Hamon within me, come to my aid!

301
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:01,829
Blueford is giving nothing away.

323
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,640
Make for the surface if you can.

327
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:26,190
Come. You'll drown if you tarry.

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,106
A castle dominates the landscape.

35
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:40,138
JoJo, your shoes are getting wet.

123
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:57,609
Freezing your arm in the process.

134
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:28,472
I didn't think you had it in you.

142
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:53,314
If you think hamon will save you,

167
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:35,361
Where'd he dig up these bruisers?

193
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:54,070
Aye, peasant. Give me your blood!

204
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:29,280
I may have sold you short, amico.

264
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,537
We have sworn fealty to lord Dio.

266
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:01,454
It is a place without redemption.

298
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,154
Breathe steadily, no matter what!

310
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:28,398
No air to breathe means no hamon.

337
00:20:56,017 --> 00:20:58,791
He's mad. He's going deeper down.

347
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,586
I found it. With just one breath,

133
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:26,486
for the moment, your mentor lives.

152
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,097
Every nerve is crying out in pain.

153
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:34,995
The skin on my fingers is peeling.

290
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:28,804
That's Blueford, the black knight.

350
00:21:38,236 --> 00:21:40,388
Prepare yourself, servant of evil.

140
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:48,716
As you can see, by freezing my arm,

141
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:51,273
your puny attack had nowhere to go.

217
00:14:14,273 --> 00:14:17,052
Bow to my will, o warriors of yore.

303
00:19:04,418 --> 00:19:06,778
Neither. His hair wields the blade.

315
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,692
He can't touch Blueford underwater.

348
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:35,067
My blood is generating hamon again.

355
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:11,940
The words will make you out and out

23
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:52,769
our culprit is a lad, it would seem.

47
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,504
Who are you? Why are you holding me?

90
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,987
You dare to address me thus, insect,

188
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:39,012
In a pinch, I figure this'll do you!

300
00:18:57,732 --> 00:18:59,787
He's got both hands behind his back.

353
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:53,441
Underwater turquoise blue overdrive!

68
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,621
Listen, you. You're gonna pay for it.

92
00:06:59,164 --> 00:07:02,325
To mere humans, I am like unto a god,

118
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,710
I froze the very blood in your veins,

284
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:05,157
Get thee gone from here, you glutton.

84
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,537
JoJo and Speedwagon have told me much.

160
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,280
So anemic, this parlor trick of yours.

194
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:01,393
His hair, he's using it to feed on me.

199
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:13,636
If he can drink my blood through this,

209
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,862
There's no way he can take them alone!

227
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,575
But in something larger and ineffable.

293
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:37,830
I can tell he's no one to tangle with.

1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,373
Behold the village of wind knights lot,

155
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:38,719
The baron's arm is in a pretty bad way.

158
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:45,186
Hamon's the only weapon in our arsenal.

220
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:26,098
The cunning queen Elizabeth I, a tudor,

244
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:43,310
You think you're so selfless, don't ya?

246
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:48,048
Your precious Mary's already worm food.

309
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:26,213
Oh, no. He's at a serious disadvantage.

6
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:18,391
Mining coal as penance for their crimes.

130
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,644
I can feel the evil coursing through it.

145
00:09:57,327 --> 00:10:00,056
This fiend is our equal many times over.

190
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,730
Heard they treat frostbite in the arctic

265
00:16:56,576 --> 00:16:59,063
We have come to lay waste to this world.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,655
It houses prisoners who toil underground,

21
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:38,064
Un migliaio di scuse, my dear Speedwagon.

111
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,076
His hamon is moving its way up Dio's arm.

213
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:01,454
And that one, he's the bleeding Minotaur.

237
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:18,751
Elizabeth approached them with a bargain.

306
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:16,345
My hair's danse macabre has claimed many.

365
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:32,433
I just hit 'em until they fall to pieces.

8
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:26,488
517 souls call the sleepy burg their home.

232
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,594
Elizabeth blamed Mary for Darnley's death.

343
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,189
Wind knights lot, it's a coal‐mining town.

60
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:04,135
You will not live to see it rise once more.

95
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:17,054
Already, this Dio has the soul of a tyrant.

245
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:45,370
Well, you're losing your heads for nothing.

258
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,208
The peerless locks slicing the man's flesh.

330
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,806
Or will I just get dragged down to my doom?

39
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:05,106
Do you think I struck the right spot, baron?

49
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,060
The fall shouldn't have hurt you that badly.

71
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:43,304
But here in a field of darkness and carrion,

136
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:34,915
That said, if you keep cutting in like this,

274
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:34,116
But I know they ain't far from his thoughts,

277
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,021
Me thinks this boy is a champion of his day.

296
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:46,308
And now he returns from the dead to kill me?

326
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:22,152
If you're lucky, you can beat me to the top.

332
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:39,440
As death readied himself for another victim,

128
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,834
I'm ending your reign of terror here and now!

183
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:21,547
Then I could heal my arm a little with hamon.

219
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:22,836
Two women waged war for the crown of England,

251
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:06,659
You played us false and murdered Mary anyway!

74
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,171
Somehow, we will purge the world of this evil.

131
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:22,022
Stop it. You're going to set me all a tremble.

221
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:29,762
And the beautiful Mary Stuart, queen of Scots.

238
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,749
Surrender, and bring an end to this bloodshed.

275
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,324
All that he's lost and what he's rediscovered.

316
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,233
I will go. Here, there is nothing left to see.

333
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:42,503
JoJo felt a wellspring of resolve burst forth.

344
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,119
That means collapsed tunnels and sunken earth.

360
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:37,981
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

147
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:06,761
come what may, I can't let harm befall the lad.

361
00:22:40,582 --> 00:22:44,249
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

73
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:51,255
a creature of such guile must not have the mask.

352
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:45,728
Down here, my hamon will hit you all the harder.

93
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:05,677
So why would I cavort down in the filth with you?

144
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:57,279
His strength is like nothing I've ever witnessed.

180
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:15,009
He's a warrior, but he can't handle both of them.

181
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,709
If only my blood would start moving a little bit.

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:07,794
Nestled in a valley and ringed by daunting cliffs.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,794
But how few shall remain when the carnage is done.

224
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:39,760
Without a purpose to center them, a raison d'être,

294
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:41,604
Back in my school days, we learned about this man,

359
00:22:27,334 --> 00:22:31,523
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

40
00:04:05,254 --> 00:04:08,381
no, but a couple of paces to the left should do it.

186
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:32,598
Speedwagon's feeling right charitable this evening.

205
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:32,357
I thought you would run when things got truly dire.

363
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:55,039
24 before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

13
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:18,759
however, Dio lurks in the shadows waiting to strike.

177
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:04,967
That big one broke the boulder with a single finger.

146
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:03,732
Wait. He's about to freeze JoJo's arm just like mine.

234
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:10,527
She was caught and imprisoned in a series of castles.

240
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,290
If our lives can buy the queen her freedom, I accept.

280
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:58,808
Oh, yes. I can smell his delicious cartilage already.

292
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:35,590
Just watching him put one foot in front of the other,

367
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:36,216
The day will come when this will be the death of you.

17
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,498
Speedwagon has been begging me to share in your power.

27
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:02,372
He's making off with every pound we have to our names!

96
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:20,455
All of the scars from my battle with JoJo have healed,

121
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:51,890
You see, I just vaporized the moisture in my left arm.

184
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,698
How am I supposed to thaw this damnable thing in time?

255
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:24,482
Legend has it that Tarukus's neck was stiff with fury,

64
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:19,127
but it's like the grim reaper's breathing down me neck.

85
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:42,580
To the mask that allows you to act out your evil heart,

117
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:36,753
Blood must flow through this arm with which you hit me.

336
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:55,717
Instead he turned and swam down, deeper into the abyss.

26
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:59,424
How come you two are heaping
praise on that little imp?

36
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:43,546
Try to bolster your hamon for the sake of your wardrobe.

156
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:41,554
Gangrene will take it if we don't get the blood flowing.

4
00:00:10,174 --> 00:00:13,052
Built in the middle ages as a proving ground for knights,

103
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:38,204
How many loaves of bread have you eaten in your lifetime?

122
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:55,267
The force of it pulled in all heat in the immediate area,

7
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:22,028
fishing and farming provide sustenance and commerce alike.

38
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:02,691
Your overdrive passed through the rocks as smooth as silk.

72
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:47,823
He thinks us easy prey, ripe for the taking at any moment.

99
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:28,311
Relinquish your blood, that I may erase this imperfection.

340
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:07,712
You're trying to take it away from him. That's the reason.

94
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:14,107
He almost knocked me off my
feet with a blast of pure hate.

235
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:14,565
Tarukus and Blueford fought
like lions to free their queen.

239
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,615
Grant us but this one thing,
and we will spare Mary's life.

313
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:36,376
Damn. He needs us, and we
can't lift a finger to save him.

51
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:31,690
I'd guess we were meant to
give chase when he took our bag.

248
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:52,431
Take a look over by that wall
if you're having your doubts.

56
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,859
Our young thief, he was
hypnotized and made to lure us here.

200
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:16,996
Then perhaps it will serve as
a conduit for my hamon as well.

210
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:52,429
Eyeballing that sword freezes
me up worse than you just did.

226
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:45,150
The dutiful man seeks respite
not in the vagaries of romance,

31
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:11,875
a guide who knows the lay of
the land would not be unwelcome.

207
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:37,216
Baron, if we live through this,
you and me are right as rain.

268
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,473
Dio's turned the flower of
knighthood into vengeful monsters.

230
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:59,658
But one day, Mary's husband,
lord Darnley, was found murdered.

339
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:04,767
Danny's grabbed hold of your
toy pistol and won't give it back?

29
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,107
Yes, he took our money, but
think how he might be able to help.

101
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:33,514
To undo your injuries, how many
innocent lives did you consume?

317
00:19:46,258 --> 00:19:50,817
And now I will transform this
sleepy village into a necropolis.

267
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:06,278
That hate they felt when they
died, it had 300 years to ferment.

67
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:29,285
Sir Joestar loved him, and all
he got for his troubles was death.

166
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:13,962
Let their cries of anguish resound
so that all may know my glory!

203
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:26,516
Have I already lost too much
vitality to make my hamon effective?

346
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:29,466
If I'm right, there should be
air trapped underneath these rocks.

256
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:28,964
And the headsman broke many an ax
before the task was finally done.

257
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:33,301
For his part, Blueford's hair
coiled around the executioner's feet,

357
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:23,420
Call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

120
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:48,284
I have mastery of my body in ways
that you can't even begin to dream.

286
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:15,889
Milord Dio, in this young man, I
do sense a great reservoir of spirit.

278
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:48,413
He shall make the perfect target
upon which to practice the art of war.

126
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:07,882
This punch is going to shatter your
arm and your skull like a windowpane!

291
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:32,716
He was known to be a flawless fighter,
and he was utterly devoid of mercy.

88
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:52,657
Hey, bambino, it's easy to be cocky
when you're up there out of harm's way.

163
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:03,549
You're going to need that air for all
the screaming I have in store for you.

70
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:40,510
He and his minions have no power to
attack us while we stand in the daylight,

63
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:16,367
I... I've been trying to steel my spine
leading up to this little tête‐à‐tête,

198
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,880
I'd be buggered before I let harm come
to you or JoJo while I can lend a hand.

222
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:34,745
The most steadfast of her vassals were
the great knights Tarukus and Blueford.

215
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:07,597
And these two are full of stories
Speedwagon don't wanna hear, thank you kindly.

216
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:13,739
You should be honored to perish at the
hands of these men, Tarukus and Blueford.

259
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:41,225
The story of these brave knights' betrayal
seems to have struck a chord with me.

252
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:12,211
I die this day. But my hatred for you
and your wretched family will live forever!

260
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,649
From the earth, I called them to wreak
their vengeance all these centuries later.

66
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:24,909
How am I supposed to find my courage
when that monster's staring right at us, huh?

191
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:48,279
By cutting open a seal and sticking the
frozen hand or foot into the poor blighter.

229
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:54,828
They swore to serve and honor the young
queen, even at the cost of their own lives.

287
00:18:15,947 --> 00:18:21,519
I humbly petition you for the right to
face him in sole combat and strike him down.

211
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:57,142
JoJo's well over six feet tall, but next
to that thing, he might as well be Tom thumb.

318
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:57,174
The zombies I create will devour England
like a plague, with the world soon to follow.

324
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:17,960
I suffer not for want of air, but my armor
leaves me sorely encumbered under the water.

18
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:31,678
I meant to help him create just a little
bit of hamon, as I did that first day with you.

55
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,559
It's no accident that we now find ourselves
held by these restless cadavers, my friends.

334
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:48,748
His lungs screaming for breath, an ordinary man
would mindlessly claw his way towards the surface,

171
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:50,744
casualties of queen Elizabeth's fatal machinations
in the mid‐1500s against Mary, queen of Scotland.
