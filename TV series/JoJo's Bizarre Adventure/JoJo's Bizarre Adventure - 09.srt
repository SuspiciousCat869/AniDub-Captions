1
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:05,905
The hamon...

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,796
Has almost reached my head and brain.

3
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:10,755
Must do something.

4
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:13,505
Move, arm. Move!

5
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:27,585
Ohh.

6
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,484
Lord Dio.

7
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:35,185
We'll get a new body for you.

8
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:47,366
Excerpt from the December 4,
1888, edition of the London press

9
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:55,727
it has been reported that 73 of the 452 residents in
the town of wind knights lot have gone missing overnight.

10
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,448
The police have been pursuing lines of inquiry

11
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:01,569
based on certain witness accounts.

12
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:08,639
These accounts state that four outsiders were seen
burning a man's clothing at the base of a nearby cliff.

13
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:14,979
One of the four was reportedly wielding a large
hammer and using it to smash a curious stone mask.

14
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,624
Our work here is done.

15
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:53,829
Heir to the Joestar fortune,

16
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:56,194
Jonathan Joestar weds Erina,

17
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:58,418
only daughter of the pendletons.

18
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:02,708
The couple will travel to the Americas.

19
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:03,509
Nice.

20
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:06,067
Blazes!

21
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:08,179
Look what time it is!

22
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,841
Their ship's about to leave!

23
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:16,725
Oi!

24
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:19,195
Eh? Mr. Speedwagon!

25
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,015
You almost missed being able to say goodbye.

26
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:23,587
Sorry I'm so late.

27
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,200
So then, where are they?

28
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:26,678
They're both on board the ship.

29
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:27,345
Eh?!

30
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,439
It's about ready to sail.

31
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,306
What? It is?

32
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:33,505
Where are they? I've got to see them.

33
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,003
Now then, father styx,

34
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:39,657
we expect to hear great things
from your mission to Mexico.

35
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,525
I'll certainly do what I can.

36
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:47,068
Jonathan Joestar! Where are you?!

37
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:48,622
Watch where you're goin'!

38
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:51,517
What makes this thing so blasted heavy, anyway?

39
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:52,638
How should I know?

40
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,806
We been hired by that Asian
bloke, so we move it where he says.

41
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:57,021
Hmm?

42
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:58,721
Hmm?

43
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,990
Oi. D‐did you boys hear that?

44
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:07,455
Quit flappin' your blasted cake hole.

45
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,869
Now move it! We don't get paid 'til this job's done.

46
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:16,106
Ow. Ruddy hooligans.

47
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,285
Mr. Speedwagon.

48
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:17,773
Hmm?

49
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:19,456
Look. They're up there.

50
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,109
Hello!

51
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:23,262
Jonathan!

52
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,965
What a beautiful sight.

53
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:29,921
I wish you a long, love‐filled life.

54
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:32,399
I'll always be here for you.

55
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:35,998
If you ever need me, just call. I'll be there.

56
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:38,350
Though at the moment,

57
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,081
I'd just be in the way, eh?

58
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:51,181
Bon voyage!

59
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,757
Have a wonderful trip!

60
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,171
Poor little bird, all alone.

61
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:27,094
Did you lose your flock?

62
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:35,785
Erina.

63
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,248
Something wrong, love?

64
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,261
Dear, what are you crying about?

65
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:47,350
These tears that I'm crying are from joy,

66
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:49,535
joy that I am here with you.

67
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:55,123
Even as a boy, you strove to be a true gentleman,

68
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:58,969
a champion of others, no matter
the consequence to yourself.

69
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:02,529
And now that proud and noble Jonathan Joestar

70
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:04,576
is here in my arms.

71
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,031
And I have you.

72
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:08,985
When my heart was frozen in despair,

73
00:06:09,362 --> 00:06:11,855
you warmed me and brought me back to life.

74
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,797
I am fortunate to have saved a world that has you in it.

75
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:20,300
I only wish father could have known you.

76
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,010
Erina, come. Supper is waiting.

77
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:26,265
Jonathan!

78
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:32,606
Um, I wanted to tell you to be
careful so you wouldn't bash your head.

79
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:42,324
Ah, I wish that today would last forever.

80
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,537
Damn, it fell into the engine room.

81
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:53,066
That's a filthy place to go after it.

82
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:55,925
I could just sell it,

83
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,038
but it brings in the shekels.

84
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:00,960
Dear lord.

85
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:04,712
You surely do seem to enjoy picking on me.

86
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,707
Oh. No.

87
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:16,677
I haven't the experience drinking a man does.

88
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:20,206
Just a bit, barely enough to get the taste.

89
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,063
It really isn't strong at all.

90
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,938
I think it's good.

91
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:26,816
Here.

92
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:36,819
Eh?

93
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,393
No. It can't be.

94
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,013
Jonathan?

95
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:52,971
Impossible.

96
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:54,804
There is no way.

97
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,554
He's here. Dio's alive.

98
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:03,012
Erina, go. Back to our cabin now.

99
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:05,205
And don't forget to lock the door.

100
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:15,152
Humph.

101
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:17,051
Eh?

102
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,140
Well, that's rather strange.

103
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,680
The lock's undone.

104
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,872
Queer bit of business.

105
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:26,657
I can see a metal catch glinting on the inside there.

106
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,908
But that would mean...

107
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:31,653
That this trunk is locked from the inside!

108
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:38,923
Halt!

109
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:41,338
You can't escape!

110
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,452
Where is...

111
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:46,287
My body?

112
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:48,074
D‐dio.

113
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,000
Jonathan is so upset.

114
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,524
Something is wrong.

115
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,379
JoJo.

116
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:01,098
Do you see the condition in which I find myself?

117
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,765
Your work.

118
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,515
There is a reason I display myself to you like this.

119
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:10,886
Why would I show my weakness to my deadliest foe?

120
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:14,303
Because though I once despised you,

121
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:18,187
now I have only the greatest respect for your spirit,

122
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:21,047
your valor in battle, your power.

123
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:25,156
I see it now, how incredible you are.

124
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:26,108
Dio.

125
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,545
JoJo.

126
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,996
If not for you, I would never have
obtained the power of the stone mask.

127
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:38,827
However, your damnable meddling cost me world domination.

128
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,932
If there really is a god,

129
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:43,332
one who plucks the strings of our fate,

130
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,375
I am certain that our fates
were bound together for a reason.

131
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:54,193
Our two existences were only ever intended to be but one,

132
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:59,134
and so I will take the body of
the only man on earth I respect.

133
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:01,716
Then I will live in eternal glory,

134
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:05,261
for that is the destiny which is waiting for me.

135
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:06,675
There will be no pain.

136
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:09,781
That is the final gift I bequeath to you.

137
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,293
No. No, those eyes. I can't...

138
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:17,122
Live on as my body, JoJo!

139
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,388
Jonathan! What...

140
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,533
Erina.

141
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,751
No. Jonathan.

142
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:50,587
Eri...na.

143
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,388
Oh...

144
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,525
A pity you wouldn't hear me.

145
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,513
If only you had remained still as I told you,

146
00:10:57,538 --> 00:11:00,398
your death in fact would have been quite painless.

147
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:07,232
Torn from your little fairy tale into hell,
thrust into a reality you didn't know existed,

148
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:09,377
what will you do now?

149
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:12,546
Did JoJo never tell you of me,

150
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:15,994
the evil that dwells there in the darkness?

151
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,268
I may not look like much right now,

152
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:22,406
but surely you remember me, Erina Pendleton.

153
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:23,683
Wait.

154
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:26,648
It's Erina Joestar now, isn't it?

155
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:27,950
Dio!

156
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,941
The ship's full of monsters!

157
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:35,139
Run!

158
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,740
As you ordered, lord, I drained
the life of only one passenger,

159
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:04,643
and now most of the ship has joined our little family.

160
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,028
And now we will proceed to america.

161
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:11,824
Isn't that right, lord Dio?

162
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,379
I can't speak.

163
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:16,351
I can't even take a breath.

164
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,504
I have to move.

165
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,904
Erina. Erina.

166
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,774
I have to save...

167
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,895
Can't gather hamon.

168
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,661
Well, how the mighty have fallen.

169
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:41,198
This sniveling whelp can't even draw a proper breath now.

170
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,351
He'll be causing no more mischief with his hamon.

171
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,791
This is what he gets for crossing you, lord Dio.

172
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,189
Now we are going to play.

173
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:53,308
Or maybe I'll just sit quietly and watch

174
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:56,237
while he suffocates slowly.

175
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,405
Silence, wang chen.

176
00:12:58,856 --> 00:13:01,131
There shall be no insult to JoJo.

177
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:01,898
Huh?

178
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:06,119
He is the one man capable of
bringing me to the apex of my fate.

179
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:09,274
You will show him all the respect which is due to him

180
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:11,939
by severing his head in a painless manner.

181
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,095
Of course, lord Dio.

182
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:19,515
The body of my dearest foe has become my future!

183
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:20,507
Jonathan!

184
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:26,950
He's up to something.

185
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:28,109
Be careful.

186
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,740
He might have one last trick up his muscle‐bound sleeve.

187
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:34,004
Bah, he's done for.

188
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:37,271
Lord Dio overestimates his "mighty power."

189
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,892
Well, Jonathan Joestar,

190
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:44,262
I'll scoop out what little brains
you have with my bare fingers.

191
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,033
Must...

192
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:47,486
Save Erina.

193
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:52,668
I have to use the last bit of
hamon left in me all at once.

194
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:54,700
Please work.

195
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:55,987
Careful.

196
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:57,648
Wang chen, look out.

197
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:08,971
Something broke inside my body,

198
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,496
something important.

199
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:14,252
What have you done?

200
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,604
Th‐this is the end,

201
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:25,512
the last hamon I have.

202
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:30,699
Too weak to destroy that zombie completely,

203
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:32,820
but it was enough.

204
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:42,512
What-what is he playing at?

205
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:47,667
JoJo has interfered with wang
chen's body, disrupting its functions

206
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:50,243
without bringing it to complete destruction.

207
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:54,280
He's made it seize tightly onto a piece of machinery,

208
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:58,277
and the device it clings to so immovably...

209
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:01,207
Is the paddle's screw shaft.

210
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:05,475
The strength of a zombie is
sufficient to arrest the paddle.

211
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:07,580
If the shaft is stopped,

212
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:11,610
steam pressure in the piston will build up inexorably.

213
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:14,666
Under such conditions, there is but one end.

214
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:16,914
The ship will explode!

215
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:20,180
Jonathan, what's happening?

216
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:23,604
Why is this happening to us?

217
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:26,498
Y‐you must leave, Erina.

218
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:29,964
Soon the ship will be destroyed.

219
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:39,369
I don't know how the things that
are occurring today are possible.

220
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:42,674
It's all too impossible to bear.

221
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:45,334
I don't know whether I should cry or scream.

222
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,816
Perhaps I should just faint dead away and block it out.

223
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:53,622
But there is one thing I know.

224
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,505
Erina Joestar...

225
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:00,200
Will remain with her husband.

226
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,508
In the warmth of these lips,

227
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,131
I feel the cool ebbing of his life.

228
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:13,429
Jonathan Joestar is dying,

229
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,123
but we are together.

230
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,538
I want to stay like this

231
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:24,170
until the ship explodes and everything burns to ash,

232
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:27,206
until everything is gone.

233
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:50,652
It's all right if you cry,

234
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:54,139
but you have to...

235
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:56,657
Stay alive and go on.

236
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,627
Just like in a storybook.

237
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:04,054
You want me to come to the aid of a
helpless child and escape to safety?

238
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,868
That's unfair, just sheer cruelty.

239
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:13,485
The only thing that I want is
to end my life here with you.

240
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:16,360
That woman died

241
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:20,436
trying to save her child until the last.

242
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:24,318
My own mother did the same thing for me.

243
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,188
Save yourself

244
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:28,874
take the baby. Hurry.

245
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:36,692
So your plan is to destroy this vessel, is it?

246
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:41,968
JoJo, you never give up or give
in, no matter the odds, but know this.

247
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,438
Determination is not just in you.

248
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:48,228
I will live. There is no one who can defy me!

249
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,986
I will take your body as my own!

250
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,106
Zombies, hither!

251
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:59,741
Devour wang chen's body, and
restart the piston once you have.

252
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,858
The end has begun.

253
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:19,324
Jonathan.

254
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:25,606
It's already blowing apart. But there's still a way out.

255
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:29,199
I was protecting myself from
the sun's rays well before this.

256
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:30,572
Let it explode.

257
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:33,473
I already have everything I need to survive.

258
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:40,623
Erina, take a good look.

259
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:43,723
Hah! Since JoJo can no longer use his hamon,

260
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:47,227
I'll remove his head and take his body as my own.

261
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:51,406
Then I shall walk over and lie down in my velvet boudoir.

262
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,823
That humble shelter is marvelously constructed.

263
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,380
It could withstand a ton of dynamite.

264
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:59,589
Goodbye, JoJo,

265
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,451
and welcome to you, my new eternal body!

266
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,085
Jonathan!

267
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:18,090
Dio.

268
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:20,507
As you observed,

269
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,519
it may be true that our fate is to be together.

270
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:26,434
I feel an odd warmth for you,

271
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:30,430
for now our lives are interwoven completely

272
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:33,919
and will end along with this ship.

273
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:42,061
Farewell to you, my beloved.

274
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:50,211
JoJo, let me go!

275
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:51,364
Release me.

276
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:53,247
Think of what we two can achieve.

277
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:56,015
You'd like a taste of eternity, would you not?

278
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:57,743
I can heal your wounds.

279
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,756
You and Erina can live together forever!

280
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:03,270
JoJo!

281
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:09,058
No. It's too late.

282
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,537
He's dead.

283
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:40,410
Jonathan Joestar passed away

284
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:42,922
into undeserved oblivion.

285
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:47,210
His life was an important part of history,

286
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:50,198
but invisible to ordinary people.

287
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:56,213
Most of humanity, for whom he sacrificed,

288
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:59,304
will never know of his noble accomplishments...

289
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:02,592
But his descendants will.

290
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:13,833
The life within me, newly created by Jonathan and I,

291
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,391
will certainly hear his story.

292
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,117
Erina Joestar was soon rescued
afloat near the Canary Islands,

293
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:30,844
and the book of the stone mask was closed for a time.

294
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:37,731
But that was only the beginning
of a new bizarre adventure.

295
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,745
I'll be the roundabout

296
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:15,600
the words will make you out and out

297
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:21,033
I spend the day your way

298
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:28,231
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

299
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,615
The music dance and sing

300
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:42,754
they make the children really ring

301
00:22:42,825 --> 00:22:48,187
I spend the day your way

302
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:54,506
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

303
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:57,223
in and around the lake

304
00:22:58,496 --> 00:23:02,563
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

305
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,211
one mile over, we'll be there and we'll see you.

306
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,611
10 true summers, we'll be there and laughing, too.

307
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:21,321
24 before my love you'll see

308
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:24,975
I'll be there with you

309
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:30,689
it was in the fall of 1938.

310
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:32,954
It's good to see you again, Speedwagon.

311
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:35,552
You bastard! How could you have
possibly have known where they were?

312
00:23:35,577 --> 00:23:36,496
Teach him a lesson.

313
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,722
Joseph Joestar.

314
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:39,658
My friends call me JoJo.
