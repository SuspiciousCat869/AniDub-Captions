1
00:00:01,897 --> 00:00:05,724
This gothic structure began its
life as a 14th‐century castle.

2
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:09,321
Converted into a hotel in the early 1900s,

3
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:12,410
it closed 10 years ago when the owner died.

4
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:18,283
Now Kars is using the ancient
building as a shelter from the sun.

5
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:21,185
He lurks within waiting.

6
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:25,840
Alas, JoJo and Lisa Lisa know
nothing of the hotel's layout.

7
00:01:58,227 --> 00:01:59,428
Disgusting.

8
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on. Cobwebby halls, really?

9
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:03,780
Would it kill you to sweep a bit?

10
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:08,076
Okay, I get it. Scary monsters
don't do much housecleaning,

11
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:10,520
but that does leave evidence.

12
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:11,913
See this blood trail?

13
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:15,444
It seems as though Wamuu took a good hamon thrashing.

14
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:20,609
Caesar didn't go down without
giving a good account of himself.

15
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:29,739
We mustn't let Wamuu heal any more.

16
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,684
Coach Lisa Lisa, it's time for some action.

17
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:35,554
Yuck.

18
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:37,167
What is it?

19
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:38,628
Eh, it's just,

20
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:42,535
well, when I took a hold of
this doorknob, it wasn't pleasant.

21
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:46,389
It felt like I was grabbing the
hand of something cold and dead.

22
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,251
I'm not a door.

23
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:48,989
Where's that...

24
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:51,777
Why are you looking around?

25
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:54,056
I'm not a door, but I am here.

26
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:54,645
What?

27
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:58,284
That's... it's a...

28
00:02:58,446 --> 00:02:59,847
A vampire.

29
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,781
Careful, JoJo!

30
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,704
JoJo!

31
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:11,829
If it weren't for your little yo‐yo there,

32
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:14,839
I would have peeled your face right off your head.

33
00:03:17,017 --> 00:03:20,052
Hi. I'm Wired Beck, and I'll be slaying you now.

34
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:23,930
I killed my sweetheart, but then I busted out of prison.

35
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:28,528
In no time, lord Kars took me in
and made me part of his little gang.

36
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,746
He's got my loyalty,

37
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:36,345
and I am not going to let you go in there and disturb
lord Kars when he's enjoying a well‐deserved rest.

38
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,037
So they've done it. It's begun.

39
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:43,016
They've started unleashing their
demon hounds on the weak and innocent.

40
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:46,909
Stop that noise.

41
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:50,594
You're just another vampire who's
bound for hell and leaving now.

42
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:54,639
Well, then, let me help you plan your
trip so you don't have to wait any longer.

43
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,688
Huh? Lisa Lisa?

44
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:01,144
Mmm.

45
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:03,066
You're beautiful, magnificent.

46
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:05,679
Your skin is so soft, heavenly, and clear.

47
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,612
Let me hold you, and then I'll drink
your life right through that skin.

48
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,076
You're really not impressing me.

49
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:17,175
I refuse to waste my time listening to
your weak flirtations and shallow threats,

50
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,631
but if you want to hold me, go ahead, and give it a try.

51
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:24,056
I guarantee it'll be the last thing that you do.

52
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,902
Spikes!

53
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:33,154
He's covered top to bottom.

54
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:36,142
They're popping out of him
like hundreds of pointed fingers.

55
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:39,972
They're metallic and razor
sharp like an iron‐maiden jacket.

56
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:44,151
I don't appreciate it when stuck‐up
females are insulting like that.

57
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:48,520
They need to be punished. Wouldn't you agree?

58
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:53,049
I'll give you a nice squeeze.

59
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,378
I'm going to hug you to death!

60
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:58,492
Oh, no. He's a lot faster than I thought he was.

61
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:07,157
Wait. I see. Her scarf becomes a
hamon‐filled weapon with incredibly long reach.

62
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:08,181
Huh?

63
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:10,637
Gosh, thanks for the thought.

64
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:14,012
Yah hah! You can't catch me like that.

65
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,846
Don't make me laugh. Hee hee hee!

66
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,954
See? I'm free.

67
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:23,191
Hmm? That's all? Where do you think you're going?

68
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:25,218
Come, JoJo. Let's go.

69
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:26,742
Uh, okay.

70
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:32,888
Lisa Lisa's movements, they're
effortless and flow like silk, efficient.

71
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:34,741
She doesn't waste any energy.

72
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,346
Come back! You can't just walk away.

73
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:42,525
Hey, you, wouldn't you agree that a woman
who behaves like that needs to be punished?

74
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:45,562
Oh, no. You are the one being punished.

75
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:47,866
You see, you've just run out of time.

76
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:50,236
Hamon is now running all through your body.

77
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,991
Huh?

78
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:53,605
Don't be ridiculous. I'm not...

79
00:05:57,059 --> 00:06:00,996
No!

80
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:08,794
Lisa Lisa has really got what it takes.

81
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:14,126
I thought she might be out of her depth in a fight,
but it's plainly obvious she's even better than me.

82
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,699
I am so impressed.

83
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:17,828
I'm lucky to have her training me.

84
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:20,459
By the way, JoJo,

85
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,484
have you taken it? You really shouldn't delay any longer.

86
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,432
You must use the antidote.

87
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:29,129
Huh? Oh, you mean this?

88
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:30,915
Yes, of course.

89
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,837
I'm going to drink it only after I defeat Wamuu.

90
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:34,880
Heh.

91
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:39,724
See this ring, it no longer signifies
a promise between me and Wamuu.

92
00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:43,091
It's now a promise I make to Caesar

93
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:45,766
that I will go on living and stay in the fight.

94
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:50,159
Would you please hold it for me
until I actually need it, Lisa Lisa?

95
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,122
No.

96
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:56,198
It would be better if it stayed with you.

97
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,344
Who knows what might happen to me?

98
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:00,566
Huh?

99
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,594
As they ventured further into the depths,

100
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,188
the trail of blood grew ever thinner.

101
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:13,192
Both JoJo and Lisa Lisa knew well what
meaning could be drawn from that fact.

102
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,475
Wamuu's hamon wounds were healing.

103
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,499
So you're here.

104
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,343
I've been waiting.

105
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:39,146
I see your powers have grown greatly.

106
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,521
Bastard! You're the one who killed Caesar. Now I...

107
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:45,627
Cool your head, JoJo.

108
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,091
Now look at the floor.

109
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,188
I'm very calm.

110
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:51,452
Don't worry. I'm in control here.

111
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:53,509
You mean the footprints, right?

112
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:54,844
I noticed it, too.

113
00:07:55,097 --> 00:07:56,544
There are two sets.

114
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:58,965
That means Kars is here!

115
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,912
Tell me where I can find him!

116
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,748
Show your cowardly self now!

117
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:08,121
Indeed. There are two sets of footprints.

118
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:12,273
He's here, but I feel dozens of
lungs moving the air around as well.

119
00:08:12,298 --> 00:08:12,782
Eh?

120
00:08:13,806 --> 00:08:14,982
So it's you.

121
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:20,653
Fascinating. You are extremely composed
and perceptive though you are a woman.

122
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:25,604
I can see how JoJo and Caesar were
able to learn so much so quickly.

123
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:29,721
And you can feel even the lightest respiration.

124
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,944
You rank among the finest hamon warriors.

125
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,715
Damn. Look at that.

126
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,670
There's so many. I'd guess
you're all vampires. Is that right?

127
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,706
No response? That's creepy, too.

128
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,317
Kars!

129
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:06,536
Lord Kars saw fit to give us, his chosen
ones, the gift of eternal life. We number 100.

130
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:12,203
On our master's order, we'll tear you
both to shreds, 100 against two, JoJo!

131
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:14,753
You fiends.

132
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,061
This really is not good.

133
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:29,753
It's 100 of them against the two of us. We can't win.

134
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,414
Lord Kars, a moment.

135
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,399
Back in Rome, JoJo and I
promised to fight one another again.

136
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:40,060
I want revenge for Esidisi.

137
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,619
Please allow me the chance to fight him.

138
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:43,741
No.

139
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:48,466
Remember that my goal is only
to obtain the Red Stone of Aja.

140
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,731
Don't forget that, Wamuu.

141
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:52,503
Yes, lord.

142
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:55,024
Oh, darn, no fight.

143
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:57,205
Well, I'm not in the mood anyway.

144
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:59,986
Of course we both know I would beat you.

145
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:02,741
But to what end? All these vampires are here.

146
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:05,673
What sort of motivation is that, I ask you?

147
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:09,344
Win or lose, I would still come out of it dead, right?

148
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:12,980
With odds like that, giving
up is the only rational choice,

149
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:15,107
so I'm throwing in the towel.

150
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,265
Damn. Had to try.

151
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,077
I thought it was worth a shot, even
if you were watching all the time.

152
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,070
A hamon net was a good idea.

153
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:27,267
Kill them without any further delay.

154
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:30,920
Your choice, but if you kill
us, you'll never get the stone.

155
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,198
Hmm? Hold it.

156
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,184
What are you saying now, woman?

157
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:36,701
You don't think I'd have the stone here with me?

158
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:38,965
That wouldn't be wise, now, would it?

159
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:40,982
We're headed to our destination.

160
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:47,163
If we're not there in time to set the device, the
red stone will be destroyed, and you will have nothing.

161
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:48,083
Huh?

162
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,564
Look, woman, don't try to fool me.

163
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:59,055
Are you confident that you and your
minions will be able to find it in time?

164
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,404
The bomb I set is a very small one,

165
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:04,653
but enough to damage the stone and prevent its use.

166
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,665
Could this really be true?

167
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,389
She never said anything.

168
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,876
Whatever. I'll follow her lead.

169
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:15,291
Were you fellows listening?

170
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:18,200
If we don't stop it, the bomb will go boom.

171
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:21,679
Even if true, we cannot let you leave here alive.

172
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,374
Therefore, I have a suggestion.

173
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:28,615
JoJo and Wamuu can have their fight one‐on‐one,

174
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:32,476
and, Kars, you and I will also fight one‐on‐one,

175
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,973
and those who are left standing will possess the stone!

176
00:11:37,336 --> 00:11:37,878
What?!

177
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:42,993
The winners of this fight will have
the red stone and all of its power.

178
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,757
It'll be made very clear.

179
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,984
Which one of us will prove strong
enough to wield the stone's power?

180
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,842
Who is fit to survive?

181
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:53,331
The pillar men or humankind?

182
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:55,132
How dare you say?

183
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:56,826
Wamuu.

184
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:00,069
Lord Kars, this is most absurd.

185
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:01,982
She is good.

186
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:06,820
She's just proven herself to be a better
gambler than I could ever dream of being.

187
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:10,483
No doubt, you do have pluck.

188
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:13,907
Very well. Then we will battle for the stone.

189
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,703
But don't get cocky.

190
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:18,238
You have no tomorrow.

191
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:24,521
Using only words, she just turned a dire
situation into more‐or‐less even odds.

192
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,725
Then so be it. Let's do this.

193
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:45,505
And so now we need to arrange
a time and place for our battle.

194
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:48,457
Wamuu, what are your thoughts?

195
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,819
We fight tonight under the gaze of the full moon,

196
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:59,294
the arena at the base of piz
bernina, 15 kilometers to the southeast.

197
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,742
We will meet at the skeleton's heel stone circle there.

198
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:09,281
Many warriors have found death, glory, or
both throughout the history of that place.

199
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:11,482
In a stone circle?

200
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:16,216
Hey, you can't just choose a
place because it happens to suit you.

201
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:20,085
Yes, Wamuu, I believe that to be a fine choice.

202
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:22,334
Now let's speak of the red stone.

203
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:28,889
JoJo, you will bring the Red Stone of Aja
to the skeleton's heel at midnight tonight.

204
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,527
And don't forget to remove the bomb.

205
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:36,334
The woman will remain here with us as insurance.

206
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:52,682
Well, Lisa Lisa?

207
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,563
They want to make sure that we
don't run away from the fight.

208
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:57,437
It is a reasonable request.

209
00:13:57,613 --> 00:14:00,058
JoJo, go and fetch us the red stone.

210
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:02,004
You mustn't worry about me.

211
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:03,292
Would I?

212
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:05,333
I'll see you back at the arena.

213
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,828
Trust me, all right?

214
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,725
I assure you I do.

215
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,295
Caesar.

216
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,417
Until yesterday,

217
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:30,910
I lived my life thinking only about myself,

218
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:35,476
but now there's a new intense
feeling burning up inside of me.

219
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,320
Is this compassion?

220
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:40,793
I swear...

221
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:44,199
I just want to destroy those bastards and all their line.

222
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:47,654
I have to do it for Caesar and for Meshina, too,

223
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,458
Lisa Lisa, and for everyone else I know.

224
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:53,295
I'll fight for you all.

225
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:06,921
Obviously there's no bomb here
or anywhere else for that matter.

226
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:11,168
Lisa Lisa, even when you're under
pressure you are one deceptive young woman.

227
00:15:11,673 --> 00:15:12,366
Hmm.

228
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,743
Well, now, maybe I should bring you a
change of panties in case you get scared.

229
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,603
Wait a minute what are these photos?

230
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,219
What? It's granny Erina.

231
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:28,005
What would Lisa Lisa be doing with this?

232
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:28,919
Huh?

233
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,245
Who are these people?

234
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:34,803
"May 22, 1889"?

235
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,347
50 years ago.

236
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,761
Then that young guy there is...

237
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,229
Speedwagon!

238
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:43,128
And granny Erina!

239
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:46,917
And that's Straizo holding a baby.

240
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:54,337
Lisa Lisa, I don't know anything about your
past or the life you have led or who you've known.

241
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:57,428
What could you possibly be doing with these photos?

242
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:42,915
It's genuine.

243
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:45,042
We accept your proposal.

244
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:48,815
We honor you by fighting one‐on‐one.

245
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:08,722
I suppose this means you saw the photos,

246
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,936
and you'd like to talk about it, right?

247
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:14,642
Actually I had intended to discuss this with you anyway.

248
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,569
Start with who you are.

249
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:19,900
50 years ago now,

250
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:23,990
Erina lost her husband on a ship sailing the Atlantic.

251
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:26,398
He was Jonathan Joestar,

252
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:27,980
your grandfather.

253
00:17:29,162 --> 00:17:30,593
That horrible day,

254
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:33,787
your grandmother saved the life of a baby girl.

255
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:35,146
That was me.

256
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:37,973
I am the baby in that photograph.

257
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:42,318
W... wait a moment here. That was 50 years ago.

258
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:45,456
So if you were a baby 50 years ago...

259
00:17:45,574 --> 00:17:49,005
Ho... hold on now. Just how old are you, anyway?

260
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:52,070
Y... you're 50?!

261
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:55,387
Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh, man.

262
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,846
If you're 50,

263
00:17:56,953 --> 00:18:00,451
that means then... you're really old!

264
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:05,219
Is that right? Normally...

265
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:08,920
Y... you look like you're in your late 20s. Hmm.

266
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:13,337
They say that hamon energy is
life energy and keeps you young.

267
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:18,575
I guess that explains why you really don't
act like a young woman would behave at all.

268
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:23,437
Ah. I think I see a little wrinkle back there. Yup.

269
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:25,995
Hey, I'm just kidding, all right?

270
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,212
Vampires, prepare the arena.

271
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:32,031
Light the fires!

272
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:43,096
There is not enough time for us to talk now,

273
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:46,195
but we really do need to find the time,

274
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:49,665
because our roots are deeply connected.

275
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:50,990
Our roots?

276
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:54,071
The stone mask killed my parents.

277
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:58,258
Erina was pregnant when she
rescued the little girl on the ship.

278
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,961
She couldn't raise two children,
so Straizo became a father to me.

279
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:05,425
Straizo as a father?

280
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,696
Are you serious?

281
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:10,443
Everything I know about hamon, Straizo taught me.

282
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:14,322
He even gave me the Red Stone of Aja.

283
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:16,007
He did that? Wow.

284
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:18,897
This is all just so unbelievable and hard to accept.

285
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:25,398
It's tragic beyond words that the fear of
growing old drove him to commit such acts of madness.

286
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:31,023
JoJo, my feelings about you
defeating him are extremely complicated,

287
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:34,106
but I believe that it was destiny.

288
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,514
What is there to say?

289
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:42,473
Everything, all of it, is so complicated.

290
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,071
What a bizarre relationship.

291
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:50,655
Lisa Lisa, she carries with her a past painted by sadness.

292
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:52,517
It's time.

293
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:54,756
The rest of it will have to wait.

294
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:56,463
W... what's that rumbling noise?

295
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:10,270
They have come. It was worth
the wait. The battle can begin now.

296
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:15,416
Huh? What's that?

297
00:20:21,823 --> 00:20:23,015
Out of the way!

298
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:25,501
I don't care how many of you get crushed!

299
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:28,740
What... what is that thing, a dinosaur?

300
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:31,234
No, I think a horse. That's a horse.

301
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,640
Lord Kars, lord Wamuu, please move!

302
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:38,190
They've gone berserk! I can't control them!

303
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,359
Lord Wamuu, please!

304
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:52,138
Ah, these are fine steeds.

305
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,730
The stone masks worked extremely well.

306
00:20:57,755 --> 00:20:59,603
They're now strong vampires.

307
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:01,781
Wha... vampire horses?

308
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:10,057
On that track, JoJo and Wamuu will face each other
one‐on‐one in a fierce ancient‐style chariot duel.

309
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:14,149
What do you mean?

310
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,353
An ancient roman‐style death match.

311
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:21,330
You will battle, racing around
the arena, trying to kill each other.

312
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:23,279
Lord Wamuu or JoJo,

313
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:28,386
who will be the first one to fall under
the wheels or get beaten down by his opponent?

314
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:30,304
The loser dies!

315
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,129
Those are the rules, JoJo.

316
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,767
The beasts have a hundred times normal strength.

317
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:37,429
Even lord Wamuu can barely control them.

318
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:39,257
Hold it just a minute.

319
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:42,171
I will fight you on any field or in any cage,

320
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:46,153
but vampires are your minions,
even horses, so how is that fair?

321
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:47,607
Don't fret, human.

322
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:50,388
The reins you use will conduct hamon.

323
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:53,385
Wamuu will use his superior strength,

324
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:56,253
and you can use your hamon to control them.

325
00:21:57,144 --> 00:22:00,103
Are you sure about that? They look pretty vicious.

326
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,075
Be careful. They're mean.

327
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:10,519
That's true, but a little hamon does help.

328
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:11,051
Ah.

329
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:14,300
Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu!

330
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:17,244
Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu!

331
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,054
Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu!

332
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:24,359
Raah!

333
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,441
See Wamuu?

334
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:29,221
He has chosen an ancient form for this battle.

335
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:31,345
That's a sign he means to win.

336
00:22:31,444 --> 00:22:32,599
It's not for fun.

337
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:35,237
He's not going into this for the sport of it.

338
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:37,127
He wants to take your life.

339
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:39,074
Just beat him, JoJo.

340
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:41,433
We have no choice but to win this.

341
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:43,101
There are no draws.

342
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:47,056
Wamuu, hey!

343
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:53,185
Did you notice that I haven't taken this antidote yet?

344
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,776
I made a promise to Caesar
that I wouldn't drink this until after I took you down.

345
00:22:57,951 --> 00:23:02,331
That promise is going to provide me
with a power I've never experienced before.

346
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:11,845
We'll face this fight together, Caesar.

347
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:21,494
Let's ride into battle!

348
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:50,678
Along the drifting cloud the
eagle searching down on the land

349
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:57,552
catching the swirling wind the
sailor sees the rim of the land

350
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:04,558
the eagle's dancing wings create
as weather spins out of hand

351
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:26,247
Go closer hold the land feel
partly no more than grains of sand

352
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:33,381
we stand to lose all time a
thousand answers by in our hand

353
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:40,461
next to your deeper fears we
stand surrounded by a million years

354
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:48,491
I'll be the roundabout the
words will make you out and out

355
00:24:48,516 --> 00:24:55,547
I'll be the roundabout the
words will make you out and out

356
00:24:59,176 --> 00:25:02,913
Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu!

357
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:06,880
Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu!

358
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,363
Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu!

359
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,119
Begin now!
