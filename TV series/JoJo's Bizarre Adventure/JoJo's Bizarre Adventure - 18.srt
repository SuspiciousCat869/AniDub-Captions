1
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:07,853
Phew, I think I used my head a
little bit too much last time.

2
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:10,459
My shoulders are real sore.

3
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,572
They feel so heavy.

4
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:49,396
The sun is up.

5
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,671
The tests are ending, and soon the two students,
Caesar and JoJo, will be making their way back here.

6
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,661
Signora Lisa Lisa.

7
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,484
Which blouse do you like today?

8
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:03,090
Oh, I don't know. What do you think?

9
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:08,119
Well, white is always nice, but I think
something colorful can be kind of fun, too.

10
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:10,454
I'll let you decide.

11
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:12,930
Okay, let's see.

12
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:15,205
I think the white one is pretty,

13
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:18,288
but I really like the lovely design on this one.

14
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:23,024
I wonder if JoJo and Caesar have passed their final exams.

15
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:25,185
I have a bad feeling.

16
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm beginning to worry.

17
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:31,121
So today we're going to go with the pretty white.

18
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:32,484
Suzie Q...

19
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:33,551
Yes?

20
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:37,175
Please send Caesar and JoJo to
my room as soon as they arrive.

21
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:38,957
Yes, of course, signora.

22
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:42,245
Hmm. I know I said I like the white blouse,

23
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:44,041
but the other one is nice, too.

24
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:45,875
So which is better?

25
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:48,321
Oh, which do I choose?

26
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,538
White. But then again,

27
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,730
this is really nice, too.

28
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,263
Ai! What do I do?

29
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:58,584
The colorful one will do nicely. Thank you.

30
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:00,754
Excellent choice.

31
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:15,611
I'll just leave these here for you, all right?

32
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:19,774
I'll come back later and clean up
the broken glass. Be careful, okay?

33
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,657
I will. Thank you.

34
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:43,856
Hey.

35
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:45,372
Suzie Q.

36
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:50,561
Eh, what are you screaming for?

37
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:52,960
Be quiet, you stupid idiot.

38
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:55,329
W‐who-who are you?

39
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,378
Th‐there's a stranger on the island!

40
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,738
Hey, wait. You think I'm a stranger?

41
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:01,025
Huh?

42
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,200
It's me, you dummy,

43
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:03,977
Joseph Joestar.

44
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:04,671
Huh?

45
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:05,567
Hmm.

46
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:08,939
JoJo? No way.

47
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,180
When I saw you before, you were always wearing a mask.

48
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:13,848
Wow, what a surprise.

49
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:17,916
What? Are you telling me you've
never seen my face in all this time?

50
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:21,331
So? What do you think? Am I handsome?

51
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,095
Hmm.

52
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,049
Weird lips.

53
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:28,800
Guh! Well, they may be weird,

54
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:31,827
but if we were ever to fall madly in love with each other,

55
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:36,141
you'd be welcome to kiss them all you'd like.

56
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:38,945
Yeah, in your dreams.

57
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:40,670
Ahh!

58
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:43,547
Hmm?

59
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,150
What's the matter?

60
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:48,551
Uh, nothing at all, really.

61
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:53,318
Oh! Yeah, signora Lisa Lisa wants
you to go up to her room right away.

62
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,257
But she is taking a bath,

63
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:57,257
so you should probably wait half an hour.

64
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,390
Got it. I was planning to go anyway.

65
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,940
I've gotta tell her that they know all about the stone.

66
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:03,464
Huh?

67
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:06,779
Oh, no, you're not talking about her stone, are you?

68
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:11,347
Uh, don't worry about it. You really
don't want to get involved in all this stuff.

69
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:12,132
Believe me.

70
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:13,021
Uh, okay.

71
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,439
JoJo, wait a minute.

72
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:17,517
Huh? What's up?

73
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:22,634
You're actually pretty hot, you know?

74
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:25,417
Hmm?

75
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:27,371
Hmm.

76
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,367
Hmm. That's odd.

77
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:34,489
My shoulders feel like they've
suddenly started to loosen up.

78
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,678
The news I have to report is really
important, but Lisa Lisa is taking a bath,

79
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:52,436
so I'm gonna have to wait for
half an hour until she's done.

80
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:07,031
If I was told to wait, then waiting is what I'll do.

81
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:09,007
Now where to spend half an hour?

82
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:13,298
I think the best place is here by Lisa Lisa's door.

83
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:19,447
Would it really be all that wrong if I took a
peek through the keyhole to check things out?

84
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,272
Nice.

85
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,046
Uh, eh?

86
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:32,029
Suzie Q?

87
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,359
Wait a minute. What's she doing in there?

88
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,354
I didn't even see her go into the room.

89
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:38,817
That was really fast.

90
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:41,224
I thought she was still out on the docks.

91
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:44,148
Huh?

92
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:45,371
What the hell?

93
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:48,653
The doorknob is completely covered in some kind of goo.

94
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:58,140
Suzie Q, tell me, have JoJo and Caesar made it back yet?

95
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:03,068
Uh, Suzie Q?

96
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:18,505
Are you all right, Suzie Q?

97
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,530
What's going on? What did you do with the red stone?

98
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,425
Who are you?!

99
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,591
Tell me what you did with the red stone!

100
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:36,164
No. This is bad.

101
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:40,758
It seems something has taken over Suzie Q's body.

102
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:49,584
You, you have reduced me to nothing
but a brain with no body of my own!

103
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:53,813
But nevertheless I challenge you to one last fight!

104
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:58,265
I put the stone on the boat that just left the dock.

105
00:07:58,403 --> 00:08:01,852
I am here to stop you from chasing it and getting it back.

106
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,703
I will not allow you to follow that postal boat,

107
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:06,023
no matter what!

108
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:09,963
The woman I am inside of is still mostly alive, you see.

109
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:13,570
There is only one way for you to destroy me completely,

110
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:15,801
and that is to take her life as well.

111
00:08:16,318 --> 00:08:19,750
Can you do that? Are you capable of that?!

112
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:22,889
Esidisi!

113
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:23,953
JoJo.

114
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:26,208
You won't stop coming at us, will you?

115
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:27,510
You don't give up.

116
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:28,652
JoJo.

117
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:29,418
Eh?

118
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,587
Oh, Caesar.

119
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:33,489
Well, it's about damn time.

120
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:36,492
You, uh‐‐

121
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,665
so you managed to survive your bout with Esidisi?

122
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:45,067
You're a lucky one, that's for‐‐

123
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:48,103
JoJo. What the hell

124
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:50,105
were you doing in here with our coach?

125
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:51,774
Hey, cool it, you meathead.

126
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:54,784
It's not like that, okay? Just take a look at Suzie Q.

127
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:55,785
All right then.

128
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,772
What's going on?

129
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,407
It's Esidisi.

130
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:07,126
Damn him. He somehow figured out a way to make his brain
and blood vessels invade her body and take control of her.

131
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:08,840
Save me, Caesar!

132
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,336
Oh, please help me.

133
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,902
Everyone picks on me all the time.

134
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,630
But you'll never pick on me, Caesar, will you?

135
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:22,276
Don't fall for a word of it.
Suzie Q's not doing the talking.

136
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:24,596
Esidisi is manipulating her.

137
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:29,195
That's right. She managed to take
the stone and put it on a postal boat.

138
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:33,749
Leave this thing to JoJo and me,
and find that boat. Get the stone back.

139
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:37,719
If the red stone reaches venice
and is transferred onto a train,

140
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:41,900
we'll lose track of it and have
no way to know where it will end up.

141
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,740
You're not going anywhere, dickheads!

142
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,826
If you want to stop that boat or leave at all,

143
00:09:53,898 --> 00:09:55,700
you'll have to kill me first!

144
00:09:56,852 --> 00:09:58,195
A male voice.

145
00:09:58,367 --> 00:09:59,776
I see what's going on.

146
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:02,916
His blood vessels must be controlling her from the inside.

147
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:07,921
Yeah, come on! Bring it!

148
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:10,216
Use your hamon, and kill me!

149
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:14,833
It should be a relatively easy task
for you to destroy me in my current state.

150
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:18,668
But then again, you must know that
this girl's heart isn't nearly strong

151
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,602
enough to endure a hamon shock and survive it.

152
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:25,622
Are you willing to snuff out this
girl's life in order to defeat me?

153
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:28,274
If you are, then hurry up, and do it!

154
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:31,834
Quit standing there and wasting
time, you stupid dickheads!

155
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:34,241
Hey.

156
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:37,324
I'm not softhearted, Esidisi.

157
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:40,630
All I have to do is end the life of one young girl,

158
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:44,038
and I'll be able to save the entire world from you.

159
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:47,971
I would consider it a small, but necessary sacrifice.

160
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,332
Wait a minute! Are you serious, JoJo?

161
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:58,269
Time to tear you into little, tiny pieces, Esidisi!

162
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,455
No, you can't!

163
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,273
JoJo!

164
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:05,394
I'm not kidding here! I'm really gonna do it!

165
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:07,419
Damn it all.

166
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:08,989
I just can't hit her.

167
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:10,672
The bastard.

168
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:14,762
I thought he'd pop out of her when I started
to make my move, but it didn't even faze him.

169
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,544
Enough of your bluffing.

170
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:23,327
You could never kill this girl,
no matter how hard you tried.

171
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:38,312
By now, I'm sure the stone has
already arrived on the main island.

172
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:40,249
You're too late.

173
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:43,260
Heh. And now...

174
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:47,670
The bastard. What is he doing to Suzie Q now?

175
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:49,757
Stop! Don't do this, Esidisi!

176
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:52,142
And now, just to make things interesting,

177
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:58,950
I will make this girl's body explode and cover
you all in blood that burns as hot as flowing lava!

178
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:02,319
Look out! His blood is boiling hot.

179
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:06,530
Suzie Q's body, it's beginning to fall apart!

180
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:08,968
If this keeps up, it won't be just Suzie Q

181
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,750
who'll be in trouble. It'll be all of us as well.

182
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:13,727
So we have no choice.

183
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:17,374
JoJo, you need to use your hamon on her right now.

184
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:19,439
Come on. No.

185
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:22,195
I don't wanna do this. Please don't make me.

186
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:27,639
I'm still having to deal with all the horrible nightmares
I get about the time I chopped Von Stroheim's leg off.

187
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:29,084
A different plan.

188
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:31,062
We need a different plan right now.

189
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:35,663
All right. I'll do it, then.

190
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:39,016
No, hold on a minute. Coach, let me do it.

191
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:42,258
Wait. Don't do anything. I thought of something.

192
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:44,887
Caesar, do you remember hell climb pillar?

193
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,772
We can give that a shot. It's
do or die, so let's go for it.

194
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:49,601
Eh?

195
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:50,593
You and me,

196
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,368
two types of hamon at the same time.

197
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,518
Two types?

198
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,035
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

199
00:12:57,138 --> 00:12:59,538
You're right. Something like that might just work.

200
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:01,072
You know what to do then.

201
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:06,481
JoJo! Caesar!

202
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,183
Right, I understand.

203
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,146
JoJo, I want you to follow my breathing.

204
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,475
Let's go!

205
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:27,194
JoJo creates a burst of positive
hamon and surrounds Suzie Q with it.

206
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:30,944
Caesar creates a burst of
negative hamon focused on her heart.

207
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,751
At that point, the hamon is
both negative and positive zero.

208
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:48,437
It worked. You forced Esidisi out.

209
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:51,894
JoJo!

210
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:55,071
Don't worry. It's all right.

211
00:13:56,678 --> 00:13:59,100
We'll just let the sun take care of the rest.

212
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:03,477
That lowdown, dirty scum,

213
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:05,607
hiding in a girl's body like that.

214
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:07,242
He's nothing but a coward.

215
00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:09,513
No, Caesar. You don't get it.

216
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,490
I fought against him, so I understand.

217
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:22,419
You see, he gave all he had and even threw away his pride,
because he felt a duty to get the stone for his allies.

218
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:25,606
For thousands of years, he did as he pleased,

219
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,656
and he lived his life to its fullest.

220
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:30,338
Whether it was good or evil,

221
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,574
I respect his life and how he chose to live it.

222
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,055
JoJo.

223
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:49,754
Suzie Q...

224
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:52,600
While Esidisi controlled you,

225
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:55,914
you must have been at least
semiconscious most of the time.

226
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:57,442
Now tell me,

227
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:00,109
where is the stone headed?

228
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:03,914
Switzerland...

229
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,973
St. Moritz.

230
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,013
A package...

231
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:13,743
An envelope with signora Lisa Lisa's crest.

232
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,552
The address is...

233
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,071
Switzerland?

234
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:21,038
What about Kars and Wamuu? Are they there?

235
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:24,327
Mm. I just checked with my contact at the station.

236
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:27,584
A cargo train for Switzerland left not 10 minutes ago.

237
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:30,848
That's it. The stone has to be somewhere on that train.

238
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,089
They've got a big head start,

239
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:37,585
but we've got to somehow figure out a way to get
ourselves to St. Moritz before that train arrives.

240
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,448
We have to do everything we can to keep
the stone from falling into the wrong hands.

241
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:45,515
We might even have to do a little bit of dirty work.

242
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:50,321
A few laws might be broken as well.

243
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:53,698
Some of us may even end up in body bags.

244
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:55,335
Don't worry. I won't.

245
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,963
I wasn't ready before,

246
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:59,427
but now there's no way I'm gonna lose.

247
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,485
I'll eradicate every one of them.

248
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:04,583
Let's go!

249
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:06,601
Right. We're out of here.

250
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:27,295
Hey, Suzie Q, look over here!

251
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:30,985
It's goodbye for now, Suzie Q.

252
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:35,632
I don't know when or how, but I'll
be back in venice one day, I promise.

253
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,410
Really?

254
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:38,410
Yeah.

255
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:42,297
Heal those ugly wounds on your
face before I get back, will you?

256
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,121
Later!

257
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,359
JoJo, be careful!

258
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:54,444
Make sure you come back in one piece, okay?!

259
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,643
Don't get pushy.

260
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:59,593
You may be an old lady before
I get back, but I will return.

261
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:02,636
Oh, yeah?

262
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:05,264
You stupid jerk!

263
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:17,230
I'll be back a lot sooner than you think.

264
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:08,491
Hey, drive the damned car, will you?

265
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:10,630
Huh? What happened to your arms, man?

266
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:12,368
Huh? Aah!

267
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,792
Something's wrong with the
wheel, man! I can't get it to move!

268
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,878
Hmm.

269
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:23,396
Esidisi hasn't reported back.

270
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:27,408
He last said that he had learned
the stone was somewhere in venice.

271
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:30,348
I wonder if something has happened to him.

272
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:34,033
Hey, JoJo.

273
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,065
JoJo.

274
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:38,578
JoJo, wake up.

275
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,572
Huh? Wha...

276
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:42,949
JoJo, we've caught up with the train.

277
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:46,038
They're going through their customs check at the moment.

278
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:47,603
That works in our favor.

279
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,877
We're less than an hour from St. Moritz,

280
00:18:49,902 --> 00:18:52,061
which leaves us enough time to get ready.

281
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:53,855
It's good we caught up.

282
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:56,119
Come on, JoJo. Look sharp.

283
00:18:57,143 --> 00:19:02,310
Listen, I'm just saving up my strength for
the big battle, that's all. Get off my case.

284
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:05,972
Let's hurry up and get there
so we can retrieve that stone.

285
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,277
Then we're gonna need some sort
of plan for the fight with Wamuu.

286
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:11,724
We'll wait for that until we cross.

287
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:16,205
What the hell?

288
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,326
Knock it off!

289
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:21,275
If you want to go on, just quit honking, and pass us.

290
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:23,735
German soldiers.

291
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:28,266
What the hell are they doing in a
car on the swiss‐italian border?

292
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:33,414
Well, well, you're looking rather spry.

293
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:36,569
My, you have grown so much, Joestar.

294
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:39,324
Huh? W‐what did you say, mister?

295
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,900
What was that about?

296
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:44,829
G‐get back here!

297
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:49,646
Who the hell are you?! What's going
on? I don't know any German soldiers.

298
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:51,322
Hey, look at the train.

299
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:53,451
So many soldiers.

300
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:56,122
Hey, major, we found the package!

301
00:19:56,678 --> 00:19:59,444
The crest. Look. They've got the package.

302
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,635
Yeah, and we all know what's inside.

303
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:09,428
The Red Stone of Aja!

304
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:12,562
I don't understand. Why do the Germans want it?

305
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:17,953
We have decided to take the stone as a
specimen for our scientific research program.

306
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:19,907
For the past three weeks,

307
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:24,207
we have been watching your every
move while you were operating in venice.

308
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:28,250
We began the surveillance when we lost our team in Rome.

309
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:31,483
We saw your training, we saw Esidisi,

310
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:33,906
and we knew you were chasing the stone.

311
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:38,809
Now, our base is set up at a lodge up ahead.

312
00:20:38,974 --> 00:20:40,015
Follow us.

313
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:44,767
We want to ask a few questions
about the stone und about Kars.

314
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:47,143
Why not work together, eh?

315
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,845
After all, we are not complete strangers, JoJo.

316
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:53,540
Hey! What are you blabbering about?

317
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:56,471
Don't think you know anything about me, you bastard!

318
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,219
If the Germans are here, that means...

319
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:00,687
What do we do, coach?

320
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:02,818
We have to follow them.

321
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:06,401
At least we know Kars doesn't have the red stone either.

322
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,987
At that time, the German army was marching
across Europe, taking country after country.

323
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:16,373
They wanted to ensure their rule across
the continent would last indefinitely.

324
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:20,932
The power of the mask and red stone
would solve their problem perfectly

325
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:23,841
by giving them everything they would need to prevail.

326
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,741
The Germans were planning to use
the ultimate power of immortality

327
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,741
to conquer the world.

328
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:46,887
I'll read the heat inside.

329
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:48,754
The fireplace is lit.

330
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:51,552
Four lights on the wall, two on the ceiling,

331
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:54,458
two on the desk. No, three.

332
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,738
Four humans standing by the wall.

333
00:21:56,893 --> 00:22:04,938
Their heights are 178, 174, 181, and 178 centimeters.

334
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:09,482
One human is by the fireplace, 183 centimeters tall.

335
00:22:10,775 --> 00:22:13,287
There are five humans, all male.

336
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:27,449
One, two...

337
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:28,616
That's four

338
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:29,973
and five.

339
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,691
So you must be Kars. You're fast.

340
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:43,743
In just a few hours, you heard about your friend's defeat,

341
00:22:43,782 --> 00:22:45,912
learned that we had obtained the stone,

342
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:48,740
found our location, and have come for it.

343
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,478
Very impressive.

344
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:54,181
And then this brutal, perfectly calculated assault.

345
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:58,225
Not one of my men made even the
slightest sound before they died.

346
00:22:58,735 --> 00:23:01,856
I was sure there were only five men in this room.

347
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:06,712
Now tell me, why can't I sense your body heat?

348
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,585
Hey, rifle heads,

349
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:11,972
what's a guy gotta do to get a little food in here?

350
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,678
Kars!

351
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,244
Huh?

352
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:18,293
This man's mechanical.

353
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:19,803
Wait a minute.

354
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:23,699
You're Von Stroheim!

355
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:36,436
I'll be the roundabout

356
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:40,471
the words will make you out and out

357
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:45,850
I spend the day your way

358
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:53,301
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

359
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:03,472
The music dance and sing

360
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:07,531
they make the children really ring

361
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:12,655
I spend the day your way

362
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:19,300
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

363
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:22,236
in and around the lake

364
00:24:23,246 --> 00:24:27,417
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

365
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,137
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

366
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:40,620
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

367
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:46,027
24 before my love you'll see

368
00:24:46,157 --> 00:24:50,169
I'll be there with you

369
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:00,751
We should attack now.

370
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,953
The building on top of that hill is the address.

371
00:25:02,984 --> 00:25:04,230
That was pretty mean.

372
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:07,021
German science is the finest in the world!

373
00:25:07,054 --> 00:25:09,000
No machine can stop me.
