1
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:37,857
All the air, it seems to be flowing over to Wamuu.

2
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:44,276
My ultimate mastery, atmospheric rift!

3
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:52,895
That's only wind?

4
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:55,046
I know you're near the flame.

5
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:58,866
I sense it, though I can't see exactly where that is,

6
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:01,804
but I am going to find you eventually.

7
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:05,493
Now that I've prevented you
from gathering your hamon energy,

8
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:07,264
I'm going to cut you in half.

9
00:02:08,552 --> 00:02:12,198
Atmospheric rift is Wamuu's supreme final weapon.

10
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:17,012
The pipes he uses to cloak
himself take in huge amounts of air

11
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:19,777
and then unbelievably compress it.

12
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,376
The air is then blasted from
an orifice thinner than paper.

13
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:26,005
It is a razor made of wind.

14
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,076
But it creates heat and friction
at levels terrible even for Wamuu.

15
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:34,555
His body cannot handle it.

16
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:36,427
He is falling apart.

17
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:40,999
But he is certainly a breathtaking
figure, tragic and heroic.

18
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:43,302
Victory is yours, Wamuu!

19
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:46,353
Take his life as a balm for your wounds.

20
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:47,300
JoJo!

21
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:49,738
It's getting close.

22
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:52,590
Time to pull off one of my famous tricks now.

23
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:55,784
This one's called the hamon oil trick.

24
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:59,676
His lungs are literally high‐pressure oxygen tanks.

25
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:03,409
Those pipes, if I can only hit them,

26
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:08,118
he'd inhale the flaming oil, which in
turn would create an internal explosion.

27
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:11,512
But this is the very last ace up my sleeve.

28
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:12,893
If I mess it up...

29
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:15,890
Got you now.

30
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,509
Your life is mine.

31
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:18,607
Damn it!

32
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,712
Take this, Wamuu!

33
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:22,220
Hmm?

34
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,477
That's your choice?

35
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:29,658
Fool.

36
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:33,574
I can sense anything that is
far enough away from the fire.

37
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:35,869
You're out of tricks,

38
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:39,408
and that cry of yours gave away your position.

39
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:41,933
And now...

40
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:44,237
Atmospheric rift!

41
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,381
Caesar!

42
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,710
Lend me your strength!

43
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:52,695
Another fire attack?

44
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:55,488
I told you I can sense these things.

45
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:02,710
And now I will cut you in half to claim my victory.

46
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:04,228
JoJo, no!

47
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:06,174
Now he has finally won.

48
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:08,468
Wamuu...

49
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:12,381
Let me tell you exactly when you lost.

50
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:14,748
It was when I threw Caesar's scarf.

51
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:15,288
Eh?

52
00:04:15,814 --> 00:04:19,959
Don't you get it? I meant for you to
cut the bottle in half the entire time.

53
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:25,014
Your ability to do it so quickly and
easily is what led to your downfall.

54
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:29,247
The oil inside of it is now vaporizing.

55
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,721
And look. You see the bandana,
all the pieces flying around?

56
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:36,468
Every little fragment is still on fire,

57
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,747
and they're entering my body.

58
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:43,849
Wamuu, you have been a worthy and admirable fighter,

59
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:47,311
but a powerful ally named Caesar

60
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,936
was with me throughout this contest.

61
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:00,796
He was defeated.

62
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:03,542
Lord Wamuu. How could he have lost?

63
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,780
JoJo, be careful. He can regenerate,

64
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:20,306
even like that, after being blown to bits.

65
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:24,482
You have to use your strongest
hamon to destroy him completely.

66
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:33,354
So it is finally over now, JoJo.

67
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:37,227
It is.

68
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:40,292
You took revenge for Caesar.

69
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:42,062
Yes, I did.

70
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:44,024
Then go ahead.

71
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,596
Finish it.

72
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,492
I will!

73
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,015
What is going on?

74
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:07,257
That smoke isn't from the flaming oil.

75
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,140
It's coming from your wounds.

76
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,729
The hamon from your arms spread through you.

77
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,985
Every part of you is infected now.

78
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:16,343
You are dissolving.

79
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:18,934
I can only imagine the agony you feel.

80
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:21,747
I can't prevent you from dying now,

81
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:22,950
but there's this.

82
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,173
My blood can at least ease your pain.

83
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,588
Why do you want to shame me?

84
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:29,930
I have made peace with myself.

85
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:32,667
Stop. I don't need pity from you.

86
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,339
Is that what you think?

87
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:37,820
That this is done out of pity for you? No.

88
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:42,387
Why didn't you destroy Caesar's bubble
of blood that carried his bandana and ring,

89
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:45,193
knowing full well that they posed a serious threat to you?

90
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:46,996
Was that pity?

91
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:52,035
It was because the man was a worthy and noble warrior.

92
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:54,410
He deserved to be honored for that.

93
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:58,221
What you'll say next is, "JoJo, you can't mean..."

94
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,399
JoJo, you can't mean...

95
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,433
Yes, I do, Wamuu.

96
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:07,604
The honor you showed my friend, Caesar's
warrior spirit, had earned your respect.

97
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:13,004
So in return, I wanted to find a
way to honor your warrior spirit.

98
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:15,632
My blood is a tribute to you.

99
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,034
You beat me, JoJo.

100
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,044
And as a warrior,

101
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:26,120
it would now appear that you stand taller than I do.

102
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,215
Kill the bastard!

103
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:36,209
Hold!

104
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:38,569
What betrayal is this?

105
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:41,280
Huh?

106
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:46,846
You cowardly animals!

107
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:51,500
Wamuu!

108
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:53,678
Why do that?

109
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:55,949
I am Wamuu.

110
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:01,200
Although sworn to lord Kars, I will
not allow the vampires to attack you.

111
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,663
It's not because of sentiment.

112
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,099
I told Caesar this as well.

113
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,694
To me, only the strong truly existed.

114
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:13,302
Victory was the single quality to be admired.

115
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:17,654
I existed only according to my own code of honor.

116
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,427
JoJo, please understand,

117
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:25,670
to me, immortality was something
utterly unimportant and trivial.

118
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:31,137
All that has ever mattered to me was living up to my code.

119
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,109
And now...

120
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:37,166
I desire that you should drink the antidote.

121
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,649
You must do it before I dissolve completely away.

122
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,769
You won't see it, though.

123
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,762
I don't need eyes, words, or a horn.

124
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,338
I will know it. What matters is that you do it.

125
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:58,820
I have no regrets.

126
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:03,457
I am glad I was able to witness your growth as a warrior.

127
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:08,212
Perhaps

128
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:11,353
the reason I lived these thousands of
years was so that I could meet you at the end.

129
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,237
Farewell to you,

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,198
warrior JoJo.

131
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:30,420
Wamuu became one with the wind.

132
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:34,613
JoJo gave his opponent one final salute.

133
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:38,896
Though no tears fell, they had shared a silent song.

134
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:42,358
They had shared a warrior's affinity.

135
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:49,817
Wamuu...

136
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:51,390
You must kill him.

137
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,875
But, my lord Kars,

138
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:57,471
with utmost respect, he is only an innocent young boy.

139
00:09:57,948 --> 00:09:59,870
That's true, just a boy.

140
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,437
That is the reason he must die.

141
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:07,799
If these hamon users are allowed to live,
they're likely to become our mortal enemies,

142
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,786
and humans grow very quickly indeed.

143
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,090
Hmm.

144
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:14,735
Is it beyond you?

145
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,000
It would seem I must demonstrate how it is done.

146
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:23,279
Now, resolving the problem is handled like this, Wamuu!

147
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:30,850
Wamuu, he was too pure in his warrior philosophy,

148
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,463
and he became weak as a result.

149
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:35,623
Well, that's the end of Wamuu.

150
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:38,541
Indeed it is. What a disappointment.

151
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:41,224
You're right. He's only a poser.

152
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,895
Your followers are such base creatures.

153
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:45,369
Makes me want to vomit.

154
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:49,713
No, don't. Lord Kars, we...

155
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:52,643
He's draining us dry.

156
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,624
I alone am the only one to remain...

157
00:10:58,405 --> 00:10:59,174
Because...

158
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:04,090
This world and all in it belong to me.

159
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:10,705
Look at him! Look!

160
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:12,952
Lord Kars is amazing!

161
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:17,391
Our lord is ready to fight!

162
00:11:17,624 --> 00:11:22,714
Listen, lord Kars, there's no reason for
you to waste time on any one‐on‐one battles.

163
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:25,962
Forget the rules. Let us kill these two for you.

164
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,641
For you, lord, we'll turn them into sprays of blood!

165
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,508
Just what I thought you would do.

166
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:36,020
I told you.

167
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:39,093
The red stone! Look!

168
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:41,745
It's me against Kars one‐on‐one,

169
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:44,081
but if those terms aren't to your liking,

170
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:46,893
why don't I just smash this thing right here and now?

171
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,864
I will honor my word.

172
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:51,190
A one‐on‐one fight, count on it.

173
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:52,777
My promise stands.

174
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,662
That is why I chose to reveal my horn to you.

175
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:58,958
As for my underlings' behavior,

176
00:11:59,274 --> 00:12:02,696
as you can clearly see, they are already dead.

177
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,483
Why, lord Kars?

178
00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:10,052
All I want is that red stone.

179
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:16,185
However, though, Esidisi and Wamuu
were my comrades for 10,000 years.

180
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:21,173
I have no choice but to honor both their
warrior deaths and their warrior pride.

181
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:24,524
I will fight you hamon users fairly,

182
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:28,449
and then I will finish this with my own two hands.

183
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:31,985
For you, Lisa Lisa, seeing the fighter you are,

184
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:34,377
I will not think of you as merely a woman.

185
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,080
I will fight you with all the
strength I have at my command.

186
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:40,242
Come with me.

187
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,330
That is where we shall fight...

188
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:46,143
The temple at Piz Bernina.

189
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:53,342
Champions of battle would come here to drink the
blood of those they had felled mixed with liquor.

190
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,407
They thanked the gods for the gift of life.

191
00:12:56,834 --> 00:13:01,792
It's not an arena, but it will serve for our fight.

192
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:06,679
Coach Lisa Lisa, you may be extremely
skilled, but you are still a woman.

193
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:08,611
He doesn't look as strong as Wamuu was.

194
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:10,064
Let me take him for you.

195
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:11,717
I will not.

196
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:19,834
I didn't live my life as I did and train all
those years to be replaced by some stripling.

197
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:22,439
Oh, that's right. You have lived a lot of years.

198
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,629
I shall use my brilliant bone blades.

199
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:32,601
It would offend Wamuu's memory if I
didn't offer you the weapon of your choice.

200
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:34,848
Feel free to pick anything you like.

201
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:38,677
My scarf will be more than sufficient.

202
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:39,932
As you will.

203
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:42,440
And now let's fight.

204
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:51,322
Remarkable. There is no violence in his stance.

205
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,063
How can he fight without violence?

206
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:58,416
What's the matter? Are you not ready?

207
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:00,910
Apparently the first move is mine!

208
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:09,239
He disappeared completely in that sudden white light.

209
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:10,620
Where'd he go?

210
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:11,796
Kars is here.

211
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:13,844
I... I can feel him.

212
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:17,949
But he seems to be coming from above as well as below.

213
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:32,793
Attack of the brilliant bone blade!

214
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:34,801
Look! In the pillar, there's a crack!

215
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:37,167
Snake muffler.

216
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,407
Eh?

217
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,323
What you don't know is this satiporoja beetle scarf

218
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,121
is able to conduct hamon energy perfectly.

219
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,448
It's both a deadly weapon and a life detector,

220
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:51,987
and it protects against being attacked from behind!

221
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:00,645
All right. A knockout.

222
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,034
My wonderful coach really got him good.

223
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:07,405
He didn't really compare to
Wamuu, but dogs who bark rarely bite.

224
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:10,978
Coach, I have to say that you really are better than me.

225
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:17,437
Help me. Help me, lord Kars.

226
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:19,948
Kars is behind her.

227
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,999
Then who's that? Who's at her feet?

228
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:25,217
It can't be.

229
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,822
What the hell is going on?!

230
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:31,747
Kars wasn't the one fighting with her. He used a double!

231
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:36,079
What stupidity.

232
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,359
Why would I ever choose to fight one‐on‐one?

233
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:42,625
The only thing I wanted out of this was the red stone,

234
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,763
because I plan to become the ultimate life‐form.

235
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,021
I am not a warrior‐philosopher like Wamuu was,

236
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,809
nor am I a romantic.

237
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:54,144
No matter the method utilized, in the end...

238
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:58,117
Victory is the only thing that matters!

239
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:04,202
So that's why I sensed no violence.

240
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,540
He never had any intention of fighting me.

241
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:10,581
It's over!

242
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,707
Jo... Jo.

243
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,881
I have the red stone.

244
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:22,276
The only thing that's left is for all
of you to make me happy by killing JoJo!

245
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,654
Kars. Kars!

246
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:30,982
You are going to pay!

247
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:35,318
Kars!

248
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:37,394
Out of the way! Move back!

249
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:40,148
I'll split your damned skulls and kill you!

250
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:41,476
Zoom punch!

251
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:43,446
Eh?

252
00:16:46,535 --> 00:16:47,759
Your hamon,

253
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,017
I don't think it's working anymore.

254
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,814
You're weak now, so we're...

255
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,240
Rebuff overdrive!

256
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:01,449
JoJo, you look completely worn out.

257
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,859
Your breathing is ragged, your hamon level is weak,

258
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:11,460
and you're the only one left out of all
of the hamon users that Lisa Lisa trained.

259
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:13,279
Can you last?

260
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:14,702
Will you last?

261
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:16,187
JoJo...

262
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,587
Think you can beat me?

263
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:20,795
Mmm.

264
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:27,474
What? It can't be gone.

265
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,755
Let's rip off his skin!

266
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,885
Ah, crap. You can try!

267
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:35,410
Eh?

268
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:39,704
Eh?

269
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,769
Th... that light.

270
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,597
And that face.

271
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:48,027
This is your warning, vampires.

272
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,078
You are now facing major Von
Stroheim und the German elite.

273
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:56,844
And we represent the special
forces of the Speedwagon foundation!

274
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:57,439
JoJo.

275
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:58,384
JoJo.

276
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:01,148
Damn. Speedwagon, you look great.

277
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,557
And, Smokey, too.

278
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,487
You're a sight for sore eyes.

279
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:09,341
My right leg might be stiff now,

280
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,826
but my body is better than it ever was before.

281
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:17,340
Now all you vampires will see what German science can do!

282
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:22,227
Taste our ultraviolet floodlights!

283
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:26,455
It was the Speedwagon foundation
that made them small enough to carry,

284
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:28,825
but our boy does like to brag.

285
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:34,563
Hmm.

286
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,831
Crafty creatures, no question.

287
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:39,135
Hmm?

288
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,352
I don't see JoJo down there.

289
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:43,862
Gone again.

290
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:44,902
Eh?

291
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:48,351
Oh, you're just as quick as ever, aren't you?

292
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,013
Take eyes off you for a second,

293
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:54,916
and there you are putting another little scheme in play.

294
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:57,973
You crossed a line.

295
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:00,660
No honor earns you no consideration.

296
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:03,384
You said it would be a fair fight,

297
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,425
but attacked Lisa Lisa in a cowardly ambush,

298
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:08,848
thereby showing what you're made of.

299
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:12,918
And you have betrayed the honor
and memory of your friend Wamuu.

300
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,810
Save your indignation.

301
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,810
Your outrage means nothing.

302
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:20,518
Any action is a means to an end for what I desire.

303
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:23,562
The thing that matters to me is the red stone.

304
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:27,945
Battling over thousands of years means minimizing danger,

305
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,101
not taking any risk, and moving
your pawns very carefully indeed.

306
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:35,034
This is what the battle has been about.

307
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:37,718
And to show you how good I am at this,

308
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,768
I'm going to maneuver you effortlessly to your death.

309
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:41,914
Listen to me.

310
00:19:42,273 --> 00:19:44,161
For your information, Kars,

311
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:47,839
I've never hated anyone before this day, but you, I hate!

312
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:49,547
You really hate me?

313
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,643
Then show me, JoJo.

314
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:53,272
Let's go one‐on‐one.

315
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,305
We'll have that fair fight you wanted to have.

316
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:01,665
Lisa Lisa is almost dead,

317
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,896
but not completely yet.

318
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:05,469
I left her alive.

319
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:07,646
My plan is to let her live for a while.

320
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,337
And why would I do that?

321
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:12,697
She's just another pawn,

322
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:16,821
a worthless little pawn I can use against you.

323
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:29,385
You utter bastard.

324
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,464
Hah!

325
00:20:33,237 --> 00:20:35,977
Now I've tied her feet together with this rope.

326
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:37,725
And do you know why?

327
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,735
Why would I do such a thing as this?

328
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,103
This is why!

329
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,594
Lisa Lisa, no!

330
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,656
Off you go.

331
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:49,611
If she hits the ground, she'll be dead.

332
00:20:50,463 --> 00:20:56,028
If you don't save her in a few seconds,
she'll be a lisa‐lisa‐shaped splatter.

333
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:01,666
Huh?

334
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,333
What?! JoJo!

335
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:05,809
Lisa Lisa!

336
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:07,064
Hmm? Lisa Lisa?

337
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,574
That Lisa Lisa?

338
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:11,125
Do you mean to say she's the baby

339
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:13,642
on the ship granny Erina told us about?

340
00:21:16,264 --> 00:21:19,334
Then that means she is JoJo's...

341
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:23,748
Now that you can't move from that spot,

342
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,682
here's how efficient battle can be, JoJo.

343
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,066
I'll very calmly walk right up to you

344
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:33,195
and slice you to pieces while you can't move!

345
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:42,360
Kars, you bastard!

346
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,504
There's a place waiting for you in hell!

347
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,034
JoJo doesn't know.

348
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:49,866
He doesn't know the woman he's trying to save

349
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,652
is his mother.

350
00:22:05,717 --> 00:22:08,886
I'll be the roundabout

351
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:12,838
the words will make you out and out

352
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:18,267
I spend the day your way

353
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:25,363
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

354
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:35,856
The music dance and sing

355
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,926
they make the children really ring

356
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:45,227
I spend the day your way

357
00:22:45,252 --> 00:22:54,504
call it morning driving through the sound and
in and out the valley in and around the lake

358
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:59,457
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

359
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,473
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

360
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:13,009
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

361
00:23:15,597 --> 00:23:18,533
24 before my love you'll see

362
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,354
I'll be there with you

363
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,699
Have you finished disposing of those vampires yet?

364
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:33,219
I'm taking your life at the moment of my choice.

365
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:34,760
The scarf is a gamble.

366
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:35,903
Poor little child.

367
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:37,627
Von Stroheim, you must stop!

368
00:23:37,652 --> 00:23:39,795
This can't be!
