1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,269
Hey, rifle heads,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,841
what's a guy gotta do to get a little food in here?

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,397
Kars!

4
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:11,005
This man's mechanical.

5
00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:15,180
You're Von Stroheim!

6
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:16,617
Double shock!

7
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:22,291
This is spookier than meeting a
ghost in a dark cemetery after midnight.

8
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:24,425
Kars...

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,430
And Von Stroheim, who I could have sworn was
blown into little, tiny bits back in Mexico,

10
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,601
they're both standing right in front of me.

11
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:05,014
Kars,

12
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,220
and Von Stroheim is here, too.

13
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:09,839
His hand looks like it's made of metal,

14
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,546
and his face is wrapped in some strange machinery.

15
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:14,756
The Germans must have been hiding this.

16
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,839
What incredible medical technology.

17
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,052
Could it be for some kind of military use?

18
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:22,534
I guess that's what saved your
miserable life, Von Stroheim.

19
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,067
JoJo, as you can see, I'm back from hell.

20
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:29,812
Should I be happy about it?

21
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:33,777
When you get down to it, he's not exactly a bad guy,

22
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:36,237
except for the fact that he's a damn German soldier.

23
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:39,522
And I don't like the way he struts
around like he's better than everyone else.

24
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,697
Still, I am a bit happy.

25
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:46,348
Why don't you make yourself at home on
the sofa and watch me while I do my work?

26
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,679
H‐he's glaring at me.

27
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:56,912
He knows that I'm the one who killed Esidisi,

28
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:58,703
and he hates me for it.

29
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,139
Even so...

30
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:05,233
Kars! Do you think I'm gonna just sit
here and let you try and psyche me out?!

31
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:11,744
JoJo, once I'm finished securing the stone,

32
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:13,537
I'm going to put an end to you.

33
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:17,530
It's too bad Wamuu is still off working in Greece.

34
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:22,329
I can't allow a hamon user who was
able to beat Esidisi to remain alive.

35
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:24,906
Tell me something, Kars. Do you speak as a warrior,

36
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:27,358
or are you after something else, like revenge?

37
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:30,914
Pay attention. You're fighting me.

38
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:33,779
I'm the one who is going to be your final opponent.

39
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:36,238
No machine can stop me.

40
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:38,012
Is that right?

41
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:44,938
Arms of flesh and blood can't bend like
that, which means they are mechanical.

42
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,469
Now for the fun.

43
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:49,605
Wait. He's...

44
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:54,988
His fingers squeeze at 1,950
kilograms per centimeter squared,

45
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:56,839
almost twice Santviento 's strength

46
00:03:57,807 --> 00:03:59,806
you utter fool!

47
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,610
German science is the finest in the world!

48
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:05,280
These arms have such great power!

49
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,468
They were constructed based
on the abilities of Santviento!

50
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:11,352
And so, Kars...

51
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:15,557
We calculated exactly what we need to do to you.

52
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:19,732
In order to eliminate your power
and leave you in desperate agony.

53
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:26,467
I'm going to pluck you like a chicken, bit by bit,
and take you apart one square centimeter at a time.

54
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,689
Hey, JoJo...

55
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:28,124
Yow! Hey.

56
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:31,170
Don't you dare even think about feeling sorry for me.

57
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:34,688
My proud new form...

58
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:39,413
Is the very embodiment of the ultimate
peak of German science and engineering!

59
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:43,217
You see, I'm not merely human. I'm more!

60
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:44,552
Take this, Kars.

61
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:47,540
My machine gun can fire 600 rounds per minute,

62
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:50,784
and shred through armor plating like it was made of paper.

63
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:54,670
I'll whittle you down into tiny pieces in no time at all.

64
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:57,334
His body's mechanical, too?

65
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,225
...the hell was that?

66
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,658
It came from downstairs.

67
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:19,765
I swear the stone will be mine today.

68
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:22,580
Attempting to get it cost Esidisi his life.

69
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:26,238
I refuse to allow his ultimate
sacrifice to have been in vain.

70
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:29,984
That light.

71
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:32,440
The blade coming out of his arm is glowing.

72
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:34,456
I can control light.

73
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:37,244
Behold brilliant bone blade.

74
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:43,275
Impossible.

75
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,587
That blade is hardened bone and skin,

76
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:47,889
not weapons‐grade forged steel.

77
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:53,125
It shouldn't be able to deflect bullets like
that let alone slice them in half in midair.

78
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:56,638
His blade is amazing, but why is it glowing like that?

79
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:57,798
Here he comes. Here he comes.

80
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,632
Here he comes. Here he comes. Here he comes.

81
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:02,226
I... I know that sound.

82
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:04,679
Upon seeing the blade up close,

83
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:07,365
Von Stroheim was able to understand its secret.

84
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:09,734
It didn't have a simple edge.

85
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,353
Rather, it had a rotating blade moving at high speed.

86
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:17,449
Tiny, razor‐sharp claws slid quietly
along the outer edge of the blade,

87
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:19,527
ready to shred anything in its path.

88
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:24,575
Each claw was flawlessly polished to a mirror
like finish and refracted the faintest light,

89
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,410
making the blade look as though
it were glowing from within.

90
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,322
W‐we can't win this,

91
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:36,583
at least not with my weapons or
any modern technology that I know of.

92
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:38,298
We can't defeat him.

93
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,659
And what was Santviento?

94
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,512
Nothing but a weak child, a well trained guard dog.

95
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,916
He couldn't even compare to us.

96
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,825
Now I'll take that stone.

97
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:52,845
Kars. What the hell?

98
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:58,184
That ice‐cold sheen across his face.

99
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,911
A blade that can cut bullets in midair.

100
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:04,546
There's no way I could ever block
that thing with only my bare hands.

101
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:08,452
Even if I could concentrate all
of my hamon into a single blow,

102
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:11,274
that blade would still slice right through me.

103
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,236
To be perfectly honest,

104
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:15,972
I want to run away from here.

105
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,592
He's way too dangerous to take on directly.

106
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:21,496
I can't think of any way to get around that blade of his.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,216
Then again, I can't just leave and let him take the stone.

108
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,960
If he obtains the stone's power,
he'd become practically invincible.

109
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,825
I'd never be able to defeat him.

110
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:33,372
Damn it all.

111
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:35,460
I have to get my hands on Wamuu's antidote.

112
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,285
Kars wants to kill me after all.

113
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:40,036
Why me? Was this in my horoscope?

114
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:42,430
What is this?

115
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,061
What's in this pocket here?

116
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:48,222
Oh. The Red Stone of Aja.

117
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:53,453
I have waited a long time for this, 5,000 years,

118
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:55,478
and at last the stone is mine.

119
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,752
Not that I ever doubted it would be.

120
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:00,319
It was destined to fall into my hands.

121
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,213
Kars!

122
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:04,737
Just be patient.

123
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:06,799
I'll kill you in a moment.

124
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:08,650
Damn, that bastard.

125
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:11,283
H‐he really hates everything about me.

126
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:15,387
Letting him walk away with the
stone would mean the end for everyone.

127
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:18,058
Kars, you fool.

128
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,929
Don't think you've beaten me,
because I'm not finished with you yet.

129
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:26,803
Huh?

130
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:29,604
German science is the world's greatest!

131
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:31,087
I will beat you!

132
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,691
Von Stroheim, you idiot, what do you think you're doing?

133
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:35,977
How can you sit there and boast at a time like this?

134
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:40,367
Ultraviolet beams, activate!

135
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,378
It's the stone!

136
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:51,667
Huh? Oh, no. The stone is sliding down the slope.

137
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,106
Ah, damn it, no!

138
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,320
We have to stop it.

139
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:00,487
The stone is sliding toward the cliff.

140
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,739
If it falls off, it could be lost forever!

141
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:06,700
What the hell? Look at this.

142
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,903
W‐what's happened in here?

143
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,109
Kars happened.

144
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:13,971
JoJo, you have to go after the stone!

145
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,732
Grab it while you still can.

146
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,049
Damn. He's catching up.

147
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,095
He's fast. He's focused on the stone like a laser.

148
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,496
The way he keeps accelerating, he must be
planning to grab the stone and fall off the cliff.

149
00:09:27,886 --> 00:09:30,203
He won't be able to stop before he reaches the edge.

150
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:34,549
D‐damn it! The drop beyond that
cliff is at least several hundred meters.

151
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:37,800
With all his superior abilities,
Kars could survive the fall,

152
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:41,538
but it's as high as jumping off the
tallest skyscraper without a parachute.

153
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:43,466
It'd be certain death for me.

154
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
He's passing me.

155
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:52,288
JoJo plans to slow down before he reaches
the edge so he doesn't go flying off,

156
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,051
but not Kars. JoJo can't win.

157
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:58,265
There's no way I'm gonna let this
slime get his hands on the stone.

158
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,439
Go! Run hard, JoJo!

159
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,789
JoJo, when I reach down to grab
the stone, I'll be off balance.

160
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:06,861
With my flank open, I'll be vulnerable.

161
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:10,076
Is that when you'll do it? Is
that when you'll try to kick me?

162
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:10,568
Huh?

163
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:15,690
You'll attack me with your hamon, even if
it means the stone disappears into the abyss.

164
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:19,019
You think your plan will work, JoJo?

165
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,953
Look there. JoJo.

166
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,679
You're right on the nose, Kars.

167
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:29,048
Here it comes! It's the kick you ordered!

168
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:30,538
No!

169
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:34,017
Ah. He's used his legs to pick up the stone

170
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:37,073
right as JoJo kicked him. He's going to get away with it.

171
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:38,362
I don't believe it.

172
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:41,792
Now, Kars, what's with that ridiculously arrogant grin?

173
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:44,125
I mean, I'm the one who should be smiling here.

174
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:46,583
I guess I should have expected as much from you.

175
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:49,732
A trick like that really isn't good enough to fool me.

176
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:53,605
My kick wasn't aimed at your
vulnerable flank, but rather the snow,

177
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:56,168
and it worked just like a brake.

178
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,848
What do you know? Looks like I'm the
one who made the nice catch, not you.

179
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:04,761
Enjoy your trip, Kars.

180
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:07,316
Uhh! Aw, man. No way!

181
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,877
Aah! A blade from his foot?!

182
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:12,954
JoJo!

183
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:21,260
He's falling with Kars.

184
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,450
What's happening?

185
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,086
Kars's blade is starting to meld itself with my body.

186
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,087
It won't come out.

187
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:29,866
Y‐you son of a bitch!

188
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:32,831
It's 175 meters to the bottom,

189
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:34,796
five seconds until impact.

190
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,602
Damn. Falling to my death with this guy?

191
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:40,403
No, thank you.

192
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:41,919
Clinging hamon!

193
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:45,752
He's so heavy.

194
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:48,018
Hamon goes through fluids easily,

195
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,811
but ice and snow are solid and impede the hamon.

196
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:52,867
But water is trickling down the ice,

197
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:55,581
so the hamon can use that to flow around the solids.

198
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,492
Thus it's working perfectly.

199
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,520
I don't care what you do. The stone will be mine.

200
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:02,439
That's it exactly.

201
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:06,060
That tenacity of yours, it's what scares me the most.

202
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:09,092
I'm best at exploiting my opponent's negligence,

203
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:12,172
so a tenacious foe is the absolute worst for me to face.

204
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:15,078
Tenacity is the opposite of negligence.

205
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,131
It will be mine today!

206
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:23,151
More icicles up ahead.

207
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:26,451
Before I can do anything, I have
to get this blade out of my shoulder.

208
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:32,046
Wait. I can just send hamon through
the blade and directly into Kars.

209
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:33,192
Take this!

210
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:34,415
As I thought.

211
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:37,725
I knew you would try using my blade against me.

212
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:39,090
Just for that,

213
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:41,854
it's into the cliff wall with you!

214
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:45,255
And now...

215
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:46,450
N‐no. Wait.

216
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:48,819
He's gonna use that blade and cut me into pieces.

217
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:52,191
Kars is waiting for JoJo to
rebound before he starts cutting him.

218
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,555
There's no way he can dodge that.

219
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,739
Now I'm going to take great pleasure in
slicing you in half and picking up the stone,

220
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:00,177
at the bottom of the abyss.

221
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:02,978
You...

222
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,803
Now, you're not about to cut this, are you?

223
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:13,309
You wouldn't dare take the chance of
chopping the stone in half along with me.

224
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:18,376
I can use your own strength against you by letting
your tenacity act as a defensive measure for me.

225
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:20,944
Now eat this, Kars! Hamon kick!

226
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:31,092
Damn, he's trying to use the falling icicles as a rope.

227
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:32,193
He's clever...

228
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:34,095
But they're in a freefall, too.

229
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:36,264
He'll never reach the top.

230
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:39,741
In that case, allow me to lend a hand. Hold on.

231
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:40,629
Huh?

232
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:45,515
Caesar!

233
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:48,050
Hey, nice timing, don't you think, JoJo?

234
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:49,691
What the hell's going on?

235
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:52,287
And what are you two, some kind of a team?

236
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:58,126
Heh. Fusing falling icicles together to make
a rescue rope, I had nothing to do with that.

237
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:01,470
Only JoJo would try something that colossally stupid.

238
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:02,764
It was predictable.

239
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,198
At least you were able to think up
a stupid trick and then pull it off

240
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:09,493
in the nick of time. I'm proud of you, Caesar.

241
00:14:09,624 --> 00:14:11,151
Eh? What was that?

242
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:12,982
Nice. Nice.

243
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:15,611
Real outstanding work, caesarino.

244
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:19,019
And, hey, if Lisa Lisa is up there, give her a message.

245
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:21,402
I've got the red stone, and it's safe.

246
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:23,484
I kept him from snatching it.

247
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,137
That was a close call.

248
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:28,058
All right, Caesar, you had better pull him up now.

249
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:30,558
Now, my German compatriot,

250
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:34,562
your body is even more durable
than any of theirs could hope to be.

251
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:39,571
Listen. If you can stop with the
snobbery, maybe we can work together.

252
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,507
JoJo, you're a lucky one.

253
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:17,557
I'll let you hold the stone for me

254
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:19,320
for at least another day.

255
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:41,577
So this is Switzerland's famous Saint Moritz, a
winter sports hub often referred to as sun valley,

256
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:44,879
chic, relaxed, and sophisticated,

257
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,883
a resort that the wealthy flock to during the holidays.

258
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:54,549
Even the cats look like they're owned by actresses
and are pampered at all the finest spas in Europe.

259
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,473
Aren't we fussy?

260
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,740
Not even a tiny glance for shrimp?

261
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:08,687
This little Princess thinks
she's the center of the universe,

262
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:10,878
but doesn't know a thing about the world at all.

263
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,212
All right, then.

264
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:16,045
Would this smoked salmon suit your snooty palate better?

265
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:18,389
There we go.

266
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,507
It seems I've found what you prefer.

267
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:24,559
That's it. Reach for it.

268
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:26,771
Just a little bit higher now.

269
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,130
Stretch up just a little more there.

270
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:32,638
I gotcha now.

271
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,706
Oh? Did I upset you?

272
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:41,108
Enjoy, you puny, pompous puffball.

273
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,583
That was pretty mean.

274
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,869
I don't know why I thought it would be a good idea.

275
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:55,748
It's just because I'm really on edge.

276
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:59,369
We only have five days until the ring dissolves,

277
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:02,369
and Kars is absolutely serious about killing me.

278
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:04,729
I can feel the threats closing in.

279
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,925
They're all around.

280
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:07,688
I have to relax.

281
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:12,714
This is ridiculous. I'm the one who's always
saying you can't sit around moping about stuff.

282
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,653
JoJo, what are you doing just sitting there?

283
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:18,554
Get up out of that chair, come
over here, and look at this.

284
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,913
Right. Be there in a second.

285
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:28,730
The building on top of that hill is
the address Esidisi put on the package.

286
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,406
It looks like the abandoned corpse of a shuttered hotel.

287
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:36,501
It would make a perfect hideout
for Kars during daylight hours.

288
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:39,207
Every doorway and window is boarded up.

289
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:41,034
No sunlight could get in there.

290
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,255
That's got to be it.

291
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:44,796
I'm sure Kars hides in there during the day.

292
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:48,193
I bet he's just sitting inside,
waiting for Wamuu to show up.

293
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:50,328
All right. So what is the plan?

294
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:52,860
Humph. That's a no‐brainer.

295
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:54,705
We should attack now.

296
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:56,798
Yes, I agree.

297
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:59,603
Kars can't go outside as long as the sun is up,

298
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,111
and that gives us a tremendous advantage.

299
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:03,938
What do you think?

300
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:07,709
Sorry, but...

301
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:09,953
I have to disagree with you.

302
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:12,392
You're looking at this wrong.

303
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:15,099
I think it's more dangerous to attack when the sun is up.

304
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:18,794
Just think about it. Kars has been
living like this for thousands of years.

305
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:22,483
He wouldn't have survived if he had
left himself defenseless during the day.

306
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,499
Oh, please!

307
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:27,695
Walking into his hideout and trying to
take him down right now would be suicidal.

308
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:29,330
I'm not going to do it.

309
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,900
It would be like a bug walking
into a spider's web on purpose.

310
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:34,294
Hah! Come on.

311
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:39,673
JoJo, this isn't like you. Are you scared or something?

312
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:42,554
I think I'm going to take sun tzu's advice this time.

313
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:45,379
Only engage in a fight when victory is assured.

314
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,515
Like I said, I'm not going in.

315
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,447
Oh, yeah? So you're chickening out?

316
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:51,092
I'm not afraid.

317
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:52,594
I'm just thinking straight.

318
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:54,896
I've got a cool head, unlike you.

319
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:57,999
Caesar, we have to wait for him to make his move first.

320
00:18:58,024 --> 00:18:59,893
An assured victory is what you want?

321
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,266
Kars is all alone there. It's him against all of us.

322
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,995
That's a four‐to‐one advantage.

323
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:08,543
We have to strike now, before
Wamuu arrives, cutting that in half.

324
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:09,854
Calm down.

325
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:11,846
Don't go off all crazy now.

326
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,856
Try and keep your head together.

327
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,583
Just focus, and think it through.

328
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:18,019
If we go now, he'll cut us to pieces.

329
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:19,621
You can't approach this half‐cocked.

330
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:21,456
I am not half‐cocked!

331
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:23,107
I'm gonna end this!

332
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:25,456
I am going to finally finish the fight

333
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,645
that cut short the lives of both of our grandfathers!

334
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,595
I'm gonna destroy Kars!

335
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,899
You're going to finish it?

336
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:34,636
Right, and why bring our dead grandfathers into this?

337
00:19:34,702 --> 00:19:36,137
Who the hell cares?!

338
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:39,474
Don't drag the dead into your little drama, you moron.

339
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:41,694
What did you say to me?

340
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:45,647
Family you've never met and that came
long before your time doesn't mean crap.

341
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:46,995
It's just foolish.

342
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,819
Only a complete idiot would die for something like that.

343
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:54,699
Caesar?

344
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:58,280
You watch your mouth, JoJo!

345
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:01,603
Hey, what was that for, you...

346
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,822
A sucker punch, huh?

347
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:05,322
Oh, it's on.

348
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:07,853
What the hell, Caesar?! What's wrong with you?!

349
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:09,308
Just shut the hell up!

350
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:12,761
Caesar, stop it. Now.

351
00:20:13,055 --> 00:20:14,329
You too, JoJo!

352
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:15,237
Caesar!

353
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,916
You bastard, what's with you?

354
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:23,372
Have you completely lost it?

355
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:25,427
You're acting like some kind of a madman.

356
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:31,886
JoJo, I guess you won't ever understand the concept
of family honor and inheriting a battle like this.

357
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:32,299
Huh?

358
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:35,049
Enough. I'm going.

359
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:36,995
Caesar, JoJo is right.

360
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,709
It's far too dangerous.

361
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:41,750
We have no way of knowing what
might be waiting for us in there.

362
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:43,811
We'll wait for Kars to make his move.

363
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:46,814
That is an order, Caesar.

364
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:50,551
The only thing that matters now
is protecting the Red Stone of Aja.

365
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,350
No, coach, I'm sorry.

366
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,315
I can't obey this time.

367
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:59,233
You know this is a matter of blood and family honor.

368
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,412
It's a Zeppeli problem.

369
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,515
I just can't leave it unsettled when
I know exactly where Kars is hiding.

370
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:10,845
I can't sit here twirling my
thumbs, waiting for him to come to me!

371
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:13,380
What do we do?

372
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:19,137
Follow him, and do whatever you have to to stop
him from entering, even if it means using force.

373
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,954
Caesar, why are you doing this?

374
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,528
Why are you so damn grim and hotheaded all of a sudden?

375
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:29,296
Why can't you be patient and just wait a while?

376
00:21:29,844 --> 00:21:34,280
You see, you've inadvertently touched
on a painful piece of his hidden past.

377
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,764
Although you didn't mean to, you've hit upon a dark place

378
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:40,995
where he harbors his saddest secrets.

379
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:43,628
Caesar has a hidden past?

380
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:49,523
W‐what the hell could it be?

381
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:13,367
I'll be the roundabout

382
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,251
the words will make you out and out

383
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:22,590
I spend the day your way

384
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:29,892
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

385
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:40,405
The music dance and sing

386
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,220
they make the children really ring

387
00:22:44,474 --> 00:22:49,551
I spend the day your way

388
00:22:49,812 --> 00:22:56,197
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

389
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:59,100
in and around the lake

390
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:04,278
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

391
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:10,856
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

392
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:17,357
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

393
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,724
24 before my love you'll see

394
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,310
I'll be there with you

395
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,413
I feel like I did back then when I was na ïve and poor!

396
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,498
I'll use my viciousness to destroy you!

397
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:40,380
Very well. You are worthy of
death at my hands, bubble user!
