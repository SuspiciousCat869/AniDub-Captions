1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:07,732
Two rings filled with a fatal poison have
been implanted around JoJo's neck and heart.

2
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:09,240
Neither can be removed.

3
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:12,092
Before the rings dissolve and the poison is released,

4
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:16,025
JoJo must defeat the powerful
Wamuu in order to secure the antidote.

5
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,454
Ahh! What was I thinking?

6
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,608
When I said I needed a month, I only meant it as a bluff.

7
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:29,055
I didn't think he'd take me seriously.

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,121
I should have said I needed a year.

9
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:32,773
A tip for you, JoJo.

10
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:35,912
Quit screwing around, and act like a man.

11
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:38,334
We need to think of something, and fast.

12
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,201
I know. This is how I think.

13
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:44,223
But there really isn't any point
in me thinking about this too hard.

14
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:48,123
If we do that, we'll realize just
how much trouble we're both in here.

15
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:51,231
Once you're done with your thinking freak‐out,

16
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:54,220
I want you to pay close attention
to what I'm about to do here.

17
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:54,732
Eh?

18
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:01,367
The water's suspended in midair!

19
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:03,790
JoJo, catch.

20
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,993
Try to keep the water in the glass like that.

21
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:08,407
Easy. I can do that, no sweat.

22
00:01:13,028 --> 00:01:14,563
Here's what you did wrong.

23
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:17,910
The strength of your hamon is
pretty much equivalent to mine,

24
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:22,096
but you waste a lot of your power, because
you release it from the palm of your hand.

25
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,704
And thus you can't control the water.

26
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:28,309
However, when I hold the water,

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,630
I release hamon from the tip of one of my fingers,

28
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:33,043
a single point.

29
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,694
That method allows me to focus my energy,

30
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:37,835
making it easy to control the water.

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,849
Scattering hamon everywhere the
way you do just disperses your energy.

32
00:01:43,776 --> 00:01:49,051
Think of it like using a squirt gun with its
smaller hole, rather than an open water hose, capiche?

33
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:53,159
You're naturally gifted, JoJo,

34
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,440
but you need a lot of work to
get your hamon under control.

35
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,856
I brought you to venice to meet my mentor,

36
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,478
but it's gonna be a grind.

37
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:01,946
Oh, no!

38
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:06,786
"Grind" and "work" are probably my two
least favorite words in the English language.

39
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,813
Venice, huh?

40
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:47,346
I thought this was pretty much a tourist town.

41
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:51,062
What's a hamon master doing in a place like this?

42
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:54,414
Excuse me!

43
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,609
Do you know air supplena island,
and how long it takes to get there?

44
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:03,973
Gondolier, did you hear me?

45
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:22,477
How is he standing on that oar like that?

46
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:25,527
Uh, I don't think I like this, not one bit.

47
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:33,240
...the hell?

48
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:40,152
You asked for it.

49
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:42,473
I have no idea who you are,

50
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:44,517
but I'm going to make you pay for that.

51
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:46,734
You're gonna wish you never met me.

52
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:52,150
At least he can control his hamon well
enough to stand on water. That's a start.

53
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,618
A woman.

54
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:58,928
Is that you, coach?

55
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:01,781
She goes by the name of Lisa Lisa.

56
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:04,840
Nobody knows her true name, her place of origin,

57
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:08,073
where she studied, or how she mastered the art of hamon.

58
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,020
She will be JoJo's coach for as long as it takes

59
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:12,778
or at least for the next month.

60
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:17,550
Well, well. Don't think that I'll forgive
you for hitting me in the face with that oar.

61
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,323
Just because you're a girl,

62
00:05:19,474 --> 00:05:21,778
doesn't mean that I won't give you what you deserve.

63
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,258
You should just be happy that you impressed
me with your initial display of skills.

64
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:31,336
Walking on water when you obviously lack
proper training is quite an accomplishment.

65
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:32,528
However...

66
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,772
If you truly wish to master hamon in a
month, you must be prepared to die for it!

67
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,398
She‐she's using the oar as a high bar.

68
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,705
What is this?

69
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:01,480
Joseph Joestar.

70
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:06,873
From this moment forward, you will be wearing that
breathing correction apparatus until I say otherwise.

71
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:09,270
I can't breathe.

72
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:10,974
Not without proper rhythm, you can't.

73
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:14,278
However, with proper breath
control, you'll have no problem.

74
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:19,999
If you do not maintain proper breath control,
then, yes, the mask will eventually suffocate you,

75
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:21,245
so focus.

76
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:25,678
Learn to master your breath, and you'll
be running marathons while wearing it.

77
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:28,976
Are you crazy? Get this damn thing off my face right...

78
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:31,812
I‐i can't breathe.

79
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:34,346
You do realize your training has already begun.

80
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:37,790
You can take the mask off for meals
and whenever you need to brush your teeth.

81
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,507
JoJo, don't make it hard on yourself.

82
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:43,620
Just keep your rhythm and pretend that it's Halloween.

83
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:45,390
I'm gonna get you, lady.

84
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:47,298
And one more thing before I forget,

85
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:48,875
so we're both on the same page.

86
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:53,751
I did not accept the responsibility of training
you just so that you can save your own skin.

87
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:58,358
I am forging a squad of warriors
capable of annihilating our enemies.

88
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:00,079
You‐you witch.

89
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:02,909
Careful. You want another go‐round with her?

90
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:05,538
Humph! I would never hit a woman.

91
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:08,645
It's always a pleasure, Caesar.

92
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:11,824
And you, JoJo, welcome to venice.

93
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:14,769
Sheesh.

94
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:17,386
You can't help but respect her hamon skills,

95
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:19,984
but good luck finding anyone who would ever marry her,

96
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:22,661
even if she is kinda cute.

97
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:24,805
Bow when she leaves!

98
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,828
Are you kidding me? Italy's most transparent
playboy wants me to be polite to that little witch?

99
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,790
Watch your tongue, JoJo.

100
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:33,808
I respect her like my own mother.

101
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:36,447
Show her the same respect. I'm warning you.

102
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:42,310
Air supplena island is about 30
minutes northeast of venice by boat.

103
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:46,797
Its mysterious air is a stark
contrast to the city of canals,

104
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:51,334
but it possesses a dark beauty that
seems to be a perfect fit for Lisa Lisa.

105
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:53,828
This is your new training ground, JoJo.

106
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,332
I have claimed that entire island as my home.

107
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:00,709
So this is where I'll have to die for my hamon training.

108
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:02,759
We'll just see about that.

109
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:07,405
So I see.

110
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:11,266
I'm glad you're safe, and my grandson, too.

111
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,968
I don't know if I've ever been happier.

112
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:22,129
Hey, if you mention one word about
those stupid poison rings to granny,

113
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:26,111
I'll beat you senseless. It would
do no good to tell her anything.

114
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,394
No sense wasting any more of my time.

115
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:34,489
I hope you're ready for the hell climb pillar!

116
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,469
Wait. Seriously?

117
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:37,566
What's the big deal?

118
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:38,827
But‐but, coach,

119
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:42,508
you know that I haven't even made an
attempt on hell climb pillar, right?

120
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:45,110
Do you really intend for us to start on this?

121
00:08:45,702 --> 00:08:48,047
So many have died on hell climb pillar.

122
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:49,762
I've heard countless stories.

123
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:52,654
Stories that may or may not be true.

124
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,917
If you fail, you have no place here.

125
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,668
Hello. Would somebody care to
clue me in on what's going on?

126
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:01,327
This hell pillar thing doesn't really look all that tall.

127
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:04,564
Well, from up here, it's really more deep than tall.

128
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:05,246
Huh?

129
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:08,457
Coach, wait! Please don't do this!

130
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,590
What the hell is this?

131
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:19,808
Oil.

132
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:22,619
This pillar is covered in flowing oil.

133
00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:27,069
It's 24 meters to the top of the pillar,
and you may only use your hands to climb.

134
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:29,121
There is no other way out.

135
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:31,631
If you can't find a way to climb back,

136
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:33,275
you'll die down there.

137
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,586
But that's impossible.

138
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,302
There's no way that anyone could climb up that pillar.

139
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:59,889
JoJo and Caesar must now overcome the
most grueling of all hamon endurance tests,

140
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:01,796
the hell climb pillar.

141
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,397
This is really bad.

142
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:08,677
I can barely cling to the pillar,

143
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,396
and moving my fingers even a little bit is so exhausting.

144
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,953
If I were to fall now,

145
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:16,821
I wouldn't have anything left to start climbing again.

146
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:18,926
But I can't think like that right now.

147
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:22,863
Otherwise, JoJo and I will both starve to death down here.

148
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:29,057
JoJo! The longer you stay in that
muck, the harder it is to climb out.

149
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:30,551
Now focus, and...

150
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:31,505
No.

151
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,546
I must stay focused on myself.

152
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:38,645
I can't get distracted, not even for a second.

153
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:44,803
This is ridiculous!

154
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,605
I just got here!

155
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,063
That smug witch knows I'm not strong enough to
climb this stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid thing!

156
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:53,848
It's not fair!

157
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,791
Just who the hell does she think she
is, anyway, throwing us down this hole?

158
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:01,280
There's no way I could possibly respect her after this.

159
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:04,013
I've always been patient when it comes to women,

160
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:07,557
but she'd better start praying that
I never make it out of here alive.

161
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:09,342
Bloody hell.

162
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:18,083
So this idiotic pillar claimed the
lives of a lot of trainees, is that right?

163
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:23,373
Maybe they were all just too dimwitted
to come up with a creative solution.

164
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:34,882
Using anything but hamon is an
insult to the pillar and your training.

165
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:37,567
The hell climb pillar only accepts hamon.

166
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:41,309
It refuses anything else, so don't ever forget that.

167
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,222
Wait a sec!

168
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:44,629
Come back, Lisa Lisa!

169
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:46,629
I mean, coach! Wait!

170
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:52,869
Y‐you wouldn't really leave me down here
to rot just because I don't have enough power

171
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:54,497
to climb out of here, would you?

172
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,143
I mean, it's my first day.

173
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,201
This is just some kind of test, right?

174
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:00,552
To teach me humility?

175
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:02,801
You'll pull me out later, right? Right?!

176
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:09,983
Her eyes are like ice.

177
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:11,588
She really means it.

178
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:13,677
She's just going to let me die down here.

179
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:17,491
Curse her. What gives her the right to do this?

180
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:22,519
The fact that she's so damn beautiful just
makes me even more furious about this whole thing!

181
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:29,712
28 hours later,

182
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,740
Caesar is at 15 meters,

183
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:34,120
while JoJo is at zero meters.

184
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,957
The rings will now dissolve in 28 days.

185
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,106
I'm pretty sure we've been in here overnight,

186
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:42,946
and Caesar still has a long way to go up that pillar.

187
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,173
I should be focusing on myself, but I
can tell that he's really struggling.

188
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:52,099
His fingers look like they're about to come loose.

189
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:55,404
If‐if he loses that grip, he's going to come sliding down.

190
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,961
His hamon looks like it's about to run out.

191
00:12:58,135 --> 00:12:59,732
Caesar, focus!

192
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,799
He looks like he's about to fall again.

193
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,063
He's hanging by his fingertips.

194
00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:12,023
Caesar!

195
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,917
Wait a second.

196
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:19,173
Is that how he's been climbing this entire time?

197
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:21,302
By using just his fingertips like that?

198
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:25,951
He wasn't about to fall off at all.

199
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,362
He was just...

200
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:30,542
Think of it like using a squirt
gun with its smaller hole...

201
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,065
That's‐that's it!

202
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:34,364
It totally makes sense now.

203
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,697
Consider this hamon mystery solved.

204
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,248
Let's see how this works.

205
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:50,850
I did it. It's working.

206
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:52,906
My hamon is sticking to the pillar.

207
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,735
All this time, I had my hands flat.

208
00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:58,191
I was trying to use them to support my weight,

209
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,675
when in fact, it's the opposite that works.

210
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:05,308
Focused hamon concentrated into the
fingertips is where the true strength lies.

211
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:08,289
What a simple little trick. I've got it now.

212
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:11,053
All I have to do from here on up is just climb

213
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:15,001
and plot my revenge on that so‐called hamon coach.

214
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:18,301
JoJo's got it. Good for him.

215
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:21,644
Another 24 hours have passed.

216
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,856
Caesar is now at 18 meters, and JoJo is at 16 meters.

217
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:29,289
The rings will dissolve in exactly 27 days.

218
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,882
Oh, boy. Now I can see why Caesar started to
slow down so much once he got to this point.

219
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:39,989
The pillar begins curving outward here as it goes up.

220
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:42,276
This is where things are going to get tough.

221
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:45,836
The pillar is as unforgiving as that damn Lisa Lisa.

222
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:49,278
It's now 3 hours later,

223
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:53,036
Caesar is at 19 meters, JoJo at 18 meters.

224
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:54,523
Ohh. Is that a...

225
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:59,417
Yes, it is. It's a crack, and it
should be just big enough for my fingers.

226
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:00,861
Thank goodness.

227
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:02,950
Time for a well‐earned break here.

228
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:06,566
I can't believe my luck.

229
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:09,649
Things are finally starting to look up for me.

230
00:15:11,316 --> 00:15:12,014
Oh, no.

231
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:12,905
What was that?

232
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,619
It felt like some kind of switch.

233
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:19,016
Did you feel that, JoJo? What's going on?

234
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,954
What the... oh, no.

235
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,680
The hell climb pillar only accepts hamon.

236
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,490
It refuses anything else.

237
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:29,922
Watch out! Something's happening!

238
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:35,277
Not good. I must have tripped some sort of booby trap.

239
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,424
This just went from difficult to impossible.

240
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,308
How in the world are we supposed to scale this thing now?

241
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:46,932
An impenetrable sheet of oil shoots out of the
pillar at a deadly speed near the 20‐meter mark.

242
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:58,955
That stream is so highly pressurized
that it can cut like a razor.

243
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:00,842
What?

244
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:04,856
Stop looking at me like that. It was
an accident. You can't be mad at me.

245
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,642
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

246
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:12,580
I was just trying to rest for a second.

247
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,781
I did what any other sane person would have done.

248
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:18,969
Whatever madman designed this
diabolical thing set that up as a trap.

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,356
I wasn't giving you a look of blame, JoJo.

250
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,562
I was giving you one of concern.

251
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:30,060
I'm not even sure if I can focus my hamon
enough to get through that oil in one piece.

252
00:16:31,382 --> 00:16:32,965
There is one way up!

253
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:36,756
Whoa. What the...

254
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:41,153
He's sticking to the pillar with his feet.

255
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:49,015
Caesar!

256
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:52,416
Hamon to attract and repel.

257
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:56,427
My hamon is now focused through
my feet to keep me on the pillar

258
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:59,296
and in my hands to protect me as I break through the oil.

259
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:05,230
I must stay focused to control the two
opposing types of hamon simultaneously.

260
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,684
I did it.

261
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:19,722
I hate to say it, but JoJo isn't even close to
being able to control two types of hamon at once.

262
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:22,669
There's no way he can get through that.

263
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,298
That‐that was amazing.

264
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:28,948
I'm glad Caesar was able to find
his way through the oil somehow,

265
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,355
but there's no way I can pull off a hamon stunt like that.

266
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:37,329
Nine hours later...

267
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,643
He's done it.

268
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:46,693
Caesar reaches the top after 61 hours.

269
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:49,912
Please, coach.

270
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:51,641
JoJo can't make it through that.

271
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:53,670
You've got to turn off the oil for him.

272
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:56,824
The man has no patience at all.

273
00:17:56,996 --> 00:18:03,203
He'll undoubtedly try some stupid
do‐or‐die stunt any second now, and he'll fail.

274
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:08,036
Well, I know that hanging around
like this won't get me anywhere.

275
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,007
You've got to turn that oil off.

276
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:12,787
If he tries to break through it,

277
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:15,203
the oil will end up cutting him in half.

278
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:17,959
And even if he's just blasted to the ground,

279
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,365
he'll end up starving to death down there.

280
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:23,536
Coach, please!

281
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,033
Ah, to hell with it!

282
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:26,778
I'll make it or die trying.

283
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:28,478
Here goes nothing!

284
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:29,980
JoJo, don't!

285
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:31,640
Just stay right where you are!

286
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,692
I can use the strength of my
hamon to get me out of this, too.

287
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:44,184
JoJo!

288
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:48,547
Look at that. I don't believe it.

289
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:51,994
He's using his hamon to slide
along the plane of the oil sheet.

290
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:55,713
The oil loses its speed the farther it shoots out.

291
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:57,803
I'll have to launch from here!

292
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:14,606
He actually used the momentum of the oil
to whip himself up and over the top of it.

293
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:19,246
He didn't fall. In fact, it looks like
he's made it up a whole three meters.

294
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,322
I've never seen anyone ascend the
hell climb pillar like that before.

295
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,348
He did it by turning his weakness into a strength.

296
00:19:26,518 --> 00:19:27,961
That was quite clever.

297
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:29,778
I‐i made it.

298
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:32,544
Kind of, anyway. I'm on the wall.

299
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,756
But it's not over yet. This overhang here is even
worse than the one that was on the pillar down below.

300
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:44,653
I don't have anything left.

301
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,570
I've just got one more meter to go, damn it.

302
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:53,027
I‐i can't control my breathing any longer.

303
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:54,806
I'm slipping.

304
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:56,190
No!

305
00:20:00,423 --> 00:20:01,552
C‐caesar.

306
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:03,562
Let me set the record straight.

307
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:06,183
I was not mad at you earlier, JoJo.

308
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,007
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:09,401
Forgive me, coach,

310
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:12,040
but I just couldn't let JoJo go down like that.

311
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:16,015
I suppose I understand, Caesar,

312
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,726
although I'm surprised you
have any strength left yourself.

313
00:20:18,762 --> 00:20:20,573
Oh, I forgot.

314
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:22,742
I could really use your other arm here.

315
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,196
Don't let me go! Caesar!

316
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,437
10 seconds later and after saying,

317
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,639
"don't let me go," another 13 times,

318
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:33,250
JoJo reaches the top.

319
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:37,008
Hello again, coach.

320
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:39,275
I bet you thought I was done for, huh?

321
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:43,644
I want you to know that while I was
clinging to that pillar for dear life,

322
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:45,123
I had time to think to myself,

323
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:48,690
"how should I exact my revenge upon that witch?!

324
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:50,798
"Should I challenge her to a duel?

325
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:54,196
Or maybe I should just squeeze her nose until she cries."

326
00:20:54,238 --> 00:20:55,499
That's interesting.

327
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,971
I didn't think JoJo would be the
type that would hold a grudge like that.

328
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:01,926
So which will it be, coach?

329
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,378
Eh?

330
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:06,172
I‐I'm doing it.

331
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:09,981
I'm really doing it. I'm holding the
water in the cup when it's upside down.

332
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:15,868
That's great. In only three excruciating
days, he's improved his hamon control.

333
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:19,294
JoJo's inherent talent is incredible,

334
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:22,693
but coach Lisa Lisa's hamon training is even more so.

335
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:25,044
Forgive me, coach.

336
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:26,945
Please, I'll do whatever you say.

337
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,646
You've got to give me more training, I beg you. Please.

338
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,808
You'll see what I can do. I'll overcome anything.

339
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:34,930
Well, that was pretty quick.

340
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:37,988
I didn't think you'd be able
to hold a grudge for very long.

341
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:39,589
Oh, don't worry, JoJo.

342
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:41,300
I've got plenty more for you.

343
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:43,617
I will train you into the ground.

344
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:44,844
Thank you, coach.

345
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:49,532
Your next three weeks here are going to
make the hell climb pillar look like a cakewalk.

346
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:50,540
Huh?

347
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:53,941
Who the hell do you think you
are, sneaking up on me like that?

348
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:01,494
Whoa. Who are these guys?

349
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,588
He's made the water move like pudding.

350
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:07,860
I would like for you to meet two of my finest servants.

351
00:22:08,003 --> 00:22:09,942
These men will be your new instructors.

352
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:11,871
Say hello to Meshina and Loggs.

353
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:14,369
I‐i can't even imagine how to do that.

354
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:16,536
Would you like to learn, then?

355
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:17,116
Eh?

356
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:20,135
Didn't you hear me ask if you
wanted to learn how to do this?

357
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,835
Yes, of course I did.

358
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,813
Learning from you would be an honor.

359
00:22:23,853 --> 00:22:25,665
Well, fine then.

360
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,928
Come closer, take a look, and
I'll show you what's going on.

361
00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:30,296
Huh?

362
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,601
Why do you chumps want hamon training?

363
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:42,701
No matter. From here on out, we're gonna...

364
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:45,520
Forge you into real men!

365
00:22:52,358 --> 00:22:57,707
Strengthen your breath. How can your muscles be
strong if what supports them is weak as a butterfly?

366
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:01,360
You must be able to take 10
full breaths in a single second.

367
00:23:01,862 --> 00:23:03,197
Ugh! This sucks!

368
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:05,571
You will inhale for 10 minutes

369
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:07,882
and then exhale for 10 minutes.

370
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:10,196
The mask doesn't come off until then.

371
00:23:10,894 --> 00:23:11,744
Really?

372
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:14,463
Ohh! You guys are insane.

373
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:21,866
Seven days remain until the rings dissolve.

374
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:37,340
I'll be the roundabout

375
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:41,373
the words will make you out and out

376
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:46,454
I spend the day your way

377
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:52,892
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

378
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:55,450
in and around the lake

379
00:23:56,722 --> 00:24:00,733
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

380
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:07,612
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

381
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,667
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

382
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:15,407
with you

383
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:19,150
24 before my love you'll see

384
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:23,980
I'll be there with you

385
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:02,203
I'm afraid it's necessary for a final examination

386
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,133
the solution is finding more power.

387
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:06,355
Deep down, he's worth having as a friend.

388
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:08,135
Horrible. Unnatural!

389
00:25:08,254 --> 00:25:10,984
I just can't take it!
