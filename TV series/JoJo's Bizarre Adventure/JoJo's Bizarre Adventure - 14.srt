1
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:12,813
What the heck is this supposed to be?

2
00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:17,863
You think you're funny, putting black
ink all over my spaghetti, is that right?

3
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:19,709
N... n... no, sir, not at all.

4
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:21,671
This is called al nero di seppia.

5
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:25,467
It is a classic pasta dish made
with fresh squid ink, hence the color.

6
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:26,348
Really?

7
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:28,000
It's quite delicious.

8
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:28,611
Hmm.

9
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:30,811
Hmm.

10
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:40,672
Say, this is delicious!

11
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:41,434
Mmm.

12
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,112
Mm... mm... mm.

13
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:48,591
This hotel used to be a place of class and refinement.

14
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:50,737
Now they let just anyone in here.

15
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:55,973
Signorina, accept this, a token of your beauty.

16
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:57,371
It's beautiful.

17
00:00:57,897 --> 00:00:59,287
Not as much as you.

18
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:02,480
When you remove this at night, please think of me,

19
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:04,902
and we shall be together in your dreams.

20
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:06,261
Come on!

21
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:09,851
Did that mozzarella cheese‐ball
just say what I think he said?!

22
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:10,513
I didn't know eavesdropping could rot your teeth.

23
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,013
I shall cast an enchantment upon it,

24
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:14,905
just a little love spell,

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,385
and then you will have no
choice but to fall to my passion.

26
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:23,846
You've got to be kidding. This guy is making me sick.

27
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:29,199
And I shall spread my charm's magic
to those delicious lips of yours.

28
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,987
That's just ridiculous.

29
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:33,838
How could any modern woman fall for such an obvious act?

30
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,092
Disgusting.

31
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:37,137
I have an idea.

32
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:41,853
Hamon di seppia.

33
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,159
This should stick to that little
Casanova's enchanting face for a bit.

34
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,610
How... how did he just do that?

35
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,226
That... that was hamon.

36
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,196
Yes, I'm sure of it.

37
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,102
Your pardon the intrusion.

38
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:10,219
But there is a phone call from a
Mr. Speedwagon, Mr. Caesar Zeppeli.

39
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:12,729
Mamma Mia. I will be right there.

40
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:14,303
What? What the...

41
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:20,523
That spaghetti‐brained womanizer is the
Caesar Zeppeli we came all the way here to find?!

42
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:00,531
This is the Speedwagon foundation.

43
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:05,533
This complex was built 28 years ago with
funds from the ample Speedwagon fortune.

44
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:13,439
Here, all manners of science, medicine, archaeology,
and more are generously funded and exhaustively researched

45
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:15,805
for the benefit of all humankind.

46
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,172
But the foundation also houses a darker purpose...

47
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:24,448
One to unlock the secret of the stone masks.

48
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:26,680
The U. V. Lights are very powerful.

49
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:28,231
Please, if you don't mind.

50
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:31,947
Introduce the snake.

51
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,410
It was absorbed into the stone!

52
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:46,630
Santviento still isn't dead.

53
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:48,795
His body is defending itself somehow.

54
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:51,304
What if he finds some way to awaken in there?

55
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,448
This can't be.

56
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:54,404
We must find a way to destroy him.

57
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:56,501
The monster feeds on masked vampires.

58
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:59,773
He's immortal for all we know. What are we supposed to do?

59
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,936
Don't worry, Mr. Speedwagon. He can't do anything.

60
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,006
As long as he's under those U. V. Lights, he
will remain petrified and can pose no threat to us.

61
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:11,199
That's right.

62
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:13,901
Well, I suppose that's a relief.

63
00:05:13,926 --> 00:05:17,689
There is still more research to be
done if we are to understand him fully.

64
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:24,325
See those? These pictures were taken in
the cave where we originally found Santviento.

65
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,891
Inspect them carefully.

66
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:28,757
The horns.

67
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:31,124
They all have different types of horns.

68
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:35,549
So if the one on the bottom is supposed
to be Santviento, then who are the others?

69
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,586
According to Von Stroheim,

70
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:42,645
the Germans have uncovered another pillar at an
undisclosed location somewhere on the European continent.

71
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,981
Is that true?

72
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,924
Their faces are stacked vertically in this picture.

73
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:48,309
Speaking historically,

74
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:52,202
I would theorize that this indicates
status or rank among the three pillar men.

75
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:54,680
JoJo and I are headed to Rome.

76
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:59,439
Von Stroheim told him that we must go there
in order to find the person who can help us.

77
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,142
And it turns out that person...

78
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:06,757
Is none other than the grandson of Will A. Zeppeli,

79
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,219
Caesar Zeppeli.

80
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,897
Tell me, where might you be from?

81
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:14,686
Would you like me to take a picture?
Perhaps one of you in the fountain?

82
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:15,274
Huh?

83
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:21,489
Boy, the birds in this country sure are friendly.

84
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,593
They seem much smarter than the
men here, too. Don't you think?

85
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:26,839
Knock it off, JoJo.

86
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:30,607
We didn't come all this way for nothing.
The two of you better start talking.

87
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:35,326
Mr. Speedwagon, I'm sorry, but not a chance.

88
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,336
My grandfather died tragically 50 years ago.

89
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,334
My father then took up his torch
and spent his life hunting the mask.

90
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:49,528
We Italians have the strongest familial
bonds of any culture in the world.

91
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:52,324
We are very proud of that tradition.

92
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:54,010
It is everything to us.

93
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,735
That's something he'll never understand.

94
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,390
In fact, you told me he didn't know about
his own grandfather until just recently.

95
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:03,456
A true man knows his history.

96
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,650
Tell me this, true man. Is your whole family this dumb?

97
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,017
That's not fair, Caesar.

98
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:10,772
JoJo didn't know anything, because
I kept it all a secret from him.

99
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:15,500
I don't think that's any excuse.

100
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:20,283
I heard about Straizo, and I was impressed to
find out that he fought one of the pillar men.

101
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:24,517
But I wanted to see for myself how
tough he was, so I waited at the hotel.

102
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:29,722
And I'm disappointed to say that his
hamon skills leave much to be desired.

103
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:31,827
His hamon is weak.

104
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,019
It's worthless.

105
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:37,006
His defeat of the pillar man was nothing but blind luck!

106
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:40,901
I won't be forced to work with this imbecile!

107
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:44,641
Caesar, just relax for a moment.
JoJo is still training with...

108
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,463
We're done with the niceties here.

109
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:52,923
I'm going to have to settle this with a good thrashing.

110
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,380
Hamon as weak as yours couldn't pluck
the petals off this delicate flower.

111
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,540
Oh, yeah? Well, you couldn't
even beat one of those pigeons.

112
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:11,881
Are you gonna fight me or not?

113
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:16,981
If there's any mocking to be done here,
I'll take care of it, thank you kindly.

114
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:23,121
You... bastard.

115
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:25,727
You gave this woman a hamon kiss!

116
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:27,713
Like I just said,

117
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:31,048
your weak hamon couldn't even defeat a woman. Sad.

118
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:33,337
I must not intervene here.

119
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:35,476
This will be a good lesson for JoJo.

120
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:37,803
Overcoming this will only make him stronger.

121
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:45,967
What did I tell you?

122
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:51,923
My grandfather might still be alive if
your grandfather hadn't got in his way!

123
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:55,688
I refuse to accept your kind, your pathetic blood.

124
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,625
That's enough. You've crossed the line now.

125
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,484
Stop. I've got this.

126
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:05,647
Someone as arrogant as you just couldn't
resist insulting my entire family, could you?

127
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:10,007
Like to see my maneuver sure to eliminate the pillar men?

128
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:11,548
It's a clean technique.

129
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:17,623
Behold! My hamon bubble launcher.

130
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,743
It's important to keep oneself clean.

131
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,486
I, myself, have a thin layer of
soap on my clothes at all times.

132
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,888
You're looking a little dirty yourself there, Joestar!

133
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:30,444
Ohh!

134
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:43,985
Well, I am impressed that you're still conscious,

135
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,873
but your weak little hamon couldn't even pop a bubble.

136
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:51,218
Just look at you. Your breath
is already all over the place.

137
00:09:51,243 --> 00:09:53,306
Enjoy your stay, Joestar.

138
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:57,859
And next you'll say, "now I'll lift
my hamon spell, signorina. Thank you."

139
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,832
And now I'll lift my hamon spell, signorina. Thank you.

140
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,140
While that woman was throttling me,

141
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:19,125
I filled the pigeon with as much hamon
as I could and hid it away in her mouth.

142
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:19,792
Mm?

143
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,300
I knew you'd kiss her,

144
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:24,654
either because you had to withdraw
your hamon or just to show off.

145
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:27,063
So I was right.

146
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:29,882
Turns out that you couldn't even beat a pigeon.

147
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:34,822
What a day.

148
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:48,562
Honestly, just who does this jerk think he is?

149
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:51,621
Grandstanding like that just to sit down in a chair.

150
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:53,889
I really can't stand people like him.

151
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,712
If only I had a technique like his bubble launcher.

152
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,310
I'd be able to teach him some humility then.

153
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,418
I have to get stronger with my hamon,

154
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,411
but training is always such a hassle.

155
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:11,449
Hmm. Let's see how our little
friend handles a game of chance.

156
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:16,041
I saw that, JoJo. Deal the
cards right. Only cowards cheat.

157
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,996
Huh? Whatever do you...

158
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:22,341
Deal the cards properly, Joestar, or play elsewhere.

159
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:24,605
Fancy that.

160
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:27,133
Well, that didn't work.

161
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:29,603
Pathetic.

162
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:34,202
You should be ashamed that you have to
resort to cheating and gimmicks to beat me.

163
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,570
You really are serious about cleanliness.

164
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,097
This mirror is spotless.

165
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:39,766
Stop provoking me, Joestar!

166
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,434
Oh, I haven't even started!

167
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,538
Calm down!

168
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:44,898
It's been eight hours, Caesar.

169
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:47,312
Do you mind telling us what we're waiting for?

170
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,426
What are we waiting for?

171
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,096
Here's your answer.

172
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:01,930
What the hell is a German soldier doing here?

173
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:04,514
It looks like we're clear.

174
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,930
Just who do you think guards the pillar men?

175
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:10,526
He'll get us in there. Behave yourself.

176
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:12,981
Again with the Germans?

177
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:33,109
Germany and Italy have an alliance,

178
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:37,811
and the Germans are interested in
researching the nuances of my hamon, see?

179
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,983
You Englishmen are very lucky that you are
being granted access to view the pillar men.

180
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:48,347
No need to thank me. Your
appreciation's written on your face, JoJo.

181
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:49,477
Mr. Speedwagon...

182
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:49,962
Huh?

183
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:51,836
We have so many questions for you.

184
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:55,720
I hope that we can all work together
to stop the pillar men before they awake.

185
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:58,756
How is the beauty?

186
00:12:58,781 --> 00:12:59,057
Huh?

187
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:02,092
Now don't be embarrassed you have a girlfriend back home.

188
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,997
Well. She's...

189
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:09,503
uh, actually, the truth is I'll be going
home next week so we can finally get married.

190
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:10,386
Really?

191
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,230
Mamma Mia! Congratulations, Mark.

192
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:17,307
I was his wingman when he picked
her up, you know. He was so nervous.

193
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:18,521
Heartwarming.

194
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:20,485
Please don't get us all killed here.

195
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,894
And please stop cuddling with
the wheel, if you don't mind.

196
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,388
I wanted to ask you, JoJo,

197
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,723
do you have a girlfriend back home?

198
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:30,917
I'll take that as a no.

199
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,878
But you're such a great catch.

200
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:35,095
Why doesn't anyone want to date you?

201
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:38,719
Perhaps they're all too busy washing their hair, eh?

202
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:42,849
Where does this pompous ass
get off talking to me like that?

203
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:47,846
Once I develop my own killer technique,
I'll show him a thing or two or three.

204
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,704
Look! There's something on his head.

205
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,815
I don't think that was there before.

206
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:03,486
Calm down. They're just rocks as long
as they're under those U. V. Lights.

207
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:04,870
No need to worry.

208
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,436
Now get a closer look!

209
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:07,381
Yes, sir.

210
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:11,629
The death of Von Stroheim's team
is an important lesson to us all.

211
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:18,209
Once we cut this pillar out, we'll have to seal
it so that it will never see the light of day again.

212
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,890
I can't tell what that dark spot is. It
looks like a hole, but it might just be a shadow.

213
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:25,283
Get a closer look.

214
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:26,130
Eh?

215
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,365
D... do you hear that?

216
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:35,513
His horn!

217
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:37,674
He's supposed to be petrified!

218
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,471
He's waking up!

219
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,890
Quickly! Bring out more U. V. Lamps!

220
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:44,437
Yes, sir!

221
00:14:44,462 --> 00:14:45,313
Schnell!

222
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:55,339
This can't be happening!

223
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:58,713
He's blocking out the lights with the blood of my own men!

224
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:20,506
I see the world has undergone
significant changes during my slumber.

225
00:15:20,642 --> 00:15:24,024
These insignificant inventions must be quite popular here.

226
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:25,537
What'd he say?!

227
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:30,029
I said your pitiful illuminations
are no match against my power.

228
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:35,702
My hands!

229
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,951
We're stuck together!

230
00:15:58,929 --> 00:15:59,941
Wamuu!

231
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,824
Now is the time.

232
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:06,102
Awaken, my masters!

233
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:20,144
Somehow, this doesn't surprise me.

234
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:20,691
The famous mouth of truth

235
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:23,480
was a secret entrance all this time.

236
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:32,048
You can really feel the chill of the dead here.

237
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:36,177
Caesar, what sort of effects has your
hamon had on the sleeping pillar men?

238
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,641
Hamon is only useful on the living.

239
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,043
No reason to waste my powers on stone.

240
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,726
We can't learn anything if they're not alive.

241
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:44,138
Hmm.

242
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:49,390
I'm surprised you Germans don't have
more than, uh, zero guards down here.

243
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:51,736
It's a little quiet. Hello?!

244
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,687
Stop being foolish, JoJo.

245
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:55,753
Wait. Something's wrong.

246
00:16:55,778 --> 00:16:56,127
Hmm?

247
00:16:56,152 --> 00:16:58,773
He's right. There should be
guards posted all around this place.

248
00:16:58,798 --> 00:16:59,696
Huh? Really?

249
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:02,984
Yaah!

250
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,938
Why didn't anyone tell me there were bats in here?

251
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:08,194
Gross. I stepped in bat dung!

252
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:10,427
And I just cleaned these.

253
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,738
Wait. Those are...

254
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:19,922
They're husks of dead soldiers.

255
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,671
What... what the hell happened to them?

256
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,143
They're all dead!

257
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:28,281
Stop where you are! Whoever did this could still be here!

258
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:30,229
We don't know what's out there!

259
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:33,596
What... what is that?

260
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:35,948
I can't believe it. They're... they're alive!

261
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,213
Run away, Mark!

262
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:39,136
Get out of there now!

263
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,206
No!

264
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:51,947
Mark!

265
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:58,331
Mark, no.

266
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:00,952
Caesar. Caesar.

267
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:02,621
What have they done?!

268
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,800
They just walked right through
your friend like he wasn't even there.

269
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:11,471
The pillar men have awoken with such
massive power that we barely even exist to them.

270
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,913
We may as well be nothing more than
a colony of ants beneath their feet.

271
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,626
It appears to be night outside, Wamuu.

272
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,424
That is correct, lord Kars.

273
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:26,094
And what shall be your bidding?

274
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,027
Easy.

275
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:31,674
We will be searching for the
whereabouts of the Red Stone of AJA.

276
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:35,695
The stone is the last piece we
need in order to complete the mask.

277
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,372
Then we will unleash its power.

278
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:40,212
Of course, master Esidisi.

279
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:44,181
However, the human world has changed
much over the years that we slumbered.

280
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:48,517
Long ago, it was the Emperor
of Rome who possessed the stone.

281
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:52,173
Unfortunately, I am certain that age has ended.

282
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:57,033
Well, then, we simply need to find
where it is the stone currently calls home.

283
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,189
They say the emperor cherished the stone above all things.

284
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:05,002
I believe that the humans of
today still tell stories of it.

285
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,832
I shall retrieve the stone for you, my master.

286
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,341
There's time, Wamuu.

287
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:10,747
For the moment then,

288
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,204
let us go outside and observe the changes
that have occurred in the human world.

289
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:15,943
Hmm.

290
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,395
Wamuu!

291
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:32,373
Explain your insolence.

292
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:34,066
Stay your hand, Esidisi.

293
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:38,023
I apologize, lord Kars.

294
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:41,660
Of course. It had slipped my mind

295
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:47,149
that you possess a reflexive attack against anyone
who dares to walk across the depths of your shadow.

296
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:49,754
It has been 2,000 years, after all.

297
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:51,312
I have offended you, my lord.

298
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,416
I will accept whatever punishment you see fit.

299
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:57,913
I simply cannot accept your apology.

300
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:03,529
Your innate fighting spirit is what makes you
a great warrior, and that is why I trust you.

301
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,441
The fault is my own for treading upon your darkness.

302
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:09,354
Please forgive my transgression.

303
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,896
You are too kind.

304
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:14,920
Rise, Wamuu.

305
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:16,299
Yes, master.

306
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:19,892
Caesar!

307
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:23,759
Kill me, please. Do it. You've got to kill me now.

308
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:24,601
I can't.

309
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:29,240
It's... it's getting so cold. Please, Caesar.

310
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:31,624
I'm... I'm so scared.

311
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,746
I couldn't feel anything at first,

312
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:35,889
but now, the pain.

313
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:38,713
Please, Caesar, you've got to kill me now.

314
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,412
Mark.

315
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:42,271
There's nothing we can do.

316
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:45,510
I can't do anything to help this poor bastard.

317
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:47,290
I feel so powerless.

318
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,323
I must control myself.

319
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:51,777
I feel like I'm going to explode.

320
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,931
Goodbye, friend.

321
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,698
Caesar.

322
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,187
Give her my love, Caesar.

323
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:17,265
I promise.

324
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:23,913
He was so young, his whole life ahead of him.

325
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,226
He worked hard for a living.

326
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,505
He loved his family dearly.

327
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:31,556
He loved his girl and his country.

328
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:35,172
He was a good person, clean‐cut, the boy next door.

329
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,381
And they killed him.

330
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,038
Now they die!

331
00:21:40,251 --> 00:21:41,103
Caesar!

332
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:46,196
Don't you dare get in my way, JoJo.

333
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,396
I'm going to enjoy every second of this!

334
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:53,692
This is personal. I'll destroy these fiends myself!

335
00:22:11,222 --> 00:22:16,526
Along the drifting cloud the
eagle searching down on the land

336
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:23,713
Catching the swirling wind, the
sailor sees the rim of the land

337
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:30,800
The eagle's dancing wings create
as weather spins out of hand

338
00:22:46,688 --> 00:22:52,269
Go closer hold the land feel
partly no more than grains of sand

339
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:59,648
We stand to lose all time a
thousand answers by in our hand

340
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:06,734
Next to your deeper fears we
stand surrounded by a million years

341
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:10,604
I'll be the roundabout

342
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,513
The words will make you out and out

343
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:17,650
I'll be the roundabout

344
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:22,878
The words will make you out and out

345
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,402
Oh, I'm sick and tired of all this talking.

346
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:33,713
Explain yourself. What are you trying to get at?

347
00:23:33,738 --> 00:23:35,383
I knew he was spineless.

348
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:36,732
These humans know hamon.

349
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:39,253
I call that divine sandstorm.
