1
00:00:01,214 --> 00:00:03,292
With the help of Caesar's bandana,

2
00:00:03,397 --> 00:00:05,970
JoJo barely managed to defeat Wamuu.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:15,382
Then it was Kars's turn to face
Lisa Lisa in their one‐on‐one combat.

4
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:21,730
Suddenly Von Stroheim showed up to battle the vampires,

5
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,922
along with Speedwagon and Smokey.

6
00:00:26,172 --> 00:00:30,492
In a cowardly turn, Kars used
a double to deceive Lisa Lisa.

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,485
Then he literally stabbed her in
the back to use as a pawn against JoJo.

8
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:41,143
JoJo and Lisa Lisa are in the
greatest peril of their lives.

9
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:45,749
Kars, you bastard!

10
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:48,925
There's a place waiting for you in hell!

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,595
JoJo doesn't know.

12
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:53,216
He doesn't know the woman he's trying to save

13
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:54,855
is his mother.

14
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:12,833
You don't want to let go of that, JoJo.

15
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:17,655
It's a forest of crystal spikes
down there. She would die horribly.

16
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:19,617
Kars!

17
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:21,623
You have lived for far too long.

18
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:23,240
Your soul's decayed.

19
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:26,117
It's like a pumpkin left to rot out in a dead field.

20
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:27,816
Even flies avoid it.

21
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:29,420
Yes, grumble at me.

22
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:32,692
Shout your lungs out. Heave your insults at me,

23
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,160
for as long as you're holding on to that
rope, my friend, that's about all you can do.

24
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,635
JoJo! Lisa Lisa!

25
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:56,332
He can't follow what's really going on.

26
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,160
He doesn't realize that's his mother he's holding.

27
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,870
Mr. Speedwagon, we need to tell JoJo.

28
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:04,550
Not yet.

29
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:05,512
But why not?!

30
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,156
It's not the proper time.

31
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:09,624
Von Stroheim!

32
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:12,198
Have you finished disposing of those vampires yet?!

33
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:13,458
We must help JoJo.

34
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:14,638
Ja, right.

35
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:20,198
You think I just have to wave my
magic flashlight und then it's all done?!

36
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,508
Out of sight und out of mind!

37
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,767
Von Stroheim has got his hands full right now.

38
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,848
JoJo.

39
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,084
Careful now.

40
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:44,842
That rope looks like it's starting to slip a little.

41
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:49,173
Hmm?

42
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:55,718
As long as you're holding on so tightly to that rope,

43
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:58,379
your clumsy feet have limited reach.

44
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:06,632
Oh, no. His kick did make it
to Kars, but there was no hamon.

45
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:08,652
We're in real trouble.

46
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:12,893
You poor boy, it looks like you're running out of hamon.

47
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:15,626
But it is possible you might have enough left

48
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:18,377
to make one last‐ditch attack on me.

49
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:22,150
I'll walk up there,

50
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:28,773
and then I'm going to take your life as easily as if
I were plucking a little flower along a garden pathway.

51
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:33,235
Kars.

52
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,862
Mmm?

53
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:37,188
Maybe there is enough left in me,

54
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:40,198
enough hamon for one last desperate attack.

55
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,360
To be honest, even I don't know.

56
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:43,092
Hmm?

57
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,398
But either way, I've devised a cunning plan.

58
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:50,552
I guarantee it's something to make you choke.

59
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:53,397
How badly do you want to know what it is?

60
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:55,113
'Cause I'm not telling!

61
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:55,932
Hey.

62
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:59,720
I can see that you've stopped
tying those ropes together now.

63
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:01,046
Hmm?

64
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,732
You see this match?

65
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:05,496
What do you think I'm going to be doing with this fire?

66
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:06,241
Humph.

67
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:11,166
Huh? What on earth is JoJo thinking?

68
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:13,660
He set his scarf on fire.

69
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:17,789
Before this flame has a chance to burn me,

70
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:22,482
I'm going to find a way to use whatever
I can to send you straight to hell.

71
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,454
The scarf is a gamble,

72
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:26,394
something to motivate me,

73
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,460
a little pain to help me find a way.

74
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:32,026
JoJo, come on now.

75
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:33,686
You can't fool me.

76
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:37,372
That's just an act of desperation!

77
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,573
Don't toy with me.

78
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:49,058
You're just dodging around for
a chance to catch your breath.

79
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,903
It's no matter.

80
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:54,460
I'm taking your life at the moment of my choice,

81
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:57,177
I'm tired of dealing with your silly antics.

82
00:06:57,202 --> 00:06:59,466
Oh, come on. I need to breathe.

83
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,412
So what if I look silly doing it?

84
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:04,947
JoJo, look.

85
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:09,936
Clearly I can sever Lisa Lisa's
rope with just a flick of my wrist,

86
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,217
and if you dodge me again, that is exactly what I will do.

87
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,103
What do you think?

88
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:18,581
Should I press just a little harder?

89
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:23,093
It's so easy.

90
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,286
Is that what you want?

91
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:27,494
Don't do it!

92
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:29,187
You ran away before.

93
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:31,610
Now come toward me slowly.

94
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:35,304
Heh. Or you could stay where you are

95
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,551
and watch as I cut through the line.

96
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:39,988
The coward.

97
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:41,593
So, what then?

98
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:46,487
Is your life more precious than
that of the woman dangling down there?

99
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:50,028
Hah!

100
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:54,650
Here's my choice!

101
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:58,407
I don't know what you think you're
doing, but when I cut this line,

102
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:01,758
you will both be impaled on the crystal spikes below.

103
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,045
You fool!

104
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,192
JoJo!

105
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,256
Lisa Lisa!

106
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:08,154
Heh. Idiot.

107
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:09,914
Two birds with one cut.

108
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:11,348
Huh?

109
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:12,930
What?!

110
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,526
But he...

111
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:17,840
This rope, it's connected to JoJo.

112
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:22,416
When did he make this happen?

113
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,205
He didn't have enough time to...

114
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:26,048
Oh.

115
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:28,639
When he first kicked at me,

116
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,649
he allowed himself to be cut along with the rope.

117
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:35,342
And then when he ignited that damned match,

118
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,520
he secretly tied his leg to the rope on Lisa Lisa.

119
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:39,967
I see it now.

120
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,294
He needed some kind of distraction.

121
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:46,242
That's when he set his scarf on fire.

122
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:54,377
And then to tie the lines together, he maneuvered me
into doing his work for him by cutting Lisa Lisa's rope.

123
00:08:58,143 --> 00:08:59,938
That manipulating cheat.

124
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:04,109
Now you're the one saving both me and Lisa Lisa.

125
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:08,277
You deceived me, JoJo!

126
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:11,709
How odd that I should hear you complaining about trickery.

127
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:16,230
You enjoy deceiving others, but
now the shoe's on the other foot.

128
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:19,231
You may have lived for over 10,000 years,

129
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,017
but if you're going up against
my skills, you need another decade!

130
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:26,296
You're through!

131
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:37,088
Hamon Overdrive!

132
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:42,413
Did it work?

133
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,894
That was the last of my hamon.

134
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:47,269
I'm burned out.

135
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:51,121
I don't have an ounce of strength left.

136
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,042
Yes. It was enough.

137
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:00,852
Oh, yes!

138
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:01,758
He did it.

139
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:03,831
He hit Kars with his hamon.

140
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,262
Off you go.

141
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:28,810
I'll get you.

142
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:39,577
Ohh! Look at that.

143
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:42,869
Kars fell right onto his own crystal spikes.

144
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:49,533
Bwa ha ha ha!

145
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:51,467
The pillar man is done!

146
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:56,136
See?! The hamon will travel
right up his arm und do the job!

147
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,494
You're weak! Your time on earth is up!

148
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,934
A mere human could finish you off now!

149
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:24,015
Ohh. Trying to spook us, eh?

150
00:11:24,342 --> 00:11:27,883
Now let's eliminate him forever.

151
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,656
Bring out the ultraviolet amplifier.

152
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:31,592
Jawohl!

153
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:38,733
Lisa Lisa.

154
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:47,769
Kars said that he wasn't actually
planning to kill you with his blade,

155
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:51,129
so I don't think that your wounds are fatal.

156
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,558
We need to get you taken care of quickly,

157
00:11:57,146 --> 00:12:00,188
but I don't think this is the day you're going to die.

158
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:04,439
It's finally done.

159
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:07,045
Looks like it, and I'm glad.

160
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,510
Say, Mr. Speedwagon, um...

161
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:10,860
Huh?

162
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,067
Can I please ask you something?

163
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:13,909
Of course.

164
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,953
Well, why did granny Erina lie to JoJo?

165
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:20,512
Why'd she tell him that his mother
had died when he was little boy?

166
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:25,326
Why does Lisa Lisa hide her past
and not tell him who she really is?

167
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,763
Smokey, that's, uh...

168
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,600
I know granny Erina told me not to ask you,

169
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,674
but I've gotta figure this out.

170
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,713
I mean, she is his mother.

171
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:37,194
Keeping that information from him is just awful.

172
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,956
Smokey.

173
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,221
JoJo and granny Erina,

174
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,663
they're my friends.

175
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:46,179
Back in New York, they both saved me.

176
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:50,601
I was just a lowly pickpocket,
but they helped me out anyway.

177
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,628
That's the reason I'm here.

178
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:55,130
I'm going to do anything I can to help.

179
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:05,413
All right then, Smokey.

180
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:07,675
Let me tell you.

181
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,987
In New York, you proved what a good friend you were.

182
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,783
You took excellent care of Erina while I was gone.

183
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:17,772
But this, you can never reveal to JoJo.

184
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:21,482
This is the business of the Joestar family.

185
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:25,004
Friends or not, we don't have the right to talk about it.

186
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:34,766
The name Lisa Lisa is made up, an alias.

187
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:37,862
Her real given name is Elizabeth.

188
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:41,993
Raised and trained by the hamon‐user Straizo you met...

189
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:45,538
She and Erina's son,

190
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:47,498
George Joestar, fell in love.

191
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:48,972
They got married.

192
00:13:56,979 --> 00:14:00,066
Soon George and Elizabeth had a son.

193
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:02,283
You know him as JoJo.

194
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:12,680
JoJo's father, George, enlisted as a
member of britain’s royal flying corps.

195
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,487
Aviation developed rapidly during the first world war,

196
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:22,707
and George was among the brave
pilots to fly into battle in the skies.

197
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:32,123
He stood out as a hero, even among
the members of the royal flying corps.

198
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,847
It was then...

199
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,242
That a gut‐wrenching horror from the past came
back to haunt the members of the Joestar family.

200
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,224
50 years earlier,

201
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:47,225
Dio Brando created bloodsucking zombies.

202
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:52,294
Straizo, myself, and the others
believed that we had exterminated them.

203
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,040
But one of them had escaped.

204
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,600
He hid himself within society

205
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,867
and lived for decades undiscovered.

206
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:05,567
He was cunning, intelligent, supremely dangerous.

207
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:09,934
He created no spawn.

208
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,358
He devoured the bones and hair of his victims,

209
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:16,319
leaving behind no evidence of his existence.

210
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:27,945
And by some wretched, wicked twist of fate...

211
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:35,583
He had placed himself in position as
a commander in the royal flying corps.

212
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:38,770
The royal flying corps? With JoJo's father?

213
00:15:39,086 --> 00:15:40,399
The very same.

214
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:44,277
George was observant and figured this out.

215
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:47,628
He had listened well to Straizo and myself.

216
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:51,674
But ultimately, George was only an ordinary man.

217
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:54,270
He had character and talent,

218
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,027
but he had no training in the ways of hamon.

219
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:02,317
Before he was able to unmask the commander,

220
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:05,294
he was discovered by his monstrous quarry.

221
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:08,634
His message to Straizo was too late.

222
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:19,615
George's death was covered up as
an unfortunate nighttime plane crash.

223
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:24,891
Straizo and I found this suspicious,

224
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:28,853
so we investigated and eventually learned the truth.

225
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:35,082
That night, Elizabeth held an infant JoJo

226
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,529
as I told her what we had discovered.

227
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:43,716
Instead of showing grief,

228
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:48,155
she ran out intent on bloody revenge.

229
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:01,998
She was a genius with hamon,

230
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:04,912
but she let her emotions consume her.

231
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:07,859
She was careless.

232
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:10,417
There was a witness to the commander's death.

233
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,068
The military knew nothing about zombies or hamon.

234
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,578
They concluded that for some unknown reason,

235
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:24,486
Elizabeth had attacked their beloved commander,

236
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:28,210
killed him, then burned his body to hide the crime.

237
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:31,755
Word spread as only bad news can,

238
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:37,442
and soon she was known around the world
as a murderer and traitor to the war effort.

239
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:58,352
We used all the resources of the
Speedwagon foundation to cover her trail.

240
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,830
Elizabeth had to leave England behind

241
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:05,103
without even a word of goodbye to her son.

242
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:10,528
Erina knew what had occurred,

243
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,848
and she gave me this specific request.

244
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:17,560
When the child grows up and asks about his parents,

245
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:21,746
please tell him they both died in the war.

246
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:27,621
This child,

247
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:30,749
poor little child.

248
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:38,700
And so it was that Elizabeth became Lisa Lisa.

249
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:45,840
Why?

250
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,229
Why is it that way?

251
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:52,613
At least let him know his mother's not dead somewhere!

252
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:54,829
I know painfully well why.

253
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:59,580
Erina lost her husband and her son

254
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:02,682
in the battle between hamon and the stone masks.

255
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:05,001
But thinking of her grandson,

256
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,962
her Joseph, her JoJo,

257
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,848
she didn't want hamon to create
yet another hole in her life!

258
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:13,946
Lisa Lisa feels the same.

259
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:21,836
What tragedy for this family.

260
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:25,259
Such a miserable fortune.

261
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:28,421
But now...

262
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:31,154
It's better.

263
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:37,298
JoJo used hamon positively to save his mother's life.

264
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:44,024
Mr. Speedwagon.

265
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:44,897
Hmm?

266
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:48,923
There's no reason for Lisa Lisa to
hide the truth from JoJo any longer.

267
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:49,489
Eh?

268
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:51,866
He already knows about hamon,

269
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:54,233
and he used it to save his mother's life.

270
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,709
That's true.

271
00:19:57,457 --> 00:20:00,348
But still it's not my decision to make.

272
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,097
It's a question of how Erina and Lisa Lisa feel.

273
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:05,581
I guess.

274
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:06,406
Major!

275
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:09,185
We're ready to fire, sir.

276
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:10,735
Excellent.

277
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:12,729
Everyone focus on him.

278
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:16,724
Und now we will share the honor of executing Kars.

279
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:17,557
Jawohl!

280
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:26,089
Now, Kars, die!

281
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:31,371
I can't begin to tell you how good
it feels to give this order myself!

282
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,629
Von Stroheim, you must stop!

283
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:55,621
He's got the red stone attached right there on his mask!

284
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,344
U.V. light will help him!

285
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:58,719
No, damn it.

286
00:20:58,744 --> 00:21:00,010
Stop now!

287
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:03,678
Don't fire the U. V. Amplifier!

288
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:05,998
This can't be!

289
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,628
I didn't see him with the mask.

290
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:33,472
I didn't know that he had it anywhere near him.

291
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:36,498
I didn't see him put in the red stone.

292
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:38,056
No, it can't be.

293
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,287
Dear god.

294
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:41,566
Kars.

295
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:08,325
I'll be the roundabout

296
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:12,277
the words will make you out and out

297
00:22:12,326 --> 00:22:17,516
you spend the day your way

298
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:23,801
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

299
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:26,126
in and around the lake

300
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:31,458
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

301
00:22:34,456 --> 00:22:38,134
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

302
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:44,465
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

303
00:22:47,105 --> 00:22:49,828
24 before my love you'll see

304
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:54,091
I'll be there with you

305
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:30,248
He has become the ubermensch.

306
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:32,886
He has complete mastery over organic life.

307
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,254
Is there really no way to stop him, Mr. Speedwagon?

308
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,295
Kars the pillar man is no more.

309
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,939
He's become Kars, the ultimate creation!
