1
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:06,590
Long ago, an already extraordinary
man wished for further power.

2
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:11,577
This man could soar like a bird, swim like a fish,

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,891
breathe like a tree, and move like a winding stream.

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,808
But sunlight spelled his doom,

5
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:21,754
so he created a stone mask.

6
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:27,016
One day, he would face the sun without fear,

7
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:31,067
and then the world would be his.

8
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:31,758
Hmm.

9
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:36,645
Where'd he go?

10
00:00:37,624 --> 00:00:40,322
Please tell me Kars fell into the lava.

11
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:47,337
I'm... still alive.

12
00:00:47,362 --> 00:00:48,200
All right.

13
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:53,509
Must create armor...

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,359
Something like a clam...

15
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:57,671
Or a crab...

16
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:59,466
A bony shell.

17
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:04,517
Yes. Make me impervious.

18
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,313
It's not enough!

19
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,141
You dummy, that's lava!

20
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:18,444
It's a thousand degrees in there!

21
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,422
Now burn to a crisp, you cocky bastard!

22
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,078
Ouch.

23
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,256
Yes. That did it.

24
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:41,425
Finally.

25
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,649
Kars was the last of them.

26
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:45,984
The pillar men are defeated!

27
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:01,897
The shock of his demise triggered an eruption.

28
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,996
Let's get to safety before we celebrate further.

29
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:06,006
Good call.

30
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:07,595
Hang on tight, all right?

31
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:18,525
Guhh!

32
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:53,127
Music to my ears.

33
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:55,947
You perform that aria perfectly.

34
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:59,297
I've so longed to hear you sing it, JoJo.

35
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:03,978
Kars, you're alive.

36
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:07,172
A bit of his shell.

37
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:14,951
Inorganic. But of course.

38
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:21,145
Kars first covered himself in a
substance not unlike a crab shell.

39
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,522
However, it was still organic.

40
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,232
It wasn't up to the task.

41
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,834
Faced with the heat of the lava, it burned away instantly.

42
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,507
Luckily for Kars,

43
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:35,644
he had the idea to create a second layer of armor

44
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:38,688
made of an unlikely substance,

45
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,366
mere air bubbles.

46
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,872
The bubbles maintained a pocket of air
between Kars's body and the lethal heat.

47
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:49,977
As the outer layer burned away with each passing second,

48
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:52,607
more bubbles worked their way outward to replace them,

49
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:54,743
maintaining a perfect equilibrium.

50
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:58,279
Kars had the moments he needed to escape.

51
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,942
The earth gave birth to life,

52
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:05,809
but now, horror of horrors,

53
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,986
Kars, a creature of the earth,

54
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:10,353
has conquered the planet itself.

55
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:17,702
Eons ago, long before man first
thought to chronicle his deeds,

56
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,721
a group of creatures, like us, but not,

57
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:23,089
evolved alongside humanity.

58
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:28,927
The sun was lethal to them, so they lived
out their lives under the cool glow of the moon

59
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:31,843
and in their subterranean cities.

60
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,777
Even without the sun's sustaining rays,

61
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:38,676
they endured far longer than their human rivals

62
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,179
by feeding on other living things.

63
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,962
To humans that knew of their existence,

64
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:46,416
they were revered as gods or demons.

65
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:48,808
Their numbers were small,

66
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,035
as few died and children were rare.

67
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:54,559
In all things, they maintained a vital balance.

68
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:58,372
They knew no strife and lived in peace with one another.

69
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:00,550
But then...

70
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:05,340
A man of great pride and ambition was born among them.

71
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:10,519
Strength is hidden within this body,

72
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,906
talents we can naught but dream of.

73
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:16,449
I shall be the one to unlock them.

74
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:20,596
To that end, he created a stone mask.

75
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:24,791
The mask granted him unheralded power,

76
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:27,554
but at a terrible, ravenous cost.

77
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:32,047
To survive, he had to consume life at a dizzying rate.

78
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:33,418
If left unchecked,

79
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,237
he would eventually devour every living thing on earth.

80
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,303
His brethren began to fear the mask,

81
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:42,060
as well as the gifted soul who created it.

82
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,260
Hmm?

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,523
His very existence is a threat!

84
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,724
There is no place for one such as him in this world.

85
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,351
Ahh! We have to wipe out his evil.

86
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:53,127
Look at you fools.

87
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,674
Don't you want to have dominion over the sun?

88
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:59,147
To stand in ascendance over all life?

89
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:03,222
To purge your fears and reign forever as gods?

90
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:09,441
If not, then die.

91
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:20,394
The iconoclast brazenly slaughtered his brethren,

92
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:23,505
even killing the parents who had given him life.

93
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:28,645
He and his sole ally took the two surviving infants

94
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,759
and left the scene of the carnage.

95
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:33,349
They set off in search of ultimate power,

96
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:36,216
a journey of continents and centuries alike.

97
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,804
And now, ten thousand years later,

98
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:41,757
that power was in his hands at last.

99
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,950
He's a god.

100
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:48,447
This tyrant has become a deity,

101
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:53,133
and against such a foe, there is nothing that we can do.

102
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:55,968
We must submit or perish!

103
00:06:58,915 --> 00:06:59,709
Hmm?

104
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,522
Hear that?

105
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,485
I think JoJo is trying to tell me something.

106
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,504
Hamon Overdrive!

107
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,425
What? Hamon?

108
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,468
Did you say, "Hamon Overdrive"?!

109
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:23,639
JoJo!

110
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,471
No. How?

111
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:32,449
My leg, it's melting away.

112
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,435
This is impossible!

113
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:37,057
Melting? You don't mean to say...

114
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,317
It can't be!

115
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:41,267
Denial will get you nowhere, my friend.

116
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:42,833
Hamon did that.

117
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:45,789
I conquered the sun itself.

118
00:07:45,878 --> 00:07:49,625
What makes you think that something
like hamon was somehow beyond my reach?

119
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,776
Huh? I just...

120
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:53,548
Not only is hamon at my disposal,

121
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:57,091
but it seems that mine is hundreds of times more potent.

122
00:07:57,116 --> 00:08:00,214
Mein gott. That much stronger than JoJo's?

123
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,933
It's as though he brushed his knee against the sun.

124
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:09,151
His flesh is liquefying und
vaporizing before his very eyes.

125
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:13,251
I wonder, how do you like the taste of your own medicine?

126
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,573
Hmm. A very articulate reply.

127
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:23,262
I suppose it's time to put you out of your misery.

128
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:24,637
JoJo!

129
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:30,212
This is it. I'm going to die here.

130
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,380
This is the end.

131
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:35,606
JoJo accepted his impending demise calmly.

132
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,518
He felt no fear, no pain, no regret at his plight.

133
00:08:40,682 --> 00:08:43,226
"I did all I could," he told himself.

134
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:47,449
As the epitome of evil loomed over JoJo in triumph,

135
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:50,502
he watched his dying self with perfect clarity.

136
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:53,829
Stroheim felt much the same.

137
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:57,626
Unable to move, he knew what snake prey fells like

138
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,224
as it stares into oblivion's maw.

139
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,994
The power in a breath.

140
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:13,897
To think I will annihilate a practitioner
of hamon with his own discipline.

141
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:21,390
Surely you can appreciate the irony in that.

142
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:24,791
Ha... mon...

143
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,342
Stronger than mine has ever been.

144
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:34,440
Let me be the first to welcome you into oblivion!

145
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:36,542
Wait. Hamon.

146
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,612
What the...

147
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:46,199
The red stone!

148
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,669
What the...

149
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,405
The red stone!

150
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,675
The Red Stone of AJA.

151
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,954
But why did JoJo brandish it at Kars in
that final moment? Even he had no idea.

152
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:08,473
As if by instinct,

153
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:12,254
he'd lunged the stone towards the
approaching hamon to which it gravitated.

154
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:18,768
Now in a moment devoid of hope,

155
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:22,549
JoJo's body did the one thing that could save his life.

156
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:24,956
Having survived Kar's coup de grace,

157
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,468
his will to live sprang into action.

158
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:31,843
Yes. The red stone amplifies hamon.

159
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,315
Huh?

160
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,372
Fueled by the magnified blast of hamon,

161
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:41,175
the volcano's fury reaches the breaking point.

162
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:42,948
It erupts!

163
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,353
What? They blasted into the sky!

164
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,829
The force, it's strong,

165
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,696
like nothing I've ever known.

166
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:12,157
Do you really think a little eruption
will be enough to conquer the likes of me?!

167
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:15,703
I'll just fly my way to safety.

168
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:20,334
Enjoy the fruits of your folly, JoJo.

169
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:24,370
Who's laughing now, huh?

170
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:29,176
Let me guess.

171
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:33,538
You're gonna say, "Did you plan this, too, JoJo? Tell me."

172
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,643
How do you always know?

173
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:40,356
For a moment, Kars was distracted
by JoJo's arm and his cocky attitude.

174
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,406
That moment was all it took.

175
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,981
Scalding rocks he didn't see coming
launched him even higher into the stratosphere.

176
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:52,335
Did you plan this, too, JoJo!

177
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,394
Tell me!

178
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:55,100
Why are you even asking?!

179
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,043
I set the trap, and you walked right into it!

180
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:01,197
All of this went down like clockwork.

181
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:09,030
I just got lucky, but thinking I
outsmarted him will drive Kars nuts.

182
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:14,885
At that moment, the rocks launched by the
volcano's eruption reached escape velocity.

183
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:17,546
Kars was the perfect being.

184
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:19,422
Nothing on earth could kill him,

185
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,454
but just then...

186
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:24,979
He was blasted into the vacuum of space.

187
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,702
No! Damn you!

188
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:37,603
It's over.

189
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:41,603
Granny and Stroheim,

190
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,591
old Speedwagon, Smokey...

191
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:49,559
And Lisa Lisa.

192
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:53,411
Everyone, goodbye.

193
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,767
No.

194
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,415
JoJo!

195
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:09,823
Von Stroheim made it back to the others eight
hours later, whereupon he told them the sad news.

196
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:22,233
No!

197
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:24,686
The earth! No!

198
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:25,918
Don't panic.

199
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:27,332
Just find the earth.

200
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:33,814
I'll use air to change my trajectory.

201
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,706
Once I'm back on solid ground, I will tear that boy apart.

202
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,573
No! It's not working!

203
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,623
I'm freezing.

204
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:05,333
The air is freezing around me.

205
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:09,234
The moment it comes out of the jets, it turns to ice.

206
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,956
I can't change my path.

207
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:18,403
I can't move.

208
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,703
So ended Kars,

209
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:28,304
last and greatest of the pillar men.

210
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:31,588
His body turned hard as rock,

211
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:34,494
and he floated through space for the rest of time,

212
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:36,479
never to return.

213
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:38,544
He wished for death,

214
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,196
but there was nothing out there to kill him.

215
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,506
The spark of thought within him went dim and then silent.

216
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:00,449
We commend his soul unto the heavenly father.

217
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:03,722
Though his life on earth has ended far too soon,

218
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,660
he lives in grace with you.

219
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:09,720
Comfort those he leaves behind, o god,

220
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:12,087
and let them know your peace.

221
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:25,869
Goodbye, JoJo.

222
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,346
I didn't know you for too long.

223
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,825
Couldn't have been more than six months.

224
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:34,789
Don't matter.

225
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,471
Even though you're gone,

226
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,566
I'm your friend...

227
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:40,320
Forever.

228
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:48,669
Come, Erina. It won't do to catch cold.

229
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,783
Let's get you home.

230
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:53,151
Just a bit longer.

231
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:59,243
Guess who.

232
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,231
What gives, fellas?

233
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:05,200
I finally make it to New York,

234
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,520
and nobody was there to pick me up.

235
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:10,515
Then I got word you were all at a funeral,

236
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,366
so I decided to crash it.

237
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:14,385
Hey, Lisa Lisa.

238
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,159
Guess you healed up pretty well, huh?

239
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,650
Meshina, good to see you, too.

240
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,145
New hand works well,

241
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,818
though I've been meaning to ask Stroheim if he can
jazz it up with a few gadgets or tools or whatnot.

242
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:28,876
I guess that's right out, with us fighting Germany.

243
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:32,312
Hey, now. You leave these mourners alone.

244
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:34,875
This is a funeral. Show some respect, you oaf.

245
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,734
Oh, so I'm an oaf, am I?

246
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,975
You need a lesson in manners, and I'm glad to oblige.

247
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,085
All right. Calm down. Let's not be hasty.

248
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,320
But how?

249
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:46,854
No way.

250
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,771
Hey, I'm talking to you, big guy. You'd better...

251
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,191
Back off, man!

252
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:54,029
I'm just trying to catch up with my family and friends.

253
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,116
JoJo!

254
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:58,810
You're telling me JoJo's alive?!

255
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,859
Huh? Yeah, of course.

256
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:02,665
Wait. What's this about?

257
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,849
You're all staring as though you've seen a ghost.

258
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:06,342
I know it's a funeral and a...

259
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:07,152
Huh?

260
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:09,784
What the?!

261
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,651
What's my name doing on there? I'm alive and well!

262
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:14,596
Wait. This funeral was for me?

263
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:15,549
JoJo!

264
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:18,213
You're still recovering, you big silly.

265
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:20,396
Don't run off in the rain like that.

266
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,196
Here. Take this.

267
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:29,446
Hey, that girl is Suzie Q,

268
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:31,829
and that... that ring looks like a...

269
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:35,412
Are you telling me you don't know that we got married?

270
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:37,406
You got married?

271
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:40,759
Isn't it crazy? Just think about it.

272
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:44,899
I'm officially Mrs. Joseph Joestar. Goodness.

273
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,053
It makes me blush.

274
00:17:49,928 --> 00:17:51,754
Wait a second here.

275
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:56,243
Suzie Q, something about this doesn't
feel right, and I wanna know what.

276
00:17:57,071 --> 00:18:00,763
The rock I was on fell into
the ocean, and me along with it.

277
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,431
A fishing boat picked me up.

278
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,201
So far, so good.

279
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:07,110
You nursed me back to health in Venice for two weeks,

280
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:08,816
and we tied the knot.

281
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:10,899
So why did they all think I was dead?

282
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:15,373
You never sent that telegram like I asked, did you?!

283
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,580
Uh,

284
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:18,768
I don't really know.

285
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:20,801
To me, that sounds like no!

286
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:22,912
Uh...

287
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:28,234
Now, now. Let's not get all clicky‐fingers.

288
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:32,191
I never sent it! I'm sorry, JoJo!

289
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,844
Suzie Q, what the hell?!

290
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:37,393
You had one job, woman, one job!

291
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:41,826
JoJo came back to us all!

292
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:44,558
Stop it! I said I was sorry!

293
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,925
Sorry?! They thought I was dead!

294
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:49,801
JoJo.

295
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,034
Soon after, Lisa Lisa, A. K. A. Elizabeth Joestar,

296
00:18:54,243 --> 00:18:56,574
told JoJo that she was his mother.

297
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:58,863
They moved to America.

298
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:02,566
In 1948, she found love again

299
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,790
and married a Hollywood screenwriter.

300
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:11,335
Erina Joestar continued her work as a teacher.

301
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,175
In 1950, she died peacefully at the age of 81,

302
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,091
surrounded by family and friends who loved her.

303
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:27,996
Robert E. O. Speedwagon continued to
pour his energy into philanthropic research,

304
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:31,554
helping to further science and medicine in countless ways.

305
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:36,091
He died in 1952 of a heart attack at 89 years of age.

306
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:39,507
A lifelong bachelor, he left no family behind.

307
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:45,314
Smokey Brown went on to work his way
through college, majoring in political science.

308
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:51,655
Later, he became the first black mayor
of a city in his home state of Georgia.

309
00:19:53,228 --> 00:19:57,001
Major Rudol Von Stroheim would never see JoJo again.

310
00:19:57,224 --> 00:20:00,760
He died in 1943 at the battle of Stalingrad,

311
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:04,549
a fearsome example of the German
science he'd always championed.

312
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:07,218
Our technology is the greatest!

313
00:20:14,728 --> 00:20:17,783
And so the years flowed by...

314
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,594
To a new generation.

315
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,989
And as for JoJo...

316
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:29,423
Oh. Right in the leg, huh? Sorry about that.

317
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:31,203
You should watch where you're going.

318
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:33,252
You wouldn't want a broken bone at your age.

319
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:35,611
You're right. How careless of me.

320
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:38,288
I guess this is a case of live and learn.

321
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:40,433
Hmm? Hey, wait a sec.

322
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,379
You're Japanese, aren't you?

323
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:43,975
I am. Why do you ask?

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,645
In that case, watch your damn bag!

325
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:48,861
Yow!

326
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:56,964
Alitalia flight 285 for Tokyo
is now boarding out of gate c‐17.

327
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:02,637
My only daughter has been married
to a Japanese man for over 20 years,

328
00:21:02,788 --> 00:21:06,694
fell in love on the other side of
the world, and never came home again.

329
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:09,934
