1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:03,672
Caesar was the son of Mario Zeppeli,

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,877
considered the best furniture maker in all of Naples.

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:09,763
Mario was a proper Italian man of his day,

4
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,703
thoroughly dedicated to his family.

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,688
To Caesar, he was the ideal man.

6
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:17,704
When Caesar was 10,

7
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,756
Mario suddenly left without so much as a word.

8
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:24,071
Having lost their mother years before, they were alone.

9
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:26,769
Distant relatives stole what little they had.

10
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,301
Caesar became a delinquent,

11
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:32,446
growing to hate his father and what he had done to them.

12
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:37,695
I bet he's living carefree with some hot young woman!

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,975
I'll gonna find him and then kill him!

14
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,570
He threw away his youth and his future.

15
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:49,170
He committed theft, arson, assault,
anything short of outright murder.

16
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,089
Even the local mafiosos feared him.

17
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,017
Hey, you're that guy named Caesar, aren't you?

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,366
So what's your last name?

19
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:57,874
I don't have one.

20
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:01,279
Well, that means there's no way you're italiano.

21
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:04,081
Italianos are proud of their family names.

22
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:08,677
Never holding back, he often
started fights by using a wrench

23
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,501
to suddenly bash his opponent's head,

24
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,986
before calmly finishing them off.

25
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,659
Though he didn't know it yet,

26
00:01:16,962 --> 00:01:19,124
he was already beginning to use hamon.

27
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,371
Then, at age 16 in Rome...

28
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:29,456
There's no mistake. It's really him.

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,226
At that moment,

30
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:33,948
Caesar felt he might murder his own father.

31
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:36,598
But then...

32
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:39,252
W‐what is all that?

33
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:41,209
Huh?

34
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:45,344
That's a massive diamond.

35
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:49,184
No! Boy, don't touch that stone!

36
00:01:49,802 --> 00:01:50,520
It's you!

37
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:55,197
W‐what the hell is the wall doing?

38
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:00,560
Stay back.

39
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:02,237
This is all a trap.

40
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:07,672
Events had occurred 50 years ago
that were completely unknown to Caesar.

41
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,764
His grandfather will had died
tragically while on an expedition.

42
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:16,074
Mario took up his father's torch
and trained with hamon to prepare,

43
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:18,281
discovering the ruins soon after.

44
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:22,868
He began a worldwide search for
a way to defeat the monsters within,

45
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:24,992
and unlock the treasure they hide,

46
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:27,145
but Caesar knew none of this.

47
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,860
Young man, I beg from you a favor.

48
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,340
Make your way to venice, and speak
with a woman named Lisa Lisa.

49
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:36,015
It's a matter of life and death.

50
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,213
She is the only one who has any chance of stopping them.

51
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:42,468
Perhaps because so many years had passed

52
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:46,208
and Caesar had grown, Mario did not recognize his son.

53
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:47,216
Fa...

54
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:51,209
Caesar's father hadn't abandoned
his family for selfish reasons.

55
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:55,563
He'd left in order to keep his children
safe from the nightmare of the pillar men.

56
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:05,070
Father!

57
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:51,211
I see.

58
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:54,369
Caesar's misunderstanding

59
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:57,878
led to a deep hatred, but then that changed.

60
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,108
It became pride in his father and his family.

61
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:03,482
So Caesar sought me out

62
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:06,400
and picked up where his father had left off.

63
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,722
He's going, because he needs to avenge his father.

64
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:13,027
Forgive me, Caesar.

65
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:16,364
I didn't mean to speak ill of your brave family.

66
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,712
If you still want to
go charging in there

67
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,270
even though you know damn well
it's going to be a trap,

68
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:26,652
then you must have figured out
some way to beat Kars.

69
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,097
Changed my mind.

70
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,923
Since you're going in that derelict hellhole,

71
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:34,032
then I'm right behind you, Caesar Zeppeli.

72
00:05:36,313 --> 00:05:38,734
A set of footprints leads into the mansion.

73
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:47,922
Who was that?

74
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:50,463
I swear I saw someone there.

75
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:51,967
Am I hallucinating?

76
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:53,999
There it is!

77
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:55,221
It's not an illusion!

78
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:57,410
What the hell is that?!

79
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:00,007
Caesar!

80
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:05,573
He vanished.

81
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:08,036
But I know he's here, close.

82
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,381
He's within a few steps of me.

83
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:12,907
Does Kars have some kind of new trick?

84
00:06:13,264 --> 00:06:15,951
No, the sun is shining too strong for him.

85
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,945
He can't be out here and survive.

86
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:19,853
The cat stance,

87
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,914
a fundamental element of kung fu.

88
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:24,121
Caesar has never heard of kung fu,

89
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:27,855
but instinctively balances his stance
as he relaxes his limbs,

90
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:30,008
ready for attack from any direction.

91
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,648
For him, it is not a technique, but a reflex.

92
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,220
Caesar.

93
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:37,148
What do you think you're doing?

94
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,624
Going in there all alone is madness.

95
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:41,316
Just stay back, instructor!

96
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:44,629
I can't move at all, let alone go rushing in.

97
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,906
Something is hiding just inside
the entrance of the building.

98
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:50,526
What do you mean? I can't see a thing in there.

99
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:51,912
Huh?

100
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:54,467
A...a single footprint just appeared.

101
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:55,465
He must have jumped.

102
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,648
He's coming at us from above! There!

103
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:01,091
What the...

104
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03,171
Wamuu!

105
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:12,466
Instructor, no!

106
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,780
What the hell is this?

107
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:18,119
That guy was Wamuu.

108
00:07:18,243 --> 00:07:20,759
Are he and Kars inside that mansion together?

109
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:24,876
But wait a minute. How can Wamuu
come outside during the day?

110
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,681
He did look kind of ghostlike.

111
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:36,226
Where is he,

112
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,889
that infuriating smart‐talking upstart?

113
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:42,355
I hear tell that JoJo has learned quite a bit.

114
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,733
Where is the man who killed master Esidisi?

115
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:47,702
Wind.

116
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,052
Wamuu can control the wind.

117
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:52,516
That's why he's difficult to see.

118
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,941
Air's coming from pipes in his chest.

119
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:57,342
He's only slightly visible

120
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:01,090
because of water vapor swirling
in the flow around his body.

121
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:02,443
I've got it!

122
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,125
He's cloaking himself in vapor
that he's generating from the air,

123
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,566
and then he's pumping it out of those pipes.

124
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,459
It's refracting light like a million tiny prisms.

125
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,602
It's a suit that bends light around him,

126
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,604
protecting him from the sun's rays,

127
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:19,394
thus allowing him to be outside.

128
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,905
That's why he seems to be transparent.

129
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,116
Too bad JoJo isn't here.

130
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:29,316
You are the bubble user named Caesar, are you not?

131
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,524
Simply by looking into your eyes,

132
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:35,161
I can see that you've also learned
much though your ordeals.

133
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,915
Very well!

134
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:41,113
You are worthy of death at my hands, bubble user!

135
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,492
We'll see who dies!

136
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:46,736
I feel like I did back then,

137
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:48,332
when I was naive and poor,

138
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:51,427
back when you viciously took the life of my father.

139
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:55,548
And now I'll use my viciousness to destroy you!

140
00:08:57,918 --> 00:08:59,917
Very impressive, but don't think your wind

141
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:02,130
will be able to just blow my bubbles away.

142
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:04,786
Some bubbles go right through wind.

143
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:09,512
I've significantly updated my grandfather's hamon cutter.

144
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,784
Bubble cutter!

145
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:16,175
High‐speed rotation turns the
bubbles into a salvo of deadly disks.

146
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,962
Hamon ensures they won't pop along the way.

147
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:19,917
Hmm?

148
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:23,993
The wind protecting you is nothing
more than a pocket of empty air to them.

149
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:27,617
Instead of defending you, it'll suck them in.

150
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:33,417
I underestimated his skill with hamon.

151
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,969
It is far more than I bargained for.

152
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:36,470
Heh.

153
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:39,502
Now, hamon‐user...

154
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,434
Hold it. I won't let you go inside.

155
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,419
Gliding bubble cutter!

156
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:48,808
Now, while you're standing there stunned

157
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,258
and helplessly off balance, I'll give you a hamon kick.

158
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,910
But Caesar was in for an extremely big shock.

159
00:09:57,752 --> 00:10:00,635
If you are tripped, you try your best not to fall,

160
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:04,073
especially if you need to avoid sunlight
in order to survive.

161
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,186
But Wamuu was different.

162
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:09,197
He bent over backwards and attacked.

163
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,708
I've never seen anything like that before.

164
00:10:21,948 --> 00:10:24,425
He's not just an immortal with incredible strength.

165
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:27,259
With senses like that, he's a fighting genius.

166
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:33,274
But my bubble cutter must have
inflicted severe damage on him.

167
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:36,954
The advantage here is mine!

168
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:40,661
I have a way to take you down, even indoors.

169
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:55,089
My nerves are honed to a razor's edge.

170
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,497
I can feel differences in the air.

171
00:10:57,763 --> 00:11:00,311
I have the itch like when I was poor.

172
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,141
My breathing is relaxed and normal.

173
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,549
I'm not sweating.

174
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:06,758
Perfect hamon conditions.

175
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,312
Instructor Meshina!

176
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:22,885
I see you've taken off your coat and
made yourself ready, Wamuu.

177
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:34,318
Damn it. Caesar and Meshina aren't here.

178
00:11:34,731 --> 00:11:37,033
Do you think they might have already gone inside?

179
00:11:39,937 --> 00:11:42,901
No. That's his... that's Meshina's arm.

180
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:46,403
Now take this! Bubble launcher!

181
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:48,096
That's nothing.

182
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:56,882
Bubble cutter!

183
00:11:58,287 --> 00:11:59,360
Running? Hah!

184
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:01,698
I won't run or hide from you!

185
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:08,528
Huh?

186
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,117
Bubble cutter!

187
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:26,476
You're dead, Wamuu!

188
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:29,134
Gliding bubble cutter!

189
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:37,393
Wamuu!

190
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,132
I'm finished with these games.

191
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:42,741
You're through.

192
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:46,676
Divine sand...

193
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:47,831
Wait a minute, Wamuu.

194
00:12:47,856 --> 00:12:48,983
Stop, and look around.

195
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:50,788
Huh?

196
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:54,062
My bubble cutters are now bubble lenses,

197
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:56,226
and they're floating in the air all around you.

198
00:12:57,364 --> 00:13:00,163
And that enormous hole you knocked in the wall earlier

199
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,841
is just like the open shutter of a
camera on a bright summer day.

200
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:07,441
Those lenses, they focus the sunlight...

201
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:10,948
Into the hotel.

202
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:12,403
What?!

203
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:17,953
You can't move.

204
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:20,817
You're like film, a frozen image.

205
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:23,586
You're totally exposed, Wamuu.

206
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,977
Trying your vapor barrier again?

207
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:29,451
Not this time.

208
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:34,061
Now, Wamuu, I'm going to finish
you off with a direct hamon blast.

209
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:36,616
One point at one moment,

210
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,406
a tiny blind spot.

211
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:43,706
Caesar's body created the briefest of
shadows amid the blazing wall of sunlight.

212
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:45,846
Wamuu didn't waste his chance.

213
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,491
He showed Caesar once again

214
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:53,126
that he was a fighting genius and a genius of strategy.

215
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:56,134
Wind power, Divine Sandstorm!

216
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:08,673
Huh? S‐such destruction.

217
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:09,952
It couldn't be.

218
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:13,143
It's Wamuu's Divine Sandstorm. I'm sure of it.

219
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:15,445
So that means Caesar is....

220
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,349
You had grown so much in so little time.

221
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:23,534
I'm satisfied.

222
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:28,325
I haven't had a fight like that in ages
now, warrior of hamon.

223
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:33,277
And it was a close one as well.

224
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,774
If the wind of my Divine Sandstorm

225
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,097
hadn't had the strength to blow your
bubble senses to oblivion,

226
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:45,284
I have no idea how I would have stopped
the light before it destroyed me.

227
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:50,294
And even if the mighty lord Kars,
who cannot use wind,

228
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:52,368
had been the one to first
note your presence

229
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:55,561
and confront you as I did
and faced your power...

230
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:01,079
If he had prevailed,

231
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:03,778
he most certainly would have been in far worse shape

232
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:06,545
than I find myself in now. Huh?

233
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:19,282
Enough. You will not fight again,
for you have nothing left with which to fight.

234
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:24,520
My Divine Sandstorm has shredded your body
beyond any chance of survival.

235
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:26,035
Stop.

236
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:28,035
The battle is over.

237
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:33,093
You have no more hamon with which to continue. See?

238
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,650
You've almost completely bled out.

239
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,831
That means you have no hope.

240
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,947
Stop, Caesar.

241
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:55,941
Goodbye. Your life and all you once were has ended.

242
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:01,057
What?

243
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:10,841
My lip ring with the antidote,

244
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:12,375
why did you take it?

245
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:16,761
I‐I'm not afraid to die here...

246
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:22,098
But I am a proud member of the Zeppeli family,

247
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:24,586
so you see, it's in my blood.

248
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:29,122
Something like this might mean absolutely nothing

249
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:31,666
to a demented, inhuman monster like you.

250
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,612
My father didn't recognize me,

251
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:40,217
but he sacrificed his life to save mine anyway.

252
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,879
My grandfather gave his hamon energy to
save JoJo's grandfather right before he died.

253
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:50,919
It's tradition.

254
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:53,578
I have to do something.

255
00:16:54,056 --> 00:17:00,077
I‐i can't let my life's flame just
sputter out to darkness.

256
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,966
This is the Zeppeli family spirit,

257
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,825
handed down from the past to ensure the family's future.

258
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:09,358
It's the human spirit!

259
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:18,825
JoJo, this is the last of my hamon!

260
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:23,068
Take it from me!

261
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:27,157
Take it from me!

262
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:30,940
Did you hear that?

263
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,194
It sounded like Caesar screaming.

264
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,032
Yes, I heard it. Oh, no. Caesar can't....

265
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:42,051
Caesar!

266
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,605
He made a bubble from his blood.

267
00:17:58,137 --> 00:18:01,312
He must have used every last bit of his hamon to make it.

268
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:05,642
Before he died, he saved it for his friends

269
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:08,263
rather than using it to try and destroy me.

270
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,462
I'll let it go,

271
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,763
but not because I'm sentimental about him.

272
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:23,794
His talent as a fighter was undeniable.

273
00:18:24,656 --> 00:18:27,425
He has my deep respect as a fellow warrior.

274
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:30,743
I will hold you and the last moments we spent together

275
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:33,068
forever in my memory, Caesar...

276
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:37,925
A man as splendid and as fleeting

277
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,826
as the bubbles he conjured.

278
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:53,108
The place is a wreck.

279
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:55,955
A Divine Sandstorm did all this,

280
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:59,112
and Caesar was caught right inside the heart of it.

281
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:04,775
A bubble.

282
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:07,893
C‐could it be?

283
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:09,390
Look at that.

284
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,938
Inside is Caesar's bandana.

285
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:16,036
Also a ring,

286
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,981
Wamuu's lip ring.

287
00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:25,037
This hamon energy feels really strange.

288
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,546
W‐whoa!

289
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,559
You know, I haven't been able to bring myself

290
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:41,778
to call Caesar's name since we
made our way into this place.

291
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:46,276
It's because I'm afraid there'll be no answer.

292
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,147
If I came in here and cried out his name,

293
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:51,794
there might not be any response in return.

294
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:54,622
There might be nothing but a lifeless silence.

295
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:56,459
That is what scares me.

296
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:59,815
I couldn't accept it, so I didn't call his name.

297
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:03,436
But now I know he's gone.

298
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:07,774
The hamon contained in that bubble
told me everything I needed to know.

299
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:10,395
Right here,

300
00:20:10,998 --> 00:20:14,724
just a few moments ago, Caesar died.

301
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:17,509
Guh! Caesar, you bastard.

302
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,737
You had to be a damn showoff right up until the very end,

303
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:23,644
and then you leave
a precious gift like this for me.

304
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,935
Caesar, where are you?!

305
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:29,536
Where the hell are you sleeping?

306
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:31,197
I'll find you, Caesar.

307
00:20:31,222 --> 00:20:32,189
I'll dig you up.

308
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:33,304
Caesar!

309
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:34,014
JoJo.

310
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,600
This isn't the time to search or grieve.

311
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:39,014
We have work to do.

312
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:39,621
What?

313
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:42,019
There are two of them and two of us.

314
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:44,224
The numbers are balanced. They're even.

315
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,227
That trail of blood leading up the stairs

316
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:51,609
tells me that Caesar significantly wounded Wamuu.

317
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:54,394
We're in the middle of enemy territory.

318
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,592
Let's go finish this fight.

319
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:59,092
JoJo, come on.

320
00:20:59,513 --> 00:21:03,196
Take the antidote. Then we'll go hunt
those bastards down.

321
00:21:03,816 --> 00:21:04,744
That heartless...

322
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:08,333
She can't even manage to shed
a single tear for Caesar.

323
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:19,336
Coach Lisa Lisa,

324
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:22,189
your cigarette, it's backwards.

325
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:28,824
Lisa Lisa is our coach,

326
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:31,650
so she always has to keep a cool exterior.

327
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:35,435
I know she wants to cry much more than I do.

328
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,936
He treated her like a goddess

329
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:39,969
and knew her longer than I've known her.

330
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:45,400
I have to try and hold my feelings back.

331
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:53,014
Caesar, I know you always thought
I was impulsive and self‐centered,

332
00:21:53,786 --> 00:21:57,335
but sometimes I do understand
the feelings of those around me.

333
00:21:58,232 --> 00:22:00,003
I might finally be learning.

334
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:04,907
I swear I will fight them both like the devil
until there's nothing left of them.

335
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:06,818
I'll avenge you, Caesar.

336
00:22:06,963 --> 00:22:08,564
Your spirit is with me.

337
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:17,997
Blood. His blood.

338
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:21,500
This is where he fell.

339
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:23,894
Caesar.

340
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:32,419
Caesar.

341
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:41,912
Caesar!

342
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:43,778
They were deep in enemy territory.

343
00:22:44,215 --> 00:22:46,439
Kars and Wamuu were very nearby,

344
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:49,662
but the two simply couldn't help themselves.

345
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:52,667
JoJo called out Caesar's name.

346
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:56,079
Lisa Lisa's tears flowed freely.

347
00:22:57,654 --> 00:22:59,825
But their heartbroken cries of grief

348
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:02,854
were answered only by a cold silence.

349
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:05,887
Caesar was gone.

350
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:08,432
As they mourned him,

351
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:12,064
they took solace in one simple fact.

352
00:23:13,282 --> 00:23:14,936
Though his body had died,

353
00:23:15,504 --> 00:23:17,939
his soul would live on through them.

354
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:21,752
Rest in peace, Caesar Zeppeli.

355
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:44,585
In and around the lake

356
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:47,391
mountains come out of the sky

357
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:51,520
they stand there

358
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:58,362
24 before my love and I'll be there

359
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,707
You're really not impressing me.

360
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,747
I'm going to hug you to death!

361
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:05,382
We fight tonight under the full moon.

362
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:07,071
You have no tomorrow.

363
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:09,468
We'll face this fight together, Caesar.
