226
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:09,942
This senior gentleman seems familiar.

337
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:13,501
We definitely know that upright bearing and that scar.

237
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:17,862
It's good to see you again, Speedwagon.

293
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:21,389
I understand you're an American oil tycoon now.

138
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,630
That's a bit exaggerated.

211
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,473
You look as young as ever, Straizo.

212
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:28,927
Hard to believe we're the same age.

294
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:34,062
Hamon energy is life energy, right? I envy you.

382
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:40,116
It has been half a century since
Jonathan Joestar made his sacrifice.

229
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,872
Straizo has succeeded master tonpetty,

322
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:46,217
while Speedwagon has had success building a fortune.

331
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:50,014
Together, they're headed for Mexico to see something.

385
00:00:50,713 --> 00:00:55,129
This something was discovered by a
speedwagon‐funded exploration team.

371
00:00:56,917 --> 00:01:01,302
What's more is that it's a secret
known only to these select few.

295
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:06,637
I tell you, Straizo, once you lay eyes on this,

296
00:01:06,744 --> 00:01:10,464
I believe no, I am certain you'll feel a chill.

386
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:14,652
It's frightful enough to make even
your disciplined hair stand on end.

400
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,142
I find it even worse than the terror we
faced 50 years ago when we all battled with Dio.

245
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:27,378
I can't believe how large this space is.

220
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:30,686
And this is the reason we came here.

82
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,656
What? It can't be!

53
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:34,048
A stone mask!

170
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:36,484
And there are so many of them!

152
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,498
It was in the fall of 1938.

376
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:53,891
I was doing my job, just like I
always did, eyes peeled for a mark.

129
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:55,727
You gotta be kiddin' me.

4
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:56,163
Huh?

280
00:01:56,454 --> 00:01:59,198
You really never heard of this fine beverage?

354
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:03,006
All right. By your accent, I'd say you're in from England.

54
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,331
Tourist, huh?

42
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:07,103
No kiddin'?

255
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:09,335
You're gonna make the big city your home?

387
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,793
Well, if you want a drink, you're
gonna have to lay down some shekels.

164
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:15,521
Cash is the king around here.

78
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,866
The nerve of him!

305
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:23,222
You're not gonna let that mook steal your wallet.

60
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:24,233
Get after him.

5
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:26,497
Hah!

213
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:29,406
What a patsy. That was easy as pie.

61
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:33,043
Hey‐a, Smokey.

323
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:36,572
Looks like I finally caught you red‐handed, ya punk.

246
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:41,388
What are ya doin' on my beat, you trash?

309
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:46,885
I'm gonna make sure they lock you up for 20 years.

147
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,965
Take it easy. Please, sir.

130
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,450
I only pinched a wallet.

332
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:54,352
I hate bottom feeders like you preyin' on the public.

238
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:57,355
But see, I'm nice. I'll do you a solid.

260
00:02:57,465 --> 00:03:00,682
I'm gonna let you bring me $20 every week,

193
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,927
also half of everything you glom.

22
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:06,285
Hello.

6
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:07,210
Hmm?

303
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:11,514
Hey, it's the pigeon what got his wallet lifted.

281
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:14,143
This is evidence, so I'm gonna be keepin' it.

184
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:16,972
Well, now, how shall I put this?

116
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:18,410
Here is what happened.

377
00:03:19,427 --> 00:03:23,677
There actually is no crime since
that wallet was a gift, constable.

7
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:24,342
Hmm?

8
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:24,851
Hmm?

1
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:25,472
Eh?

398
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:31,376
For some reason, this six‐and‐a‐half‐foot
giant of an Englishman was covering for me.

55
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,411
So then, sir,

274
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:37,358
would you please return both wallet and boy?

101
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:38,883
What'd you just say?

139
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:41,202
As I said, it was a gift.

148
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,754
He and I are good friends.

93
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:45,629
Let him go, please.

24
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:48,280
Uh‐huh.

83
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:50,331
A good friend, eh?

338
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:55,320
Why don't you tell me what your good friend's name is?

23
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:56,687
Hmm...

140
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,419
What's the matter, limey?

315
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,748
You want to see what a New York pokey is like? Huh?

141
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,924
Here's a present for you.

65
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:11,982
That's curious.

351
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,628
Help me understand. Why would you do something like that?

239
00:04:15,982 --> 00:04:18,734
It's just such an unsavory thing to do.

94
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,276
There is no reason!

316
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:23,534
I do what I like whenever I feel like it, you fool!

383
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,982
But if someone wipes a booger on
your face, it probably means that...

269
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,453
You've made the wrong move, you stupid pig!

176
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:38,193
You were shot resisting arrest!

131
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:40,614
Please, try to shoot me,

177
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:42,578
but I am warning you right now,

185
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,368
before you can pull the trigger,

344
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:47,766
I will have broken your finger like a rotten matchstick.

102
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:49,337
Not from over there!

178
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:51,593
I'll blow your damn brains out!

345
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,880
Suddenly his body started to give off some sort of glow.

124
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:03,449
It was just incredible.

310
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:06,691
The soda cap blew off and flew as fast as a bullet

240
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:09,074
straight over to snap the cop's finger.

165
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:18,673
I gave in to my temper again.

103
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:20,778
Crap. I'm in for it.

241
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:23,963
Oh, granny Erina's going to be furious.

324
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:27,142
He beat down two cops, but is scared of his grandma?

84
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:28,642
I'll just explain.

333
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:31,908
Granny Erina will understand if I explain, won't she?

378
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:35,958
All right. Mr. Pickpocket, what
say we high‐tail it on out of here?

390
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:41,830
He didn't know exactly how he had
launched the bottle cap with such force.

275
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:44,462
He said he could always do things like that.

346
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:48,927
Apparently his grandpa could do the same kind of things,

153
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:50,913
but he died at a young age.

166
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,137
His dad, who died in the war,

205
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,068
didn't have any talents like that.

117
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,247
His mom was gone, too.

149
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:00,633
I really owe you big time.

391
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,975
Everyone calls me Smokey, and i'd
sure like it if you'd tell me your name.

56
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:07,498
It's Joestar,

66
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,814
Joseph Joestar.

132
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,492
My friends call me JoJo.

57
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:27,443
What is this?

247
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:30,294
Who is that a carving of on that pillar?

112
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:32,645
That's not a carving.

248
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:36,078
He has amino acids, proteins, and cells,

325
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:39,326
and though it's faint, he has body heat and a pulse.

179
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:42,392
We are looking at a living man!

104
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,412
Straizo, understand,

230
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,432
who he is, how long he has been there,

221
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,616
how he got there in the first place,

282
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:54,255
what the masks are for, none of that matters.

194
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:56,871
We are here for one purpose only.

276
00:06:57,474 --> 00:07:00,151
I brought you because of your hamon ability,

249
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:02,924
so you can use it to utterly destroy him

186
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:04,782
while he slumbers in this stone.

95
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,096
And Joseph Joestar?

15
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:08,866
What?

187
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:12,069
Joseph Joestar, how is he doing?

334
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:16,152
I hear he has hamon ability and saved your life once.

142
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:19,076
Wh‐why bring up JoJo now?

326
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:23,637
As I recall, he was but 13 years of age at the time.

79
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,916
Yes, quite young.

388
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:30,970
Your plane was hijacked by criminals
who wanted to hold you for ransom.

283
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:39,097
Hey, kid, you can't stay back here, you know.

58
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,518
Get up front!

362
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,981
You're hijacking the plane and
kidnapping Speedwagon, correct?

118
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:49,815
I am only a bystander.

105
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,909
This is his problem.

188
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:53,085
I'm just going to read my story.

288
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:55,860
Do your business, and just leave me out of it.

96
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:58,433
Wrong answer, punk!

34
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,218
Now move!

16
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:00,071
JoJo.

35
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,010
Not good.

189
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,260
That suit was a gift from Erina.

167
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,992
This'll set him off for sure.

222
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:15,168
He's got no sense of self‐restraint.

125
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:19,006
Control yourself, JoJo!

402
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:24,257
You fellows did know there was the possibility
of a crash if you hijacked this plane, did you not?

119
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,518
Is that hamon? Oh, no.

157
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,478
What did that crazy kid do?!

85
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,797
We're gonna crash!

86
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,072
Grab the controls!

97
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:41,625
I can't fly, idiot.

297
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,866
Here. Get the pilot ready. We're going to jump.

317
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:55,020
Why can't you ever just think things through, JoJo?

154
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:57,730
I do in fact, a great deal,

347
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:01,821
mostly about how to best keep you and granny Erina safe.

261
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,707
You two are the only family that I've got.

214
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,203
He may have his grandfather's face,

223
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,380
but he's far from being a gentleman.

370
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:18,623
That was the day I discovered
that Joseph was able to use hamon.

399
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:25,090
So young Joseph inherited the ability to
control hamon from his grandfather Jonathan?

256
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:28,745
Yes, but why are you speaking of him now?

67
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:33,535
What the hell?!

242
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:37,238
I just took the lives of all these men,

158
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:39,415
and when you lose your life,

341
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:43,633
Jonathan's grandson will know grief and anger and hate.

270
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:46,430
He will develop a tremendous hatred for me.

47
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:48,488
No! Straizo!

38
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:10,194
Straizo...

150
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:13,880
Have you lost your senses?

39
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:14,777
I haven't.

250
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,630
In fact, my thinking is extremely clear.

363
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:22,724
I chose hamon to forge my body
into something pure and strong,

384
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:28,736
but as I trained, the aging of my
flesh became painfully clear to me.

356
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:34,664
Hamon provides only a small
advantage over ordinary people.

284
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:37,953
It cannot guard against the process of aging.

373
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:43,181
In the battle we fought so many
years ago, I secretly admired Dio.

72
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:45,532
He was powerful.

80
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,312
He was beautiful.

73
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,433
He was immortal.

394
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:56,504
I coveted the power granted by the stone
mask. I didn't care who got in the way.

206
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,175
You're a twisted traitor, Straizo.

257
00:11:01,414 --> 00:11:05,428
Your blood will now bring me immortality.

395
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:11,136
With you gone, the only ones to know of
the mask will be Erina and Joseph Joestar,

195
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:13,531
and once I have disposed of them,

318
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:17,281
I shall learn more of the mask than Dio ever could.

74
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:19,511
No, don't do it.

364
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:23,065
The knowledge you're seeking
could have terrible consequences.

27
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,039
Jo...jo.

28
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:30,912
Erina...

365
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:47,470
Hey, you! Why don't ya get a
clue what you're doin', dumb‐ass?

342
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:50,157
Pull your head out of your butt, and see where you are!

180
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,341
Now get the hell out of my way!

48
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:55,250
Hello there.

277
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:57,919
What? Didn't hear that. I can't make it out.

207
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:00,558
Would you mind repeating all that?

289
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,973
I'd like to know what it was you meant to say,

159
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:05,284
in case I have to pound you.

17
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:06,759
JoJo.

171
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:09,145
What is it you're doing there?

81
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,665
Uh, granny Erina.

251
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:13,780
I asked what you're doing with that man.

106
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,104
Uh, well, you see...

62
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:17,752
This man is...

25
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:20,881
A taxi!

252
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:23,447
This way, you don't have to walk so far.

290
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:26,585
Thank you, JoJo. You're such a thoughtful boy.

258
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:29,471
Climb in, Smokey. We're going for a ride.

98
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:33,243
The Joestar family,

262
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:36,825
reduced to a grandmother and her grandson.

271
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:41,522
Over time, I would hear bits of their past.

68
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:43,874
Granny, really.

397
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:49,140
Speedwagon sent for us, and we came all
the way to New York simply because he asked,

215
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:51,385
but now we find he's not even here?

216
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,502
I think his behavior is quite rude.

352
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:57,022
I'm sure that the oil business requires much of his time.

9
00:12:58,964 --> 00:12:59,651
Hmm.

63
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:02,628
Say, granny...

10
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:03,234
Hmm?

49
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:04,815
I'm curious.

278
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:07,868
Was Speedwagon really grandpa's best friend?

190
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:10,235
Is that all it was? Come on now.

120
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,022
What are you implying?

291
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:15,799
Well, let's see. He was never married, was he?

168
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:18,029
And you yourself are a widow.

403
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:23,981
Well, it leads me to wonder if simple friendship
was the only relationship that was going on there.

69
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:26,810
You rogue, you!

126
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:29,095
Sorry. Ow! I was wrong.

107
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:30,908
Ow! Forgive me. Aah!

181
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:33,132
I know Speedwagon is loyal. Ow!

29
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:33,982
Agh! Ow!

231
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:37,088
The Joestars tended to be short‐lived.

327
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:40,823
Granny Erina lost her husband in an accident at sea.

253
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:44,184
She was pregnant with a son at the time.

75
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:45,718
When he grew up,

311
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:48,307
he married a girl who had also survived the wreck.

143
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,484
They were JoJo's parents,

196
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:54,186
later claimed by war and disease.

272
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:58,684
Granny Erina was a gentle and giving woman,

232
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:02,252
even to punks like me or anybody else.

298
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:05,547
Maybe it was because she lived with loneliness.

87
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:08,353
JoJo was the same.

366
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:12,523
This time, however, his basic
kindness got him into trouble...

76
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:15,161
...thanks to me.

108
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,876
Hey, waiter. Waiter!

36
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:18,734
Yes, sir?

367
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:23,121
Who decided that stinkin' animal
could be allowed in here, huh?

18
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:24,651
Huh?!

197
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:28,755
His smell is ruinin' my appetite.

328
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,416
That kind shouldn't be allowed in a place like this.

88
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,727
I understand, sir,

304
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:35,412
but there is a policy handed down by management.

227
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:37,716
As long as the check is paid in full,

133
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:39,273
we happily serve anyone.

64
00:14:39,352 --> 00:14:40,185
What was that?

374
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,336
You'll happily let beasts like
that do their grazing in here? Huh?

198
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:47,319
Uh, guess I'll just be on my way.

19
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:52,691
JoJo.

127
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,639
You heard him. Come on.

285
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,197
You're not going to tell me to stop, are you?

263
00:14:57,284 --> 00:15:00,764
No. People are entitled to their opinions.

368
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:05,039
But this misbegotten oaf has
given public insult to our friend.

357
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:09,145
Be mindful of the other guests
now, but teach him a lesson.

11
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:11,774
Hmm.

160
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:14,390
I was hoping you'd say that.

199
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:19,960
Well, now, boy, lookin' to fight?

50
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:23,575
Let me help.

312
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:26,085
If the brass knuckles are what you're looking for,

319
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,906
you are not going to find them inside of your coat.

306
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:31,630
You might want to check your back pocket instead.

12
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,344
Wha?

20
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:34,393
What?

43
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:39,090
Eh? No way.

2
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:41,052
Eh?

396
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:45,438
Next you'll say, "you bastard, how could
you have possibly known where they were?"

369
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:48,567
You bastard, how could you
possibly have known where they were?

21
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,298
Huh?!

335
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:53,518
By the visible abrasions that are on your right hand,

360
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:57,283
it's obvious that you do your
fighting using brass knuckles.

372
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,043
You've no wounds, so the the
blood on your shirt is not from you.

40
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:02,068
Therefore,

172
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:03,629
you've just come from a fight.

380
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:07,666
Since the blood is on your shirt
and not that pink horror of a coat,

224
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,171
it was taken off prior to the fight.

404
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:16,174
And then after you had completed your assault,
the knuckles came off, and that's when you proceeded

233
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,266
to stow them away in your back pocket.

225
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,449
For my next glimpse into the future,

286
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,151
you will now say, "so what, you little punk?"

182
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,086
Yeah, so what, you little punk?

161
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,096
And now you're gonna get it.

37
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,932
I got ya!

99
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,983
You like that, huh?

155
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:38,731
That'll teach you a lesson.

89
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:40,966
Sorry. You missed.

162
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,674
What have you been punching?

299
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,749
I wasn't the one you were pummeling so happily.

44
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,432
Oh, my god!

392
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:54,652
I can predict and counter anything
your tiny brain is able to come up with.

264
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:57,080
Do you understand that now, you simpleton?

329
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:06,617
Please, forgive the behavior of my underling, madam.

200
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,907
You're Erina Joestar, aren't you?

389
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,625
I've worked on a lot of business
deals with your Mr. Speedwagon, you see.

393
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:18,845
He told me some stories about you when
him and me were in London a while back.

113
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:20,210
I'm glad to meet you.

307
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:23,685
I heard a little something through the grapevine.

358
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:27,408
It hasn't made it into the
papers yet, but you should know.

300
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:31,764
It seems that Mr. Speedwagon has been murdered.

59
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:34,923
Are you sure?

355
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,072
Rumor is the cat who did it was some sort of Tibetan monk.

243
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:42,385
Some sort of monk? Could it be Straizo?

320
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:45,464
All they're saying is that the bodies of Speedwagon

375
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:49,171
and his team washed up along a
riverbank somewhere down in Mexico.

128
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:51,562
It's a genuine mystery.

254
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,953
Nobody has any idea why they were killed

301
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:56,566
or where the monk might have gone to afterward.

183
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:01,562
Actually, I think I might know.

30
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:03,081
Perhaps.

265
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:06,687
Speedwagon said something a long time ago.

70
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,369
It involved Dio

287
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:11,542
and the horrible stone mask that changed him.

173
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:14,887
JoJo, that guy is a mafia man.

208
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:16,897
You can't trust what he tells you.

174
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:18,279
He's trying to pull something!

209
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:21,035
Believe whatever you want to, kid.

31
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,919
Hold on.

330
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:25,951
Try your breast pocket if you're after your lighter.

3
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:26,623
Eh?

244
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,087
Anyway, thanks for the warning, Smokey.

313
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:32,861
But I think I believe what this man is telling us.

266
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:35,855
These fellows are only motivated by money.

401
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:41,718
Clearly information like that is valuable to
his organization, so I'm inclined to listen to him.

41
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:42,861
However...

348
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:50,228
As true as that may be, you don't simply waltz over here

321
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:53,343
and then just blurt out awful news to granny Erina.

361
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,678
Don't you see how badly upset
you've made her with this news?

144
00:18:56,742 --> 00:18:58,411
You are very thoughtless!

109
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,343
It was 50 years ago,

191
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:07,300
and still those events haunt us.

175
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:09,802
Don't be frightened. I'm here,

114
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:11,413
and I'll protect you.

110
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:12,963
You mustn't, Joseph.

121
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:14,841
I'm concerned for you.

349
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,749
I don't want you snared by evil from a half‐century ago.

115
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,780
I'll be fine, granny.

234
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:25,898
If this is my fate, I accept it fully.

51
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:29,941
At the time,

235
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:32,318
I didn't understand what was going on,

267
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:36,315
but these two had an unimaginable history.

52
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:44,990
Hey, Smokey.

156
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,685
Hmm? What's going on, JoJo?

90
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,885
Look at this here.

134
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:51,030
See what they're saying?

45
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,252
What is it?

151
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,262
Do you think this is true?

279
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,059
Can girls really make them bigger? Whoo‐hoo.

268
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:00,563
Let's see. "Go from an aa cup to a c cup."

236
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,232
Hah! Right. Just a bunch of snake oil.

91
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,457
Don't buy into it.

46
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:05,566
Come again?

201
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:08,405
I think $1.25 a pair is too much.

13
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:12,581
Hmm.

26
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:18,271
Uh, no.

32
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:19,462
Yes, but

33
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:22,918
I say...

339
00:20:23,451 --> 00:20:27,226
You look rather familiar to me, yet somehow different.

340
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:33,367
Please tell me, have we possibly met somewhere before?

350
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:39,119
And why isn't your breath visible? It's so cold tonight.

217
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,733
And if my eyes aren't deceiving me,

359
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,261
I think I caught a glimpse of
fangs in your mouth just now.

111
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:47,136
Was I seeing things?

202
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:56,638
Don't trifle with me. I warn you.

14
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,116
Heh.

343
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:02,549
Even if it is in plain sight on this city street, JoJo,

353
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,810
I'll take your life long before you ever become a danger.

71
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:09,112
Or perhaps not.

145
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:19,940
I knew the man was crazy,

100
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:21,545
but not that crazy!

192
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:24,023
Right out in public? Incredible!

228
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,362
Where did he even get the Tommy gun?!

169
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:28,805
Why shoot up the whole city?!

203
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:44,117
Yes, I was awaiting you, Straizo.

204
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,508
That was on behalf of Speedwagon,

273
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,021
but I don't think you'll go down so easily.

92
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:53,327
Our war has begun.

122
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:14,428
I'll be the roundabout

218
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:18,495
the words will make you out and out

135
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:23,827
I spend the day your way

259
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:26,496
call it morning driving through the sound

146
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:31,015
and in and out the valley

136
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:41,830
The music dance and sing

210
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:45,627
they make the children really ring

137
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:50,961
I spend the day your way

379
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:57,413
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

123
00:22:57,601 --> 00:22:59,894
in and around the lake

314
00:23:01,122 --> 00:23:05,337
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

302
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:12,002
one mile over, we'll be there and we'll see you

308
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:18,406
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

336
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,523
24 before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

163
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:32,380
Straizo is indeed a vampire.

77
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:33,599
Now you're mine!

381
00:23:33,623 --> 00:23:36,661
German medicine is the greatest
thing in the world, don't you think?

292
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:38,301
You don't know the forces you're playing with!

219
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:41,261
Give my best to Speedwagon in hell!
