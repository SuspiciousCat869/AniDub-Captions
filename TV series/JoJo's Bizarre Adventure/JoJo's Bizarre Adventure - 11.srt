1
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,093
Eh?

2
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:17,737
Eh?

3
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:43,501
Eh?

4
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:30,509
Huh?

5
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:36,522
Hmm?

6
00:00:37,183 --> 00:00:37,693
Ohh.

7
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,008
Heh.

8
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:48,580
Hmm?

9
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,735
Hmm.

10
00:17:26,623 --> 00:17:27,203
Hmm?

11
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:06,124
Agh!

12
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,263
Hmm.

13
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:17,974
JoJo!

14
00:15:58,348 --> 00:15:59,314
JoJo.

15
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:47,889
Hamon!

16
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:17,131
Now...

17
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:47,449
Person?

18
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:24,796
In hell!

19
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:55,192
Lick it.

20
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:44,698
Not that!

21
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:38,959
Whoa! No!

22
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:02,751
Yes, sir.

23
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:07,834
A mirror?!

24
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,696
Batter up.

25
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:36,938
Take this!

26
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:38,136
Am I right?

27
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:11,190
Straiz‐oaf!

28
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:58,805
Not at all.

29
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:06,253
Gently now.

30
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:44,342
Speedwagon?

31
00:12:58,038 --> 00:12:59,122
That's im...

32
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:55,283
No, you did.

33
00:06:58,065 --> 00:06:59,039
Child's play.

34
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,272
You son of...

35
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:05,102
And if he was,

36
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,641
but I don't...

37
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,527
Is that hamon?

38
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:07,389
A truth serum?

39
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:04,688
Guns will fail.

40
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,499
Make way! Move!

41
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:49,625
Out of the way!

42
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:07,486
Run, JoJo! Run!

43
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:51,491
It was ghastly.

44
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,236
JoJo, let's run.

45
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,679
Just despicable.

46
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:12,901
Your mouth okay?

47
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:24,740
That's outta here!

48
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:43,419
No, really, it is.

49
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:07,826
You demonic freak.

50
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:02,784
That's impossible.

51
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,729
No. No, you can't.

52
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,502
JoJo, what'd you...

53
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:52,090
I'm also very fast!

54
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:51,148
This guy is insane!

55
00:08:57,777 --> 00:09:00,532
Hey, wait up! JoJo!

56
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:06,953
I want answers now!

57
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,967
We can do anything!

58
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:52,290
He... he's unharmed.

59
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,636
Please just save me!

60
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,960
He followed us here.

61
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,526
You'll pay for that!

62
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:39,666
Help us! Let us out!

63
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,702
You are quite brave.

64
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,630
Here comes the pitch.

65
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:05,243
He... he's a monster.

66
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:18,518
Sure. Of course I do.

67
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:46,726
Run as fast as I can!

68
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:54,235
Do I hear what, JoJo?

69
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,942
Release her, Straizo!

70
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,133
Hah! You mean Straizo?

71
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,670
Why, isn't it obvious?

72
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,438
No, not that. Look up!

73
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:49,797
Farewell to you, JoJo.

74
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:23,882
Don't cut your tongue.

75
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:42,700
How are you feeling...

76
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,429
You just shot a person!

77
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:10,935
What else would he be?!

78
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,775
Let's have a look here.

79
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:11,985
I'll be the roundabout

80
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:25,320
I'll be there with you

81
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:31,140
someone call the police.

82
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,505
Great. I knew you would.

83
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:37,125
That's our ticket there.

84
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:15,439
This is a perfect scoop.

85
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:39,318
Are you all right, miss?

86
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:53,866
What? I never said that.

87
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:56,486
All right, here's a hint.

88
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:31,635
Look at his legs, Smokey.

89
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,485
It's behind me, isn't it?

90
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:55,849
I'll kill her regardless.

91
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:59,594
Fight me, or run. Decide!

92
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:54,904
That... that was a tooth.

93
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:15,915
As the German army grows,

94
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:12,758
Good. Slowly now. Slowly.

95
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:15,275
Give me a history lesson.

96
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:41,284
I'll do anything! Please!

97
00:21:43,755 --> 00:21:46,383
Let the experiment begin!

98
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:21,366
I spend the day your way

99
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:38,955
The music dance and sing

100
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:48,326
I spend the day your way

101
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:30,049
he's going to kill us all!

102
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:34,057
Wh... what the hell is he?

103
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:35,950
Shall we interrogate, sir?

104
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,967
Can you tell me your name?

105
00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:27,446
Why did you make me live?!

106
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:43,207
You are stubborn, old man.

107
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:44,741
I have a proposal for you.

108
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:20,787
That was a little too easy.

109
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:09,815
Look who finally noticed...

110
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,586
Well, that was a close one.

111
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,332
It's too late for that now.

112
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,949
My legs are in great shape.

113
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:26,893
What are you talking about?

114
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:58,167
You drew blood from me, no?

115
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:28,962
I can't wait to see Mexico.

116
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,488
Me. I volunteer for it. Eh?

117
00:00:57,364 --> 00:00:59,361
Smokey, get out of here now.

118
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:26,405
I know what you'll say next.

119
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,533
Come on. Follow me, Straizo.

120
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:17,684
What sort of threat is that?

121
00:17:18,627 --> 00:17:21,603
Be careful now. Careful now.

122
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:42,894
Allow me to escort you home.

123
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:22,876
Why, god? Why do this to me?

124
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:36,822
Und don't screw anything up.

125
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,663
Wow, that's quite impressive.

126
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,486
Give my best to Speedwagon...

127
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,409
I'd like to see you try that.

128
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,306
I want some answers, Straizo.

129
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,352
Did you lose your mind?
Just look at what you've done.

130
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,224
Can we please stop the crying?
I'm trying to think here.

131
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,157
Hmm. Next thing you'll say is,

132
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,275
Bah. Go ahead and do what you
think you need to do, Straizo.

133
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:01,124
Really? Wow, I didn't mean it.

134
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,353
They've been completely warped.

135
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,429
There will be no mercy for you.

136
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:08,017
Here's a secret before you die.

137
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:02,877
Sure, but I was still able to
pull one over on you, wasn't I?

138
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,635
So what are you gonna do, then?

139
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:01,349
This bastard has no conscience.

140
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:41,495
Fool me once, then shame on me.

141
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,499
24 before my love you'll see

142
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:49,009
we should be safe by now, right?

143
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:04,432
Consider that your last warning.

144
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:54,380
So I dragged the bodies outside.

145
00:06:03,802 --> 00:06:05,779
If I didn't have to kill you now.

146
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,331
I am a master of its strengths
and flaws in all forms of combat.

147
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:16,776
You know what to do, right? JoJo?

148
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,862
I'll just pummel you into
fertilizer with my remaining arm.

149
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:04,938
Tell me, why did you throw
Speedwagon's body into the river?

150
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,413
Why in the hell did you do that?!

151
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:35,003
Make the necessary preparations
for the blood feeding experiment,

152
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,610
but I have a different philosophy.

153
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,334
So I hear that hamon does a pretty
good job of melting vampire faces.

154
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:06,180
And you should take a look at
the grenade you just knocked away.

155
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,401
No stealing, no lying, I swear it!

156
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:09,922
I would not do that if I were you.

157
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:26,354
Are you certain that this is
the type of game you wish to play?

158
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,680
Your act of playing it calm belied
the fire that we see in you now.

159
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:31,289
There is nothing I regret, Joseph.

160
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:43,408
I cannot tell you the ecstasy that
I have felt in being young again.

161
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:09,835
Yeah, I'm sure it "just happens"
every time you talk about a woman.

162
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,666
You were nearly dead in the desert

163
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:13,456
Everything! I want to know it all.

164
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,826
You're a vile, inhuman abomination!

165
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:07,084
Something here just doesn't add up.

166
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:11,492
Joseph, your grandfather
Jonathan's blood flows through you.

167
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:43,025
They make the children really ring

168
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:42,137
but... but how could he possibly
be alive with that hole in his head?

169
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,884
Just as much as you are to sunlight!

170
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:13,313
There is an insect deep in southeast
Asia called the satiporoja beetle.

171
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,695
Smokey, I thought I told you to run.

172
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,336
I will make him pay dearly for that.

173
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:25,165
Whether you know this woman or not
is inconsequential. If you flee now,

174
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,132
Now you'll say, "that's impossible."

175
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:46,353
The pillar sucked deeply of the
blood from those bodies in the cave.

176
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:29,088
So that means... you must have been
creating hamon inside your own body.

177
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:16,149
Mmm. I think the pain is going away.

178
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,945
The words will make you out and out

179
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:28,462
Call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

180
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:30,455
You've no idea what he's capable of!

181
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:24,852
Or I could just smash in your brains.
How would you feel about that?!

182
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:27,206
It's similar to an electrical ground.

183
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:35,354
Unlike Dio, I have studied the craft.

184
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:25,577
Pressure applied by fingertips,
235 kilograms per centimeter squared.

185
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:41,800
But I threw the bodies into the river
because of him. Don't you see, fool?

186
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:25,842
Now it's time to find out about this
pillar man Straizo was talking about.

187
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:58,348
You have a secret, a secret that is
very dangerous and could kill us all.

188
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:56,034
Only thing I got to hear is the river.

189
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:40,633
However, if you were to come up
here after a girl you don't even know,

190
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:46,282
But unfortunately for you, Straizo,
you'll never be able to fool me twice.

191
00:15:15,993 --> 00:15:18,735
Your destiny has already been written.

192
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:26,138
However, they also research astrology,
sorcery, alchemy, and psychic powers.

193
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:30,099
It wasn't god. At least, not your god.

194
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:51,718
I also know that you were
penniless when you first got to Texas.

195
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,108
Once you have all agreed on who
will be the one to sacrifice his life,

196
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:16,881
Courage like yours is a thing that
must be cultivated like a lush garden.

197
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,403
Straizo! I'm going to give you a choice
on how you want to meet your demise.

198
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:21,611
Will it be plain old sunlight or hamon?

199
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:24,800
Now the only one left is Erina Joestar,
and that should be...

200
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:47,644
Too much time meditating out in the
Tibetan boonies has dulled your senses.

201
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:12,775
Run away, and I'll kill her right here,

202
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,351
"The village in which the elderly kill
each other is not long for this world."

203
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:29,490
He's powerful enough to destroy us all.

204
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:43,381
Hmm. Yeah, I know. It'll take a small
fortune to fix everything in this place.

205
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:47,876
But did you think I'd completely rely
on a gimmick like hamon all of the time?

206
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:14,752
You probably kill monsters all the time.

207
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,712
I basically blew them to smithereens,
and they still haven't fully healed yet.

208
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,660
I'll know just what sort of man you are.

209
00:14:54,768 --> 00:15:01,040
But I have no doubts now that he will
soon awaken from his 2,000‐year slumber.

210
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:38,888
Not as some withered, desiccated corpse.

211
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:10,812
If I do your experiment, you promise
that you'll let everyone else go, right?

212
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,052
30,000 of their tiny stomachs have been
dried out and then woven into this scarf.

213
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:32,532
I have inherited 4,000 years worth of
history and research in the art of hamon.

214
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:52,218
I'm afraid not, Smokey. Do you hear that?

215
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:56,952
He just ripped it right out of her mouth.

216
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:39,910
The wehrmacht would like some information
from you before anything drastic happens.

217
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,293
About as easy as taking candy from a baby.

218
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:54,507
You wouldn't be so confused right now
if you had just been a bit more observant.

219
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:49,415
Which means you'll present a real threat
and continue to pursue me into the future,

220
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:42,586
Such gratuitous cruelty would be unseemly.

221
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:48,093
Why would you try to save me from falling?

222
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:08,689
I know you wouldn't want to hurt me again.

223
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:34,118
The old man found on the bank of the Rio
dada, he is now awake, major Von Stroheim.

224
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:03,682
Get ready! German medicine is the greatest
thing in the world, don't you think?!

225
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,631
Could it be possible that granny was wrong?

226
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:24,714
Their bodies conduct hamon far better than
the human body, thus dispersing the charge.

227
00:09:07,361 --> 00:09:12,370
Even though I'm immortal, it'll take some
time to regenerate after what he did to me.

228
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,026
Predictability can be quite the fatal flaw.

229
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:36,152
All this time, I planned on entering hell
while still vibrant and filled with energy,

230
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:26,598
Pardon my interruption, major Von Stroheim.

231
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:51,806
Just who do you think you are, anyway, huh?

232
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:47,584
I'm smart enough to know that torture alone
would not give us what we want out of you.

233
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:03,777
Your granny was not wrong, because I can see
that you would grow into quite a worthy foe

234
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:46,833
Straizo, wait! Not yet! I need to know more!

235
00:00:00,937 --> 00:00:04,309
I knew the man was crazy,
but not that crazy!

236
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:27,925
A secret weapon? Really? What kind of weapon?

237
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:40,096
What do his legs have to do with your weapon?

238
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:19,102
Tell me about Straizo und about this Joestar.

239
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:22,906
Set the boy aside, und execute everyone else.

240
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:31,536
Just as I feared, Straizo is indeed a vampire.

241
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:53,372
Aren't you frightened that I still possess
enough power in me to blow your arm clean off?

242
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:16,698
From the outside, you appear to be
opposites, but you're both insatiably curious.

243
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:26,882
You don't know the forces you're playing with.

244
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,675
Here, we will allow only the most fit to live.

245
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,353
I figure I'll have plenty of time to reflect on
the extent of my powers after you're destroyed.

246
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:50,455
That's why I like the city. It keeps you sharp.

247
00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:55,184
It's as though I never even touched him at all.

248
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,842
The papers will be falling all over themselves.

249
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:16,093
But come up and meet me, and I will let her go.

250
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:20,842
I don't even know who that woman is, you moron!

251
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:15,728
And when that time comes, you shall learn
his identity and the true meaning of evolution.

252
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,305
Don't make me order you to lick my wound clean.

253
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:48,036
There is a saying in Europe that comes to mind.

254
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:58,937
You wouldn't happen to have the time, would you?

255
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:32,237
Let's skip the pretty speeches. Now you're mine!

256
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:58,636
When you found the oil fields that would soon
cause a massive overhaul of the world's economy.

257
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:09,503
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

258
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:10,351
I was pretty sure you'd go for my forehead again.

259
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:31,246
They seek to gain advantages through every manner
imaginable in their quest for global domination.

260
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:46,726
I'm... I'm so terribly sorry, major Von Stroheim.

261
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:25,498
Why couldn't you just have let me die back there?

262
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:58,807
I thought it would be appropriate to open up
with the technique that Dio used to kill Jonathan.

263
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,001
We extracted it from the location we got from you.

264
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,915
Go ahead und choose someone from among yourselves.

265
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:57,603
Call it morning driving through the sound
and in and out the valley in and around the lake

266
00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:15,975
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

267
00:23:36,324 --> 00:23:39,309
He's squeezing himself into the ventilation ducts!

268
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:31,758
It would be so easy to tear through her neck
and open up her chest cavity with just two fingers.

269
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,899
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

270
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,952
this is my chance to break into big‐time journalism.

271
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:49,974
It was like a plant ravenously drawing in nutrients.

272
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:10,549
For what? What more could you possibly want from me?

273
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:12,995
Look deeply into my space‐ripper stingy eyes, Joseph.

274
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,336
What the... how did you pin that grenade on my scarf?

275
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,361
I deflected your shot with a little hamon shot glass.

276
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:31,211
Granny should be able to sleep well tonight, finally.

277
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,998
Oh, shut up. I'm done decoding your rubbish, Straizo.

278
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,861
My hand, it just slipped. I don't know what happened.

279
00:19:14,302 --> 00:19:17,168
There appears to be a man trapped inside this pillar.

280
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:22,640
Tell us so that we can finally awaken the pillar man.

281
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,091
All I've got under my skirt is more Tequila, big boy.

282
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:23,815
And now it is my pleasure to warn you that your nature
has trapped you in a fate you cannot hope to escape.

283
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:33,484
Soon you shall learn of him, of the pillar man,
and then you shall finally come face to face with him.

284
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,810
I'm really sorry about that. It just happened kinda...

285
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:21,428
Looks like the adrenaline from her fear just wore off.

286
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:08,904
However, I can fire high‐pressure essence from my eyes.

287
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,808
I heard the story about Dio taking down my
grandfather by firing some sort of blast from his eyes.

288
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,548
Leaping ability, currently four meters, 22 centimeters.

289
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:14,393
1938. The second world war rages, threatening to engulf
more nations around the globe with each passing day.

290
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:21,268
It seeks to conquer the world with technology and
weapons that stand at the very cutting edge of science.

291
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:34,120
I was the one who made you live, but I can change that.

292
00:20:57,372 --> 00:21:00,666
We will grant the rest of you your freedom immediately.

293
00:23:33,116 --> 00:23:36,299
Which one of you was fool enough to disturb my slumber?

294
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:03,649
That thing I shot, I can only hope that he was a person.

295
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:08,285
I'll happily go to jail without thinking twice about it.

296
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:16,980
If you don't calm down, I may have to make out with you.

297
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:36,344
Dio's failure was in his infatuation with his own power.

298
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:14,886
I also heard that you may be severely allergic to hamon,

299
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:24,235
Yep. I have a secret weapon for situations such as this.

300
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:36,301
For a true coward would not seek revenge for Speedwagon.

301
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:44,012
Then I'll see that you are both courageous and powerful,

302
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:38,069
And it was through this tenacity that one of their
spy networks in Mexico caught wind of Straizo's actions.

303
00:20:48,972 --> 00:20:52,919
We need blood for a very important, historic experiment.

304
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,011
And I would therefore have to eliminate you here and now.

305
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:49,406
You've got some nerve calling me a floozy, you big brute!

306
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:39,845
He just couldn't resist constantly pushing his own limits.

307
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:42,155
Please, god, I promise I won't ever do anything bad again!

308
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,214
You said that you would never fight for a floozy like her.

309
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,053
He stretched himself thin,
allowing Jonathan to strike him.

310
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:39,703
A true master of Tibetan hamon
would never do such a thing.

311
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:54,513
These bullets I fired at him
all have strange dents in them.

312
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:37,316
"How could he possibly be alive
with that hole in his head?"

313
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:09,986
Not to worry. It is fated that
you shall meet him very soon,

314
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,526
rather than pursue you, I could
use this time to heal myself,

315
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,479
I wouldn't fight for that floozy
even if I was married to her.
