1
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:07,022
You're a poisoner, Dio Brando.

2
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:09,625
I have all the proof I require and then some.

3
00:00:12,756 --> 00:00:15,825
He's found his proof. So be it.

4
00:00:16,423 --> 00:00:19,566
This moment's been a long time coming, JoJo.

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,113
Now I finish what I started.

6
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:01,014
I tracked down the antidote.

7
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:03,726
Father took it moments ago.

8
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:07,890
Dio, this pains me greatly.

9
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:12,706
For years, you were my brother, and
now I have no recourse but to turn you in.

10
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:14,737
I'm sorry, really.

11
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,817
I'm sure you don't believe a word of it,

12
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:18,983
but I'm telling you the truth.

13
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:23,647
Even now, you show compassion.

14
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:30,813
JoJo, I've been a devil, but grant me this one wish.

15
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:35,896
Allow me to do the right thing for
once in my life and turn myself in.

16
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:37,733
What's this?

17
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:42,516
I thought once I confronted him, he'd
fight me tooth and nail like a cornered beast.

18
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,455
JoJo.

19
00:02:45,186 --> 00:02:47,788
You should be dead in a gutter right now.

20
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:51,960
I must distract him long enough for
the knife and mask to find their mark.

21
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,203
My wicked deeds gnaw at me.

22
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:59,850
The poverty I knew as a child ate away at my
moral compass until greed was all that remained.

23
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,906
I'm the lowest of the low.

24
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,031
Your father took me in off the street,
and I repaid his kindness with poison.

25
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:09,626
The only reason I came back was to surrender myself.

26
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:13,476
If I'd wanted to flee, you never
would have laid eyes on me again.

27
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:14,960
I see your point.

28
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,792
Please allow me to make amends.

29
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:18,890
Dio.

30
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:20,932
Look alive, master Joestar.

31
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:23,330
He's trying to lure you in, like as not.

32
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:27,166
Right about now, you're probably wondering who I am.

33
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:28,829
Allow me to elucidate ya.

34
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:31,928
The name is Robert E. O. Speedwagon.

35
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:36,804
I had a hunch Jonathan's run of trouble
might not be done, so I followed him back home.

36
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:41,680
I like you, Jonathan, so I'm gonna
offer up this little tidbit pro bono.

37
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:46,585
Living in the gutter, you learn to spot
lowlifes pretty quick if you want to see tomorrow.

38
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,689
I've trained my nose to sort out the
bad ones from the good just from a sniff.

39
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:56,533
This fella reeks of brimstone and blood
worse than anyone I've ever laid eyes on!

40
00:03:56,558 --> 00:04:00,312
He is pure evil right down to his very bones!

41
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:03,259
Is he a victim of circumstance, you're wondering?

42
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,530
Not on your life!

43
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:07,256
He's been evil since he drew his first breath.

44
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,415
But don't you fret, 'cause I brought you a friend.

45
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,446
Remember him?

46
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,890
This man confessed to selling
you the poison you used on father.

47
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,656
I've heard enough.

48
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:24,944
You break my heart.

49
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,407
Why, Dio?

50
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:31,451
From the day you arrived, I have
loved you as though you were my own son.

51
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,940
Father, you're too weak to be down here.

52
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:39,093
You're right. I'll return to my chamber.

53
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:42,883
I don't want to see my boy in chains.

54
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:45,098
Do what you must, JoJo.

55
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:46,037
I will.

56
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:49,167
Is this how it all ends?

57
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:52,313
He won't see the inside of a cell this night.

58
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:56,197
I read his face and the trio of moles on his ear.

59
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,773
The devil smiles on him and grants him luck.

60
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:06,646
JoJo, I want you to be the one to put the cuffs on me.

61
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,583
Please, brother.

62
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:09,966
All right.

63
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,177
Be careful. He's a crafty one.

64
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:18,824
JoJo, it was hubris that led me to this ignominious end.

65
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,862
This fall from grace has taught me well.

66
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:25,635
However one may scheme and dissemble,

67
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:29,272
my downfall this night is part of the human condition,

68
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:32,347
a condition I now forsake.

69
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,774
Wait. Forsake? What do you mean?

70
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,180
You see, I am about to become so much more!

71
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:42,502
Help me shed this mortal skin.

72
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,510
Mother's mask. But how?

73
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:45,809
Watch out.

74
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,092
Fire at will, men.

75
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:49,546
JoJo, your blood is the key!

76
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,946
Oh, my god.

77
00:05:57,421 --> 00:06:00,190
Father!

78
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:11,419
Shoot that maniac!

79
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:28,190
JoJo.

80
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:30,525
Father.

81
00:06:32,947 --> 00:06:34,355
This is all my fault.

82
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,120
I should have blocked his knife.

83
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,374
The mask. When I saw it, I froze up,

84
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:41,870
and you paid the price.

85
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:46,558
Take this ring.

86
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:50,101
It was your mother's, JoJo.

87
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:52,008
Father.

88
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:53,876
Damn it.

89
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:56,066
Ain't a doctor on earth who can fix that.

90
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:58,124
How'd that devil get the drop on us?

91
00:06:58,149 --> 00:06:59,381
It's all my fault.

92
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:02,459
If only I hadn't listened to you, sir Joestar.

93
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:09,065
If I had run his father out of town years ago like
I'd a mind to, none of this would have taken place.

94
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:10,940
Hold on. Whose father?

95
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,927
Back when I first joined the force,

96
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:19,160
there was a never‐do‐well who tried to pawn
that very ring you now see on Joestar's finger.

97
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:23,688
The suspect was Dio's birth father, Dario Brando.

98
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:26,551
It's mine.

99
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:27,955
Of that, there's no doubt.

100
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:31,905
My late wife and I had them
made to celebrate our betrothal.

101
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:36,598
A local cutpurse by the name of
Dario Brando ‐ was trying to sell it.

102
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,046
Hmm?

103
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,429
Can it be?

104
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:42,860
Sir Joestar thought he owed his life to Dario,

105
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,567
but he was sadly mistaken.

106
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:50,369
Dario hadn't scrambled down to the mangled
carriage that fateful night to look for survivors,

107
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:52,837
but to root for ill‐gotten riches.

108
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,783
Huh?

109
00:07:54,513 --> 00:07:55,569
You stay back.

110
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:59,576
This man, what has he said, inspector?

111
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:02,499
Did he ever tell you that I gave him the ring?

112
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:04,452
Aye. He swore up and down.

113
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:06,058
You filthy liar.

114
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,923
He swore with good reason.

115
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:10,364
I gave him the ring, just as he told you.

116
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:12,285
You have got to be kidding!

117
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:12,905
Eh?

118
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:14,763
He is innocent.

119
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:17,146
Let him go at once, inspector.

120
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,846
But, sir, this man stole from you.

121
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:22,580
But for providence's hand in my life,

122
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,914
I might as well have done the same.

123
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:30,692
Sell this ring if you may ease your family's burden by it.

124
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,721
Walk an honest path henceforth, and I give it gladly.

125
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:40,649
He knew he didn't owe Dario a damn thing,

126
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:43,151
and he took Dio in all the same.

127
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,382
Father, hang on.

128
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,575
The doctor is on his way now.

129
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:51,752
JoJo, don't hate Dio for what he's done.

130
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:53,974
I am to blame for this.

131
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:58,742
I was hard on you, because you are a Joestar.

132
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:03,389
I went too easy on Dio, and he
might have felt I didn't care.

133
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:07,641
Perhaps he did this for want of a father's love.

134
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:12,811
Please, see that he's buried next to Dario.

135
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:15,610
Father.

136
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:21,519
Don't look so sad, JoJo.

137
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:23,244
Where better to die

138
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:26,920
than in the arms of my son?

139
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:35,644
Sir Joestar!

140
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,793
We have lost much this night.

141
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:44,338
A noble man's soul has been taken from the world.

142
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:45,925
You're wrong!

143
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,792
All that was good in that man,

144
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,066
he passed it along to Jonathan, every bit of it!

145
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:52,916
You can be sure.

146
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:56,988
JoJo's gonna live an upright
life using what his father gave him.

147
00:09:57,706 --> 00:09:59,091
Rich folks are rubbish.

148
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:03,010
Watching 'em flounce around, I wanna
throw the whole lot of them into the thames,

149
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,443
but not the Joestars.

150
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,613
They're heroic and merciful and just.

151
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:11,211
The whole damn lot are giants among men.

152
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:15,488
What the hell?!

153
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:16,462
The body!

154
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:19,647
Dio's corpse, it... it vanished.

155
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,588
Oi, copper! Away from the window!

156
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:40,707
JoJo.

157
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:47,300
The inspector.

158
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:50,522
No, that's impossible!

159
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:51,510
How's he alive?

160
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:52,379
He can't be.

161
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:54,127
We all filled him full of bullets.

162
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:56,233
Keep your distance, lads.

163
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:57,426
He's armed with something.

164
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,064
Was it the mask?

165
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,966
He's coming right at us!

166
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:07,235
What are you waiting for?

167
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,005
Hit 'em with everything you've got left!

168
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:11,021
Come no closer.

169
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:17,274
Not another step! I mean it.

170
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:20,489
Blow his brains out now!

171
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,555
Do it before he kills us all!

172
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:48,458
Mmm.

173
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:55,160
Shot 'em in the head, and it didn't even slow him down.

174
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:56,986
It doesn't make any sense.

175
00:11:57,106 --> 00:12:00,620
With all the lead we put him,
he should be worm food by now.

176
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,652
How can this be?

177
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,321
JoJo...

178
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,921
I should thank you for the source of my newfound power,

179
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:12,709
your father's blood and the ancient mask.

180
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:21,425
He takes his very life.

181
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,982
But how is that possible?

182
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:24,921
Dio, you villain...

183
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,661
What sort of monster have you become?!

184
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,506
How did this happen?

185
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:43,050
Think, JoJo. Think.

186
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:47,224
The knife, father, blood, Dio, the mask,

187
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:48,884
my notes, the brain,

188
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,774
unknown abilities, unknown strength.

189
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,482
There is nothing human left of you, Dio!

190
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,142
Father.

191
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:12,236
Don't do it, JoJo!

192
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:13,983
You haven't got a chance in hell.

193
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:16,176
I never seen anything like this, lad.

194
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:19,652
He broke those coppers to pieces
like they was bleeding' twigs.

195
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,308
I know.

196
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:24,548
Honestly, I'm terrified.

197
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:28,257
All the same, I can't let Dio kill anyone else.

198
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,491
This demon must be annihilated!

199
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:32,260
Please, JoJo, I beg of ya.

200
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:33,659
He'll tear you apart!

201
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:35,442
That's it.

202
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:37,910
According to my research on the mask,

203
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:41,003
it was fabled to unlock the brain's hidden potential.

204
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,823
To vanquish Dio, all I have to do is...

205
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:53,958
This one's alive.

206
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:54,992
Your blood,

207
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:58,257
it smells so delicious.

208
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:09,426
Now I'm going to turn you inside out.

209
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:22,903
He was my brother.

210
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:24,150
Look at him now.

211
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:28,630
Father, please lend me the strength to do what I must.

212
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:31,751
Courage, JoJo.

213
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,192
Dio is powerful, but you know how to end him,

214
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:37,184
and end him you must!

215
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,298
Watch out!

216
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,174
It's over.

217
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:45,082
I'm not going to let you kill anyone else, Dio!

218
00:14:48,548 --> 00:14:50,342
He caught the sodding' spear.

219
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:53,876
Right through the hand, and he don't even flinch.

220
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:57,254
No way. The hole from where I shot him in the head,

221
00:14:57,694 --> 00:14:58,858
it's healed up.

222
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:00,855
That spear ain't gonna hurt him.

223
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:02,182
He's immortal.

224
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:08,641
You're such a weakling, JoJo.

225
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:18,228
On your feet, insect.

226
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:21,970
I've yet to gauge the full extent of my new powers,

227
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:24,748
so let's play a little longer, shall we?

228
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,255
I trust you'll be long since
dead by the time I figure them out.

229
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:30,352
Hmm?

230
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:33,577
Hiding, are we?

231
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:35,404
Hmm.

232
00:15:48,342 --> 00:15:50,302
You were a fool to attack me.

233
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:55,090
I have disowned my weakness in favor of life everlasting.

234
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,062
You're behind the curtain, like Polonius,

235
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:01,295
and, like Polonius, it is there
that you shall meet your end.

236
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,353
No one's immortal, not even you.

237
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:20,546
He's able to heal faster than the flames can hurt him.

238
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:23,692
If that ain't immortality, then I'm the queen.

239
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,155
Fire hurts him, but not enough.

240
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:35,596
JoJo! What are you doing?!

241
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:37,444
Just get to safety, Speedwagon.

242
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:40,201
If Dio wants a fight, I mean to give him one.

243
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:59,732
What are you doing? Are you mad?

244
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:02,259
The flames are gonna box you in up there.

245
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:08,375
JoJo, you brave fool,

246
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:10,448
I hope to hell you've got a plan.

247
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:17,050
I'm waiting for you, Dio.

248
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,670
Know this. It ends here.

249
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:30,324
I will not allow you to leave this mansion alive.

250
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,864
No, that's lunacy!

251
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,779
Luring me away from the gutter rat?

252
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:43,105
How very noble of you.

253
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:44,917
No matter.

254
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:47,723
Hah.

255
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:49,594
I'll drain you dry,

256
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:53,345
and your blood will help me
mend from this little adventure.

257
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:58,412
You climb the wall in vain, JoJo.

258
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,822
In your haste to flee from me, all
you have done is guaranteed your doom.

259
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,684
You will be consumed tonight,
by the inferno below or by me.

260
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:11,806
Father.

261
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:19,647
Father, rest in peace.

262
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:22,867
Let the rising smoke guide your soul to heaven.

263
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:27,880
But first, please, lend me your aid one final time.

264
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:31,445
Let the fire burn with your strength.

265
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,890
What does he mean to accomplish up there?

266
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:40,017
No, that's crazy!

267
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,710
You're throwing' your life away!

268
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:45,414
Don't do it! Don't do it, JoJo!

269
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:50,164
Any moment now.

270
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,548
Useless. You fight as though you want to die.

271
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:06,102
In that moment, JoJo's short life flashed before his eyes.

272
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:17,058
My lonely youth,

273
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:18,768
my time with Dio.

274
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:21,667
You did me wrong time and again,

275
00:19:21,803 --> 00:19:23,708
so now I'll settle the score.

276
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:28,894
The longer the fire burns, the
hotter it gets, and JoJo knows it.

277
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:35,345
He means to use the mansion as a funeral pyre and
burn the devil faster than he can replenish himself.

278
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:38,397
And now that the house is hot enough,

279
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:40,473
he's gonna knock him back in.

280
00:19:41,902 --> 00:19:43,530
JoJo!

281
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,348
How dare you lay your hands on me, you insect?!

282
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:54,470
The only home I've ever known
will be in ashes before the dawn.

283
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,654
Father is dead, and I am alone.

284
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,387
I have nothing left to lose...

285
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,801
But my life itself.

286
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:06,640
We go to the flames together, Dio!

287
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:10,294
I'll gladly die if it means an end to your evil!

288
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:14,530
Die for nothing, fool!

289
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:20,639
All I lose by your sacrifice
is the blood I would have taken.

290
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:24,975
Blacken and burn among the bones
of your damnable father, JoJo!

291
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,949
I am a god in all but name.

292
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:32,349
With the powers at my command, I will rule this world.

293
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,921
Thank you, brother, for this great boon.

294
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:48,839
Damn it.

295
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,279
Dio! I'm not done with you!

296
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:58,372
Why won't you die already?!

297
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,660
There's no escape, Dio.

298
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:05,034
You brought this doom upon yourself.

299
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:07,735
This is the knife you used to kill my father!

300
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,547
So as you did to the man who
raised us both, I now do unto you!

301
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:24,305
I've crushed his arm bones to splinters,

302
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,878
and he's already ablaze,

303
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:28,601
but his grip on me is still that of a vise.

304
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,331
So be it, JoJo.

305
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:33,409
Consign us both unto the flames.

306
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:35,999
But perish knowing I will survive this moment.

307
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:40,623
For everything you have done,
even this inferno cannot devour me!

308
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:46,600
Father! Lend me your power!

309
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:49,059
His desperate cry echoed in the night.

310
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:55,208
Whether urged on by his departed father or
heeding an instinct borne of a long familiarity

311
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:57,675
with the home which burned around him,

312
00:21:57,857 --> 00:21:58,643
he kicked...

313
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:01,454
And that put them right in line with...

314
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:03,990
What the...

315
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:08,379
The statue of the Joestar family's guardian angel.

316
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:15,181
How could a worm like you...

317
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,057
I... I forgot who I was dealing with.

318
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:24,619
Bloody his nose, and he comes back twice as fierce.

319
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:28,090
JoJo!

320
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:31,196
I had such plans for this world,

321
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:34,190
such plans...

322
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:41,737
JoJo.

323
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:46,575
It's over.

324
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:47,950
You're alive.

325
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,182
You lucky bastard.

326
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:52,865
He did it.

327
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:57,321
JoJo bested him!

328
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:10,157
I'll be the roundabout

329
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:14,109
the words will make you out and out

330
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:19,538
I spend the day your way

331
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:26,634
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

332
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:37,127
The music dance and sing

333
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:41,197
they make the children really ring

334
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:46,498
I spend the day your way

335
00:23:46,523 --> 00:23:55,775
call it morning driving through the sound
and in and out the valley in and around the lake

336
00:23:56,682 --> 00:24:01,071
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

337
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:07,675
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

338
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:14,147
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

339
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:19,671
24 before my love you'll see

340
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:23,492
I'll be there with you

341
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:42,098
There it is.

342
00:25:00,904 --> 00:25:02,883
Courage is to look your fear in the eye.

343
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:05,979
Dio's evil, yeah, but this guy is far worse.

344
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,855
Prepare for the carnage!

345
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,960
Who do I look like?

346
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:11,555
I beg of you, teach me how to wield it.
