1
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:07,314
Seven years later, in 1888...

2
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:14,610
Jack the Ripper stalked the streets
of London, murdering women in the night

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,401
and holding the entire city in his thrall.

4
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:21,768
However, he was nothing compared to the horror

5
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:25,936
that the feud between JoJo and Dio
would unleash upon the world.

6
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:09,246
Interception!

7
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:15,276
The ball is plucked out of the air
by our hero, Jonathan Joestar!

8
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:26,442
Joestar, a gentle giant at 195 centimeters,
sprints for the try zone with a spirited roar!

9
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:30,199
Can he win this, the last game of his university career?

10
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:33,586
He's tackled from behind!

11
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:37,234
Wait! He's still standing tall.

12
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:39,252
Two more fly in.

13
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:42,433
It's three on one out there!

14
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:45,573
Huh?

15
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:47,379
Eh?

16
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,155
Incredible!

17
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:54,227
He's still making for the try line,
undaunted by the men who dog his steps.

18
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:59,288
What power. What determination. He's Hercules reborn.

19
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,496
Another tackle!

20
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:05,201
Oh, the weight's too much for him!

21
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,570
He flings it away, and...

22
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,494
Yes! There's the catch.

23
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,577
The ball lands safe in the hands of Dio Brando.

24
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:19,633
It's still anyone's game!

25
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:25,238
Can he make it?

26
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:27,930
He dodges one and another!

27
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:29,180
He's done it!

28
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:33,698
There's nothing left between Dio and the
try line, and still he gives it his all.

29
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:34,867
Yes!

30
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:37,775
They did it!

31
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,684
On the last play, they snatched
victory out of the jaws of defeat.

32
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:44,945
What teamwork. When JoJo and Dio work together,

33
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,924
there's nothing they can't do.

34
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,559
Hell of a pass, JoJo.

35
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:50,908
All for naught if you hadn't run it in like you did.

36
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:54,318
Watching you drag those defenders,
I couldn't just let you down.

37
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:59,041
Having finished his studies, Dio is
set to graduate with top marks in law.

38
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:04,514
JoJo, meanwhile, has set the faculty
afire with his bold thesis on archeology.

39
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,572
On and off the field, these two young men are giants.

40
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:10,556
They're the pride of our school.

41
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:14,949
JoJo, I think we should tell our
father about this victory of ours at once.

42
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,079
It's been seven years now since my
father welcomed Dio into our home,

43
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:28,087
seven long years.

44
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:31,075
I smile and treat him as a brother,

45
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,654
but in my heart, nothing could be further from the truth.

46
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:38,489
He's nothing if not affable and smart as a whip...

47
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,016
But I just can't forgive him for his early villainies.

48
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:50,468
Dio, mightn't you give us a quote
about your friendship with JoJo?

49
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:51,826
You seem quite close.

50
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,036
Write about the team, all of us.

51
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,581
Come on. Tell us how close you are.

52
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:58,454
Hmm. Should I?

53
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:00,152
Heh.

54
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:01,965
Friendship, huh?

55
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:06,257
The truth is I despise this grinning imbecile.

56
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:10,587
I've spent seven years making
nice to that Joestar brat.

57
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:15,602
But now that I am of age,
I shall bring my plans to fruition.

58
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:22,660
At long last, the Joestar fortune will be mine,
and devil take anyone who tries to stop me.

59
00:05:28,183 --> 00:05:30,727
Father, how are you feeling today?

60
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:35,106
But for this cough, much improved over yesterday.

61
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:39,169
The doctors say I should be in the hospital.

62
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:42,112
Why? I fear it would do you no good.

63
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:45,157
Hospitals only care about profit.

64
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:48,395
They'd measure you for a shroud ere they saw you cured.

65
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:50,884
Hmm. Then here I shall remain.

66
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:53,757
The comforts of home are curative, like as not.

67
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:58,604
My chest doesn't pain me so,
and the swelling has gone down.

68
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:00,826
I'm on the mend.

69
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:02,231
It was just a cold.

70
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:03,976
Why has it worsened so?

71
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,010
I heard tell of your victory.

72
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,581
Stunning bit of teamwork.

73
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,902
Someone told you about it?

74
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:14,325
I got word straightaway from an old college chum.

75
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:16,341
Whoever he is, he's fast.

76
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:19,367
I'm glad he wasn't on our
opponents' team, or we could have lost.

77
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,567
I'm proud of you, lads.

78
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:24,821
You both turned out so well.

79
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,517
Providence is too kind.

80
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:29,963
Dio, I'm so glad you've thrived.

81
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:33,202
Pursue your ambitions, whatever they may be.

82
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:37,019
I will lend you aid in any way I can, my son.

83
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:40,166
You rescued me from calamity.

84
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:42,988
Already my debt is more than I can ever repay.

85
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:46,020
You do me too much honor.

86
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,475
This secret is mine alone.

87
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:07,574
I can't imagine for what purpose this
mask may have been fashioned or by whom.

88
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:09,756
But it belonged to my mother,

89
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:13,700
and so having it near is a
comfort, strange as that may seem.

90
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,602
When I finally outwit this sphinx of a mask,

91
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,595
it will be the talk of the archeological world.

92
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,868
My goodness!

93
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:31,800
Many thanks to you, master Dio.

94
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:34,247
The years betray me.

95
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,342
Climbing the stairs is much harder than it was before.

96
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:43,721
This letter, having read it, all has been made clear.

97
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:45,927
Dio...

98
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:48,760
I think he's...

99
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:57,869
Dio!

100
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,237
Wait. That's...

101
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,652
That's father's medicine.

102
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,612
He's due for his next dosage.

103
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:10,891
All this time, you're the one
who's been bringing it to him.

104
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,542
Yes. What of it?

105
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:15,629
This letter, your father sent it to mine.

106
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:17,122
Guess what it says.

107
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:20,645
"Your lordship, sickness has laid me right low.

108
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,464
"It's the end of me, whatever it is.

109
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:29,951
"My chest hurts, "my fingers're all swollen up,
and I can't breathe, but for all this coughing."

110
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:33,790
Those are the same symptoms as father's, blow for blow!

111
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:35,754
No way is this mere coincidence.

112
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,688
Dio!

113
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,094
What are you trying to say, JoJo?

114
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,661
I'm having a doctor look at this powder.

115
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:51,081
JoJo, if you think I would poison father,
then from this day forward, you and I...

116
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,924
Are friends no more!

117
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:57,943
Try as I might, I can't look Dio in the eye.

118
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,893
It's because I lack proof.

119
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:02,250
All I have to go on are my suspicions.

120
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:06,312
Now, then, if you put that medicine back on the tray,

121
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:10,248
I'll be willing to forget about your lapse in judgment.

122
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,416
Dio, there's only one way
you're going to convince me.

123
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:17,966
Swear to me that the contents of this are safe.

124
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,553
Do it in Dario's name.

125
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,387
Swear to me on Dario's honor as a gentleman.

126
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:25,029
Do that, and I'll never bring up this moment again.

127
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,941
If my hunch proves true, his father's honor
is the one lie that will catch in his throat.

128
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:35,138
Say it! What are you waiting for?

129
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:37,888
I s‐swear...

130
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:45,559
How can I swear on the honor
of a man who didn't have any?!

131
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:47,555
He deserved to die!

132
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,412
How's that for the truth, JoJo?!

133
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:56,183
You just gave me all the proof I needed, Dio.

134
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:59,176
At hearing his name, you lashed out.

135
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,977
I don't know what he could have done that moved you
to such murderous rage, but murder him, you surely did.

136
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,884
You hurt father. Never again, Dio.

137
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:24,545
Damn your eyes.

138
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:29,112
Of course. You've been planning
to murder him for years now.

139
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:32,162
I knew it. I knew that you were playing false with us.

140
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:34,245
But now your villainy is over.

141
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:39,144
Once I've learned what this is, i'm
taking it to the police straightaway.

142
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:42,946
Damn it.

143
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:45,372
Their fortune was within my grasp.

144
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,487
Was it fate that JoJo found out when he did?

145
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:52,530
No. It was that letter.

146
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:54,872
He vexes me even now.

147
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,272
You're weak, just like your mother!

148
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:01,072
He drove her to an early grave.

149
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:05,112
Knowing that cur's blood flows through my veins,

150
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:07,131
it's enough to drive me mad!

151
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:15,990
Sir Joestar lives for now.

152
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,329
I'll be back from London in a few days, father.

153
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,628
'Til then, accept medicine only from
the hands of these doctors and no one else.

154
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,699
Master JoJo said he doesn't want me to bring it up?

155
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:39,377
Yes. We will do as JoJo has instructed us.

156
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:43,376
His reasons are a mystery to me,

157
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,698
but I trust the boy with my life.

158
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,227
Thank you, father.

159
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:51,546
His illness is getting worse.

160
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:56,965
If it is a poison, he may need an antidote.

161
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:04,346
Whatever you may learn in London about the poison,

162
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,538
I'll see you take the truth of it to your grave.

163
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,439
Your death will be the perfect crime.

164
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,005
Seven years ago, this mask reacted to my blood.

165
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:20,596
The spikes hidden within will
make short work of JoJo's brain.

166
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:25,644
His injuries will be so unique,
there'll be nothing at all to tie it back to me.

167
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:31,545
JoJo, your curiosity will lead to your destruction.

168
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:34,912
Whoa. Whoa.

169
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:40,704
The university couldn't identify the so‐called medicine,

170
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:44,919
though they did speculate that
it was a compound from the orient.

171
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:46,807
Therefore...

172
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,934
Young master, that stretch of road there is ogre street,

173
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,469
the most dangerous alleyway in all of London.

174
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:57,806
Yes, I know, but this is the one place
I will be able to find what I came for.

175
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,506
You're more than welcome to leave.

176
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:01,027
Hmm?

177
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:03,760
Dio grew up in London.

178
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:06,989
Where else in England could he have acquired such a toxin?

179
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:11,672
I shall have my evidence... and father's antidote.

180
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:15,935
Another dead end.

181
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:25,395
That cat... it was eating a puppy.

182
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:31,366
You do the honors, tattoo.

183
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:32,117
Right!

184
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:34,622
Use that shiv of yours to slice him open.

185
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,674
I want his guts for garters!

186
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,828
Ogre street. It is aptly named.

187
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,240
Check out this idiot! He grabbed my blade!

188
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:51,635
In all my days, I've never seen the like.

189
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,047
Ha ha ha! Stuck, ain't ya?

190
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:58,392
One quick yank of the knife, and they'll be
picking your fingers out of the snow for a fortnight.

191
00:13:58,417 --> 00:13:59,520
Try it, then.

192
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:04,909
The moment you pull, my foot will kick out at
your groin with all the force of a sledgehammer.

193
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,313
I'm willing to see our transaction through.

194
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,248
Are you, sirrah?

195
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,824
I'm fighting to protect my
family from those who wish it harm.

196
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:14,874
I doubt very much that your resolve is equal to mine.

197
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,693
That's quite enough.

198
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:24,676
Now tell me, one of you, where
can I find an Asian apothecary?

199
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:25,715
Tough talk.

200
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,769
If you're looking to lose body parts, do stick around.

201
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:31,228
Observe.

202
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,768
I'll mince ya right finely with a tip of the hat.

203
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,195
And now, we dance.

204
00:14:46,287 --> 00:14:49,759
I have to find that apothecary, no matter the cost.

205
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,880
Don't tell me this here's your first proper dust‐up.

206
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:56,678
If you mean to block like that,
it'll be your last one, too.

207
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:02,379
Ha ha!

208
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:04,544
Cut ya straight to the bone, looks like.

209
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:09,820
Granted, I didn't think you'd hoof the shiv at
me like that, but my chapeau still hit its mark.

210
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:18,860
Now I know why he weren't defending himself better.

211
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:23,061
Fingers, hands, legs, he don't
care one whit what he loses.

212
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,531
It's as if his resolve runs deeper than pain or fear.

213
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:29,085
I took the lad for an easy mark.

214
00:15:29,216 --> 00:15:32,220
Guess I've been right disabused of that notion.

215
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,981
What? JoJo went to ogre street on his own?

216
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,788
I told him it was perilous.

217
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,673
Keep this to yourself. Sir Joestar is still unwell.

218
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,501
Yes, sir.

219
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:56,030
I guess I won't need to use the mask after all.

220
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:59,556
There, alone? His fate is sealed.

221
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,212
That's enough, lads!

222
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:09,013
I won't let a single one of ya
lay a finger on that gentleman there.

223
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:11,129
But why?

224
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:12,682
Tell me something.

225
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:16,145
Strong as a bull, you are. It's plain to see.

226
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:19,064
You coulda stove my head in with that foot of yours,

227
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:20,925
but you went easy on me, didn't you?

228
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,817
I came here for the sake of my father.

229
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:31,422
You have a family, people who expect
you to return from this dark business.

230
00:16:32,215 --> 00:16:34,765
It is not my place to cause them grief.

231
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:37,113
He means it, don't he?

232
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:39,751
How'd this fella survive so long?

233
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:40,545
Wait.

234
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:45,901
He spared my mates' lives, just like he did mine.

235
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:51,967
I like the cut of his jib. Sure, he's naive,
but he's a gentleman through an' through, this one.

236
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:55,482
I wanna know the name of him who spared me.

237
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:58,658
Jonathan Joestar.

238
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:01,595
Well, pleased to make your acquaintance.

239
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,892
If it's Asian concoctions
you're looking for, mind your back.

240
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,625
That druggist is one sly customer.

241
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:13,329
Sir Joestar, JoJo's been gone three days.

242
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,918
Whatever his errand, he'll accomplish it.

243
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:18,174
Heh. Where have the years gone, I wonder?

244
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,137
He's grown into a fine man.

245
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:24,329
I cannot help but wonder if I
was too hard on the boy growing up.

246
00:17:35,524 --> 00:17:39,300
I'm sure JoJo's laying dead in some alley by now.

247
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:42,045
Did he find the apothecary?

248
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:45,419
Look at me. Swilling it down.

249
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:49,744
Nothing but a drunken fool, just like my bastard father.

250
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,595
Damn it!

251
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:54,610
Watch yourself!

252
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:57,671
Or have you no respect for your elders, boy?

253
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:03,825
Look at the baby toddling around past bedtime,
sucking on a bottle like it was his mother's teat.

254
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:06,676
Look at the man when he's talking.

255
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:08,483
Didn't your old man teach you right?

256
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:12,513
My god.

257
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:15,682
Just for that, I'm gonna take your face clean off ya.

258
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:20,354
Oh. Your threat has me quaking
in my boots, you old guttersnipe.

259
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:23,619
How will I escape this moment of mortal peril?

260
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:27,921
How about... we use this?

261
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:32,105
It's meant for JoJo, but
you'll make a fine guinea pig.

262
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,874
Just die already!

263
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:34,906
Eh?

264
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:38,176
Let's see what you can do!

265
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,023
W‐what is that light?

266
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:05,946
All of that spectacle for nothing?

267
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,252
Useless.

268
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:10,331
That was boring.

269
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:12,883
I expected more from you, mask.

270
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,313
Impossible.

271
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,651
He's alive.

272
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:41,631
That face. Those teeth.

273
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:43,671
No!

274
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,355
What incredible strength.

275
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:06,882
Even now, he advances.

276
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:10,077
But his hand... does the pain mean nothing?

277
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:13,862
He shattered my shoulder with but a glancing blow.

278
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:18,673
The river. I must jump in.

279
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,400
It's odd.

280
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:31,841
I was drinking through the night,
but suddenly I got such a brutal thirst.

281
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:34,135
My blood, he's draining it.

282
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:38,172
What the...

283
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,914
So this is the secret of the mask.

284
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:43,903
I'm dying.

285
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:50,828
No! I had such plans!

286
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:54,155
Must my last sight on earth be this damnable sunrise?!

287
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:14,946
The sun destroyed him.

288
00:21:36,203 --> 00:21:37,710
What's the meaning of this?

289
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:39,604
Why's it so bloody dark?

290
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:44,266
JoJo.

291
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:46,533
You're a poisoner, Dio Brando.

292
00:21:47,134 --> 00:21:49,569
I have all the proof I require and then some.

293
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:12,308
I'll be the roundabout

294
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:16,260
the words will make you out and out

295
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:21,689
I spend the day your way

296
00:22:21,714 --> 00:22:28,785
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

297
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:39,278
The music dance and sing

298
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:43,348
they make the children really ring

299
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:48,649
I spend the day your way

300
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:57,926
call it morning driving through the sound
and in and out the valley in and around the lake

301
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:03,222
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

302
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:09,826
one mile over, we'll be there and we'll see you

303
00:23:12,427 --> 00:23:16,290
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

304
00:23:18,886 --> 00:23:21,822
24 before, my love, you'll see

305
00:23:21,854 --> 00:23:25,650
I'll be there with you

306
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:32,928
JoJo, I've been a devil, but grant me this one wish.

307
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,923
This fellow reeks of brimstone and blood.

308
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:38,105
You see, I am about to become so much more!

309
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,421
Dio!
