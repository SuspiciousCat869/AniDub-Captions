1
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:06,210
JoJo...

2
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:10,718
I've heard so much about you.

3
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:15,224
Listen, and listen good.

4
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:18,471
Santviento here, the so‐called pillar man,

5
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:21,468
uses a mask to turn men into vampires.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,994
He does this to make them
stronger, und then he devours them.

7
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:28,434
Destroy him! Take him out while there's still time!

8
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:35,035
Don't do it, JoJo! He's dangerous!

9
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:40,532
You're it.

10
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:45,099
Oh, I get it.

11
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:47,567
You're one of those strong, silent types, right?

12
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:50,328
Ever thought about modeling? You've got a nice look there.

13
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:53,253
Come on. Let's see what you got. Give me a smile.

14
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:54,920
I know you can do it.

15
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:56,487
Show me some vulnerability.

16
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:57,721
Work with me here.

17
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,442
Make some love to the camera.

18
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:00,928
Ready? Set?

19
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:03,183
Give me happy. Now be silly.

20
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,132
Show us those pearly whites.

21
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:05,926
Heh.

22
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:40,743
Come on, big guy. Smile at the birdie.

23
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,038
JoJo, stop this nonsense immediately!

24
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,213
Don't provoke him.

25
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,438
Please, JoJo, Santviento is dangerous.

26
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:51,507
Yeah, I know you think he's dangerous, but
I have a theory that maybe he's not so bad.

27
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,127
Let me test something out here.

28
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:57,106
I don't want to assume he's evil just
because he killed a bunch of brainless...

29
00:02:57,131 --> 00:02:58,427
What are you, insane?!

30
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,564
If he's not evil, why did he kill all my men?!

31
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:04,694
Don't know. Some would say you're
responsible for what's happened.

32
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:09,453
Weren't you the one experimenting on him and
trying to blast him away in the first place?

33
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:11,391
Not that I really care about that.

34
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,212
The only reason I'm here to make sure that
Speedwagon makes it back to New York safe and sound.

35
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:20,788
Anyway, I'm not here to fight, and I'm feeling generous.

36
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:22,838
Come on. Loosen up, big guy.

37
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,825
How 'bout that smile?

38
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:31,929
That was rude.

39
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,543
He just walked through me like I wasn't even there.

40
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:36,712
Who the hell does this guy think he is?

41
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,033
Maybe I should teach him a quick lesson.

42
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,447
Have a nice trip.

43
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:47,452
Wh... what the hell was that?

44
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,907
That was the weirdest feeling, and it hurt.

45
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:01,338
What is this, this tool?

46
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:05,235
Cold and long... with many different pieces.

47
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,462
He does understand!

48
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,372
He's not simply mimicking.

49
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:12,930
It took him practically no time at
all to completely master our language.

50
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:18,603
How... how is he doing that?

51
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:20,209
He took it apart.

52
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,738
He dismantled that entire
weapon like some expert gunsmith.

53
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:28,223
It takes a soldier dozens of hours to
learn how to field strip his weapon that fast.

54
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:31,736
He's... he's using his advanced
intellect to learn everything.

55
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:34,072
So bright.

56
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,771
This light is new to me.

57
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:37,964
What is it?

58
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,997
Don't you see?

59
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:41,396
We weren't the ones observing all this time.

60
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:44,433
He was actually watching us!

61
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:48,541
Hey, big guy, you wanna learn a new joke?

62
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:50,598
Just stop me if you've heard this one before.

63
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,839
Knock, knock. Knock, knock.

64
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:54,904
JoJo! Get away!

65
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,493
You are playing games, primitive.

66
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:01,276
I do not want to play games.

67
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:05,629
What the...

68
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:10,737
Rib blades, sometimes known as fighting ribs.

69
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,915
They are capable of being manipulated in any direction.

70
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,163
JoJo!

71
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,576
Sparks. Energy.

72
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:28,785
This human seems...

73
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:30,717
Different from the others.

74
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,697
I was not able to absorb his body into mine.

75
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:36,778
He just flew away.

76
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:42,847
And somehow his leg, it remains... it still seems fine.

77
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,633
This one is something new.

78
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:48,418
I have yet to see such a human.

79
00:05:48,743 --> 00:05:50,714
Is he a unique specimen,

80
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:55,869
or do all humans of his particular
class possess the same properties?

81
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,375
Could it be related to age?

82
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:05,562
Ah, now I see.

83
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:07,342
My instinct was right.

84
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:09,791
That human is unique.

85
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:12,491
Agh. JoJo, please.

86
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:14,763
Make it stop, please!

87
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:18,917
Speedwagon.

88
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:20,945
That bastard.

89
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:23,717
Let the old man go, Santviento!

90
00:06:24,504 --> 00:06:25,841
Now I'm in the mood.

91
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:29,065
Come on, big guy. You wanna try and take me on?

92
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:30,906
It would seem

93
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:35,054
that humans have evolved their confidence.

94
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:38,240
Hope you're hungry!

95
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:41,522
One hamon sandwich coming up!

96
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,425
Huh? What the devil?

97
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,601
My hamon is making that blood float.

98
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,203
Something's wrong here.

99
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:58,031
My hamon is running off him like rain off a raincoat.

100
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,726
He's somehow repelling it and
pushing it into all of this blood.

101
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:03,126
I don't understand it.

102
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,666
His skin is acting like a ground.

103
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:08,660
Somehow, it's behaving just like Straizo's scarf.

104
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:14,334
My body and his body seem to
be repelling against one other.

105
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,691
What... what have you done to my hand?!

106
00:07:24,138 --> 00:07:26,054
Wait. It's...

107
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,000
Still there.

108
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,846
But check it out. I can completely remove my thumb.

109
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,952
Doesn't anyone have a sense of humor left?

110
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:39,043
Come on, guys. This is funny stuff here.

111
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,340
But seriously, folks.

112
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:45,612
Lucky thing I rolled my wrist just in time.

113
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,528
The beast's immune to hamon.

114
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:49,847
That's not true, JoJo.

115
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:51,324
Don't you see?

116
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:53,376
It was hamon that was protecting you.

117
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:56,815
It kept your body from being
completely absorbed into that thing.

118
00:07:57,118 --> 00:08:00,224
Idiot! It's like eating a blowfish for him.

119
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:04,242
He's knows he must kill it first
und then remove the poison parts.

120
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:08,015
That is how Santviento plans on absorbing JoJo's body.

121
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:13,365
Well, too bad for him I'm not a blowfish.

122
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,851
Regardless, I need to think of something fast here.

123
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:18,375
Maybe it's time to make my emergency escape.

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,751
You can't do that!

125
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:24,201
The danger of Santviento escaping is
too high, no one leaves until he's dead!

126
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:24,851
Ah, shut up!

127
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:29,221
You released this monster, and now you're
saying you need someone else to clean up the mess?

128
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:32,264
I don't need anything else on my plate, Von Stroheim.

129
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,384
Let's see if I can inject some hamon
into his system with something sharp.

130
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,685
His skin is malleable like rubber.

131
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,760
See if you can dodge this one, big guy!

132
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:52,246
How about a dose of hamon right in the eye?!

133
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:54,820
I hope you're ready for your can't... miss close‐up.

134
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:59,779
What? That's impossible.

135
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:02,314
Even his eyes feel like they're some kind of rubber.

136
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,537
JoJo, get out of there right now!

137
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:08,651
JoJo!

138
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,783
That hit to the solar plexus
completely knocked the wind out of him.

139
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:14,658
Hmm.

140
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:18,647
He seems to create his own energy.

141
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:20,966
He controls it with his breathing.

142
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:27,393
But lying there now unconscious, he
is as vulnerable as any other human.

143
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:30,929
JoJo! You've got to use your hamon breathing!

144
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,240
You've got to breathe! Ohh!

145
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:41,736
Use your hamon breathing! Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

146
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,809
No, there's no stopping him.

147
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,867
I've got to initiate the self‐destruct sequence.

148
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:57,299
For the fatherland und for eternal glo...

149
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:59,221
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

150
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:02,319
Everyone just calm down here.

151
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:04,469
Looks like my gamble paid off.

152
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:07,088
Figuring that attacks from outside are no good,

153
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:10,601
I'm going to send some hamon into
him while he tries to enjoy his meal.

154
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:11,827
JoJo!

155
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,866
I waited for you to start devouring me.

156
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:16,559
This is gonna be fun.

157
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:18,696
Enjoy your hamon blast!

158
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:38,527
I... I think I get it.

159
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:41,529
Now that I've seen him from the inside, I understand.

160
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:44,135
His whole body is one big digestive system.

161
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,656
Every one of his cells,

162
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,473
they'reall filled with aggressive digestive
enzymes, making it possible to dissolve his prey.

163
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:54,734
It looks like he's absorbing them,
when actually he's digesting them whole.

164
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:59,020
Hamon. That was what kept me from being digested.

165
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:01,670
I sent it inside him when he tried to eat me.

166
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:04,029
JoJo, your hamon wasn't enough.

167
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:07,008
You have to find a way to completely destroy Santviento.

168
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:23,797
The separated parts of Santviento
are trying to connect to one another.

169
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:26,538
That's pretty much exactly what happened with Straizo.

170
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:29,915
Lucky me, I figured you would
try to go and do the same thing.

171
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,438
Von Stroheim!

172
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:36,429
Aah!

173
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:38,533
Come on! Get ahold of yourself!

174
00:11:38,827 --> 00:11:40,940
Does this thing have any weaknesses?

175
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,411
Uh, sunlight! Ja, that's it.

176
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,929
It was there on the walls of the cave.

177
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,042
Sunlight is his natural enemy.

178
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,592
The very reason he made the masks in
the first place was to conquer the sun.

179
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:53,444
Hmm.

180
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,501
Are you insane?! What are you doing?!

181
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:06,159
You can't let Santviento escape into the outside world!

182
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:10,271
On the contrary, I think he
needs to go on a nice sunlit stroll.

183
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,309
He's running out of breath.

184
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,358
He won't be able to control his hamon.

185
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:21,150
He hasn't had enough training with it.

186
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,571
This fight has completely exhausted him.

187
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:26,414
Cease this foolishness now,

188
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:28,677
you lowly primitive.

189
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:39,776
Remember, you must control your hamon breathing!

190
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,266
If I could breathe, I probably
wouldn't be so tired in the first place.

191
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,814
Come on, big guy.

192
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:48,015
I think we've all had just about enough of you.

193
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:54,214
But fortunately for me, we're just a few steps
away from the two of us catching some nice rays.

194
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:01,110
What the hell?

195
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,471
I can't move.

196
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:06,004
I feel so heavy.

197
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,205
What... what's happening to me?

198
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:13,717
Meat invade, also known as foul flesh.

199
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:16,244
They're pieces of his flesh.

200
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:20,407
They're... they're feeding on me.

201
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,188
You... you son of a...

202
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:26,494
Got to stay focused.

203
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:32,253
I never once imagined a human such
as you would be born during my slumber.

204
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:38,793
What?

205
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,684
Joestar, leave the rest to me, colonel Rudol Von Stroheim.

206
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:56,330
Opening the door will end all this.

207
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:59,654
Allow me to help you destroy this vile creature.

208
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,379
Wow, Von Stroheim.

209
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:02,935
I would have never thought...

210
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:07,773
Humph. Well attempted, primitives.

211
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,722
I can almost reach the door.

212
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:24,702
A meaningless struggle. Humph.

213
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:30,327
This is bad.

214
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:32,559
Joestar, get up.

215
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:34,609
Don't just lie there like a baby.

216
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:36,075
I'm trying to think here.

217
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,291
If you hadn't noticed, we're both in deep trouble.

218
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:39,680
Silence!

219
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,627
Do you see those axes on the wall next to you?

220
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:43,946
Reach up, und grab one.

221
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:46,552
Take one, und chop off my leg!

222
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:48,196
I... I can't do that!

223
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:52,867
You coward, cut off my leg. It's the
only way we're getting that door open.

224
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:57,745
Maybe you're right, but are you sure about
this? I mean, there has got to be some other way.

225
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,576
Do as I say!

226
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,613
He's recovering, Joestar.

227
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,196
But I'm no doctor. I've no idea how to do this right.

228
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:12,070
I am a proud servant of the Wehrmacht! I am
prepared to do whatever is required to fulfill my duty!

229
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:17,312
I proudly give up my leg for the
fatherland! Now hurry up before it's too late!

230
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,411
Damn it! Do it now, Joestar!

231
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:23,677
Okay, I'll do it.

232
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:27,335
If you really want me to chop it off, then off it goes.

233
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,663
I demand that you chop it off now!

234
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:33,321
I figured this guy was just some bloated powermonger,

235
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:36,349
but I gotta hand it to him. He's got guts.

236
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,510
I wish there were some other way.

237
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:40,640
But if he's courageous enough, then...

238
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,324
Forgive me!

239
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,994
Tell me, big guy, how does
that sunshine feel on your skin?

240
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,291
We did it.

241
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:22,428
What's he doing?

242
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:30,062
Help me! That monster is trying to crawl inside my leg!

243
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,745
Get outta there, you!

244
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,863
Whoa. This is a shock.

245
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,056
Von Stroheim's basically okay, and he's free of any hamon.

246
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:40,042
Huh?

247
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:48,858
Damn it, you get out of me, Santviento!

248
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,692
I... I can't believe this thing's willpower.

249
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:53,702
I've never seen anything like it.

250
00:16:55,894 --> 00:17:00,773
If he stays inside Von Stroheim, he'll be
totally fine even here in broad daylight.

251
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,385
I can feel him.

252
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:04,205
This can't be real.

253
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:07,531
Do you want to know what the worst part about this is?

254
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:10,017
My leg doesn't even hurt anymore.

255
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:12,802
It feels pleasant. You believe that?

256
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,293
My god.

257
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,462
Von Stroheim!

258
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:31,979
Wait. What are you doing?

259
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,125
Put it down, Von Stroheim.

260
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,753
Stay back!

261
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:40,380
You've seen what horrible things Santviento is capable of!

262
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:42,014
There is no hope!

263
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:44,147
My destiny has been determined!

264
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:48,409
So now all I can do is destroy the both of us!

265
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,611
But I have one more thing to
say to you before my time is done.

266
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:57,458
If you know what's good for
you, you listen close, Englishman.

267
00:17:58,014 --> 00:18:04,363
Our Wehrmacht, we... we did not awaken Santviento
simply for scientific research or military gain.

268
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:06,430
Then why?

269
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,477
Why did you risk it? Tell me!

270
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:13,491
Silence! It's your destiny to hear
these words from my lips, Joestar!

271
00:18:13,516 --> 00:18:16,032
Santviento is just the tip of the iceberg.

272
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:18,909
The Wehrmacht has discovered
another pillar in Europe. Agh!

273
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:22,761
We now know that Santviento is
not the only one of his kind around.

274
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,775
Wait. So there's more of them?!

275
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,426
Where are they? Tell me, Von Stroheim! Where?

276
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:32,692
I'm sorry, but I don't have that answer for you, Joestar.

277
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:37,748
There are more pillar men out there, und they
have powers that are beyond our wildest imagination.

278
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:42,855
For millennia, those powers have remained dormant,
but that won't last, und soon they will awaken.

279
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:48,074
You must find another weakness other
than just sunlight, or else hope is lost.

280
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:51,312
That's why we were experimenting on Santviento.

281
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:53,354
We were looking for that weakness.

282
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:55,951
There's a battle against the pillar men yet to be fought.

283
00:18:55,976 --> 00:18:59,217
The events of 50 years ago call upon you for that battle.

284
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:00,751
Listen to me.

285
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:03,903
You will need more than just your hamon to overcome them.

286
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:06,543
You must go to Rome!

287
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:09,082
There you will find someone who can help you!

288
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:12,985
It is someone that your Speedwagon knows very well.

289
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:21,263
Santviento is trying to move my body
into that well so he can hide again.

290
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,759
But he can't stop me from opening up my
body completely to let the sun shine in.

291
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:32,240
Von Stroheim...

292
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:34,003
Don't you dare.

293
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,640
"Human greatness lies in having
the courage to face down one's fears."

294
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:43,506
Do you know who said that?

295
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:45,198
The Greek historian Plutarch.

296
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:49,884
Farewell...

297
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:52,943
You annoying Englishman!

298
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:56,984
Don't do it! I still have questions for you! Von Stroheim!

299
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:03,117
Damn that crazy German and all his honor.

300
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:07,360
I'm sure that we could have found another way.

301
00:20:20,778 --> 00:20:23,603
Santviento!

302
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:27,136
You annoy me, primitive.

303
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:29,082
I will destroy you!

304
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:30,709
Steady your breathing.

305
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:32,510
Use your hamon technique.

306
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,751
Primitive, why oppose me?

307
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:51,857
You were doomed here from the start.

308
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:53,015
Hah!

309
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:55,438
I know just what you're going to say next.

310
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:58,735
You'll say, "I've seen right
through you all this time, Joestar."

311
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,161
I've seen right through you all this time, Joestar.

312
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,614
It's high noon over this well.

313
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:15,119
The sun reflecting off of the water should cook
you nicely, although I doubt you even thought of that.

314
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,418
You were thinking about jumping under the
nice cool water and getting out of the sun, right?

315
00:21:22,477 --> 00:21:24,628
Well, screw that idea.

316
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:27,179
I'm not letting you touch the water!

317
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:47,637
I'm alive, thanks to the sun.

318
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:49,743
He's a statue now.

319
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:53,119
But we finally got that smile.

320
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:14,480
I'll be the roundabout

321
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:18,432
the words will make you out and out

322
00:22:18,481 --> 00:22:23,861
I spend the day your way

323
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:30,957
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

324
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,450
The music dance and sing

325
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:45,520
they make the children really ring

326
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:50,821
I spend the day your way

327
00:22:50,846 --> 00:23:00,098
call it morning driving through the sound and
in and out the valley in and around the lake

328
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:05,394
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

329
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:11,998
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

330
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:18,611
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

331
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:24,128
24 before my love you'll see

332
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,335
I'll be there with you

333
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:32,001
My grandfather died tragically.

334
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:34,237
You couldn't even beat one of those pigeons.

335
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:36,665
Quickly! Bring out more U. V. Lamps!

336
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,303
Now is the time. Awaken, my masters!
