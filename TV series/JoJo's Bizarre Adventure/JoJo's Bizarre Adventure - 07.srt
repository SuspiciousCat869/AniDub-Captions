1
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:23,408
For three years, you have
endured and survived our training.

2
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:28,444
You can run for unimaginable
distances and not be short of breath.

3
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:35,165
Soon you will be ready to begin the intense
training that we call the celestial gate.

4
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:38,859
But I warn you again, Zeppeli,

5
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:43,268
if your choice is to continue with these teachings,

6
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:45,659
you will be sealing your fate.

7
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:48,608
The time to turn back is now.

8
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,671
You're young.

9
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:51,443
You can start a new life.

10
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,097
Master tonpetty,

11
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:57,505
read the waves of my life.

12
00:00:57,664 --> 00:00:59,211
Tell me how long I have.

13
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:02,868
When is this life of mine going to end?

14
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:04,473
Where does it end?

15
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:06,149
How does it end?

16
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,099
Why do you want this knowledge?

17
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:13,586
I believe there is a purpose to my life,

18
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:16,558
one that I cannot set aside.

19
00:01:17,272 --> 00:01:20,665
I need to know so I can fulfill that purpose.

20
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:26,266
If I know how much time I have to
accomplish it, then I can accept the outcome.

21
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:29,069
I will accept it.

22
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:35,021
So let it be done, if that is what you believe.

23
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,785
Know this.

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,837
In an ancient chamber,

25
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:51,665
hidden from the light and reeking of death,

26
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,081
a child shall open the way for you.

27
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:57,611
To unchain a young lion

28
00:01:57,636 --> 00:02:01,173
and release him into the future of his destiny,

29
00:02:01,314 --> 00:02:03,679
you will burn your own wounds.

30
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,574
Then freely will you open your arms
to the cruel death that awaits you.

31
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:15,634
Baron Zeppeli,

32
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,311
be careful, my friend.

33
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:23,985
Here I come, JoJo.

34
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,668
"To unchain a young lion

35
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:33,654
and release him into the future of his destiny..."

36
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:18,593
Can't budge this collar.

37
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:20,363
Strange.

38
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:24,923
For some reason, Tarukus hasn't made a
display of his tricks for fighting in this room.

39
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,868
That worries me.

40
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,800
Come to me, fools.

41
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:31,508
You think your hamon will do any good?

42
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:36,735
You little bugs can't lay a finger
on me, no matter how hard you may try!

43
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,450
Huh?

44
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,317
You afraid?

45
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:41,264
Gonna soil yourself?!

46
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,751
Masterfully played, baron.

47
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:01,582
Here we go!

48
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:02,816
How about this?!

49
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:05,040
Tornado overdrive!

50
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:07,940
Watch your back!

51
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:10,758
He's attacking from above?

52
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,646
No, Zeppeli! He's coming from below!

53
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:17,221
What do you know? You're both right.

54
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:22,664
I call it "hell heaven snake kill."

55
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,261
Lovely watching you suffocate.

56
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,600
I‐i can't breathe.

57
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:42,350
My hamon won't manifest.

58
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,584
Jo...

59
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:05,581
JoJo...

60
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:23,616
Lord Dio, as you ordered,

61
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,016
they're dead, both of them.

62
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,534
This is...

63
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:31,737
This bloody savagery is unbelievable!

64
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,084
Hmm?

65
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:51,657
Jonathan!

66
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,735
Even with a broken neck,

67
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:00,438
you have the poor taste to still be alive?

68
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,440
Allow me to finish you off.

69
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:11,049
Jo...

70
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:12,450
JoJo.

71
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,789
Lively for only half a man.

72
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,993
Freely I give this.

73
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,853
Freely I give this.

74
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:25,816
Freely I give this to you!

75
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,470
My ultimate technique!

76
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:31,719
JoJo, take it!

77
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,467
Make it yours!

78
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,742
Ultimate deep pass overdrive!

79
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:05,682
Done.

80
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,884
JoJo, I have passed on to you

81
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:12,808
all the hamon which was mine to control in this life.

82
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:23,453
Go, dear friend.

83
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,069
Go.

84
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:28,841
Baron Zeppeli!

85
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:39,701
A touching display,

86
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,864
but I'm still going to grind you into red pas...

87
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,308
You can't do this.

88
00:08:58,095 --> 00:09:01,915
What? He hauled Tarukus off
the ground like a sack of turnips.

89
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:05,055
It's as if the baron's hamon healed his broken neck.

90
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:08,121
Numskull.

91
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:11,021
You actually think you can yank that collar open?

92
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:13,340
You pathetic waste of flesh.

93
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:15,825
I couldn't pull apart those steel bands,

94
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,283
even with all the power given to me by lord Dio.

95
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:27,403
Oh, no, Tarukus?!

96
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:31,621
Jonathan!

97
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,228
You bug, how'd...

98
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:39,557
Twisted by madness.

99
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,329
No human feeling.

100
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,042
You gave up your redemption when
you chose to follow Dio, Tarukus.

101
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:04,521
Look at that.

102
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,284
His hamon's visible.

103
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:08,621
His body can barely contain its strength.

104
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,634
The baron's hamon joined and
multiplied incredibly with Jonathan's.

105
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:15,921
There's been nothing like this ever!

106
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:19,466
Tarukus, you cannot be allowed to continue.

107
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:20,570
This is clear.

108
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:23,781
Your evil spirit must be banished!

109
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:27,386
Your time is done.

110
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,140
Now I'll erase you!

111
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:31,001
Enough of your blather.

112
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:32,518
You talk too much!

113
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:38,388
You'll have to do better than that!

114
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,232
Well played!

115
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:13,699
Baron Zeppeli!

116
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:17,399
Speak to me.

117
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:26,995
This is all so terribly wrong.

118
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,883
Without you beside me,

119
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:37,055
without your wisdom and guidance, how
will I make my way through this world?

120
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:43,770
JoJo, you simply must pull yourself together.

121
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,042
You've no time to waste now.

122
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:53,835
You know what lies ahead.

123
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,881
Now go. Leave me.

124
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:04,488
Settle accounts with Dio.

125
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:08,539
But first of all,

126
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:10,598
you must destroy the mask.

127
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,138
Zeppeli!

128
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:17,443
Please don't cry.

129
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,146
No tears.

130
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:22,849
I am satisfied.

131
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:25,916
I have lived my destiny.

132
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,385
When I was young,

133
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:30,635
I was very happily married,

134
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:33,780
but to pursue the mask,

135
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:36,378
I left my family behind.

136
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,774
However, I've never regretted the choice I made.

137
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:45,444
I accept it completely.

138
00:12:49,424 --> 00:12:50,440
And it's good.

139
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:55,645
In the end, I can see that my choice was the right one.

140
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:02,114
JoJo, you are my deliverance.

141
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:04,415
Baron Zeppeli.

142
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:11,441
It seems to me that in you I have
found both a best friend and a new family.

143
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:18,884
JoJo, through you, I will live on forever.

144
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:20,625
My son...

145
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,173
JoJo...

146
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:34,855
The 19th‐century novelist

147
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:37,579
William makepeace thackeray wrote...

148
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:42,439
"To love and win is the best thing."

149
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:49,163
"To love and lose is the next best."

150
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:57,838
And so it was that JoJo took up his mentor's life quest

151
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,229
as well as his spirit.

152
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:10,836
Farewell, my friend.

153
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:23,294
Oh, please, sir.

154
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:27,100
I beg you, please don't bring no harm to my child.

155
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,084
Let him be.

156
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:31,858
Hmm.

157
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:33,732
Do I comprehend you?

158
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:36,514
Let us clarify what you desire.

159
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:40,739
Voluntarily you will give yourself to us

160
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:43,648
on the condition that we not touch your child.

161
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,516
Is that accurate?

162
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,198
Yes.

163
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:55,701
Only don't hurt my boy.

164
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:58,068
You move me to tears.

165
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,142
Agreed.

166
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,079
You shall have your wish.

167
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:06,657
I hereby swear that neither I nor any of
my servants will bring harm to your child.

168
00:15:07,393 --> 00:15:10,588
That said, you need to be aware of one thing.

169
00:15:10,654 --> 00:15:15,118
All my minions, without exception,
willingly gave up their souls for me.

170
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:21,951
I truly think it would work out far
better if both of you were to join me.

171
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,947
There would be no more worries.

172
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:28,324
You would both be part of a new and greater family.

173
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:31,461
Remember, you promised not to hurt my child.

174
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,265
Me for him.

175
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:36,219
So be it then.

176
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,566
Sweet little child.

177
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:56,536
As promised, we've not harmed the child.

178
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:59,666
That's something you've taken care of on your own.

179
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:05,019
The irony is lost on you.

180
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:06,737
A pity.

181
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:22,548
'Strewth, Jonathan's demeanor is different,

182
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:25,645
as if the shutters were drawn on his soul.

183
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:27,996
And the same for me.

184
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:31,526
Got no time for tears, only anger.

185
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:34,131
There'll be plenty of time to cry

186
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:36,442
once we've dealt with Dio.

187
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:42,495
Oi, Jonathan, Dio was swanning about,
saying he'd wipe out the town by tomorrow night.

188
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:46,716
Zombies will multiply, like
rats breeding in a refuse heap.

189
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:50,402
No telling what's been going on down there.

190
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:53,914
Is wind knights lot alive or undead?

191
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:57,417
My sister, is she all right?

192
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:58,354
Let's see.

193
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:05,839
Eh?

194
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:07,569
Mr. Adams!

195
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:13,457
Well, Poco, what are you doing at this
hour of the night wandering the moors?

196
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,905
Please, tell me, is everyone all right?

197
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,978
And... and my sister, is she safe?

198
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:19,654
You dare to ask?

199
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:23,310
You mean to say you really don't know?

200
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:27,083
She's bloody furious!

201
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:30,619
When you get home, she's gonna lock
you in the barn and tan your hide!

202
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,163
Uh...

203
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:31,786
Uh...

204
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:34,122
I guess that means she's safe.

205
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,526
Huh. Then let's go.

206
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:38,230
Well, thank you, Mr. Adams.

207
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:48,662
A nice young child.

208
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,659
I have a taste for some fresh, warm blood.

209
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:06,069
He's been turned. Keep your wits about you.

210
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:10,010
You can't escape me with your human speed!

211
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:21,608
This is no good.

212
00:18:21,764 --> 00:18:23,213
We're too late again.

213
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:24,612
That is correct.

214
00:18:27,822 --> 00:18:29,149
The village is lost.

215
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,873
The zombies are everywhere.

216
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,562
Oh, no.

217
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,101
Not another one.

218
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:38,134
I'm known as dire.

219
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:47,111
A kick, but why is he so slow?

220
00:18:53,485 --> 00:18:54,399
Try this!

221
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:56,622
The thunder split attack!

222
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,512
Are you mad, man?

223
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,414
A normal man would pull back, but
instead you went on the offensive

224
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:11,121
and attacked me with a head butt.

225
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:15,236
Wait, please, Jonathan Joestar,

226
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:16,444
I am human.

227
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:19,532
I apologize.

228
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,886
You must forgive me.

229
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,674
I just wanted to see how well Zeppeli had trained you.

230
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:25,891
What? Did you say, "Zeppeli"?

231
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:27,593
You heard correctly.

232
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:30,190
Zeppeli is a dear old friend of mine.

233
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:34,199
We have been through many trials
together over the past 20 years.

234
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:35,544
That is true.

235
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,740
Hello. My name is Straizo.

236
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,442
Please read this.

237
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:43,656
It's a letter.

238
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,818
It was written by...

239
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:47,589
Baron Zeppeli!

240
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:49,861
We've only just arrived,

241
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:52,904
but he sent that some time ago requesting our aid.

242
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:56,551
He wrote about the stone mask, where it could be found,

243
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:59,292
and especially about the man who wears it.

244
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:00,992
Eh, huh?

245
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:04,870
Hmm?

246
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:08,685
Hmm?

247
00:20:09,018 --> 00:20:09,502
Mm.

248
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,878
Our training master, tonpetty.

249
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,934
Greetings to you all.

250
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:25,329
So you're baron Zeppeli's teacher, master tonpetty.

251
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,745
Mm...

252
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:40,797
In the region I call home,

253
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:42,983
our custom is not to shake hands.

254
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,080
In this way, we greet each other.

255
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:55,703
Where is he?

256
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,959
Zeppeli should be here now.

257
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:05,211
I see. Zeppeli has passed beyond the veil.

258
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,502
Even if we had arrived earlier,

259
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:12,315
his fate would still have been the same.

260
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:20,005
His death is proof that the strength
this Dio wields is devastating.

261
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:26,623
His wickedness and his power are quite extraordinary.

262
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:42,841
How amusing.

263
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:46,264
I've put this town in my thrall in but a single night.

264
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,873
I'll be the roundabout

265
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,825
the words will make you out and out

266
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:23,254
I spend the day your way

267
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:30,350
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

268
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:40,843
The music dance and sing

269
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:44,913
they make the children really ring

270
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:50,214
I spend the day your way

271
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:59,491
call it morning driving through the sound and
in and out the valley in and around the lake

272
00:23:00,398 --> 00:23:04,787
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

273
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:11,391
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

274
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,863
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

275
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:23,387
24 before my love you'll see

276
00:23:23,412 --> 00:23:26,537
I'll be there with you

277
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:31,573
run, run, run!

278
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:33,139
Fell for it, didn't you, fool?

279
00:23:33,186 --> 00:23:35,665
Straizo's my name. No mercy.

280
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:38,367
I will feel no hint of guilt for your death.

281
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,351
Come, JoJo!
