1
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:06,893
Feast your eyes on that wreck, would ya?

2
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:14,820
Damnation.

3
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:19,895
This bastard must've died right quicklike.

4
00:00:20,207 --> 00:00:22,055
Fell off that cliff, I'll warrant.

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,035
Carriage wheels slipped in the mud.

6
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:28,357
They weren't hurting for coin,
if these fine clothes tell it true.

7
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:29,516
Dario!

8
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:32,529
The lady is dead, but the baby with her,

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,412
it's still alive. I can hear it.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,144
She must have protected it with her body.

11
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:39,846
Leave it be. Soon enough, it'll be dead.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,376
W‐what are you doing?!

13
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:44,668
You've got eyes, ain't ya, woman?

14
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,291
I'm appropriating his jewelry.

15
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:49,880
Eh? What have we here?

16
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:53,414
Evil‐looking thing, ain't it?

17
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:55,795
Won't fetch me nothin'.

18
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:57,705
Hey! Lend a hand!

19
00:00:57,793 --> 00:01:00,264
Help me yank out his pearly teeth!

20
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:02,083
They'll fetch a pretty copper.

21
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:03,236
Eh? Wha?!

22
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:07,374
Providence sends me aid in the guise of a man.

23
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:08,788
Many thanks.

24
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:09,655
Eh?

25
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:10,958
My wife...

26
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:13,190
My wife and son,

27
00:01:13,804 --> 00:01:15,527
tell me, do they live?

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,401
I hate to say it,

29
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:21,270
but your wife, saints preserve
her, has gone on to her heavenly rest,

30
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,263
but the baby is alive and well.

31
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:28,834
Fate is most cruel.

32
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,177
My name is George Joestar.

33
00:01:32,538 --> 00:01:35,269
You have saved my life this cursed night.

34
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:40,647
Quickly tell me your name, that I
may remember before my senses fail me.

35
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:45,376
This peacock thinks I'm here
outta the goodness of me heart.

36
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,792
Heh heh heh heh heh. Little does he know.

37
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:50,334
Ha ha ha ha! Guess I'll oblige him!

38
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,119
Dario Brando, your lordship.

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,585
Sir, I swear to you,

40
00:01:55,775 --> 00:02:00,350
the Joestar family will honor the debt we have incurred.

41
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,745
Ah, there's a good boy.

42
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:17,551
Father! I'm off!

43
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:20,030
Then fare thee well, JoJo!

44
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:21,476
Let's go, Danny!

45
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,058
Dio.

46
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,356
Mind your father.

47
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:40,010
Damn your eyes, you lazy boy.

48
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:41,050
Are you deaf?

49
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,786
What do you want, father, medicine?

50
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:49,965
You idiot! Their snake oil does me no good.

51
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,075
Get out of here, and don't come
back until you've found me some booze!

52
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:02,870
Your manners are dreadful.

53
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:04,919
Forgive me, father.

54
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:06,565
Checkmate.

55
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:11,407
Take it.

56
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,251
Don't feel so smart now, do ya, whelp?

57
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,082
No, stop!

58
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:25,625
Please, just give her back!

59
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,332
Oh, lemme guess, Erina!

60
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:29,542
Your daddy bought you this doll, didn't he?

61
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:33,229
It's fancy. Being a quack must pay him real nice.

62
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:34,849
I know.

63
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:37,996
What do ya say we peel off this fancy‐looking dress, eh,

64
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,673
and see if they made her with
all the real girl bits underneath?

65
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:47,340
Erina's a crybaby!

66
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,839
Erina's a crybaby!

67
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:50,272
Erina's a cry...

68
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,074
That's enough!

69
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:53,280
Give it back to her right now!

70
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:54,418
Who's this guy?

71
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:56,104
You some friend of Erina's?

72
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,261
I've never met her,

73
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,094
but I'll fight for her all the same!

74
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:02,200
Who is this idiot?

75
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,887
Getting in a fight for a girl he don't even know!

76
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:10,863
Looks like somebody was nothin' but talk.

77
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,541
Look at him there on the ground.

78
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:15,851
Are you gonna cry?

79
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,638
Some knight in shining armor you turned out to be.

80
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:25,042
Huh? This little pantywaist is the Joestar kid.

81
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,094
Now that I know you're some rich guy's son,

82
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,492
we're just getting started.

83
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,694
You can't buy your way outta this.

84
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:33,958
Hit him some more!

85
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:38,152
Listen, Dio. I am not long for this world.

86
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:40,194
When I die...

87
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:45,461
You get yourself to the Joestar
mansion along with this letter.

88
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:48,052
The fool thinks he owes me.

89
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,451
This is your ticket to greatness.

90
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,694
It's your only chance, Dio. Go out there,
and take this useless world for all you can get.

91
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:03,266
Crawl on back to your damn manor, little lord fauntleroy.

92
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:04,387
Let's go.

93
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:10,598
You okay?

94
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:12,251
Just leave me alone!

95
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:13,603
I'll be fine!

96
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:15,963
I did not take a beating just now for your sake,

97
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:17,957
so whatever you're thinking, stop it!

98
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,768
All I want is to conduct myself as a gentleman.

99
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:24,558
I spotted a damsel in distress.

100
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:26,680
A true gentleman has no fear.

101
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:28,380
He'll fight for those who can't.

102
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:32,979
Even knowing it's a fight he has no
chance of winning, he enters the fray.

103
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,303
Someday, I'll have the strength to win.

104
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:44,772
Devil that you were, you drove mother to an early grave.

105
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,210
I'm glad you're dead.

106
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:48,157
May you burn for your sins.

107
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:50,644
The riches that eluded your grasp,

108
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,773
I will claim them in excess.

109
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:56,418
You lacked the cunning to take
what you wanted, but I'll prevail.

110
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,158
This Joestar shall be the key.

111
00:05:59,355 --> 00:06:00,422
Now burn.

112
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,686
I will claim what is rightfully mine.

113
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,384
"Jonathan Joestar."

114
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,556
This is the tale of two young men,

115
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:24,824
their destinies bound to intersect,

116
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:28,776
and the stone mask that changes their fates forever.

117
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:00,850
Who is he?

118
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,513
You must be Dio Brando, right?

119
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:07,714
And you're Jonathan, heir to the Joestars.

120
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,756
Yes. Please, call me JoJo.

121
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,304
It's a pleasure to meet you.

122
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:13,814
Danny!

123
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:19,092
That's Danny. He's my dog, as
well as my steadfast companion.

124
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:22,554
Don't worry. He knows better than to nip at strangers.

125
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:28,775
What was that for?!

126
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,774
How dare you?!

127
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:33,120
So this is the brat I must usurp.

128
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:36,958
Wears his heart on his sleeve. He's quick to anger.

129
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:40,755
This pampered fool is no match
for the likes of Dio Brando.

130
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:42,683
Fighting already?

131
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:46,028
I would know what this is about.

132
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:50,875
Sorry. The dog jumped at me, and in my haste, I struck it.

133
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:55,904
Welcome to the manor.

134
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:58,781
Consider yourself a part of the family.

135
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:04,302
Everyone, I would have died in the crash that
claimed my wife were it not for Dio's father.

136
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,179
You will treat him as you would my own son.

137
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:08,998
Very well, your lordship.

138
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,246
This is your home now, Dio.

139
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:14,057
Please avail yourself of all its comforts.

140
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:15,391
Thank you, sir,

141
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:17,812
for taking in this poor unfortunate.

142
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:20,351
JoJo has lost his mother as well,

143
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:22,398
and you're the same age.

144
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:24,212
You'll be thick as thieves soon.

145
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:27,300
JoJo, Dio didn't mean to hurt Danny.

146
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,204
Right.

147
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,315
It stands to reason, father.

148
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,491
If a strange dog jumped at me,

149
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:34,310
I'd be surprised, too.

150
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:38,441
I wish his apology had been more sincere,

151
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,984
but as we'll be living here together,

152
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:43,224
I'll do my utmost to be friendly.

153
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,021
This way, Dio.

154
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:46,983
I'll show you your chamber.

155
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:48,229
Yes, sir.

156
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,338
You're hurting me!

157
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:56,215
Please let go.

158
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,431
Watch your hands.

159
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:00,681
No one's allowed to touch my things without my permission.

160
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:03,796
Next time you reach for what's mine with this paw,

161
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:04,875
I'll break it.

162
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:07,017
I was only trying to help!

163
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:07,831
Well, don't.

164
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:11,389
I will have a servant carry them up for me.

165
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,791
Listen. I may be a guest within your house,

166
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:18,968
but I am not to be trifled with.

167
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:21,845
In all things that I do, I am number one.

168
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,585
Look down your nose at me, and you'll regret it.

169
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,037
But, Dio, I want for us to be friends.

170
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:29,873
And another thing. I hate all mongrels.

171
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:30,933
They don't scare me.

172
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,910
I just despise how they fawn over the unworthy.

173
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:37,814
So keep that mangy mutt of
yours well away from me, Joestar.

174
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,268
Dio, what's keeping you?

175
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:41,484
Hurry along.

176
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes, sir.

177
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:46,164
With Dio's sudden arrival,

178
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:49,891
JoJo's carefree life spiraled into one of misery.

179
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,070
You got another one wrong, JoJo!

180
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:57,440
Look at Dio. 20 out of 20, not a single mistake.

181
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:02,474
JoJo!

182
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:06,750
Your table manners are simply abhorrent.
You act as if you were raised in a barn.

183
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:09,507
Clear JoJo's plate at once.

184
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:10,962
He's had enough.

185
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:13,022
That's all the dinner you get tonight.

186
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:16,860
It's clear to me that I failed in
your upbringing when I look at Dio.

187
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:18,628
If your mother could see you now.

188
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:21,369
Dio's manners are impeccable.

189
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,115
What an oaf.

190
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,541
Our first pugilist up is Jonathan Joestar.

191
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,790
He's been looking stronger lately, I'd say.

192
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:40,158
As for his opponent today,

193
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,668
it's a boxer we haven't seen before.

194
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:43,319
Huh?

195
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:45,418
He's a newcomer to our fair city.

196
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,253
All we know is his name.

197
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:48,778
It can't be.

198
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:53,670
Introducing our surprise opponent,

199
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:55,319
Dio Brando!

200
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,023
Same as ever. Land a hit to the other
guy's face, and the match is over. Now fight.

201
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:03,179
Get him, JoJo!

202
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,342
Take him down!

203
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:11,383
Look at him dodge those hits.

204
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,098
I've never seen the like.

205
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:14,164
I can't connect.

206
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:18,159
The pampered brat can box. I'll Grant him that much.

207
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,414
However...

208
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:28,438
He's never had to punch his way out of a
scrape in the slums, and thus I hold the advantage.

209
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:29,855
Take this.

210
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,895
There it is!

211
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,207
JoJo loses the fight.

212
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:37,369
Your suffering isn't over yet, JoJo.

213
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:40,316
I'll jam a thumb into your eye for good measure,

214
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:42,577
lest you forget who you're dealing with.

215
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,614
That arm of his is unreal.

216
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,326
Dio!

217
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:52,705
Dio, that punch was simply amazing!

218
00:11:52,832 --> 00:11:54,899
How did you dodge him so well?

219
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,703
It's just a little defensive
footwork I acquired along the way.

220
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,820
If you'd like to learn it, I'd be more
than happy to teach it to you fellas.

221
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:03,179
You would do that?

222
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:05,800
Do take care that nobody shows it to JoJo.

223
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,418
He can't keep a secret to save his life.

224
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:09,812
You don't say.

225
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:11,171
Thanks for the warning.

226
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:13,789
The thumb in my eye...

227
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:15,632
That was on purpose.

228
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:21,598
Loneliness will devour a man from within.

229
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:24,618
I'll reduce JoJo to an empty husk.

230
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:29,205
Bit by devious bit, I'll steal
the life he was meant to have.

231
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,864
By the time we're grown, there'll be nothing left of him.

232
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:37,960
Damn that Dio.

233
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:39,674
It's terrible.

234
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:42,424
He's ruining everything he touches.

235
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:44,282
Look alive, fellas.

236
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,333
Hey! It's me, Jonathan!

237
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:49,915
What are you doing?! Mind if I join you?!

238
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,186
Huh.

239
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:54,800
I could have sworn I heard a voice a moment ago.

240
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:57,368
Just that snitch. Better to ignore 'em.

241
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,746
What did you say?

242
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,990
I'm a snitch, huh? Call me that to my face!

243
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:02,880
Time to go.

244
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:08,054
JoJo's nothing but a snitch. Dio was right about
you. You're just a stupid rich‐boy tattletale!

245
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:10,057
Tell me what I snitched about, then!

246
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,391
He's lying to you!

247
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:13,250
Why do you just take him at his word?!

248
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:15,760
JoJo the squealer!

249
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,766
Dio, he's slandering me.

250
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,902
He lies and lies, and people just eat it up!

251
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:25,452
From the first day he showed
up, he's been trying to destroy me.

252
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:27,597
Damn you, Dio Brando!

253
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:32,872
Dio! Dio! Dio! Dio!

254
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:38,385
Ever since he arrived,

255
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,952
everyone's turned on me,

256
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:41,412
even father.

257
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,791
Oh, Danny,

258
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,420
I know you will always be my friend,

259
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:48,444
no matter what Dio does.

260
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:52,457
Eh?

261
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:57,827
Huh?

262
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:04,200
Who was that girl just now?

263
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:07,726
I feel as though I have seen her face before.

264
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,725
That's my handkerchief.

265
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,208
She brought grapes.

266
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,663
Hey, thank you for the fruit!

267
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:19,476
You know, I'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back.

268
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:24,800
Didn't even tell me her name. Just ran away.

269
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:27,262
Girls are such a curious bunch.

270
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:33,930
A dark time in Jonathan's life was suddenly
made brighter by love's growing embers.

271
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:36,450
The two became fast friends,

272
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:38,418
and Jonathan was enchanted by her.

273
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,053
Erina Pendleton.

274
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,097
The name is music to my ears.

275
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:43,791
She's an angel.

276
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:47,824
What on earth are you doing to that poor tree?

277
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:51,539
JoJo! What possessed you to do that?

278
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:53,035
Goodness.

279
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:57,711
Farewell, Erina, 'til next time.

280
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:12,435
Huh?

281
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:15,713
Your name wouldn't happen to be Erina, would it?

282
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:19,399
You and JoJo, you make such a smart‐looking couple.

283
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:22,344
Really, I should have guessed as much.

284
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:28,208
Try as I might to ruin his life, young
master Jonathan has been oddly happy as of late.

285
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,020
He, he did it!

286
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,300
Give her the what‐for!

287
00:15:40,364 --> 00:15:43,376
The trouble I'd get into if I were as brave as Dio.

288
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,862
He just does what he wants, devil may care.

289
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:50,263
Tell me, have you and JoJo kissed yet?

290
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:52,402
I'll take that as a no.

291
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:55,208
You thought your first kiss would be JoJo,

292
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:56,804
but it was I, Dio.

293
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:03,405
Even though it was by force, the
fact that I kissed her is enough.

294
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:06,204
I've killed their romance before it began.

295
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:10,038
I'll deny JoJo the comfort of friendship and love.

296
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,789
What the? Just look at her, Dio.

297
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:14,797
She's taken leave of her senses.

298
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:17,555
What's wrong with her? That's disgusting.

299
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,970
Washing out her mouth with a muddy puddle?

300
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,178
Why would anybody do that?

301
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:24,489
There's a stream not far away.

302
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:27,253
You ungrateful wench!

303
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,932
You dare suggest my kiss is something to be washed off!

304
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:39,508
Cool your temper, you damnable fool.

305
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:41,494
She's not worth losing your head over.

306
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,399
We're done here. Come on.

307
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:45,099
Huh?

308
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:49,400
Eh? Erina!

309
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:50,328
Hey there.

310
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:55,102
Ahh?

311
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,310
Erina, wait!

312
00:16:57,344 --> 00:16:59,265
Why'd she run off?

313
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:00,868
Was it something I said?

314
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:04,452
Look at him, fellas.

315
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,218
He doesn't know why she ran away.

316
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:10,659
What do ya say we tell him? He deserves to
know what his precious Erina's been up to.

317
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:15,181
I dunno. I'd feel bad making
his little lordship start to cry.

318
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:17,992
This is his doing.

319
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:20,066
What have you done, Dio?

320
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,526
What have you done to my Erina?!

321
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:29,724
Dio!

322
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,251
Hush, boy.

323
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:38,180
You won't speak my name in vain
again if you know what's good for you.

324
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:39,824
We end this now!

325
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:42,831
I won't let you sully an innocent maiden's honor!

326
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:45,118
Your fight is with me, damn it!

327
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:46,727
Upset about Erina,

328
00:17:46,827 --> 00:17:48,796
that she shared her favors with me?

329
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:52,706
And now you intend to give me a
proper thrashing for my impudence.

330
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:55,101
This time, Dio, you have gone too far!

331
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:58,884
You may be right, but you're the one who'll pay!

332
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:03,460
Looking to repeat your performance
from our boxing match? Be my guest.

333
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:04,476
Humph.

334
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:09,619
I can't beat him,

335
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,050
but if I lose here and now,

336
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,877
I'll spend the rest of my life cowering in Dio's shadow.

337
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:19,531
Most of all, I have to fight for Erina's honor.

338
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,162
She needs a champion!

339
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:24,453
Time to end this little pissing match.

340
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:27,161
I'll beat him here, in his own home.

341
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:31,817
Once and for all, he'll know his proper
place in this world is under my heel.

342
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:34,589
He'll see that it's useless to try and defeat me.

343
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:37,442
I shall be master, now and always.

344
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:39,794
Come on!

345
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:46,198
Perfect. Right in the face.

346
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:51,497
How are you able to grab me
after such a blow to the head?!

347
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:53,694
Perhaps I was too gentle with you!

348
00:18:57,455 --> 00:19:00,704
Dio!

349
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:01,690
Impossible.

350
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:05,060
I'm going to beat you until you cry like a baby, Dio!

351
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:08,667
How could a pampered brat like him best me in a fight?

352
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,116
Eh?

353
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,689
Y‐you...

354
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,994
How... how dare you?

355
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:30,511
Bastard, how dare you strike me?!

356
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,261
Dio's crying.

357
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,687
I'll make you regret that, you filthy cur!

358
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,652
Stop it, both of you! That is quite enough.

359
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:40,867
Father, I...

360
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:45,086
Son, I know that boys your age are prone to fisticuffs.

361
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,262
However, JoJo, I saw you pummel Dio mercilessly

362
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,755
after the point at which he had obviously
no chance of winning the fight.

363
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:53,429
Such is the mark of a coward.

364
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:54,000
Father!

365
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,994
No excuses. To your chambers, both of you.

366
00:19:57,902 --> 00:20:00,171
I'll decide your punishment anon.

367
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,343
Hmm. That seems strange. Wonder what's in there.

368
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:13,326
Oh, well.

369
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:16,188
Probably something a maid threw out.

370
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:21,734
Hmm?

371
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:25,414
W‐what's that?

372
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,766
Something got into the incinerator.

373
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:29,514
Oh, mercy!

374
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,769
W‐what if a person's in there?

375
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:33,514
They're burning alive,

376
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:36,099
and it's all my fault for lighting it!

377
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:41,754
Erina.

378
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:44,525
Damn you, Dio!

379
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,689
I beat you fair and square,

380
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:48,003
but what does it matter,

381
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:50,145
if you've ruined things for Erina and me?

382
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:56,159
We buried him while you were gone, son.

383
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:58,750
It was nothing you should have to witness.

384
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:02,555
The constable said it was probably the work of a burglar

385
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:04,803
who caught sight of Danny and panicked.

386
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:06,319
Dio.

387
00:21:06,386 --> 00:21:07,568
He's not here.

388
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,665
He hasn't yet returned from school today, sir.

389
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,204
JoJo fled to his room and fell into a dreamless slumber.

390
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:19,317
When he awoke, he thought of Danny,

391
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:21,918
his loyal pet and one true friend,

392
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:25,213
now lost to him, and wept.

393
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:30,022
Yes, I may have evened the score by killing his mutt,

394
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:34,181
but it doesn't change the fact that
JoJo is far stronger than I'd thought.

395
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:37,615
Bloody his nose, and he comes back twice as fierce.

396
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:40,188
My anger makes me vulnerable.

397
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,322
I must remedy that.

398
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:44,758
Once I learn to master my temper,

399
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:47,569
I'll be invincible to the likes of JoJo.

400
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:51,884
In the blink of an eye, seven years passed.

401
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:07,494
I'll be the roundabout

402
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:11,454
the words will make you out and out

403
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:16,883
I spend the day your way

404
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:23,979
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

405
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:34,472
The music dance and sing

406
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:38,542
they make the children really ring

407
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:43,843
I spend the day your way

408
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:53,120
call it morning driving through the sound
and in and out the valley in and around the lake

409
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:58,416
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

410
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:05,020
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

411
00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:11,492
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

412
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,016
24 before my love you'll see

413
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:20,837
I'll be there with you

414
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:29,832
Seven years later...

415
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:32,215
The ball is plucked out of the air by our hero.

416
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,129
Having read it, all has been made clear.

417
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:36,941
If you're looking to lose body parts, do stick around.

418
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:37,839
We are friends no more!

419
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:38,967
You hurt father.

420
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:40,515
Never again, Dio!
