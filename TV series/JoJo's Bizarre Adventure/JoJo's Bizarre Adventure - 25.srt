1
00:00:06,793 --> 00:00:09,324
This... this can't be!

2
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,769
I didn't see him with the mask.

3
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,548
I didn't know that he had it anywhere near him.

4
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:37,472
I didn't see him put in the red stone.

5
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,165
No, it can't be.

6
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,255
Dear god.

7
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:42,487
Kars.

8
00:02:57,488 --> 00:02:59,178
He stood up again, major.

9
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:01,992
Ehh. You're the fatherland's cream of the crop.

10
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,215
You will stand on your ground no matter what.

11
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:14,112
He has become the ubermensch.

12
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:15,120
Can it be?

13
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:18,846
I thought no creature could attain perfection, but now...

14
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,897
Damn you.

15
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:24,250
See that, how his arm is burning?

16
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:26,803
Maybe we don't have to fight perfection after all.

17
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:29,741
Hamon melts his accursed flesh even now.

18
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:33,027
In another minute, there will be nothing left of him.

19
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,317
He has lusted after the red stone for millennia,

20
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:41,100
but when it is all said and done,
his quest for immortality has failed!

21
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:45,128
You will perish knowing that you are a failure!

22
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:49,124
Ready the U. V. Amplifier for another shot.

23
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:52,150
One direct hit should be enough to finish him off.

24
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:53,725
Hurry it up, soldier.

25
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,409
Jawohl.

26
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,449
What's he doing?

27
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:04,927
Looks like he's thinking.

28
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:19,679
Staring at a damn squirrel.

29
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:20,641
What the hell?

30
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,920
Look! Mr. Speedwagon!

31
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,644
His hand, it's changing.

32
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,728
I've seen some crazy stuff, but this?

33
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,784
Gets his hands on the red stone,
first thing he does is make a squirrel?

34
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:53,610
Oh, hey. Well, look at that. I think it found a friend.

35
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:57,469
Hey, squirrel, get away from that thing!

36
00:04:57,494 --> 00:04:59,763
You don't know the guy it's made of.

37
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:12,773
Squirrel incoming!

38
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:20,572
Soldiers, full retreat!

39
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:32,630
My god.

40
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:35,583
He has complete mastery over organic life.

41
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:38,610
Huh.

42
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:43,366
All right.

43
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:46,414
The sun is rising.

44
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:56,876
Not a one of 'em left alive.

45
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:00,337
Kars is about to get what's coming to him.

46
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:01,940
Thank goodness.

47
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:14,441
How...

48
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:17,045
Think again. He's feeling fine.

49
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,301
He's standing in the morning sun,

50
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,818
and he couldn't care less about it.

51
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:32,137
JoJo, this is a horrible nightmare.

52
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:33,258
We're doomed.

53
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:35,473
This is the day all of us die.

54
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,389
Humanity's done for.

55
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:41,956
Alpha and omega both,

56
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:45,581
I am the pinnacle of all life
that has ever trod the earth.

57
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,867
All of their forms are mine to take,

58
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:52,969
and you, my old nemesis, I see how entrancing you are.

59
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:56,127
Yours is a beauty the likes of which I have never seen.

60
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:57,977
I once feared you,

61
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,685
but now I fear you no more.

62
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:09,018
Kars, he's become invincible. He has no weaknesses now.

63
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:11,481
He even shrugs off hamon like it's nothing.

64
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:15,612
He's won, and he knows it. You can see it in his eyes.

65
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,481
Kars the pillar man is no more.

66
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:21,404
He's become Kars, the ultimate creation!

67
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:24,446
This is all my fault.

68
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:28,578
I'm the one who hit him with u. V
after he put on the completed mask.

69
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:32,519
Is... is there really no way to stop him, Mr. Speedwagon?

70
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:34,348
He's so strong now.

71
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,745
We're all gonna be food for this walking museum piece.

72
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:43,203
No. I've got a plan.

73
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,657
Did I hear you right, JoJo?

74
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:50,357
Hold her. Uh‐huh.

75
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:53,193
One last all‐or‐nothing gambit.

76
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:55,942
"All‐or‐nothing gambit," you say?

77
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,581
Yeah. It's my final move.

78
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:00,384
What does it involve?

79
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:05,744
JoJo, when you say, "final move," you're
not referring to that final move, are you?

80
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:09,376
Listen up. This is something you're
going to have to do for yourself.

81
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:12,808
Just tell me what to do, and I'll follow your lead, JoJo.

82
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:13,419
Humph.

83
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:20,266
Run for your life!

84
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,076
Aww, man! I knew you were gonna do that!

85
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:30,613
Hamon users mean nothing to me now,

86
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:33,340
but you are a special case.

87
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:38,733
This is a historic moment, and
Wamuu and Esidisi must be avenged.

88
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:42,072
I shall celebrate my rebirth

89
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:46,123
with the utter eradication of Joseph Joestar.

90
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:52,035
He's gaining on us!

91
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,537
Not helping!

92
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:56,896
Really, how am I gonna think of
something with you carrying on?

93
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:59,329
We've still got our dignity, Smokey.

94
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:06,447
JoJo's out there risking life
and limb to lead Kars away from us.

95
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,574
Good on ya.

96
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:11,873
But still, it is only a matter of time.

97
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:14,151
This foe ain't one you can beat.

98
00:09:14,176 --> 00:09:15,510
He's coming.

99
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:18,002
If you're gonna think of something, do it now!

100
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:21,824
Why are you running with me, anyway?

101
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:27,394
Maybe you haven't noticed this yet, Smokey, but i'm
the one who's got Kars really bent out of shape, you know.

102
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:32,771
You and I are good friends, so I'll take it
really badly if you die because of me today.

103
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,424
For the moment, at least, Kars is after my blood alone.

104
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:39,713
He thinks that killing me is a
good way to ring in his new life,

105
00:09:39,953 --> 00:09:44,474
which means that monster's not gonna stop
chasing me until I've drawn my final breath.

106
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:46,460
JoJo...

107
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,042
There's something you really need to know.

108
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:52,950
Lisa Lisa, she's more than just some hamon master.

109
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:53,913
She's your...

110
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:55,956
That was fast.

111
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,973
Quit flapping, you son of a bitch!

112
00:09:58,117 --> 00:10:00,531
Speedwagon, tell me,

113
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:04,139
has that pillar man really become the perfect being?

114
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:08,713
Yes. Our greatest fear has been
realized right in front of us.

115
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:11,950
Kars has become an unstoppable force of nature.

116
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:15,610
A perfect being is, above all, invincible.

117
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,112
That means it does not grow old.

118
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:21,027
It will never succumb to death in any form.

119
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:26,850
Additionally, it has the abilities of all other
life‐forms at its disposal and outperforms them.

120
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:32,229
And finally, its predominant form is the
standard by which physical perfection is judged.

121
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:35,470
Uhh. We have no way to stop him now.

122
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:37,084
We've already lost.

123
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:39,160
He has no weaknesses at all.

124
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:41,234
Humans can't kill him.

125
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:45,705
Not even hamon or the sun itself
will do a lick of good against him.

126
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:48,635
JoJo!

127
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:51,836
Sorry, but you're gonna have to tell me later.

128
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:52,582
Huh?

129
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:55,099
I'm kinda short on time.

130
00:10:56,632 --> 00:10:58,459
JoJo!

131
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:03,232
That won't save you.

132
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,093
Hah hah!

133
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:13,612
You're not the only one with wings.

134
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:15,748
I'm coming for ya!

135
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,043
Up there. That's...

136
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:42,464
One of our German warplanes.

137
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:51,830
JoJo!

138
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:32,458
Kars mutates his feathers into plated
projectiles as hard as armadillo shells

139
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:34,983
and coats them with a bullet‐deflecting oil.

140
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:39,060
Therefore, their toughness makes
them ideal not only as shielding,

141
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:40,869
but as weapons in their own right.

142
00:12:50,412 --> 00:12:53,007
Shooting those feathers at me is dirty pool.

143
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:56,750
This doesn't look good.

144
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:04,464
Oh, no, you don't.

145
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,047
Touching down is not an option.

146
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:12,867
I've got to make my getaway!

147
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,741
JoJo!

148
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:29,275
Aw, man, how long can he last
when all he can do is run for it?

149
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:31,729
Fly, boy, and don't look back.

150
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,104
That's all we humans can do now,

151
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,140
just try to save our skins.

152
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,773
240 kilometers an hour.

153
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,743
I don't care how perfect that bastard may be.

154
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,102
This plane has got more horsepower.

155
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,208
I'm safe for now.

156
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:58,198
If he has any morning plans, he'd better
cancel 'em, because I'm in this for the long haul.

157
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:00,151
Or am I?

158
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:02,590
Two hours left.

159
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:06,169
Guess I can't give him the
slip for as long as I had thought.

160
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:08,780
You cretin.

161
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:12,875
That metal coffin of yours
will only protect you for so long.

162
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:18,198
If your plan involves landing
somewhere, I've got news for you.

163
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:22,646
The only way you'll return to
terra firma is in bloody chunks.

164
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:26,984
JoJo. JoJo, do you read me?

165
00:14:27,018 --> 00:14:28,947
This is Speedwagon. Over.

166
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,815
Hey. You guys missing me down there yet?

167
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:33,459
Thank goodness.

168
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,133
Listen, you were smart to grab that plane.

169
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:41,049
I know it's not much, but the Germans
and I will do what we can to help from here.

170
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:43,704
Do you have a map?

171
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:46,674
Yeah. Found it.

172
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:49,486
Good. Maintain radio contact,

173
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:51,314
and I'll guide you to safety.

174
00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:53,132
Jackpot.

175
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:53,938
All right.

176
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:56,011
First give us your current position.

177
00:14:58,369 --> 00:14:59,388
Huh?

178
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:01,231
JoJo, you're breaking up.

179
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:03,941
What's going on? Hey.

180
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,902
If you can hear me, for the love of god, pipe up.

181
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,848
Yeah. Clear as a bell.

182
00:15:09,348 --> 00:15:11,249
How do you think this is gonna go?

183
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,428
I mean, we don't have a weapon or fighting
technique that'll work on Kars worth a damn.

184
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,304
You were yelling about him being immortal, remember?

185
00:15:18,637 --> 00:15:21,721
Don't I know it? You running away isn't ideal,

186
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,747
but it's all you can really do.

187
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:24,621
Heh.

188
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:26,162
Maybe not.

189
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:29,379
Looking over this map gave me an idea.

190
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:31,589
What idea?

191
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:34,844
Hey, JoJo, don't face Kars alone!

192
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:36,943
This is no time to act the hero!

193
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:39,868
He'll be too strong later. This is the only time.

194
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:44,314
Don't do it! I forbid you to get
yourself killed out there. Do you hear me?!

195
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,153
Just listen for a second.

196
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,946
I know Kars is the most powerful
creature on earth at the moment,

197
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:52,050
but he was born here.

198
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:55,163
Thousands of years ago, this planet gave him life,

199
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:58,537
and if we're lucky, it'll take that life right back.

200
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,069
Take it?

201
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,363
But how?

202
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:04,586
What in the world do you think will be a threat to Kars?

203
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:05,460
Magma.

204
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,346
After all, magma's the hottest substance on earth.

205
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:13,390
I'll drive him into the lava at isola di vulcano.

206
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:15,303
Even he can't survive that.

207
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:16,899
No! You can't!

208
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:20,196
You've risked your neck for
humanity more than enough, boy!

209
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:23,137
Let me and the Germans do the heavy lifting for once!

210
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:25,649
Listen to him, JoJo. Don't be stupid!

211
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:27,253
Kars is gonna kill you!

212
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:31,218
Maybe, but I'm at the volcano, so it's too late.

213
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,403
Carpe diem, as they say.

214
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,028
Mr. Speedwagon.

215
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:41,641
No, god. Not again.

216
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:46,816
Lord Joestar, his son Jonathan, and his son George.

217
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:51,952
The men of the Joestar family
were all cut down far too soon.

218
00:16:57,663 --> 00:16:58,802
Not again!

219
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:01,676
Why do they always have their lives taken?!

220
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:04,004
Don't fly into that volcano.

221
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:06,394
Survive, for Lisa Lisa's sake.

222
00:17:07,062 --> 00:17:07,712
Huh?

223
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,515
Listen to me.

224
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:11,905
Lisa Lisa is your mother.

225
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,251
What did you say?

226
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:14,839
You're breaking up.

227
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:16,752
Huh?

228
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,002
That sounds like chewing.

229
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:24,292
Are you kidding me?! Yaah!

230
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:27,596
Piranhas, huh? That's logical.

231
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:30,633
They'll eat the plane right out from under me.

232
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,468
But how'd they get here?

233
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,891
Those feathers Kars shot before,

234
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:38,466
they turned into these damn things.

235
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:41,731
Bugger all.

236
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:44,194
No, don't eat the parachute!

237
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,965
You devilfish!

238
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:46,737
Eh?

239
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:47,769
Huh?

240
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:50,056
Oh, this is bad.

241
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:55,829
Yaah!

242
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,717
JoJo!

243
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:02,178
What's going on?

244
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:03,626
Can you even hear me?!

245
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:04,817
JoJo!

246
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,503
Please, say something.

247
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:18,663
What a moron.

248
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:23,641
You think that parachute is your
salvation, but all it does is seal your fate.

249
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:26,580
You're just a butterfly caught in a spider's web.

250
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:29,830
Now, JoJo,

251
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:32,744
time to split you asunder!

252
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:34,382
Huh? What the...

253
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,789
But if this is a decoy...

254
00:18:40,763 --> 00:18:42,056
Hey, Kars,

255
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:43,829
I'm a Joestar.

256
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:45,854
We don't go down without a fight!

257
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:50,120
You and I have got a date with
that volcano! Don't try to weasel out!

258
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,993
JoJo!

259
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:56,066
Damn you!

260
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:03,536
You're a lunatic.

261
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:12,729
Granny Erina, a long time ago,

262
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:15,086
you told me about my grandfather.

263
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,905
You said he died on the Atlantic

264
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:21,074
to save you and father from his greatest foe.

265
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,308
Trust me.

266
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:26,547
I don't mean to be a copycat.

267
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:33,723
Maybe this is the hand my blood dealt me.

268
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,055
Really now.

269
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,249
Do you think I can't pry myself from this foul contraption

270
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:46,141
before you try to smash it into
the ground, you gibbering primate?

271
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,325
You coward!

272
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:52,766
Know that your death won't accomplish anything!

273
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:02,768
Is... is that a hand?

274
00:20:06,224 --> 00:20:07,297
What a shame.

275
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,831
All of your scheming, und still you die here.

276
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:12,121
Damn you.

277
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:13,485
Von Stroheim.

278
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,355
How did you get into the plane?

279
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,239
When did you have time?

280
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,139
I wasn't sure you could handle this battle all alone.

281
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,476
Next time, I should stow away in the cabin proper.

282
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:29,851
Next time, huh?

283
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,663
When I give the word, jump out, JoJo!

284
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:34,920
Not on your life. No way.

285
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:38,362
Believe it or not, piranhas ate my damn parachute.

286
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:42,737
Unless you want to die, jump out of there this instant!

287
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:53,219
Please respond. I don't care what you say!

288
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:56,181
Tell a bad joke, or call me an old man.

289
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:59,207
Let me hear your voice one more time.

290
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:01,162
JoJo.

291
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,643
Stroheim, you're crazy.

292
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:25,543
I'm crazy, too, but

293
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:28,052
I admit when someone's got me beat.

294
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:31,055
That was a pretty courageous move.

295
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:33,422
You seem to be all right,

296
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,932
but what about... where'd he go?

297
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:38,721
Please tell me Kars fell into the lava.

298
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:39,513
Eh?

299
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:46,741
I'm...

300
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:49,979
Still alive...

301
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:53,448
Worms!

302
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,289
I'll be the roundabout

303
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:13,036
the words will make you out and out

304
00:22:13,162 --> 00:22:18,542
you spend the day your way

305
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:27,234
call it morning driving through the sound and
in and out the valley in and around the lake

306
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:32,358
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

307
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,102
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

308
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:45,291
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

309
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:50,882
24 before my love you'll see

310
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:55,859
I'll be there with you

311
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:31,673
Did you say, "Hamon Overdrive"?

312
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:33,215
Who's laughing now, huh?

313
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,447
To purge your fears and reign forever as gods!

314
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:39,944
JoJo!

315
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:41,777
Everyone, goodbye.
