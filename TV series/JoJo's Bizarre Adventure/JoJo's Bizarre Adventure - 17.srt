1
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:10,130
The spines that this mask uses can pierce a human brain.

2
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:15,897
However, they don't yet have the
strength to probe our immortal brains.

3
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,122
The solution is finding more power.

4
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:27,647
Ooh. What's that now?

5
00:00:27,672 --> 00:00:29,808
The mortals call it the Red Stone of Aja.

6
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:33,194
Its power is of a particular interest for our kind.

7
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:37,682
This little stone can refract
light at least a billion times.

8
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:41,329
The end result is light of incredible purity and strength.

9
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,936
This amplified light holds power untold.

10
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:47,144
But this one won't do.

11
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:50,211
This little red pebble isn't large enough.

12
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:53,008
We need more capacity and strength in it.

13
00:00:53,317 --> 00:00:58,284
To complete our mask, we need a red
stone that is large and utterly flawless.

14
00:00:58,577 --> 00:01:01,040
We need a super aja.

15
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:04,798
Once we have that, we will conquer the sun

16
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:09,279
and then become the final, perfect step in evolution.

17
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:19,203
The masks were invented by the oldest
pillar man among them, and his name is Kars.

18
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:19,862
Eh?

19
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:26,042
Kars, Esidisi, and Wamuu crossed the Atlantic
in their search for a suitable super aja.

20
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,600
There you are, Suzie Q.

21
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:30,538
Signora, here. Just like you wanted.

22
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:31,666
Thank you.

23
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:33,644
You see this?

24
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:38,325
What I have in my hand here is a
natural, perfectly flawless stone,

25
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,785
a super aja.

26
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,065
Whoa!

27
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:44,880
You've been carrying the Red Stone of Aja around?

28
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:55,219
The warriors of hamon were wiped out by the pillar men.

29
00:01:55,783 --> 00:02:01,161
This stone narrowly avoided being taken, and
now I have been given the honor to be its guardian.

30
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:06,627
Caesar, I know exactly how you feel.

31
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:10,750
The stone masks not only killed our grandfathers,

32
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:13,411
but they took the lives of countless others as well,

33
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:17,137
and now we've met its creator, Kars.

34
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:18,573
Just break it.

35
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,894
Yeah, crush the damn thing.

36
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:24,095
Smash it to pieces, and they'll cry like babies.

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,724
No, I can't do that.

38
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:27,288
Why? What's stopping you?

39
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,364
Legend says the pillar men can't be defeated

40
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:32,263
unless the stone is somehow a part of the process.

41
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:35,029
What? That's crazy. Why would that be?

42
00:02:35,362 --> 00:02:36,403
I don't know,

43
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,560
but I will perform my duty as guardian as best I can.

44
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,934
JoJo, Caesar,

45
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:48,725
I'm afraid it's necessary for a final examination.

46
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:50,687
What? A final exam?

47
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:53,470
Caesar, take on Meshina, and defeat him.

48
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:57,838
JoJo, you have the same assignment,
but with Loggs. Are you two ready?

49
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,142
Are you ready, Caesar?

50
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:38,681
I was born ready.

51
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,251
It's almost dawn.

52
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,007
It's always darkest then.

53
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:55,924
Now, where could I expect Loggs to be hiding?

54
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:59,102
Stay sharp, Joseph. Eyes open.

55
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:01,191
You've got a score to settle with him.

56
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:03,430
Huh?

57
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,563
Is that instructor Loggs?

58
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:10,591
Horrible. Unnatural.

59
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:12,750
Instructor Loggs...

60
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,301
H‐he's dead!

61
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:20,681
Esidisi.

62
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:24,806
So you came to venice, came here to this island.

63
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:30,295
Hmm.

64
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:35,070
To think that the woman guarding the stone

65
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:37,723
is merely an island or two over that way.

66
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,048
His lungs were pulled out.

67
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:49,060
Lungs are vital for hamon users.

68
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:52,929
It had to have been a kick of incredible power.

69
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:55,923
The tyrant Loggs.

70
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:58,680
You yelled at me for three weeks.

71
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:01,899
You were relentless with your instructions.

72
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:03,995
To be honest, I hated you.

73
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:09,691
I was sure that this would be my chance to
get you back for everything you did to me.

74
00:06:10,414 --> 00:06:13,894
You'll have to watch me from
where you are now, instructor.

75
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,130
See what I've learned from you.

76
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:26,917
Hey, Esidisi, I know it's six days early,

77
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:28,920
but I'll take it now.

78
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:32,605
That antidote in your nose ring is mine!

79
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:34,202
Hmm.

80
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:36,450
Out of my way, boy.

81
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,692
I don't have the time to deal with you.

82
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:40,917
You don't have the time? What do you mean?

83
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,974
You have a lot more time than I do.

84
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:46,885
That was pretty sharp.

85
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:49,264
You may have a little more to offer.

86
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,812
But when someone looks at me with
an obvious challenge like that one,

87
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:56,887
they are asking for their death.

88
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:03,391
I'll tell you this one more time.

89
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,590
Back away.

90
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:08,762
You know that with one touch of my hand,
you'll soon be missing half of your body.

91
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,459
Just try to move me.

92
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:17,956
Ooh. What's this now?

93
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,158
Oh, look. I'm still here.

94
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:21,977
I only move for important things,

95
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,582
like dog poo in my path.

96
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,587
Using his hamon, he's able to break
right through the flesh of my hand.

97
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:34,243
He's learned a great deal of
control in a very short period of time.

98
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,285
However...

99
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,911
You've developed new skills.

100
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,064
I have to say I'm rather surprised.

101
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:51,529
But you're still far from ready to fight someone like me!

102
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:56,511
I've met and devoured countless hamon
users like you thousands of years ago!

103
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,230
If I twist your finger completely off,

104
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:03,194
you'll never use it for hamon ever again.

105
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:05,982
Like this!

106
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:09,404
Hmm? Eh?

107
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:11,376
Oh, you finally noticed?

108
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:14,992
Your arm is wrapped up in a loop of fine silk thread.

109
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:17,185
It's soaked in vegetable oil,

110
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:20,013
so it really conducts hamon quite well.

111
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:22,889
I admit I was aiming for your neck,

112
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,754
but you didn't give me the chance.

113
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:27,441
How could a mortal have done this to me?

114
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:32,512
But‐but that's...

115
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:35,785
Actually a little morbid for my taste,

116
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:40,702
but still, first blood goes to me and my instructor!

117
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,873
2,500 years ago in China, a man wrote "the art of war."

118
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:52,748
He said this...

119
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:57,077
"Victory is decided before the battle is fought."

120
00:08:58,212 --> 00:09:00,317
That means if you plan to win,

121
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:03,797
you need to lay out strategies
while your opponent is unaware.

122
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,643
It's true that I skipped school a lot,

123
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:10,359
but granny Erina made darn sure I studied my history.

124
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:13,753
So while you may have a lot of years under your belt,

125
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:16,588
you didn't leave any room in your head for strategy.

126
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,441
Take this!

127
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:30,690
How dare you?

128
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,517
Aww. Are you angry?

129
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:35,426
Are you upset that I disintegrated your widdle arm?

130
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:37,936
Well, then, get upset!

131
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:40,002
I'm far more furious than you.

132
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:43,315
Because of that little ring
you saw fit to put inside my neck,

133
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:45,055
I haven't slept right for weeks.

134
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:47,867
Huh?

135
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:53,252
I just can't take it!

136
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:01,317
I just can't take it!

137
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:03,016
What the hell is this?

138
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,701
He's bawling his eyes out,

139
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,957
and I thought he'd go on a bloody rampage.

140
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:08,865
This is more than weird.

141
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:10,470
This is embarrassing.

142
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:13,512
He's throwing a tantrum like some three‐year‐old.

143
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,473
My poor arm!

144
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,024
Ehh.

145
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,362
Some things are creepier than mindless anger.

146
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:30,317
I should finish him off quickly.

147
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:34,553
Eh?

148
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:48,684
I feel better now.

149
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:51,521
Sometimes my emotions overwhelm me,

150
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,213
and when I'm about to lose it,

151
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:56,622
I try to calm myself down by venting with a crying jag.

152
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,730
Earlier you referred to sun tzu, didn't you?

153
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:03,407
I knew him personally.

154
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:06,522
Long ago, I journeyed to China to study.

155
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,181
To fight is to delude.

156
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:10,732
All war is deception.

157
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,245
One tries to make their enemies angry

158
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,159
in order to lure them into committing costly mistakes.

159
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:19,203
That is precisely what you're planning on. Am I right?

160
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,838
Well, it's not going to work.

161
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:22,943
But I must say, JoJo,

162
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:25,510
I really am shocked at your improvement.

163
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,401
I admire your hamon ability.

164
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,882
I've been longing for a worthy opponent.

165
00:11:33,104 --> 00:11:34,347
What the hell?

166
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:35,496
What are you doing?

167
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:37,807
Huh.

168
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:42,432
Well, it is a bit thin at the moment, but
it'll grow thicker with the passage of time.

169
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:45,546
He's too much.

170
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:48,218
Just a minute ago, he was crying.

171
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,531
Oh, JoJo, did I just frighten you there?

172
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:54,627
Come on. Admit it. You're frightened a lot, aren't you?

173
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:56,629
I can't read him.

174
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:59,446
I've always been able to read my opponents

175
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:01,842
and then use their own feelings against them,

176
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:05,426
but this guy's personality is beyond me.

177
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:07,682
Am I the one who's being read here?

178
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:14,277
W‐what's happening to Loggs's body?

179
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:18,298
Gah!

180
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,028
That burns.

181
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:22,642
His body, it's boiling.

182
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:24,660
What's going on?

183
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:31,041
An animal's core temperature will increase when
it's fighting disease or greatly exerting itself.

184
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:35,451
I can raise my blood up to 500
degrees and then shoot it out at will.

185
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,532
At the same time I took off his arm,

186
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:40,901
I also sent in some of my boiling blood to show you.

187
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:45,450
With his Divine Sandstorm, Wamuu can control the wind.

188
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:48,203
My domain is that of heat.

189
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:50,840
I control the inferno.

190
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:56,107
I'll grant that your power to destroy
a defenseless dead body is amazing,

191
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:59,271
but I can also see that the reason you did it

192
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:00,796
was to try and scare me.

193
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:04,282
Now try a clacker volley!

194
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,515
My hamon isn't like it was a month ago.

195
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:13,069
I really did frighten you.

196
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,750
You see, JoJo, your uncontrolled emotions
caused you to attack me recklessly and too soon.

197
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,896
My veins will inject boiling blood into your skull

198
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:27,935
and then turn your brain into a nice red stew.

199
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:32,185
This is the reason that I am called the burning king.

200
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,171
JoJo.

201
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,889
Caesar, take this!

202
00:13:51,969 --> 00:13:53,643
Bubble launcher!

203
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:01,588
Caesar, stop. Hold your attack.

204
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,586
If we continue this contest, one or both of us will die.

205
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:10,955
And much as my ego doesn't want
to admit it, I'd be the loser.

206
00:14:11,398 --> 00:14:15,070
For nearly 10 years more than
you, I have been in preparation here,

207
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:20,386
but today your hamon attack was so focused
you were able to burn the hair off of my arm.

208
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:24,488
What else can I do after being shamed like this?

209
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:28,913
You have passed your final exam with flying colors.

210
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,598
You should feel a sense of pride for this.

211
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:48,470
Or are you more interested in how your
good‐for‐nothing friend is doing in his exam, Caesar?

212
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:53,738
The only reason I had the power I did in this training

213
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,817
is that I wanted to match JoJo's talents.

214
00:14:57,273 --> 00:15:01,822
In the end, we're both going to
survive the trials being presented to us.

215
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:05,807
I can't deny it. JoJo seems lazy and impudent,

216
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:09,163
but deep down, he's worth having as a friend.

217
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:12,750
Heh. You're not so good at making
friends for yourself, are you?

218
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:15,389
But when you do, it's true love, isn't it?

219
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,653
Wha?! Look there!

220
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:20,504
Esidisi!

221
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:24,437
Humph. And there's another of
those clever dodges of yours.

222
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:28,681
All right. The mask gave me
some protection that time, but...

223
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:34,568
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

224
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:37,785
Ah, damn him and his blood.

225
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:47,662
Man, oh, man, I finally have the chance for these
sexy lips to come out from under that rotten mask,

226
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:50,854
and the first thing you do, you bastard, is burn 'em off.

227
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,858
JoJo. Hmm. Let's see.

228
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:55,923
On the surface, you make witty banter,

229
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,014
but inside your head, you're
making all sorts of plans, aren't you?

230
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,954
Ooh, you went pale, JoJo.

231
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:04,385
Did I hit the mark?

232
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:08,676
Was I anywhere close to the bull's‐eye?!

233
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:13,688
Heh. My next plan.

234
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:16,470
Right. Yes.

235
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:17,839
I'll use the string.

236
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,639
I'll act like I'm dodging to get away from him,

237
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:24,859
but all the time, I'll be running a string
along these spikes with each move I make.

238
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,714
I can't let him catch on.

239
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:28,625
Once he steps inside the string,

240
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:32,341
I'll wrap him up in it, then
use my hamon to finish him off.

241
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:42,007
That laugh means trouble.

242
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:46,017
Could‐could he be reading my plan, my intentions?

243
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:48,488
No, it's impossible.

244
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:57,639
Whoa!

245
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:01,453
Here is the burning king's prison!

246
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:08,025
How long can you possibly keep avoiding my attacks, JoJo?

247
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:09,646
Humph.

248
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:10,781
Huh?

249
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:13,015
So I guess you finally noticed.

250
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,113
Now, what possible reason would my hat be shrinking?

251
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:18,822
You appear to be caught in my web.

252
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:22,524
My hat is made of 100% wool.

253
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:24,526
It conducts hamon very well.

254
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:26,082
And?

255
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,554
You're smiling again. I don't like it.

256
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:30,470
What are you laughing about this time?

257
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:32,354
The next words from your mouth are,

258
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,768
"I'm going to knock that smirk
right off of your face." Watch.

259
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,327
I'm going to knock that smirk right off your face.

260
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:42,473
What a second. You can't do that. That's my trick.

261
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:44,300
You said you had a web?

262
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:45,374
Look around.

263
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:47,272
I am the one with the web.

264
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:53,629
I knew exactly what you had in mind
with your little plan even before you did.

265
00:17:55,802 --> 00:17:59,056
So, JoJo, what was that phrase you said earlier?

266
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:03,599
Something like, "victory is decided before
the battle is fought." Was that what it was?

267
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,513
It's true, true,

268
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,295
very true, very true, very true!

269
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:12,800
How incredibly true were the words you spoke.

270
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:16,613
But my plans were the ones to go deeper.

271
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:19,728
My plans were the ones to decide victory!

272
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,843
It looks like my veins have created
some little holes on your body.

273
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:28,824
So now I'll fill every one of them with a
generous portion of my boiling, burning blood.

274
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:34,479
You'll look like a lovely birthday cake covered in
candles flickering with their merry little red flames.

275
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,552
He's on a knife's edge.

276
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:38,582
He's not going to make it.

277
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:39,320
Caesar!

278
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:42,132
Judging from what I can see,

279
00:18:42,157 --> 00:18:44,539
we have to assume that Loggs has been killed.

280
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,296
If JoJo is not the one to survive,

281
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,911
we will be the ones Esidisi will come after next.

282
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:54,495
JoJo is too far away for us to be able to help him now.

283
00:18:55,026 --> 00:19:00,142
I know it's painful, but right now we have to
think about protecting Lisa Lisa and the red stone,

284
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:02,527
so come. Let's make our preparations.

285
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:05,443
JoJo.

286
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:12,887
Let me hear your screams as you
twitch and writhe in despair and agony,

287
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,276
knowing that you lost today, JoJo.

288
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,674
Are you really laughing as I'm about
to deal you an excruciating death?

289
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:33,106
Have you been driven completely insane by the fear?

290
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:35,267
Well, let's see here.

291
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:38,606
You'll notice my arms are folded and my eyes are closed,

292
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:41,497
so this laugh would be one of victory, Esidisi.

293
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:44,945
You're the loser here today,
because for the last 2,000 years,

294
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,558
you have been asleep at the wheel.

295
00:19:46,757 --> 00:19:47,875
I lost?

296
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,425
What do you mean by that?!

297
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:51,668
Oh, really? You don't get it?

298
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:54,383
You can't read me as clearly as you thought you could?

299
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:58,164
Let me help you understand just
how badly you've underestimated me.

300
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,397
You said that your plans went deep.

301
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,542
Well, they didn't go nearly as deep as mine.

302
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:08,755
While you were snoozing for the past 2,000 years,

303
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,564
humans have progressed.

304
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:13,266
During the 18th and 19th centuries,

305
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:17,891
legerdemain, or sleight of hand, became
a very popular form of entertainment.

306
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,774
I'm a really big fan of it myself.

307
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,983
Illusion is my thing!

308
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,447
But I cut all those strings.

309
00:20:26,228 --> 00:20:28,649
I cut them! It can't be!

310
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:32,360
I'd say the rope magic worked.

311
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:37,722
I laid my trap carefully, so that even if
the string was cut, it would still function.

312
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:39,755
A simple trick.

313
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:45,740
What you're going to say next is,

314
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:50,689
"my veins will move faster than your
pathetic hamon can possibly go." Now.

315
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:55,955
My veins will move faster than
your pathetic hamon could possibly go!

316
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,802
Now feel the beat of my Hamon Overdrive!

317
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:11,177
I can't. I can't.

318
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,745
You're only a human.

319
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:17,335
I am the evolved one, the highest life‐form!

320
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:21,077
I will not be beaten!

321
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:25,829
Know that you've pushed me too far!

322
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:37,937
Esidisi's body is shooting some kind of strange energy.

323
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:40,940
That must come from living for millennia.

324
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:42,926
Die already.

325
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:47,732
Die with the power of life you stole
from thousands of innocent human beings.

326
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:53,580
My instructor, I thank you for torturing me.

327
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,131
Mille grazie to you, Loggs.

328
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:14,584
Hmm. When we defeated Santviento in the
well, his entire body turned into stone,

329
00:22:15,513 --> 00:22:18,447
but even Esidisi's bones were completely destroyed.

330
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:20,249
Why is he so different?

331
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,716
Well, maybe it's because my hamon is
so much stronger than it was before.

332
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:27,367
Well, he's dead now,

333
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:30,102
and I have one of the antidotes I've been chasing down.

334
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:33,883
Ugh.

335
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:38,595
Oh, man, this reminds me of snot.

336
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:42,321
Hopefully it's just because it's dripping
from a ring that came out of his nose.

337
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:44,870
But I need to knock it back.

338
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:57,566
Yes. I do think it worked.

339
00:22:57,963 --> 00:23:01,419
The ring around my windpipe is
gone, and I can breathe free again.

340
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:05,313
So then, I'll go see Lisa Lisa and Caesar.

341
00:23:07,537 --> 00:23:10,541
I think maybe I was using my head too much in that fight.

342
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,435
My shoulders are really kinda stiff.

343
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:42,251
I'll be the roundabout

344
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:46,256
the words will make you out and out

345
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:51,768
I spend the day your way

346
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:58,942
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

347
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:09,598
The music dance and sing

348
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:13,419
they make the children really ring

349
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:18,726
I spend the day your way

350
00:24:18,855 --> 00:24:25,112
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

351
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,823
in and around the lake

352
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:33,360
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

353
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:40,233
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

354
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:46,279
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

355
00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:52,047
24 before my love you'll see

356
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,557
I'll be there with you

357
00:24:59,086 --> 00:25:01,057
I think the white one is pretty.

358
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,756
We'll wait for that until we cross.

359
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:05,331
But I really like the lovely design on this one.

360
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:06,920
I'll eradicate every one of them.

361
00:25:06,945 --> 00:25:08,365
Which do I choose?

362
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,571
Damn it all. I just can't hit her.
