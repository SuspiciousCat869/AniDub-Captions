1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,777
Down here,

2
00:00:01,882 --> 00:00:04,000
my hamon will hit you all the harder.

3
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:13,030
Underwater turquoise blue overdrive!

4
00:00:16,923 --> 00:00:17,616
He did it!

5
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:18,641
Bravo.

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,421
That was amazing.

7
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:21,906
It's not over yet!

8
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:27,309
I can't believe Blueford was able to dodge
that blast of hamon. He moves so fast underwater.

9
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:29,493
He was all a blur.

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,346
My overdrive barely glanced off his forehead.

11
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:38,520
Now I know anything less than a solid punch
won't be enough to send the hamon into him.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,824
My good lord Dio, I thank thee for this life anew

13
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:45,224
that I may duel with this stouthearted lad.

14
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:48,165
My heart would swell to bursting if still it beat.

15
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,415
In blood and deed, he is the stuff of heroes.

16
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:54,710
Now we will fight in our native element.

17
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:59,795
It is by mastery of our arts and strength
of our spirits that we wage this duel.

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,038
Bare your soul. Hold nothing back,
lest you not survive beyond this moment!

19
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,918
Even as Dio's puppet, his pride
is a force to be reckoned with,

20
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:15,781
but his knightly valor has been
twisted into a wanton love of violence.

21
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:18,903
When I best you, I'll take your head as my trophy!

22
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,675
It's easy to let your hair do the work.

23
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:24,113
Come. Withstand my hamon face to face like a man!

24
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:03,274
Overdrive barrage!

25
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:12,800
JoJo!

26
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,578
This is terrible.

27
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:24,694
Hamon can only be projected through the arms and the legs.

28
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:29,109
With his arms bound in front of him
like that, he has no way of blasting

29
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:30,787
through that infernal hair of Blueford's.

30
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:34,791
I‐i wanna help him out, but you
and me have got things even worse.

31
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,072
I think of Tarukus fancies a dust‐up.

32
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:44,523
His hair, it's tearing through my clothes.

33
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:45,889
Through my skin.

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,480
The more I struggle, the tighter it winds,

35
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,307
and it's sucking my blood away.

36
00:03:55,957 --> 00:03:57,798
Bid your petty life adieu.

37
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,824
Behold, the coup de grâce!

38
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:04,392
I'll take your head and bathe in
a fountain of life‐giving blood!

39
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,416
Take this!

40
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:15,099
Water's not all that conducts hamon.

41
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:17,755
Metal silver overdrive!

42
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,187
What a brain.

43
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:25,310
Using the sword to hoist Blueford by his
own bleeding petard. Who thinks of that?

44
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,810
How my heart resonates.

45
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:33,487
I'm pulsing with heat and life.

46
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,733
My very blood is a symphony within me!

47
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:43,569
Sunlight yellow overdrive!

48
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,083
There we go. That's it. About time
we heard the welcome crackle of hamon.

49
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:57,206
When I pummeled Blueford a moment ago,
something felt different. Knowing his past

50
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,522
makes his present corruption all the worse.

51
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,060
Take heart, JoJo. He is that man no longer.

52
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:06,759
He's nothing but a zombie eager to spread his evil.

53
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:09,485
You must be the one to end him.

54
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,865
I am the black knight Blueford.

55
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:18,176
Strike me as thou wilt.

56
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:19,581
This pain is nothing!

57
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:23,443
He's still dangerous, mate! Look out!

58
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:27,694
Even missing an arm and scorched all to hell,

59
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:30,690
he's laying into JoJo every bit as ferociously.

60
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:35,394
What the?!

61
00:05:35,578 --> 00:05:37,777
Don't just stand there! Do something!

62
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,676
If you don't get outta there now, it's curtains for you!

63
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:48,391
Have they both gone mad?

64
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:51,117
What are they doin', eh?

65
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:54,008
A moment ago,

66
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:56,240
you said, "this pain is nothing."

67
00:05:56,706 --> 00:06:00,539
That means pain is something you can feel again.

68
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:04,657
The flowers,

69
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:06,881
they're blooming all around him.

70
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:12,610
Even now, the hamon ravages the evil
that animates Blueford's long‐dead corpse.

71
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:20,004
You see? The long‐forgotten pain came back.

72
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:22,685
Only humans know that sort of ache.

73
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,940
Observe, my dear Speedwagon.

74
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,427
His zombie body succumbs to the hamon,

75
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:31,002
but his noble soul is redeemed in the process.

76
00:06:31,153 --> 00:06:34,417
I could sense the good in you.
That's why I didn't try to dodge.

77
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:37,455
You could have killed me just now,

78
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,112
but you stayed your hand.

79
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:40,998
Look at his face.

80
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,829
It's like all the rage and hatred he
had when Dio brought him back are gone.

81
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:49,062
His features are so gentle, he could be
a bloke catching up with his oldest mate.

82
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:51,508
You stood there like a statue,

83
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,828
ready to take the fatal blow.

84
00:06:54,352 --> 00:06:57,824
Oblivion beckoned, but you put your trust in me.

85
00:06:58,236 --> 00:07:00,843
Your faith in human goodness is rare.

86
00:07:04,593 --> 00:07:07,278
Once I'd have railed against the pain I feel.

87
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:09,756
Now, going to my rightful end,

88
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:11,910
I cherish all that proves me human.

89
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:14,253
It gives me joy.

90
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,733
The embers dull within me,

91
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,169
but I am tranquil.

92
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,262
There is no bitterness left.

93
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:24,114
What irony to live yet again,

94
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:26,440
dying with thanks on my lips

95
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:28,761
for the very man who slaughters me anew.

96
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:32,034
I shall return to my one true master.

97
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:38,590
I would know the name of the warrior who bested me.

98
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:40,957
Would you kindly do me that honor?

99
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:43,944
It's Jonathan Joestar.

100
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:49,992
Sir Jonathan, I leave you this
sword, given to me by my precious queen,

101
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:52,055
and the word engraved upon it.

102
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:53,597
Luck.

103
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:58,403
But first. Let me affix my own benediction.

104
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:00,086
Pluck.

105
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:02,289
Sir Blueford.

106
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:03,900
Heh.

107
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:11,981
Go you to your rest.

108
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:14,467
Let no one doubt you have earned it, Blueford.

109
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:19,958
Why? Why did I have to strike him down to redeem his soul?

110
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:25,505
He died once before with hate in his
heart, but his spirit was still pure.

111
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:30,167
He returned not out of choice,
but dragged above by Dio's evil,

112
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,645
his evil and the mask's power.

113
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,524
I will send them both to hell before the dawn!

114
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:38,374
JoJo, he's right behind you!

115
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:39,668
Tarukus!

116
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,625
You villain!

117
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,813
That was the armor of a steadfast friend and comrade.

118
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:49,981
He died with honor and dignity.

119
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:52,444
He died like a spineless dog!

120
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:54,573
He was too clever by half,

121
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:56,775
liked winning his fights with thinking.

122
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,841
I just hit 'em until they fall to pieces!

123
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:02,742
What use have I got for clever?

124
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:05,363
I carry a sword as tall as a man.

125
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:08,117
None of you will get an easy death.

126
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:24,799
JoJo, nice catch.

127
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,104
The cliff is crumbling!

128
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:31,009
Hmm.

129
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,726
These dead leaves.

130
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:33,716
JoJo!

131
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,670
Yes, sir.

132
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:42,545
Life magnetism overdrive!

133
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:54,305
Hurry, Poco, Speedwagon! Grab on!

134
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:04,371
All human beings, whether adept at hamon or not,

135
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:07,009
constantly exude a weak magnetic field.

136
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,433
An overdrive can increase the power of that field.

137
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:12,997
JoJo and Zeppeli sent it into the leaves,

138
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,517
drawing them together into a solid sheet.

139
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:17,391
W‐wow.

140
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:18,820
Bye.

141
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:25,163
We're flying. I can't believe it.

142
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,934
I bet you're magicians, huh?

143
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:31,742
You'd have to be, right? How did you learn to
do all of these neat spells in the first place?

144
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:33,204
Damn good question.

145
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:36,271
I've been watching 'em do it, and I still pinch myself.

146
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:38,365
Oi, baron, what's the story?

147
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:39,841
We're not going anywhere.

148
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:43,199
How on earth did you pick up all this mumbo jumbo?

149
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:55,229
Many years ago, my travels took me to India,

150
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:57,469
where I discovered a mysterious man.

151
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:03,055
He called himself a doctor, though he was
very young and lacked all the tools of the trade.

152
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,620
Little did I know

153
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,709
he was more potent of a medic than I'd ever encountered.

154
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:12,222
He took a gangrenous limb in his hands
and healed it with light from within.

155
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,154
That was the day I learned of hamon.

156
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,269
I'd been looking for something with
which to fight the stone mask's evil,

157
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,502
and in hamon, I had found it.

158
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:25,872
Eager to learn, I crossed into
Tibet and up the salween river

159
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:28,955
in search of he who had taught the young healer.

160
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:37,847
His name was tonpetty.

161
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:55,777
Stranger, these eyes of mine have seen your future.

162
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:00,258
If you pursue the mysteries of hamon as my pupil,

163
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,982
your fate is sealed.

164
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,089
The day will come when this will be the death of you.

165
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,289
I understand.

166
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:13,010
If I must die to end this quest, so be it.

167
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:24,376
Master tonpetty's prophecy is never far from my mind,

168
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:27,379
but I cannot tell them, not even JoJo.

169
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:28,611
Baron...

170
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:35,261
So that sound, that's part of hamon doing its thing, yeah?

171
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:36,821
Hardly.

172
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,935
Look out! It's Tarukus!

173
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:50,240
He's insane,

174
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,537
leaping from that height just to give chase to his foes.

175
00:12:56,603 --> 00:13:00,187
There's a goodly amount of hamon
holding these leaves together, you brute,

176
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:02,530
painful to the touch for the undead.

177
00:13:03,146 --> 00:13:03,960
What's that?

178
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:06,836
That's where the knights used to train in the olden days.

179
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:10,752
Leap to safety, everyone, before
we get swatted out of the sky!

180
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,523
Crazy blighter.

181
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,028
He just slammed himself straight into the tower.

182
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:24,492
Yes, and thank your lucky stars that he did, Speedwagon.

183
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:27,909
Unlike their master, Dio's minions can't regenerate,

184
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:30,442
so that should be the last we see of that beast.

185
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:39,240
How did... he should be mincemeat.

186
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:41,644
Even in death, he has a will of iron.

187
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:44,670
How does his body endure under such punishment?

188
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,154
He's climbing up.

189
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:50,097
We can't destroy Dio while this monster dogs our steps.

190
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:52,083
It seems we have no other choice.

191
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,481
Tarukus meets his doom here and now.

192
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,881
JoJo, this will be perilous. Get the lad to safety within.

193
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:14,010
This door...

194
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:15,632
Something's odd about it.

195
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:17,218
Be careful.

196
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:19,987
This is where they used to train
the knights how to kill people.

197
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:22,322
They say it's full of booby traps.

198
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:26,562
Duck, JoJo! Something's coming at ya!

199
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,174
Oh, no!

200
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:31,193
JoJo!

201
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,494
Who ensnared me?

202
00:14:39,385 --> 00:14:40,335
Tarukus.

203
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:43,105
Yes. Caught you good.

204
00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:48,038
You're fleet of foot, little man, but
now you and me are chained to each other.

205
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:49,818
You got nowhere to run.

206
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,858
JoJo had wandered into the lair of the two‐headed dragon,

207
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:59,185
an ancient sparring ground and
home of the chain death‐match.

208
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:01,988
I killed 48 men here.

209
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:05,381
Taking a life's an art form, and I'm a master.

210
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:10,991
That's enough. You can't punch through it.

211
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,666
That door is solid iron.

212
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:16,806
Goodness. He's battered his knuckles bloody against it.

213
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:18,781
Hamon is very versatile,

214
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:22,117
but it's meant to be used as a
rapier, not as a sledgehammer.

215
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,979
Bricks I could beat to a powder,

216
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:25,887
but this door is too strong.

217
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:27,937
JoJo faces a darker dilemma.

218
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,448
That chain about his neck is more
than ripple energy can overcome.

219
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,532
Breaking out of that collar is impossible,
and you'll need the key to unlock it.

220
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:38,256
Too bad it's right here.

221
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,231
During a death match, the door to
the outside is fashioned to lock tight.

222
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,241
Just as I have the key to your collar,

223
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:48,201
you have the one that goes to mine.

224
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:52,805
Therefore, the only way that either
of us is going to get out of here...

225
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:56,665
Is by taking the other's head!

226
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:01,471
Overdrive!

227
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,832
The chain is touching the stone ceiling,

228
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:15,003
so the hamon lacks a direct path into Tarukus.

229
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,322
He's broken the bone in my forearm.

230
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:29,103
It's a simple thing to fix. A
little hamon, and I'm good as new.

231
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,851
But in order to use hamon,

232
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:33,562
I need to be free of this damnable collar.

233
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,323
I can't breathe.

234
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:40,053
JoJo!

235
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:42,023
Oh, no.

236
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,130
This is all so frightening, I think I wet myself.

237
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:48,689
This village was safe until these men arrived.

238
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:53,171
I'm in danger here. You need to get away
from all this fighting on the double, Poco.

239
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,840
I see a lever, baron Zeppeli.

240
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:59,261
No telling for certain, but I think
pulling on it will open this door.

241
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:02,030
Fighting Tarukus is a daunting enough task as it is,

242
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,900
never mind doing it fresh out of a battle with Blueford.

243
00:17:05,962 --> 00:17:07,233
Come hell or high water,

244
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:09,919
we must find a way to get in there and help him.

245
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:13,127
Uhh! It's locked up tighter than a nunnery.

246
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:20,072
It's so narrow.

247
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:23,599
Try as they might, they could never squeeze through,

248
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:24,861
but...

249
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:29,008
Maybe I could.

250
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:33,705
Blast it!

251
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:36,686
We could batter this door 'til judgment day to no avail.

252
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:39,663
We'll have to use the cliffside entrance Tarukus used.

253
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:41,665
But that'll take too much time,

254
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:43,095
time that he don't got.

255
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:45,256
I know, but we've no other choice.

256
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,452
Always on the bleedin' sidelines.

257
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,422
I'm powerless.

258
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:54,624
There's nothing I can do to help.

259
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:57,865
Look at me, brat. I'm talking to you.

260
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,543
I said look at me.

261
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,115
Are you stupid or what?

262
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:03,140
He's such a little scaredy‐cat.

263
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,559
What a baby. He's shaking like a leaf.

264
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,091
Look, fellas. Look at him.

265
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:08,823
Aw, is the baby gonna cry?

266
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:18,968
Hey. Look.

267
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,683
Hmm?

268
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,941
Come on! Let's get outta here.

269
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:29,676
Sis, it's you.

270
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:31,352
Poco, really?

271
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,626
You're letting those boys bully you again?

272
00:18:34,674 --> 00:18:36,223
They do this all the time.

273
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:38,656
Why not try standing up to them for once?

274
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:42,015
I'll bloody their noses! I will!

275
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:44,526
When? Tomorrow? In a year?

276
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:46,337
Uh, I don't know.

277
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:49,770
Poco...

278
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,877
What frightens you more than anything else?

279
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:00,138
I know that hurt, but you're still in one piece.

280
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:01,742
Pain's not the worst thing.

281
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,922
There's something far worse.

282
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:06,883
Huh?

283
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,138
It's growing up being too afraid to do anything.

284
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:12,212
What kind of a life would that be?

285
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,575
I'm sorry, sis.

286
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:21,206
It's all right, Poco.

287
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:24,701
Let's get you home and into some clean clothes.

288
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:37,751
Poco!

289
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,513
A window.

290
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:44,296
Oi, lad! That's brave, but goin'
in there is gonna be the end of ya!

291
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:46,441
Speedwagon, get the boy down!

292
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:48,977
A butcher like Tarukus doesn't care who he kills!

293
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:51,264
He'll crush Poco underfoot like a bug!

294
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,633
Come on, now! Enough of this nonsense, Poco!

295
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:02,602
Just think of what's gonna happen to
wind knights lot if these monsters win.

296
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,995
If that JoJo guy gets killed
in here, they'll attack us next.

297
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,210
What if they hurt sis?

298
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:14,486
I have to keep her safe, no matter what.

299
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:17,862
Hey, sis!

300
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,318
I'm standing up to them now!

301
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:23,249
Stay back! He'll kill you.

302
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:27,254
Do not interfere, you brat!

303
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:35,578
Poco!

304
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:37,859
It hurt a lot,

305
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:42,111
but I'm still in one piece, so it's fine.

306
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:55,537
I was brave, huh?

307
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:01,314
Brave as a bear, my lad.

308
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:04,492
Take heart. It's nothing that won't heal.

309
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:07,424
Get him, baron! Go!

310
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:10,013
Give that hulking bastard the what‐for.

311
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:21,874
Zeppeli?

312
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:27,173
The day will come when this will be the death of you.

313
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:28,826
Infine.

314
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:32,703
Is tonight the night that I go to my grave?

315
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:36,303
Fate is a fickle mistress,

316
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:38,440
but I cannot deny her.

317
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:40,092
Zeppeli...

318
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:43,541
Why do you sound so dire?

319
00:22:02,273 --> 00:22:05,442
I'll be the roundabout

320
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:09,394
the words will make you out and out

321
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:14,823
I spend the day your way

322
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:21,919
call it morning driving through
the sound and in and out the valley

323
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:32,412
The music dance and sing

324
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:36,482
they make the children really ring

325
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:41,783
I spend the day your way

326
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:51,060
call it morning driving through the sound and
in and out the valley in and around the lake

327
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:56,356
mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

328
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:02,960
one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

329
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:09,432
10 true summers we'll be there and laughing too

330
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,956
24 before my love you'll see

331
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:18,777
I'll be there with you

332
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:31,704
This bloody savagery is unbelievable!

333
00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:34,182
Oh, no! Tarakus!

334
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:35,811
Pathetic waste of flesh!

335
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:37,692
JoJo, take it!

336
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:39,557
Make it yours!
