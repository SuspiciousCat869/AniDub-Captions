RYUJI: <i>Wait. What?</i>

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:15.330
<i>No one told me we were</i>
<i>gonna hit him with a bluff!</i>

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:18.504
<i>How is this supposed to work?</i>

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:21.376
<i>I told him this guy</i>
<i>doesn’t negotiate.</i>

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:23.313
<i>What the hell is he expecting?</i>

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:26.620
<i>If Eighth Clan was just a bunch</i>
<i>of punks in it for the money,</i>

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:28.691
<i>they might be down to haggle,</i>

00:00:28.724 --> 00:00:32.064
<i>but we both know</i>
<i>that’s not how Wang works!</i>

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.272
<i>I know that monster</i>
<i>all too well.</i>

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:39.746
<i>He’s the bastard</i>
<i>who chopped up my kid brother.</i>

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.151
<i>I’ll make him pay</i>
<i>with his life!</i>

00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:44.623
<i>But all I’ve got on me</i>
<i>are hand grenades.</i>

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:47.428
<i>He can easily use</i>
<i>his Sigil to dodge them.</i>

00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:49.232
<i>Which means I’ll have to wait</i>

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:51.637
<i>for a moment</i>
<i>when he can’t teleport,</i>

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.645
<i>and that moment’ll be when he</i>
<i>gets ready to slaughter me.</i>

00:00:55.678 --> 00:00:59.786
<i>You can’t stop this,</i>
<i>Kaname, so back off!</i>

[Japanese music playing]

00:02:35.177 --> 00:02:37.214
WANG:
Didn’t I tell you?

00:02:37.247 --> 00:02:38.818
My clan
only makes deals

00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.287
that are
take‐and‐take.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.093
But I do appreciate
the effort,

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:44.896
so I’ll try to make
your death painless.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.637
‐ No dice? Okay, well,
if you’re gonna be like that...

00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:51.242
‐ I guess I have no choice.
‐ [gasps]

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:53.514
I would have expected
a smart guy like yourself

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:55.618
to understand
how valuable this key is.

00:02:55.651 --> 00:03:00.093
<i>‐ Come on. He’s gonna see</i>
<i>right through that, you idiot!</i>

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:03.601
<i>It’d be really helpful</i>
<i>if I could read Kaname’s mind.</i>

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.470
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>all my Sigil can do</i>

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:07.809
<i>is indicate whether someone’s</i>
<i>telling the truth or not.</i>

00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:09.946
‐ Go ahead and shoot it, kid.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.886
There’s no way in hell that’s
the key to the real treasure.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.689
<i>‐ Didn’t expect that.</i>

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:17.127
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>he’s actually interested</i>

00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:19.465
<i>in what Kaname has to say.</i>

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:22.037
‐ Sorry, but seeing
as I can’t prove it,

00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:23.607
you’ll just have
to take my word.

00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:27.247
The codes are a match for the
coordinates to Shibuya Station,

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.051
but unless you know
the diamond code,

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:31.222
you’ll never be able
to locate the treasure.

00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:35.798
For what it’s worth,
the code is 8‐8‐8‐O‐O‐1.

00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:37.067
Split that number in half,

00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:39.806
and you get triple‐8
and double‐O one.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.842
"Hachi" means "eight,"

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:44.048
which stands for the
Hachiko statue near the station.

00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:46.219
That’s where I found this key.

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:49.258
All that was left was
figuring out what it goes to.

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:50.661
And then it dawned on me.

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:53.333
It must be the key
to a safety deposit box.

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:57.374
Once I realized that, it was
obvious what the 0‐0‐1 was.

00:03:57.408 --> 00:03:59.980
The treasure is stored
inside a safety deposit box

00:04:00.013 --> 00:04:03.654
in Inaho Bank, branch 0‐0‐1.

00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:05.257
[Ryuji chuckles]

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.327
<i>He’s lying through his teeth.</i>

00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:10.000
<i>Now we just hope to God</i>
<i>Wang buys all of it.</i>

00:04:11.335 --> 00:04:14.375
WANG: <i>Everything he says</i>
<i>is making sense,</i>

00:04:14.408 --> 00:04:16.078
<i>but he can’t back it up.</i>

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:18.483
[chuckles]
<i>I can’t figure out his angle.</i>

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:21.322
‐ Hey, Boss,
maybe we better not kill him?

00:04:21.355 --> 00:04:23.928
We gotta find
that treasure somehow, right?

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:25.030
‐ Shut up a minute.

00:04:25.063 --> 00:04:28.671
It’s possible to win billions
of yen from this event

00:04:28.704 --> 00:04:30.808
just for collecting
a ton of rings.

00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:34.549
The real treasure must make that
look like chump change.

00:04:34.583 --> 00:04:36.987
Not to mention
that rumor I heard.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.125
Whoever successfully
clears the event

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:41.864
will be given
a special privilege in D‐Game.

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:43.333
That’s too good to ignore.

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:46.172
All right, fine.

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:48.644
I’ll guarantee
your safety, then.

00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:52.685
Sadly, your buddy here
is a different story.

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.323
I can’t let you get
too greedy after all.

00:04:55.357 --> 00:04:58.263
Plus, I’ve already
started his execution,

00:04:58.296 --> 00:05:00.802
and I always like
to finish what I start.

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:04.441
‐ Sure. Sounds good.

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:06.580
We only teamed up
out of convenience,

00:05:06.613 --> 00:05:08.651
so I don’t care
if you kill him.

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:10.621
‐ [gasps]

00:05:10.655 --> 00:05:13.393
‐ [laughs]

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:15.698
It looks like you just
got tossed under the bus,

00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:16.733
you poor bastard!

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:19.639
But hey, that’s what
D‐Game’s all about, right?

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:23.313
[laughs]

00:05:24.883 --> 00:05:26.485
<i>‐ Thanks a lot, Kaname.</i>

00:05:27.387 --> 00:05:28.691
<i>You proved that my Sigil</i>

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:31.362
<i>really is good</i>
<i>for something after all.</i>

00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:33.132
‐ So do we have a deal?

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.836
‐ Sure, kid, but look...

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.575
if I start to feel
like you’re screwing with me,

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:39.513
I’ll rip you to shreds.

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:41.282
<i>‐ Give me an opening, Kaname.</i>

00:05:41.315 --> 00:05:43.253
<i>I just need one second!</i>

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:46.259
<i>I swear I’ll send</i>
<i>this guy to hell!</i>

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:48.229
‐ I’ll tell you what.

00:05:48.263 --> 00:05:49.966
If you suspect I might be lying,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.404
why don’t you take a look
at the key for yourself?

00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:54.241
‐ Huh?
‐ Go ahead.

00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:57.014
Inspect it as much as you want!

00:06:01.355 --> 00:06:04.028

‐ Here’s my take.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.504
It’s real simple.

00:06:08.537 --> 00:06:11.309
No matter what path
you choose to follow,

00:06:11.342 --> 00:06:13.781
if you’re still alive
when the game is over,

00:06:13.814 --> 00:06:15.918
that’s all you need
to be the winner!

00:06:15.952 --> 00:06:16.920

00:06:16.954 --> 00:06:18.423
KANAME: <i>This is a gamble.</i>

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:20.026
<i>It might not even work.</i>

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.565
<i>But if we want the slightest</i>
<i>chance at winning,</i>

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.972
<i>it’s the only idea</i>
<i>I can think of.</i>

00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:31.082
REIN: <i>The diamond ring code</i>
<i>is six digits: 1‐8‐5‐9‐1‐1.</i>

00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:33.621
<i>The sequence is a reference</i>
<i>to the month and year</i>

The Origin of Species

<i>was originally published.</i>

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:41.068
<i>I see why the number</i>
<i>is connected with D‐Game,</i>

00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:41.937
<i>but I don’t understand</i>

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.108
<i>the correlation</i>
<i>to Shibuya Station.</i>

00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:45.811
<i>I also find it bizarre</i>

00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:49.285
<i>that the code doesn’t match</i>
<i>the exact date of publication.</i>

00:06:49.318 --> 00:06:50.888
<i>It’s only the month</i>
<i>and the year.</i>

00:06:50.922 --> 00:06:54.428
<i>Something that unnatural</i>
<i>must have a specific purpose.</i>

00:06:54.461 --> 00:06:56.399
<i>Perhaps the numbers</i>
<i>are merely a pass code</i>

00:06:56.432 --> 00:06:58.771
<i>and they don’t have</i>
<i>any particular significance,</i>

00:06:58.804 --> 00:07:01.375
<i>which means</i>
<i>the number of digits is key.</i>

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.514
<i>Let’s see.</i>
<i>What could a sequence like that</i>

00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:05.818
<i>be used for at Shibuya Station?</i>

<i>The only machines there</i>
<i>with six‐digit pass codes</i>

00:07:08.256 --> 00:07:10.327
<i>are the coin lockers</i>
<i>at the south exit.</i>

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.366

So then, in other words,
you created this deathtrap

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.620

‐ And that is?

00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:12.692

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:14.428

‐ Privilege?

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.996
‐ Yes. Tell me
what you wish for.

00:11:05.029 --> 00:11:06.833

00:11:12.778 --> 00:11:16.018

like much of a prize to me.

<i>‐ Well, I’m not God, after all.</i>

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.528
<i>Think of me</i>
<i>as something of a stand‐in.</i>

00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:24.001
‐ Fine. Then my wish is to quit
this stupid game right now.

00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:26.405
<i>‐ I’m not able to do that.</i>

00:11:26.438 --> 00:11:27.909
<i>It would go against</i>
<i>my own goals.</i>

00:11:27.942 --> 00:11:30.681
‐ Okay, so you’ll grant me
anything I wish for,

00:11:30.714 --> 00:11:32.885
but only if it’s
convenient for you?

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:35.925
<i>‐ I never said that I</i>
<i>would grant any wish at all,</i>

00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.628

<i>I’ve fulfilled</i>

00:11:37.662 --> 00:11:39.464
<i>as many requests</i>
<i>as I possibly could.</i>

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:41.335
<i>One winner was given authority</i>

<i>over the gambling den that</i>
<i>revolves around Darwin’s Game.</i>

00:11:44.876 --> 00:11:47.682
<i>And for another winner,</i>
<i>I allowed the institution</i>

00:11:47.715 --> 00:11:50.453
<i>of a point match</i>
<i>at his place of business.</i>

00:11:50.486 --> 00:11:52.457

<i>a contract system</i>

00:11:58.402 --> 00:12:00.507
<i>As I said before,</i>
<i>that doesn’t work for me,</i>

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:01.843

00:12:01.876 --> 00:12:04.214

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.525

<i>and the entire game</i>

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.712

<i>to ensure that outcome.</i>

00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:22.083

<i>or having to kill anybody else.</i>

00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:42.357

<i>would make that possible?</i>

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.294

SHUKA: Let me tell you a story.

00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:24.327
Once upon a time,
there were three little pigs

00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:25.363
who were brothers.

00:14:25.396 --> 00:14:26.298
One day, they decided

00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:28.069
it was time to leave
their parents’ place

00:14:28.102 --> 00:14:30.273
and build houses
of their very own.

00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:33.245
The oldest brother chose
to build his house out of straw,

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:36.118
the middle pig built his house
out of wood instead,

00:14:36.151 --> 00:14:38.857
and the youngest brother
used bricks to make his house.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.328
But then
a big, bad wolf appeared.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.201
He blew down the straw house,

00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:46.806
devouring the first pig
in one bite.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.777
Then he burned down
the wooden house,

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.981
roasting the second pig.

00:14:51.014 --> 00:14:52.317
Finally, the wolf arrived

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.555
at the house
that was made of bricks.

00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:55.958
He smashed the wall
with a hammer,

00:14:55.991 --> 00:14:59.899
minced up the last pig,
and scarfed him down!

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:02.270
Then, with his belly
nice and full,

00:15:02.303 --> 00:15:05.042
our hero the wolf
lived happily ever after.

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:12.625
‐ Eh?

00:15:12.658 --> 00:15:14.294
No matter what you do,

00:15:14.327 --> 00:15:17.500
if you’re a pig, you’ll never
escape the fangs of a wolf.

00:15:17.535 --> 00:15:18.302
It’s your fate.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.874
Survival of the fittest,
I guess?

‐ Enh! No points for Sui.

00:15:23.312 --> 00:15:25.651
The lesson I’m trying
to teach you is...

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:28.723
Straw is flimsy,
wood burns too easily,

00:15:28.757 --> 00:15:31.729
and bricks don’t provide
enough resistance to tremors.

00:15:31.763 --> 00:15:33.098
I changed the story

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:36.171
into a commentary
on Japan’s living conditions.

00:15:36.205 --> 00:15:40.146
‐ Okay. I don’t really
understand why, though.

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:44.889
‐ The point is,
safety is the first priority

00:15:44.922 --> 00:15:45.991
if I’m buying a house.

00:15:46.024 --> 00:15:47.962
‐ Huh? You’re buying a house?

00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:49.264
‐ We formed a clan,

00:15:49.297 --> 00:15:51.803
so the next thing we need
is a base, right?

00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:53.305
And because you’re
technically a member,

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:55.143
I’ll let you make
one tiny request.

00:15:55.176 --> 00:15:57.313
‐ Oh. Well, let’s see.

00:15:57.347 --> 00:16:00.219
I guess I’d like the house
to have a yard, if possible.

00:16:01.723 --> 00:16:03.225
‐ This place doesn’t have one,

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:05.229
but you can turn the roof
into a fake yard.

00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:08.002
‐ That’s huge! You can get
a whole building in that area?

00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:10.741
‐ Sure. With enough money,
you can do almost anything,

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:13.312
and I racked up plenty
in that last event.

00:16:13.345 --> 00:16:15.784
‐ I don’t know.
Do we need that much space?

00:16:15.818 --> 00:16:17.988
There’s only a handful of us.

00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:20.326
‐ Like I said before,
safety’s important.

00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:23.834
A base is more than just
a fun place for us to hang out.

00:16:23.867 --> 00:16:24.902
Buildings like that are

00:16:24.936 --> 00:16:26.973

That’s why
the big clans buy them.

The main issue is where
we should settle down.

This one’s in Minato ward,
which is near here,

00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:37.795

kind of close to Shibuya.

00:17:08.489 --> 00:17:11.161
What’s going on?
I’m still a minor,

00:17:11.194 --> 00:17:13.132
so I can’t sign a contract
or anything.

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:16.940

to ask you for money.

to speak with you.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.599
‐ Yes, but I did
leave the check with her.

00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:48.737
‐ I suppose that’ll do.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.507
In that case, I’m done here.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.713
All I was told to do was ensure
the money got to her safely.

motto is "Trust comes first."

00:17:57.621 --> 00:17:58.489
Now then, Miss Rein,

00:17:58.523 --> 00:18:01.696
would you please
introduce me to Kaname Sudo?

00:18:01.729 --> 00:18:05.403
‐ Did I give you the impression
that I was Kaname’s manager?

00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:08.042
‐ I heard a rumor
that he just formed a clan.

00:18:08.075 --> 00:18:10.146
‐ You have
some sharp ears, then.

00:18:10.179 --> 00:18:13.385
‐ Oh, no. I can’t compare
to you, Analyst.

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:15.356
But it is a promising clan,

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:17.962
and I would prefer to be
on good terms with them.

00:18:17.995 --> 00:18:19.865
We’ll talk again soon.

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:22.337
‐ [insects buzzing]
‐ [sighs]

00:18:24.274 --> 00:18:27.080
<i>As always, he comes</i>
<i>and goes like a phantom.</i>

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:28.516
‐ Wait, sir! Don’t forget‐‐

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.986
[thud]

00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:31.488
‐ [winces]

00:18:31.522 --> 00:18:32.290
‐ I’m sorry.

00:18:32.323 --> 00:18:34.327
You’re not hurt, are you?

00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:37.166
[insects trilling]

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.603
Wow, your name is Rein?

00:18:38.637 --> 00:18:41.676
Cool. It’s like a name
from another country.

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:43.647
‐ I guess so.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.784
It’s annoying
when people read it wrong

00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:48.255
because of the way
it’s written in kanji, though.

00:18:48.288 --> 00:18:50.994
It looks like it should
be "Suzu," but it’s "Rein."

00:18:51.028 --> 00:18:52.430
‐ Really? How weird!

00:18:52.463 --> 00:18:55.637
My name has the character
for "suzu" in it too.

00:18:55.671 --> 00:18:57.473
I’m Suzune. Funny, huh?

00:18:57.508 --> 00:19:00.146
I’m sorry again
for knocking you down.

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:02.283
Um, does your arm hurt?

00:19:02.317 --> 00:19:04.689
‐ Actually, I think
it’s almost healed up now.

00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:08.128
‐ A strange man visited my room.

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:10.066
He left this check behind,

00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:12.437
so I hurried after him
to give it back.

00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:15.844
But it has to be
some kind of prank.

00:19:15.877 --> 00:19:18.482
Would you look at it and
tell me if you think it’s real?

00:19:18.516 --> 00:19:21.254
He said he was
with some insurance company,

00:19:21.288 --> 00:19:22.390
but he seemed sketchy.

00:19:22.423 --> 00:19:24.260
‐ Then you should
take it to a bank

00:19:24.294 --> 00:19:26.198
and have them
verify it for you.

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:29.004
It would be a waste
not to accept that much money.

00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:31.108
‐ No, it can’t be real.

00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:33.145
It must be a mistake
or something.

00:19:33.178 --> 00:19:34.280
That man said...

00:19:34.314 --> 00:19:37.755
that it was payable
upon my father’s death.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.767
‐ Suzune,
here’s my contact info.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.238
If you want to know
the truth about Hiiragi,

00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:47.775
then please reach out.

00:19:49.244 --> 00:19:51.883
‐ "Information Broker"?

00:19:51.916 --> 00:19:53.385
Wait a minute, Rein.

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:55.924
Are you saying you know
something about my father?

00:19:57.126 --> 00:20:00.199
‐ I deal in intel,
buy, sell, trade.

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:02.738
Some people like
to call me the Analyst.

00:20:05.443 --> 00:20:07.480
‐ [athletes grunting]
‐ [bag thumping]

00:20:08.382 --> 00:20:10.386
KAEDE: Okay, now try to move it.

00:20:11.288 --> 00:20:12.524
Is it uncomfortable?

00:20:12.558 --> 00:20:14.360
Does it feel
like it moves smoothly?

00:20:14.394 --> 00:20:16.799
‐ It’s like
Wang never cut it off.

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:19.404
We should’ve gotten you
to heal Rein’s broken arm, too!

00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:21.609
‐ She’s already
mostly recovered, though.

00:20:21.642 --> 00:20:23.980
We should let nature
handle the rest.

00:20:24.013 --> 00:20:25.416
‐ Thanks, Kaede.

00:20:25.449 --> 00:20:27.353
And thanks to you too, Danjo.

00:20:27.386 --> 00:20:29.625
I’m at a loss for words.

00:20:29.658 --> 00:20:32.564
‐ It’s fine! We’re honored
to be of assistance.

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:34.735
I’m just glad my Sigil
is Healing Grace.

00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:38.008
‐ Treating your injury
was a part of his request.

00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:39.444
It was no problem at all.

00:20:39.477 --> 00:20:42.684
‐ By the way, I have a question.
‐ What’s that?

00:20:42.718 --> 00:20:45.757
‐ Why do you go by the names
"Kaede" and "Danjo"?

00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:48.763
You know, seeing as
you’re both Russian.

00:20:48.797 --> 00:20:50.567
‐ Oh, we didn’t tell you?

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.740
Maybe we don’t look it,
but we’re big Japanophiles!

00:20:53.773 --> 00:20:55.109
‐ [grunts]

00:20:55.142 --> 00:20:57.881
‐ [chuckles]
Yeah, I kinda gathered that.

00:20:57.915 --> 00:21:01.188
You guys have got a big place.

00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:03.660
Just how many people
are in your clan?

00:21:03.693 --> 00:21:06.431
DANJO: Not everyone here
is involved with D‐Game.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:08.870
Only a handful
of these guys play.

00:21:08.903 --> 00:21:10.272
Just 26, in fact.

00:21:10.306 --> 00:21:12.978
The Danjo Boxing Club
was originally

00:21:13.011 --> 00:21:15.449
a run‐of‐the‐mill
kickboxing gym.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:18.355
‐ So what happened
to make you join the game?

00:21:18.388 --> 00:21:22.296
‐ I imagine this sounds silly
to you, but the way I see it,

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.833
a martial artist is someone

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:26.438
who aspires to be
the greatest in the world.

00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:30.547
Every one of us has had
that thought at least one time.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.684
When you’re faced
with an enemy blade,

00:21:32.718 --> 00:21:35.590
will your skill
actually see you through?

00:21:35.624 --> 00:21:38.763
What if it’s a gun instead?

00:21:38.796 --> 00:21:40.667
Or even an armored tank?

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.138
To a martial artist,
the Sigils in this game

00:21:43.172 --> 00:21:45.442
are akin
to a demon’s temptation.

00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:48.315
‐ Come on. I know
you’ve trained really hard,

00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:50.821
but there’s no way
you can beat a tank.

00:21:53.058 --> 00:21:55.095
‐ If it’s one‐on‐one, I can.

00:21:55.129 --> 00:21:57.033
[Japanese music playing]

00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:02.678
‐ Hmm? Hey, Master!

00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:03.980
Good to see you.

00:22:04.013 --> 00:22:05.316
‐ How’s the new guy doing?

00:22:05.349 --> 00:22:07.053
‐ Not too bad, honestly.

00:22:07.086 --> 00:22:08.388
It’s only been two months,

00:22:08.422 --> 00:22:09.390
and he’s still working

00:22:09.424 --> 00:22:11.027
on the basics.

00:22:11.061 --> 00:22:12.965
But he’s tough, and he’s

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.568
got pretty good reflexes.

00:22:14.602 --> 00:22:15.871
If no one pins him down,

00:22:15.904 --> 00:22:17.541
I think I could
see him holding his own

00:22:17.574 --> 00:22:19.812
in a match against somebody
who’s at the same level.

00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:20.614
‐ Great.

00:22:20.647 --> 00:22:23.553
In other words,
he’s finally ready.

00:22:23.586 --> 00:22:25.657
Just so you’re aware,

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.095
all of your requests
have been fulfilled.

00:22:28.128 --> 00:22:32.103
Ryuji’s been healed, and your
training has made you stronger.

00:22:32.136 --> 00:22:35.577
If you don’t mind, I’d like
to have that conversation.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.683
‐ Oh, you want to talk
right now? Sounds good.

00:22:38.716 --> 00:22:41.154
‐ I understand
you’re forming a new clan

00:22:41.187 --> 00:22:42.724
and you want to ally with us.

00:22:42.758 --> 00:22:45.429
I sympathize with
your purpose and principles,

00:22:45.462 --> 00:22:46.799
‐ so that’s fine.
‐ But?

00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:50.406
‐ You see, a good alliance
has to benefit both parties

00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:51.976
or else it’s doomed to fail.

00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:53.445
Without strength,

00:22:53.478 --> 00:22:55.149
even the noblest
of intentions

00:22:55.182 --> 00:22:56.384
won’t be enough.

00:22:56.418 --> 00:22:58.288
Spar with me.

00:22:58.322 --> 00:22:59.592
That will determine

00:22:59.625 --> 00:23:01.161
whether you’re
a worthy ally.

00:23:01.194 --> 00:23:02.831
INUKAI: You’re gonna
fight that guy?

00:23:02.864 --> 00:23:03.633
Alone?

00:23:03.666 --> 00:23:05.369
‐ He approached me
diplomatically

00:23:05.402 --> 00:23:07.240
as the fellow leader of a clan.

00:23:07.273 --> 00:23:10.045
Therefore,
I’m the one who must fight.

00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:14.354
Please attack me with everything
you’ve got, Kaname.

00:23:14.387 --> 00:23:17.493
‐ Everything, huh?
You mean Sigils, too?

00:23:17.527 --> 00:23:19.632
‐ Right. Anything goes!

00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:22.370
I’m a no‐holds‐barred
kind of guy.

00:23:23.272 --> 00:23:25.242
‐ [insects buzzing]
‐ [doorbell rings]

00:23:25.276 --> 00:23:27.079
[doorbell ringing]

00:23:30.553 --> 00:23:32.156
‐ [click]
‐ [gasps]

00:23:32.189 --> 00:23:34.193
‐ Oh, so you are home.

00:23:34.227 --> 00:23:35.797
[ominous music playing]

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:36.866
[gasps]

00:23:38.703 --> 00:23:41.742
‐ I take it you’re a friend
of Kaname Sudo, right?

00:23:41.776 --> 00:23:42.945
‐ [shuddering]

00:23:42.978 --> 00:23:44.113
‐ Glad you’re here.

00:23:44.147 --> 00:23:46.084
I’ve been waiting.

00:23:47.621 --> 00:23:50.092
KANAME: <i>Next Time: Heads‐Up.</i>
