00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.692

bothering you, Rein?

They’re on the 29th floor.

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:34.796
Are they predicting

00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:40.675
I’d like to tell my troops
to abandon their rings,

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.113
but a command that contradicts
their own motives

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:44.883

00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:51.496
Scattering my forces is risky,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.235
I’ll station soldiers

does get killed,

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:14.341

I can’t believe
you had the foresight

00:04:46.607 --> 00:04:47.909
to stick a pillow in the doorway

00:04:47.942 --> 00:04:50.147

Sometimes a locked room
can really come in handy.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.902
That said, I’m sure
they’ll catch on any minute now,

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:03.908

stay here for much longer.

00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:06.880
Sorry to ask you twice,

00:05:06.914 --> 00:05:10.120
We’ve only got about
a 40% chance of succeeding.

00:05:10.153 --> 00:05:11.857
I don’t like those odds.

And even if we do succeed,

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.865
there’s less
than a 50% chance we’ll live.

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:19.940
All in all,
we’re 80% likely to be killed.

00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:21.710

00:05:21.743 --> 00:05:24.248

<i>The room keys are kept</i>
<i>on the first floor.</i>

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:38.476
<i>I saw them on the upper floors,</i>

00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:40.447
<i>so they couldn’t have</i>
<i>gotten their hands on one.</i>

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.585
<i>If they were in a room,</i>

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:45.423
<i>there’d have to be some kind</i>
<i>of damage to one of the doors.</i>

00:05:45.457 --> 00:05:46.492
<i>Then again...</i>

00:05:46.527 --> 00:05:48.898
<i>I shouldn’t</i>
<i>jump to conclusions.</i>

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:51.302
<i>They could have</i>
<i>found a key elsewhere,</i>

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:54.375
<i>or perhaps they used a Sigil</i>
<i>to bypass the locks.</i>

00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:56.513
<i>Let’s suppose for a moment</i>

00:05:56.547 --> 00:05:59.351
<i>that those two are hiding</i>
<i>inside a guest room.</i>

00:05:59.385 --> 00:06:01.557
<i>That could explain</i>
<i>why they were so meticulous</i>

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.861
<i>about shooting out</i>
<i>the security cameras.</i>

00:06:03.894 --> 00:06:05.230
<i>They wanted to make sure</i>

00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:07.635
<i>I didn’t see</i>
<i>which room they ran into.</i>

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.008
<i>So considering</i>
<i>which cameras were destroyed</i>

00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:13.781

<i>be found in room 2907.</i>

<i>It’s checkmate,</i>
<i>you little pests!</i>

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.088
<i>No, there are clear signs</i>
<i>that someone was in the room.</i>

00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:36.092
<i>They must be hiding somewhere.</i>

00:06:38.396 --> 00:06:39.933
[rumbling]

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:41.803
[gasps] An explosion?

00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:43.139
What caused it?

00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:46.780
[gasps] <i>They’re using explosives</i>

00:06:46.813 --> 00:06:49.318
<i>to break through</i>
<i>the barricade to floor 25!</i>

00:06:49.351 --> 00:06:52.090
<i>Perfect. Now I know</i>
<i>just where to find you.</i>

00:06:52.124 --> 00:06:55.330
‐ Just as I expected,
one explosion wasn’t sufficient.

00:06:55.363 --> 00:06:57.000
Unfortunately,
there’s not enough time

00:06:57.034 --> 00:06:58.570
to try setting off another one.

00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:02.210
‐ They’re on floor 26!

00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:04.415
Head for the eastern barricade!

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.335
‐ [gags]

00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:16.807

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.646
This stun gun
is actually pretty useful!

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:21.550
So, aside from
the failed explosion,

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:22.885
everything’s going as planned.

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:25.992
However, this next step
is the most crucial, though!

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:28.363
‐ Sure hope this works.

00:07:28.396 --> 00:07:30.400
‐ You were the one
who suggested it.

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:32.505
It’s not a bad idea, really.

00:07:32.538 --> 00:07:35.477
We’re just lucky no one else
has thought to try it yet.

00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:39.986
Guess we were successful.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.690
I can’t believe
it never occurred to me

00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:44.562
that we could access the gacha
shop in the middle of the game.

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:45.965
I mean, you rarely have a second

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.436
to try things out
during a one‐on‐one battle.

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:50.140
‐ Okay, we have
all the supplies we need.

00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:52.411
Now we just need to figure out
who’s doing what.

00:07:52.444 --> 00:07:53.580
‐ Since I have Laplace,

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:55.584
it makes more sense for me
to use the explosives.

00:07:55.618 --> 00:07:56.920
‐ What’s Laplace?

00:07:56.953 --> 00:08:00.795
‐ Oh, that’s the Sigil
that D‐Game decided to give me.

00:08:00.828 --> 00:08:03.399
Universal Function.
Here’s what it looks like.

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:06.405
‐ Wait a minute. I didn’t notice
anything like that on my screen

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:07.842
when the game gave me my Sigil.

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:10.447
Did you come up with that name
on your own, or what?

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.384
‐ That’s the part
that bothers you?

00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:15.558
No, the D‐Game system
chose that title for me.

00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:17.127
Or perhaps
it’s more accurate to say

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.833
it was selected by the person
who created the app.

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:22.404
I don’t suppose you’re familiar
with the classic concept

00:08:22.437 --> 00:08:24.542
‐ of "Laplace’s demon," are you?
‐ No.

00:08:24.576 --> 00:08:28.282
‐ The idea was proposed
by a scientist named Laplace

00:08:28.316 --> 00:08:29.753
during the 18th century,

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:32.592
before the field of quantum
mechanics was established.

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:34.662
It’s fairly straightforward,
actually.

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:37.000
Imagine a being that knows
the mass and momentum

00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:38.469
of every atom in the world

00:08:38.504 --> 00:08:41.375
and possesses
infinite calculative abilities.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:46.018
‐ Uh, okay. So it’s like some
kind of demon supercomputer?

00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:49.158
‐ Exactly. I assume
the creator of D‐Game

00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:50.293
called my Sigil "Laplace"

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:53.734
because its ability is
reminiscent of that old concept.

I’m exhausted.

00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:24.696
I should have
done more training runs

00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:26.298
to prepare myself for this.

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.102

00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:39.793
<i>It seems I vastly</i>
<i>overestimated my troops.</i>

00:09:42.297 --> 00:09:44.034
<i>No, that’s not it.</i>

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:46.205

[groans]
<i>She’s surprisingly tough.</i>

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:08.717
<i>And there’s something else</i>
<i>that’s bothering me.</i>

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.088
<i>What happened to the boy?</i>

00:10:11.122 --> 00:10:13.694
<i>Did he send the girl away</i>
<i>to fight on her own</i>

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:16.098
<i>while he stayed behind</i>
<i>to cower like a dog?</i>

00:10:16.132 --> 00:10:19.271
<i>If so, then I’ve</i>

00:10:19.304 --> 00:10:20.908
<i>I don’t know.</i>

00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:22.578

00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:25.283

<i>the eyes of a coward.</i>

00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:27.722
<i>There’s no sign of him near</i>
<i>the barricades or elevators,</i>

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:28.824
<i>so where is he?</i>

‐ [rumbling]
‐ What?!

00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:37.809
He’s already reached
the first floor?

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:39.913
How’d he get there that quickly?

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.292
Did he climb down the outside
to bypass the plant on floor 25?

00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:48.029
I tried not
to underestimate him,

00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:50.099
but he’s one step ahead of me.

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:52.672
I failed to understand
his objective.

00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:54.441
I realize it now.

00:10:54.474 --> 00:10:58.550
My greatest mistake was not
seeing how determined he is.

00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:00.788
This entire time...

00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:02.992
his target was me!

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.135
[footsteps echoing]

00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:10.908
<i>‐ The Florist has been</i>
<i>watching us on the cameras.</i>

00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:13.514
<i>If this place</i>
<i>has a security office,</i>

00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:15.684
<i>it’s probably</i>
<i>down that hallway,</i>

00:11:15.718 --> 00:11:18.256
<i>which, of course,</i>
<i>is blocked by plants.</i>

00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:20.126
<i>Time for another one of these.</i>

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:22.063
[sighs] <i>Oh, man.</i>

00:11:22.097 --> 00:11:24.468
<i>I’m totally exhausted</i>
<i>after all this.</i>

00:11:24.502 --> 00:11:27.340
<i>Maybe it’s because I’ve used</i>
<i>my Sigil so many times.</i>

00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:29.812
<i>I didn’t have a chance</i>
<i>to open the shop again</i>

00:11:29.846 --> 00:11:31.315
<i>while I was running, so...</i>

00:11:31.348 --> 00:11:34.388
‐ There’s no need for you
to use that grenade, young man.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.803
‐ [gasps]

00:11:41.836 --> 00:11:43.139
I take it you’re the Florist.

00:11:43.172 --> 00:11:46.513
‐ Well, I’ve certainly never
introduced myself that way.

00:11:46.546 --> 00:11:47.848
What do you say you and I

00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:50.119
have a little discussion
before we begin?

00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:52.190
‐ You wanna talk?

00:11:52.224 --> 00:11:54.929
‐ One of us is going
to die in this room

00:11:54.963 --> 00:11:57.234
or perhaps both of us.
Therefore,

00:11:57.267 --> 00:12:01.242
this will be our first and
final chance to exchange words.

00:12:01.275 --> 00:12:05.083
Now, what is your motivation
for playing D‐Game?

00:12:05.116 --> 00:12:07.020
‐ Motivation? I don’t have one.

00:12:07.053 --> 00:12:09.057
I fell into this nightmare
by accident!

00:12:09.091 --> 00:12:12.364
‐ [plants creaking]
‐ Well, my motivation is money.

00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:15.771
A human life’s
an extremely valuable commodity.

00:12:15.804 --> 00:12:18.242
It’s worth around
100 or 200 million, in fact.

00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:19.812
‐ You kill people for money?

00:12:19.846 --> 00:12:22.685
‐ The death of one organism
helps another one to grow,

00:12:22.718 --> 00:12:25.356
as you’re about to find out.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.931
Now then, your life or mine?

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:30.734
‐ Forget it, dumb‐ass!

00:12:30.768 --> 00:12:33.205
You don’t
get to choose what happens!

00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:37.982
‐ You’re right.
It’s not my decision.

00:12:38.015 --> 00:12:41.021
‐ [gasps]
‐ It’s survival of the fittest!

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:44.929
<i>‐ How the hell is he so strong?</i>

00:12:44.963 --> 00:12:47.802
<i>With a name like the Florist,</i>
<i>I was expecting a wuss!</i>

00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:49.606
‐ You’ve heard
of those ancient lotus seeds,

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:51.108
the ones that were
found in ruins

00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:53.412
and bloomed after
a whole century of dormancy?

00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:55.316
Surely you
must have seen the way

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.422
weeds can grow through concrete,
stretching up to meet the sun!

00:12:58.456 --> 00:12:59.324
Make no mistake.

00:12:59.358 --> 00:13:02.330
Plants are far more formidable
than animals!

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:05.236
And I’ve been blessed
with their unstoppable power!

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.077
‐ All right,
then I won’t hold back!

00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:17.494
<i>The bullets are bouncing off!</i>

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:20.366
[groans]

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.736
‐ Fatal mistake, boy.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.874
‐ He can do that too?

00:13:23.907 --> 00:13:26.245
‐ Now I’ve really
got you in checkmate.

00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:28.049
‐ [grunts]

00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:31.388
Don’t count your chickens
before they hatch!

00:13:31.422 --> 00:13:35.263
‐ I see. Your Sigil is
quite the thorn in my side.

00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:37.067
It would appear
you have the ability

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.438
to reproduce any weapon
you’ve seen before.

00:13:39.471 --> 00:13:42.010
‐ [panting]
‐ But...

00:13:42.043 --> 00:13:43.714
obviously there’s a limit

00:13:43.747 --> 00:13:45.383
to that handy little talent
of yours!

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:49.491
<i>‐ Damn it. I didn’t think</i>
<i>he’d pick up on that.</i>

00:13:49.525 --> 00:13:52.163
<i>My head feels like</i>
<i>it’s gonna split open.</i>

00:13:52.197 --> 00:13:56.639
<i>I can use my Sigil</i>
<i>one more time, two at most.</i>

00:13:56.673 --> 00:13:59.211
<i>Man, who knew</i>
<i>I’d get my ass kicked</i>

00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:02.484
<i>by a dude who fights</i>
<i>with killer plants?</i>

00:14:02.518 --> 00:14:06.125
<i>That’s it. Back to square one!</i>

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.035
<i>‐ Exactly what</i>
<i>I thought you would do!</i>

00:14:12.738 --> 00:14:14.374
[gasps] <i>A flashbang.</i>

00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:20.353
[groans]

00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:23.025
Not half‐bad.

00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:27.500
Even so, there’s no escape
from my immaculate garden!

00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:28.537
‐ [groans]

00:14:29.772 --> 00:14:31.543
[gasps]

00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:33.245
[yells]

[gags]

00:14:41.663 --> 00:14:44.000
[groans]

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:49.144
[chorus vocalizing]

00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:54.421
‐ I will admit you do
possess a warrior’s spirit.

00:14:54.454 --> 00:14:56.391
I respect that.

00:14:56.425 --> 00:15:00.567
You were a worthy opponent,
but you still lose!

00:15:02.437 --> 00:15:03.774
‐ [gags]

00:15:03.807 --> 00:15:05.811
<i>Aw, crap.</i>

00:15:05.844 --> 00:15:08.750
<i>I barely have the strength</i>
<i>to stand up now.</i>

00:15:08.784 --> 00:15:10.721
<i>Is this really the end for me?</i>

00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:13.459
<i>Well, I probably lost</i>

00:15:13.492 --> 00:15:15.496
<i>the moment my bullets</i>
<i>bounced off his armor,</i>

00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:19.672
<i>since that was the best thing</i>
<i>I had up my sleeve.</i>

00:15:19.705 --> 00:15:20.607
[metal clangs]

00:15:24.014 --> 00:15:25.483
<i>You again, huh?</i>

00:15:25.517 --> 00:15:27.020
[metal clanging]

00:15:28.222 --> 00:15:30.994
<i>That voice in my head’s</i>
<i>back to pester me.</i>

00:15:31.028 --> 00:15:33.265
FLORIST: <i>It would appear</i>
<i>you have the ability</i>

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:35.136
<i>to reproduce any weapon</i>
<i>you’ve seen before.</i>

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:36.973
SHUKA: <i>Even if nobody</i>
<i>tells you what it is,</i>

00:15:37.006 --> 00:15:38.476
<i>you should be able</i>
<i>to use it instinctually.</i>

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.181
REIN: <i>No, the D‐Game system</i>
<i>chose that title for me.</i>

00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:42.918
<i>Or perhaps</i>
<i>it’s more accurate to say</i>

00:15:42.952 --> 00:15:45.891
<i>it was selected by the person</i>
<i>who created the app.</i>

00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:48.697
‐ [metal clangs]
‐ KANAME: <i>My power,</i>

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.066
<i>what is it, really?</i>

00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:53.339
<i>The power to reproduce</i>
<i>weapons that I’ve seen?</i>

00:15:54.942 --> 00:15:56.145
<i>‐ Are you sure?</i>

00:15:57.615 --> 00:16:01.054
‐ What’s that sound?
‐ [metal clangs]

00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:05.931
<i>I can’t identify it,</i>
<i>but it’s soothing somehow.</i>

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:08.737
‐ It’s a hammer.
‐ [clang]

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.139
‐ A hammer?

00:16:10.173 --> 00:16:14.314
<i>‐ A blacksmith’s hammer</i>

[clang]

00:16:28.977 --> 00:16:31.816
<i>There’s something you must do,</i>
<i>isn’t there?</i>

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.653
‐ Something I have to do?

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:34.622
[clang]

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:37.628
Can you tell me
what it is that you are doing?

00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:39.765
<i>‐ All this time...</i>

00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:42.571
<i>I’ve been creating new weapons.</i>

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:44.775
‐ How long?

00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:46.946
<i>‐ Quite a while now.</i>

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.019
<i>This piece of artillery</i>
<i>that you summoned,</i>

00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:52.123
<i>it’s fairly decent work.</i>

00:16:52.156 --> 00:16:54.929
<i>It should do well in combat.</i>

00:16:54.962 --> 00:16:56.933
<i>Now get out of here.</i>

00:16:56.966 --> 00:16:58.435
<i>One second on the battlefield</i>

00:16:58.469 --> 00:17:00.841
<i>is equal</i>
<i>to a brick of solid gold.</i>

00:17:00.874 --> 00:17:03.513
‐ But this won’t be enough.

00:17:03.547 --> 00:17:05.984
I can’t break through his armor
with a gun.

00:17:06.018 --> 00:17:08.723
And even if I could,
he knows how to make a shield.

00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:11.128
‐ [laughs] <i>A shield and armor</i>

00:17:11.161 --> 00:17:13.065
<i>that withstands</i>
<i>firepower like this?</i>

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:15.036
<i>They must be</i>
<i>incredibly well made.</i>

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.373
‐ Stop laughing!
I’m desperate, all right?

00:17:17.407 --> 00:17:18.342
‐ [laughs]

00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:20.647
<i>It’s clear</i>
<i>that humanity’s history</i>

00:17:20.681 --> 00:17:23.653
<i>of pitting spear</i>
<i>against shield will never end.</i>

00:17:23.687 --> 00:17:27.060
<i>Your opponent realized</i>
<i>that armor was insufficient,</i>

00:17:27.093 --> 00:17:29.064
<i>so he took the next step.</i>

00:17:29.097 --> 00:17:31.536
<i>Now you follow suit.</i>

00:17:31.569 --> 00:17:33.506
<i>You should have</i>
<i>all the knowledge you need‐‐</i>

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.879
<i>the structure of this gun,</i>
<i>the way it was made,</i>

00:17:36.913 --> 00:17:39.518
<i>and how best</i>
<i>to put it to use.</i>

00:17:40.554 --> 00:17:44.194
<i>‐ That’s right.</i>
<i>I know all that,</i>

00:17:44.227 --> 00:17:46.633
<i>which means</i>
<i>I can make this gun real.</i>

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:49.404
<i>It’s the most natural thing</i>
<i>in the world to me,</i>

00:17:49.437 --> 00:17:52.010
<i>like I’ve been doing it</i>
<i>since the day I was born.</i>

00:17:52.043 --> 00:17:55.182
<i>He went to the trouble</i>
<i>of using a shield,</i>

00:17:55.216 --> 00:17:56.351
<i>which he wouldn’t have done</i>

00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:59.157
<i>if he didn’t see</i>
<i>my bullets as a threat.</i>

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.459
<i>All right, think.</i>

00:18:00.493 --> 00:18:04.034
<i>If I can increase</i>
<i>its power a little more...</i>

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:05.504
BOTH: I’ve got it.

00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:07.574
<i>‐ In this case,</i>
<i>it may be beneficial</i>

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:09.812
<i>if we sacrificed</i>
<i>the weapon’s life span.</i>

00:18:09.845 --> 00:18:11.315

00:18:11.348 --> 00:18:13.586
You sure know a lot about me.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.891
Who are you, anyway?

00:18:15.924 --> 00:18:17.528
<i>‐ That’s simple.</i>

00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:19.197
<i>I am...</i>

‐ [gasps]

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:28.282
‐ Don’t worry.
I’m a merciful man,

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:30.186
so I’ll make this quick.

00:18:30.219 --> 00:18:31.756
‐ Screw you, jackass.

00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:33.727
‐ What’d you say?

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.901
On second thought,
I’d like to make you suffer.

00:18:37.935 --> 00:18:39.471
‐ Shut your mouth.

00:18:39.505 --> 00:18:41.876
Enough with the victory speech!

00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:44.214

Screaming won’t change reality!

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:54.000
[gasps] <i>No.</i>

<i>They’re heavy!</i>

00:18:58.342 --> 00:19:00.446
<i>‐ When I cut</i>
<i>the gun’s life span,</i>

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:02.283
<i>I increased</i>
<i>the internal pressure.</i>

00:19:02.317 --> 00:19:04.655
<i>The powder’s 10% stronger!</i>

00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:07.427

00:19:28.837 --> 00:19:32.711
From where I’m standing,
you look like a loser.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.623
‐ I must’ve been hallucinating
in those last few seconds.

00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:42.230
I could have sworn
I landed the final blow.

00:19:42.263 --> 00:19:45.570
[chuckles] You were
an excellent adversary, boy.

00:19:46.639 --> 00:19:49.545
Finish me off with one shot,
if you would.

00:19:50.747 --> 00:19:52.383
<i>I’m sorry, Suzune.</i>

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:54.822
<i>Daddy lost this time.</i>

00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:55.891
‐ [gasps]

00:19:55.924 --> 00:19:58.763
Wow, you really are selfish.

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:00.534
Aren’t you afraid to die?

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:02.336
‐ I’ve been suffering
from heart complications

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.940
for quite some time now.

00:20:03.973 --> 00:20:06.078
I don’t have very long to live.

00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:07.346
‐ Is that so?

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.954
‐ Listen, you dying here
isn’t gonna do me any good.

00:20:10.987 --> 00:20:12.290
You might as well hang in there

00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:14.127
and let your heart
kill you later.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.964
‐ Does that mean...

00:20:15.997 --> 00:20:17.433
‐ Yeah. I have a feeling

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:19.672
this Treasure Hunt thing
is gonna be...

00:20:19.705 --> 00:20:20.674
[groans]

00:20:20.707 --> 00:20:22.210
‐ Whoa, you okay?

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:24.749
‐ You’d better not try anything.

00:20:24.782 --> 00:20:27.821
I can easily shoot you
in the head from here.

00:20:28.957 --> 00:20:30.594
‐ My Sigil’s maxed out,

00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:32.531
so I can’t harm you anymore.

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:34.902
It looks like he’s
run out of energy as well.

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:38.543
‐ Ah, crap. I think I just
blacked out for a second there.

00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:40.479
‐ You need to get
some rest, Kaname.

00:20:40.514 --> 00:20:44.120
As for you, if your Sigil
really is at its limit,

00:20:44.154 --> 00:20:45.489
the best thing for you to do

00:20:45.524 --> 00:20:47.360
is sit there
and not move for a while.

00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:49.330
‐ That’s exactly
what I intend to do.

00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:51.067
I’m happy to hear that.

00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:53.272
Now then,
I’ll offer you a deal, Florist.

00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:56.244
Or should I say Ichiro Hiiragi.

00:20:56.278 --> 00:20:57.246
‐ A deal?

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.415
‐ I’d like to find out

00:20:58.449 --> 00:21:00.319
how much information
you can share with us

00:21:00.352 --> 00:21:02.490
with regards
to this Treasure Hunt event.

00:21:02.524 --> 00:21:04.060
For example, can you tell us

00:21:04.093 --> 00:21:05.831
how many rings
are inside this hotel?

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:08.570
‐ There should be 24 total.

00:21:08.603 --> 00:21:10.239
Why are you asking me that?

00:21:10.272 --> 00:21:12.376
‐ Then allow me
to give you some intel.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.646
Did you know that Wang,

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.717
the Eighth Clan’s
bloodthirsty leader,

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.120
is also participating?

00:21:17.153 --> 00:21:18.923
‐ Wang from Eighth Clan?

00:21:18.957 --> 00:21:21.161
That man is a loose cannon.

00:21:21.194 --> 00:21:22.564
How do you know he’s playing?

00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:26.304
‐ I’m the Analyst, an extremely
capable information broker.

00:21:26.338 --> 00:21:28.075
Several of the informants
I rely upon

00:21:28.108 --> 00:21:29.745
were selected to take part
in this event,

00:21:29.778 --> 00:21:31.883
which means I’ve got
eyes and ears everywhere.

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.154
They’ve supplied me
with a wealth of information

00:21:34.187 --> 00:21:36.559
concerning other players
I can use as leverage.

00:21:36.592 --> 00:21:39.164
I also know that
the initial stage of this event

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:40.834
is about to reach
its conclusion.

00:21:40.867 --> 00:21:44.207
The strong players have already
accumulated most of the rings.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.677
And possession of the rings

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.716
has made those participants
easier to track down.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.554
At this point,
the game’s a free‐for‐all

00:21:50.587 --> 00:21:52.958
for the most accomplished
contenders.

00:21:54.562 --> 00:21:57.400
Meanwhile, we’ve been
exhausting ourselves in here.

00:21:57.433 --> 00:21:59.538
When the members
of the Eighth Clan show up

00:21:59.572 --> 00:22:00.907
to collect the hotel’s rings,

00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:04.548
we won’t have enough energy left
to stand up to them.

00:22:04.582 --> 00:22:06.752
The one plan
that might save us...

00:22:06.786 --> 00:22:10.359
‐ Is forming an improvised clan
so we can fight back.

00:22:10.392 --> 00:22:14.300
So do we die apart?
Or make it through...

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:17.039
by doing this together?

00:22:17.073 --> 00:22:18.977
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:50.593
KANAME: <i>Next time: "Aquarium."</i>
