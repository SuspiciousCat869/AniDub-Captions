00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:08.718
[whooshing]

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:11.524
[chains clinking]

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:17.101
‐ Oh, a target with six rings.

00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:18.370
You’re all mine.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.808
She’s fast.

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:22.779
I’d better hold off
until she lands.

00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:25.150
Come on. Stop somewhere.

00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:26.554
Damn it. [groans]

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:27.556
[gags]

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:28.925
‐ Everywhere I look,

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.628
there’s another sniper
camping out.

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.237
And most of them don’t have
a single ring on them.

00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:45.224
An underground mall.

00:00:45.257 --> 00:00:46.994
I might run into trouble
down here,

00:00:47.027 --> 00:00:48.864
but no snipers, at least.

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:50.234
[girl gasps]

00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:53.808
[Japanese music playing]

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.896
‐ [sighs]

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.833
My whole body
feels super heavy.

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:33.073
I don’t know why I’m
so exhausted all the time.

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:34.375
‐ Well, it’s obvious.

00:02:34.408 --> 00:02:36.680
You’re not getting
a lot of sleep lately.

00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:38.350
‐ You think that’s it?

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:41.489
‐ Mm‐hmm, but at least
summer break’s coming up soon.

00:02:41.523 --> 00:02:43.661
‐ We’ve got our finals
before that, though.

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:46.466
‐ [chuckles]
Yeah, I guess you’re right.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.742
By the way, there’s something
I wanted to ask you.

00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:51.810
‐ Shoot.

00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:54.616
What possessed you
to start playing Darwin’s Game?

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.154
‐ I don’t know.
I wanted all kinds of stuff,

00:02:57.187 --> 00:02:58.858
and if you found out
about a game

00:02:58.891 --> 00:03:01.730
that could earn you a ton
of money, you’d play it, right?

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:04.001
My family’s poor.

00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:06.272
Plus, the three of us
made that promise.

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:07.876
‐ What promise?

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.412
‐ Remember when you,
me, and Hamada

00:03:09.445 --> 00:03:11.349
first got our driver’s licenses?

00:03:11.382 --> 00:03:13.821
We said that we were
gonna go on a trip together

00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:14.823
during the summer.

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:18.463
‐ Dumb‐ass.

00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:21.135
Why’d you take that
so seriously?

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.373
You shouldn’t’ve bought
that fancy bike.

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:26.012
We could have
just gotten part‐time jobs.

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:27.347
‐ [sighs]

00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:29.285
I don’t know, man.

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:32.357
It seemed like a good idea
at the time, I guess.

00:03:33.426 --> 00:03:35.330
‐ You’re so stupid.

00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:36.934
‐ Got that right.

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:40.440
I’m such an idiot, I got you
and Hamada involved in this.

00:03:41.342 --> 00:03:43.279
‐ What’s the holdup, Kyoda?

00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:44.281
We gotta get moving!

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:45.484
‐ All right, I’m coming.

00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:47.856
‐ Hey, wait up, guys.
I’ll go with you!

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.291
‐ Nah, stay here, Kaname.

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:51.362
You’ve still got something
you need to do, right?

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:55.003
‐ Yep, something
we both failed to do.

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:57.207
Maybe you can survive this game.

00:03:57.241 --> 00:03:58.410
‐ [gasps]

00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:06.125
[sighs]

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.394
A new message?

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:10.267
<i>‐ I should arrive</i>
<i>at the hotel soon,</i>

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.237
<i>so get ready.</i>
<i>Whichever one of us</i>

00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:14.408
<i>has fewer rings</i>
<i>is gonna be punished.</i>

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:17.314
‐ She sounds kinda playful.
I get the feeling

00:04:17.347 --> 00:04:19.485
she’s not the least
bit nervous about this.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.092
Then again, I can’t picture
Shuka getting picked off.

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:25.565
I’m just happy she’s okay.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.303
‐ You’re already finished?

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:30.741
I think that was only
about three hours of sleep.

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:33.446
‐ Yeah, it was enough.
By the way, I heard from Shuka,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.283
and she’s almost ready
for the rendezvous.

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.121
‐ Oh, good.
She’ll be a big help.

00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:39.793
‐ What about the Florist?

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:41.129
Hiiragi, was it?

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:42.599
I believe he’s downstairs

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:44.503
creating
some new plant barricades.

00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:48.042
Fortunately, Eighth Clan
hasn’t made a move yet.

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:50.147
‐ Let’s call the old man
back up here.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.585
We still have something
we need to work out.

00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:57.194
‐ [chuckles]
Well, well, look who it is.

00:04:57.227 --> 00:05:00.467
I get it.
The three of you have teamed up.

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:02.237
That’s real freakin’ cute.

00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:05.043
So where does that
leave me, then?

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:06.345
Dead, right?

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:08.918
Guess there’s no need
to get your hands dirty, though.

00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:10.688
Just leave me here
with no rings,

00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:12.826
and the game’ll
take care of me.

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:13.828
Huh?

00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:15.631
‐ Here. Take these.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:18.036
‐ What, you’re
taking pity on me now?

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.773
‐ Not exactly, no.

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:22.211
I just think
I should return the favor.

00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:23.581
‐ Favor?

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:26.485
‐ As long as you swear not
to treat us as your enemies,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.358
we’ll uncuff you and
give you back your weapon.

00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:30.895
‐ So what’s the catch?

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:34.636
‐ Until this event is over,
you’ll work with us.

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.740
You’re a solo player too, right?

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:38.844
‐ I’ll pass.

00:05:38.878 --> 00:05:41.617
Maybe I’d say yes
if it were just you and her,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.921
but I want nothing to do
with that scumbag.

00:05:43.954 --> 00:05:47.227
He’s the sick bastard
who brainwashed me.

00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:50.668
One look, and I knew it was him.
Forget it!

00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:53.039
‐ I can see
why he feels that way.

00:05:53.072 --> 00:05:56.212
I doubt you’ll win him over
if I’m part of the picture.

00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:57.214
‐ Okay.

00:05:57.247 --> 00:05:58.717
‐ Weren’t you listening?

00:05:58.751 --> 00:05:59.853
I said no!

00:05:59.886 --> 00:06:01.355
‐ Yeah, yeah, I heard you,

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.994
but I don’t think
you’ll cause us any harm.

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:05.965
‐ Pretty naive, aren’t you?

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:07.602
[groans] Fine by me.

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:10.875
‐ You’ll find your gun and ammo
in the elevator hall.

00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:12.545
‐ Thanks for the courtesy.

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:15.651
I promise not to attack you
during the event.

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:17.020
KANAME: That’s all
I’m asking for.

00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:19.659
‐ So if he won’t join us,
that means our makeshift clan

00:06:19.693 --> 00:06:22.231
is the three of us,
plus Shuka, correct?

00:06:22.264 --> 00:06:23.601
Including Wang,

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:26.005
how many Eighth Clan members
are in the area?

00:06:26.038 --> 00:06:27.976
‐ Definitely at least five.

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:30.180
Then again, considering
the size of his clan,

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:31.850
there could easily be
double that number.

00:06:31.883 --> 00:06:32.852
‐ [growls]

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:35.090
‐ You promised you
wouldn’t attack us, remember?

00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:36.560
‐ Never mind that!

00:06:36.593 --> 00:06:38.731
You just mentioned
Wang of the Eighth Clan!

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:40.601
Is that bastard in this event?

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:42.639
REIN: I have
a verified sighting, yes.

00:06:42.672 --> 00:06:45.477
And he’s not exactly
the type to blend in,

00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:47.114
so I believe it’s him.

00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:48.717
‐ I’ll be damned.

00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:51.422
That son of a bitch
is here, too?

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:53.126
And he’s way too greedy

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:55.932
to pass up
all the rings in this hotel.

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:58.938
I changed my mind.
I’m more than happy

00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:01.910
to be part of this
thrown‐together clan of yours.

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:05.785
‐ [sighs]

00:07:05.818 --> 00:07:10.293
Thirty‐two rings is worth
just over 500 million, huh?

00:07:10.327 --> 00:07:11.964
That’s a pretty decent haul.

00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:14.603
‐ Where do you think
we should go next, Wang?

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:17.441
We already got our hands
on all the rings in this area.

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:19.779
‐ I know where we’ll
get our next batch,

00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:22.518
and it’s gonna be a big score.

00:07:22.552 --> 00:07:24.823
‐ You mean we’re
finally raiding that hotel?

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:28.429
WANG: The situation in there’s
been simmering for a while.

00:07:28.463 --> 00:07:30.835
Now’s the perfect time
to strike.

00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:33.741
‐ We can easily walk out
of that place with 20 of em!

00:07:33.774 --> 00:07:36.045
‐ All right. How much cash
does that net us?

00:07:36.078 --> 00:07:37.649
‐ Keep your pants on.

00:07:37.682 --> 00:07:40.253
Acting all giddy like that
can get you killed.

00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:43.527
We stay calm, cool,
and collected for now.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.497
Then we launch
our attack tonight.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.733
I already put out a call

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:49.939
to some members
who aren’t part of the event.

00:07:49.973 --> 00:07:53.547
By nightfall, we’ll have plenty
of our people covering Shibuya.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.916
‐ Oh, I get it.

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:57.555
The general public
was ordered to leave the area,

00:07:57.588 --> 00:07:59.191
but players can come in, right?

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:01.563
You’re a genius, Wang!
That’s an airtight plan!

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:04.903
‐ Like I said, Shibuya
is Eighth Clan territory,

00:08:04.936 --> 00:08:08.343
and there’s no way I can lose
a fight on my home turf.

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:11.550
After this, I’ll have
snagged over 50 rings.

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:14.522
That’ll put me in first place,
no problem.

00:08:14.556 --> 00:08:16.626
Then I’ll finally get a taste

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.229
of that
"event champion’s privilege"

00:08:18.262 --> 00:08:20.200
I’ve heard so many rumors about.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.039
‐ Something wrong?

00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:26.178
‐ Uh, nothing. You just
look like someone I know.

00:08:26.212 --> 00:08:29.819
‐ I was expecting your face
to be a little more threatening.

00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:31.455
RYUJI: Okay?

00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:33.794
KANAME: Anyway, we should
get a plan together, uh...

00:08:33.827 --> 00:08:37.267
‐ I’m Ryuji, or that’s my name
in D‐Game, at least.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.473
By the way, whatever happened
to all those other soldiers?

00:08:40.508 --> 00:08:41.777
‐ I felt bad for wounding them,

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.148
so I gave them each
three rings and let them go,

00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:46.753
so there’s no reason
to worry about them anymore.

00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:48.991
‐ [laughs] How gracious of you.

00:08:49.024 --> 00:08:51.930
All right. What strategy
do you have in mind?

00:08:51.963 --> 00:08:54.836
‐ Well, I’m not sure I would
call it a strategy, per se,

00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:57.140
but we currently have 15 rings
between us right now.

00:08:57.174 --> 00:09:01.516
Hiiragi used his Sigil to seal
this hotel up like a fortress,

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.088
so when they get here,
we’ll be ready for them.

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:05.190
RYUJI: I see.

00:09:05.223 --> 00:09:07.528
But do you really think
they’d be foolish enough

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:08.897
to walk straight into a trap?

00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:11.068
‐ If they don’t come,
then we’ll have enough rings

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:13.707
to be in the clear,
so it won’t matter.

00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.811
But they probably will come.

00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:18.082
In fact,
I’m absolutely certain.

00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:19.586
‐ Yeah, of course they will.

00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:23.359
That asshole Wang’s
as greedy as he is arrogant.

00:09:23.392 --> 00:09:25.497
So how do we split up the loot?

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:26.767
‐ There are 15.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.710
Altogether, their value is
equivalent to 3,800 points.

00:09:31.743 --> 00:09:32.912
‐ I think the smartest move

00:09:32.945 --> 00:09:34.949
is to give
half the total to Hiiragi,

00:09:34.983 --> 00:09:38.524
and the three of us will divide
the other half equally.

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:40.561
‐ I’m not suggesting
I have a problem with that,

00:09:40.594 --> 00:09:42.632
but are you sure
that’s all right?

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.203
‐ It’s fine. I mean, you did
most of the heavy lifting,

00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:48.009
didn’t you, so you
deserve the bigger share.

00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:51.215
‐ Yeah, it’s not like I have
any complaints about it.

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:52.552
You did set me free.

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:54.689
Besides, we can split
the rewards evenly

00:09:54.722 --> 00:09:56.560
after we beat the Eighth Clan.

00:09:56.593 --> 00:09:57.929
KANAME: Hmm? What’s wrong?

00:09:57.962 --> 00:10:00.768
‐ Nothing. I just noticed
something surprising

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:03.439
while I was looking over
the rules for the Treasure Hunt.

00:10:03.473 --> 00:10:06.312
Doesn’t the point table
strike you as odd?

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:07.682
KANAME: No, not really.

00:10:07.715 --> 00:10:08.951
‐ What’s so weird about it?

00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:11.422
‐ Maybe this game was
designed by a bunch of men

00:10:11.455 --> 00:10:13.594
who couldn’t care less
about gemstones,

00:10:13.627 --> 00:10:15.463
but it doesn’t
make sense for topaz

00:10:15.497 --> 00:10:17.735
to be worth fewer points
than lapis lazuli.

00:10:17.768 --> 00:10:21.710
Lapis lazuli is a semiprecious
stone that’s not very rare.

00:10:21.743 --> 00:10:24.682
Topaz is easily
the more valuable of the two.

00:10:24.716 --> 00:10:27.053
Another thing,
the four main precious stones

00:10:27.087 --> 00:10:29.491
are usually said
to be diamonds, rubies,

00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:31.796
sapphires, and emeralds,
in that order.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.168
At first glance, it would
appear that the point values

00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.205
correlate to the rarity
of the gemstones,

00:10:36.238 --> 00:10:39.044
but in actuality,
there’s no relationship at all.

00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:42.552
‐ Maybe they just decided on
the point values randomly, then?

00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:44.087
Besides, at the end of the day,

00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:46.025
they’re just a bunch
of painted metal rings.

00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:48.797
‐ The way the rules are worded
is strange, too.

00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:51.570
It’s unnatural.
I’m especially confused

00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:53.740
by the part that says,
"When the time limit is up,

00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:55.678
"if the Treasure Hunt event
is not cleared,

00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:58.015
"any participating player
who has fewer than three rings

00:10:58.049 --> 00:11:01.288
in their possession will receive
a ’game over’ message."

00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:03.159
KANAME AND RYUJI: Okay?

00:11:03.192 --> 00:11:05.096
‐ She’s right.
It’s very strange.

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:06.800
We don’t exactly know
what it means

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.469
for the Treasure Hunt
event to be cleared.

00:11:08.504 --> 00:11:11.510
‐ I thought you just had to
collect three rings to finish.

00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:12.912
‐ If that were
the only criteria,

00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:15.416
the instructions wouldn’t
have to specify "cleared"

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.520
as a separate condition

00:11:16.553 --> 00:11:18.456
from having enough rings
in your possession.

00:11:18.489 --> 00:11:20.193
‐ Hmm. That’s true.

00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:23.065
When you read it carefully.
It never actually states

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.334
that the rings
we’re fighting over

00:11:24.368 --> 00:11:26.706
and the treasure hidden
in Shibuya are the same thing.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.677
‐ [gasping]
‐ [chuckles]

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.150
‐ I don’t know. Maybe we
should table this for later.

00:11:32.183 --> 00:11:34.622
We need to prioritize
coming up with a plan

00:11:34.656 --> 00:11:36.760
for defeating Wang
and his goon squad.

00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:39.732
‐ By the way, you said
you had a friend coming.

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.368
Shouldn’t she be
getting here any minute?

00:11:41.402 --> 00:11:45.911
The entrances are sealed shut,
and there are traps inside.

00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:48.817
It might be prudent
to go downstairs and meet her.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.088
‐ I told her to message me
when she gets here.

00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:52.190
[cell phone buzzes]

00:11:52.224 --> 00:11:53.927
‐ Oh. Guess that’s her.

00:11:53.961 --> 00:11:54.996
Huh?

00:11:56.131 --> 00:11:57.868
It says, "Help"?

00:11:57.902 --> 00:12:00.941
This has gotta be a joke, right.

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:04.414
<i>‐ Kaname.</i>

00:12:04.448 --> 00:12:06.285
<i>Please help me.</i>

00:12:10.928 --> 00:12:12.832
‐ No rings here, huh?

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:15.738
But still, I need to be
careful of blind spots.

00:12:16.706 --> 00:12:18.476
[water flowing]

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.411
[gasps]

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:24.054
<i>Did I imagine that?</i>

00:12:24.087 --> 00:12:26.660
<i>No, somebody’s watching me.</i>

00:12:26.693 --> 00:12:28.095
<i>Where are they?</i>

00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:29.164
[gasps]

00:12:30.868 --> 00:12:33.039
<i>What was that? Water?</i>

00:12:33.072 --> 00:12:34.976
<i>It definitely</i>
<i>came from a Sigil.</i>

00:12:35.009 --> 00:12:37.949
<i>But where’s the person</i>
<i>who’s using it?</i>

00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:41.021
<i>Crap, they’re trying</i>
<i>to drown me.</i>

00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:44.829
<i>Some sort of telekinetic Sigil</i>
<i>that controls water.</i>

00:12:44.862 --> 00:12:47.100
<i>That’s not a good match for me.</i>

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:49.237
<i>Regardless,</i>
<i>I have to get out of here!</i>

00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:52.243
<i>Then I’ll find who’s</i>
<i>attacking me and destroy them!</i>

00:12:52.277 --> 00:12:54.916
‐ Sorry, lady,
but I’m not letting you escape.

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:57.387
‐ Good. Now I don’t have
to bother looking for you!

00:12:58.624 --> 00:12:59.792
That pathetic wall of water

00:12:59.826 --> 00:13:02.430
won’t be enough
to deflect my blades!

00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:05.203
[gasps]

00:13:05.236 --> 00:13:06.940
‐ That was close. Heh.

00:13:06.973 --> 00:13:08.977
You could have easily
slashed my throat.

00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:10.781
That’s an A‐rank player for you.

00:13:10.814 --> 00:13:12.652
You’re so next‐level!

00:13:12.685 --> 00:13:14.956
<i>‐ He encased my weapons in ice?</i>

00:13:14.989 --> 00:13:17.394
<i>This kid can do a lot more</i>
<i>than play with water!</i>

00:13:17.427 --> 00:13:19.565
[yells]

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:20.567
[drill whirring]

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:23.272
‐ Wow, you can drill
with those too?

00:13:23.306 --> 00:13:25.443
Scary!

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:28.082
Man, I almost
pissed myself there!

00:13:28.115 --> 00:13:31.188
You A‐rankers go all out, huh?

00:13:31.221 --> 00:13:32.658
If I don’t finish her off quick,

00:13:32.692 --> 00:13:35.396
there’s no telling what this
chick’s gonna do to me next!

00:13:37.802 --> 00:13:38.904
<i>‐ Run!</i>

00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:40.741
<i>The exit’s</i>
<i>about 100 meters from here!</i>

00:13:40.774 --> 00:13:41.876
<i>I can make it!</i>

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:43.980
[gasps]

00:13:44.882 --> 00:13:47.053
<i>No, he set me up!</i>

00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:48.255
[yelps]

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:53.499
KANAME: I don’t get it.

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:56.472
I can’t tell if Shuka’s
being serious or not.

00:13:57.608 --> 00:13:59.011
These coordinates...

00:13:59.044 --> 00:14:00.647
is that really where she is?

00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:02.150
REIN: Is there
some kind of trouble?

00:14:02.183 --> 00:14:04.221
‐ I just got a Help Call
from Shuka.

00:14:04.254 --> 00:14:07.494
It’s probably a joke
or something, don’t you think?

00:14:07.528 --> 00:14:08.563
‐ I don’t see any reason

00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:11.068
she’d send you a Help Call
if she didn’t need you.

00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:15.143
‐ Then she’s not joking around?

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:17.414
I’m gonna go pick her up.

00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:18.382
I’ll leave my rings here,

00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:20.921
so you guys
hold down the fort for a bit.

00:14:20.954 --> 00:14:22.190
‐ Roger that.

00:14:22.223 --> 00:14:24.161
I’ll let you through
the plant traps and barricades.

00:14:24.194 --> 00:14:27.033
‐ You might need some backup.
I’ll go, too.

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:28.770
‐ Sounds good. Thanks.

00:14:28.804 --> 00:14:30.741
‐ Wait. You can’t
just rush into this!

00:14:30.774 --> 00:14:33.345
It’s not as simple
as you think it is!

00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:36.686
Shuka may be in trouble, but
she’s also an A‐ranked player,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.022
meaning whatever
she’s up against

00:14:38.055 --> 00:14:39.826
is even more powerful
than she is!

00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:42.932
One wrong move,
and you’ll all be dead!

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:44.602
‐ That’s why I want to go.

00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:45.771
If we rescue Shuka,

00:14:45.804 --> 00:14:47.575
then we’ll have
a really strong ally.

00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:49.746
Remember,
Wang is also an A‐ranker.

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:51.215
‐ I’m sorry, Rein.

00:14:51.248 --> 00:14:54.922
It’s not that I don’t appreciate
you warning us or anything,

00:14:54.956 --> 00:14:56.826
but abandoning
one of our teammates

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.295
has never been an option.

00:14:59.464 --> 00:15:00.901
‐ [sighs]

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:03.005
All right, if you insist.

00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:05.878
I’ll give you as much support
as I can from the roof.

00:15:05.911 --> 00:15:07.615
My sniper rifle
should provide cover

00:15:07.648 --> 00:15:09.317
for a kilometer from there.

00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:13.560
‐ Thanks.
I’ll keep that in mind.

00:15:14.662 --> 00:15:16.533
[elevator whirring]

00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:20.072
‐ He’s headed
straight for disaster.

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:22.377
I sure hope he comes back alive.

00:15:24.582 --> 00:15:27.822
KANAME: The coordinates are
about 400 meters north of here,

00:15:27.855 --> 00:15:31.930
and there are six rings in
that spot, so it’s gotta be her.

00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:33.332
‐ She’s near the station.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.103
That should be
a five‐minute trip,

00:15:35.136 --> 00:15:36.739
but there are 300 enemies.

00:15:36.773 --> 00:15:40.012
Oh, wow, make that 168!

00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:42.317
By the way, where’s your gun?

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.589
You’re not stupid enough
to do this unarmed, right?

00:15:44.622 --> 00:15:47.895
‐ No. Apparently, any time
I go to sleep or pass out,

00:15:47.928 --> 00:15:49.699
any weapons
I’ve created disappear.

00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:51.168
‐ Disappear?

00:15:55.677 --> 00:15:58.282
So you can
make copies of things.

00:15:58.315 --> 00:16:01.589
Then why don’t you duplicate
the rings for an easy victory?

00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:03.425
‐ Sadly, it’s not that easy.

00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:07.868
When I touch something, I know
whether I can duplicate it.

00:16:07.902 --> 00:16:09.772
Complicated items
like smartphones

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:12.678
or big things like cars
don’t work,

00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:16.586
which tells me those rings are
made of more than just metal.

00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:18.890
‐ Okay, so what can you make?

00:16:18.924 --> 00:16:20.627
If you can whip up
something crazy,

00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:22.497
this fight may be in the bag.

00:16:22.531 --> 00:16:24.969
‐ I know I can do guns
and hand grenades.

00:16:25.002 --> 00:16:27.106
‐ Man, think of all
the money you could make

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.342
with a Sigil like that.

00:16:28.375 --> 00:16:30.079
If I could
trade mine for yours,

00:16:30.112 --> 00:16:31.850
I’d do it in a heartbeat.

00:16:31.883 --> 00:16:34.922
‐ Now that you mention it,
what is your Sigil?

00:16:34.956 --> 00:16:37.227
I’ve told you mine,
so it’s only fair, right?

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.999
‐ Eh, it’s not even
worth talking about.

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:43.807
It’s called Truth or Lie,
a lie detector.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.178
Tells me when
someone’s being dishonest.

00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:48.449
It’s a real bummer
of an ability,

00:16:48.482 --> 00:16:51.956
especially because
people lie so damn much.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.562
[cloth fluttering]

00:16:54.595 --> 00:16:55.664
‐ [sighs]

00:16:55.697 --> 00:16:56.833
<i>If it’s near the station,</i>

00:16:56.866 --> 00:16:58.703
<i>then I can cover them easily.</i>

00:16:58.737 --> 00:17:01.375
<i>This is a better vantage point</i>
<i>than I thought.</i>

00:17:03.012 --> 00:17:04.949
<i>The Eighth Clan</i>
<i>still hasn’t moved.</i>

00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:06.485
<i>I probably</i>
<i>shouldn’t make assumptions</i>

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:10.226
<i>based on the rings’ movement,</i>
<i>but given the event rules,</i>

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:14.067
<i>I highly doubt many players</i>
<i>would leave them unattended.</i>

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:16.573
<i>Besides, what if the rings</i>

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:20.046
<i>aren’t the hidden treasure</i>
<i>at all, just a smoke screen?</i>

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.918
<i>Or maybe they’re a clue</i>
<i>to the real treasure.</i>

00:17:22.952 --> 00:17:24.087
[gasps]

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.526
<i>That looks like a QR code!</i>

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:28.229
<i>Does that mean...</i>

00:17:28.262 --> 00:17:31.736
‐ Hey, I’ve just finished
putting up our defenses.

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:33.239
Did something else happen?

00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:36.245
‐ No. But I think
I may have discovered

00:17:36.278 --> 00:17:38.182
a clue for clearing this event.

00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:41.088
‐ [sighs] What’s that?

00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:43.425
‐ I have to assume
it’s some kind of code.

00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:45.931
This mark was obviously
put there on purpose,

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:48.135
so I think
the numbers are significant.

00:17:49.104 --> 00:17:50.373
It might be helpful to examine

00:17:50.406 --> 00:17:52.243
the rest of the rings
we have as well.

00:17:52.277 --> 00:17:54.916
‐ I’m seeing
a different sequence.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.084
Oh, wait. This one here

00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:57.755
has the exact same number
as yours does.

00:17:57.788 --> 00:18:02.497
‐ Really? I don’t suppose
that one is a topaz ring.

00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:03.600
‐ Looks like it.

00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:06.739
Maybe the numbers indicate
something about each of them?

00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:09.812
Hmm. You’re right.
It does remind me of a code.

00:18:09.845 --> 00:18:11.114
The more I think about it,

00:18:11.148 --> 00:18:13.520
the more I feel like Kaname’s
hypothesis was spot‐on.

00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:16.425
‐ It’s a little perplexing
that two of the sequences

00:18:16.458 --> 00:18:19.799
start with a decimal point,
and there are two nines.

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.403
‐ Yeah, that’s
not much to go on.

00:18:22.437 --> 00:18:24.007
And I take it
we haven’t collected

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.011
any diamond or
emerald rings, either?

00:18:26.044 --> 00:18:28.115
‐ That’s right.
This is just a guess on my part,

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:30.453
but I think we need to get
one ring of each type

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:32.156
before we can
figure anything out.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.662
At the moment, there isn’t
a single diamond ring

00:18:34.695 --> 00:18:36.064
visible on the map display,

00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:37.835
so at least
we don’t have to worry

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:39.437
about anyone else
beating us to it.

00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:41.108
‐ After the start of the game,

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:43.546
there was mention of
a first round of ring placement,

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.619
so it’s safe to say
there’ll be a second round.

00:18:47.588 --> 00:18:49.592
‐ Before we face off
with the Eighth Clan,

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:52.196
we should revise
our defense system.

00:18:56.773 --> 00:18:59.344
KANAME: It’s Shibuya
in the middle of the day.

00:18:59.377 --> 00:19:01.348
Nuts that the place
is totally empty.

00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:04.321
‐ Apparently, they forced all
the normal people to clear out.

00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:06.826
I have no idea how they do it.

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:10.701
All I know is that it’s
already down to 168 players.

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:13.873
‐ This game really goes all out,
taking over a whole area.

00:19:13.907 --> 00:19:15.176
‐ Well, it’d better.

00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:17.280
We’re betting our lives
like poker chips.

00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:20.987
‐ So do you play this game
for money or what?

00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:22.624
‐ Yeah, of course I do.

00:19:22.658 --> 00:19:25.296
Anybody who says that they’re
not in this thing for the money

00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:27.467
is either a liar
or a millionaire.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.170
‐ But I’m not either of those.

00:19:29.204 --> 00:19:30.574
‐ Then you’re a sicko.

00:19:30.607 --> 00:19:32.911
‐ Hey, I got sucked
into this by accident.

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:34.447
How does that make me a sicko?

00:19:34.481 --> 00:19:37.120
An unlucky loser, maybe,
but not a sicko!

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:39.090
‐ [laughs] At least you get rich

00:19:39.124 --> 00:19:41.929
while you fight
for your life, right, loser?

00:19:41.963 --> 00:19:43.533
‐ [grunts]

00:19:46.639 --> 00:19:47.708
Who’s there?

00:19:47.741 --> 00:19:51.381
‐ I’m not sure, but it
has to be another player.

00:19:51.415 --> 00:19:53.853
Whoever’s hiding
behind that pillar,

00:19:53.887 --> 00:19:55.824
drop your weapon
and come out!

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:57.226
Otherwise, my crazy friend

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.464
is gonna lob a grenade
right onto your head!

00:19:59.497 --> 00:20:01.903
‐ Oh, great.
Now I’m a loser and crazy?

00:20:03.105 --> 00:20:04.441
Look, if you don’t attack us,

00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:07.346
we won’t attack you!
Just come out, okay?

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.384
GIRL: Um, I’m sorry!

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:11.522
Please don’t throw a grenade!

00:20:11.556 --> 00:20:13.960
I’m not armed,
so I can’t hurt you!

00:20:13.993 --> 00:20:15.129
<i>‐ Huh?</i>

00:20:15.162 --> 00:20:16.833
<i>A girl?</i>

00:20:16.866 --> 00:20:18.903
<i>She’s even younger than Rein.</i>

00:20:18.937 --> 00:20:21.576
‐ Don’t drop your guard
’cause she’s a kid.

00:20:21.609 --> 00:20:23.880
She’s telling the truth
about being unarmed,

00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:26.318
but her Sigil
might be dangerous.

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:27.487
‐ Please! Just leave me alone!

00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:29.759
I’m not looking for a fight!
I beg you!

00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:32.998
‐ Okay, that wasn’t a lie.

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.033
What do we do?

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:35.871
‐ All right, we’ll be nice.

00:20:35.904 --> 00:20:37.206
Sorry to scare you.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.578
Come on, Ryuji.
Clock’s ticking.

00:20:39.612 --> 00:20:40.379
‐ I know.

00:20:40.413 --> 00:20:43.051
‐ Just another hundred meters.

00:20:43.085 --> 00:20:45.055
And judging
by where the rings are...

00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:47.293
Wait. The subway?

00:20:47.326 --> 00:20:48.295
Is she underground?

00:20:48.328 --> 00:20:50.032
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Sorry.

00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:51.368
We’re kind of in a hurry here.

00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:55.342
‐ It’s just it isn’t safe
to go near the subway.

00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:57.313
‐ Really? Do you know something?

00:20:57.346 --> 00:21:01.321
‐ Um, I can’t say for sure,
but maybe?

00:21:01.354 --> 00:21:04.962
‐ Look, we gotta get moving.
This is an emergency.

00:21:04.995 --> 00:21:07.200
‐ Wait. Don’t go!

00:21:07.233 --> 00:21:08.503
[whimpers]

00:21:11.007 --> 00:21:12.845
[water flowing]

00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:16.953
‐ Looks like Shuka might be in
more trouble than we expected.

00:21:16.986 --> 00:21:17.955
‐ No.

00:21:17.988 --> 00:21:19.892
[Japanese music playing]

00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:25.804
The subway’s
completely flooded!

00:21:28.142 --> 00:21:30.847
‐ Hey! You can’t go down there!

00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:32.183
‐ Maybe there’s still time.

00:21:32.216 --> 00:21:33.820
‐ This is a lot more serious

00:21:33.853 --> 00:21:35.256
than a flood, you idiot!

00:21:35.289 --> 00:21:36.859
Someone’s Sigil did that!

00:21:36.893 --> 00:21:39.197
We can’t see them,
but they’re close by.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.236
Your friend’s
probably already dead!

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.240
‐ I understand that.

00:21:44.274 --> 00:21:46.478
If I don’t come out
in five minutes,

00:21:46.512 --> 00:21:49.518
then go back to the hotel.
Forget about me.

00:21:49.552 --> 00:21:52.123
Go ahead and give my rings
to that girl.

00:21:52.156 --> 00:21:53.893
‐ Wait! [groans]
‐ [splash]

00:21:53.927 --> 00:21:57.066
Whatever happens,
it’s on you, dumb‐ass!

00:22:01.007 --> 00:22:02.644
‐ Uh, mister...

00:22:04.748 --> 00:22:05.984
Listen here, brat.

00:22:06.017 --> 00:22:09.658
You lied to me once.
You better not do it again.

00:22:09.692 --> 00:22:10.827
‐ [gasps]

00:22:10.861 --> 00:22:15.035
‐ You do know something about
what’s going on down there.

00:22:15.069 --> 00:22:16.672
Turns out my partner’s a moron,

00:22:16.706 --> 00:22:18.877
so things aren’t
looking too good for me.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.216
If you want to live, you’ll
tell me everything right now.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.053
‐ [whimpering]

00:22:24.087 --> 00:22:25.422
[energy surges]

00:22:27.326 --> 00:22:28.863
‐ [gasps] What the hell?

00:22:28.897 --> 00:22:31.167
Hey, get back here!

00:22:31.201 --> 00:22:32.905
Little shit!

00:22:32.938 --> 00:22:36.746
[groans] <i>That girl’s</i>
<i>got valuable information,</i>

00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:39.685
<i>and I won’t be able to live</i>
<i>with myself if I kill a kid.</i>

00:22:39.718 --> 00:22:41.421
<i>I’ll just give her a scare.</i>

00:22:41.454 --> 00:22:43.191
‐ [ice crackles]
‐ [gasps]

00:22:43.225 --> 00:22:45.362
Where’d this ice come from?

00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:48.503
Damn it!
You’re not getting away!

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.011

00:22:59.892 --> 00:23:01.796
‐ [shivering]

00:23:06.606 --> 00:23:09.277
<i>This water is unbearably cold.</i>

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:12.116
<i>It’s hard to stay conscious.</i>

00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:14.187
<i>This is terrible.</i>

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.659
<i>I got a partner,</i>
<i>and I still failed!</i>

00:23:16.692 --> 00:23:20.065
<i>I guess that means all that’s</i>
<i>left for me now is "game over."</i>

00:23:25.844 --> 00:23:29.551
<i>If I die in here,</i>
<i>will Kaname be sad?</i>

00:23:31.454 --> 00:23:35.129

00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:42.744
<i>That’s right.</i>
