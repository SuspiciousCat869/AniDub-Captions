WEBVTT

00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:08.250
[street chatter]

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:11.122
KOTORI: There you are!

00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:12.993
Hey, Rein, I’m over here!

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:16.065
‐ [scoffs] I wish you
wouldn’t yell out my name

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.702
and make a big scene, Kotori.

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:19.540
‐ [laughs] Sorry. My bad.

00:00:19.573 --> 00:00:22.444
I’m just not used to meeting
with you in person, you know,

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:24.683
since we usually
correspond by text.

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:25.885
‐ I’d prefer that,

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.589
but your texts
are so garbled with emojis

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:30.060
that sometimes I can’t
make heads or tails of them.

00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:31.664
Besides, I’m in a hurry.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:34.268
‐ Oh, sorry. Didn’t realize
I was a bad texter.

00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:36.507
Anyway, you’re amazing, Rein.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.945
That tip you gave me
about the Eighth Clan’s hideout

00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:40.147
was right on the money.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.019
I learned a lot from scouting,
so ask me anything.

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:45.357
‐ I was able to get
most of what I need to know

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.294
from the text you sent
about the warehouse.

00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:49.232
Next, I’d like to ask
about their numbers

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:51.302
and who specifically
is involved.

00:00:51.336 --> 00:00:54.242
I’d also like to know what sort
of weapons they may have.

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:55.912
‐ I don’t know
about their weapons,

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:58.618
but I can confirm
there are a dozen people,

00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:00.755
possibly up to 15.

00:01:00.788 --> 00:01:02.759
You guys really did a good job

00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:04.830
of thinning them out,
didn’t you?

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:08.504
Now they can’t mobilize
like they could at their peak.

00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:10.140
‐ [rumbling]
‐ We’re not the ones

00:01:10.173 --> 00:01:12.211
who should take
the credit for that.

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:15.417
So whose Sigils should we
be worried about most?

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.223
‐ Well, you know about
that karate guy named Keiichi,

00:01:18.256 --> 00:01:21.262
and then there’s their leader,
Wang, obviously.

00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:23.033
‐ And the Flame Demon?

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.103
‐ I didn’t see him,
so I’m pretty sure

00:01:25.137 --> 00:01:27.374
he was killed during
the Treasure Hunt event.

00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:28.945
‐ Okay.

00:01:28.978 --> 00:01:30.515
<i>Mr. Hiiragi...</i>

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:33.086
<i>did you manage</i>
<i>to overpower him?</i>

00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:36.894
All right,
it’s time for me to go now.

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:38.931
I’ll pay you in points as usual.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.467
‐ Hey, one more thing!

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.037
‐ Yes?

00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:44.108
‐ Don’t worry about paying me
for this time.

00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:46.513
I have a favor to ask instead.

00:01:46.547 --> 00:01:47.481
‐ A favor?

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:49.620
‐ I was hoping that you
might pull a few strings

00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:51.824
and help me get
into the Sunset Ravens?

00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:53.293
They could really use
my skills!

00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:56.900
‐ [sighs] But you’re still
a member of Icy Crown, remember?

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:58.069
Don’t betray them.

00:01:58.103 --> 00:01:59.606
We’re already
at war with the Eighth.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.111
It would be foolish of us
to create another conflict.

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:03.480
‐ Eighth is getting weaker.

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:06.019
There’s no way they can stand up
to the Sunset Ravens now.

00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:09.058
You know as well as I do
that you can win this,

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.830
even if it means
making a few sacrifices.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:13.534
‐ Actually,
our leader is the type

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.172
who wants to avoid
making any sacrifices.

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:18.577
As a result,
we’re basically playing D‐Game

00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:19.713
with a handicap on.

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:21.784
‐ Ah, he sounds like a good guy.

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:23.286
That makes me
like him even more.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.692
I heard a rumor that whenever
a player clears an event,

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:28.430
the game’ll reward them
with a super‐special privilege.

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:31.169
That Kaname Sudo
must be an incredible guy.

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:33.674
‐ Well, I’ll pass along
your request, but...

00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:34.643
you should know.

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:36.479
You won’t get an answer
right away.

00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:39.285
‐ Oh, yeah, that’s fine.
I can wait!

00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:41.356
Do your best out there,
okay, girl?

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.928
‐ [sighs]
<i>"Eighth Clan is too weak</i>

00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:46.767
<i>to stand up</i>
<i>to Sunset Ravens," huh?</i>

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.706
<i>I’m hesitant to be</i>
<i>as optimistic as Kotori is.</i>

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.545
<i>But luckily that terrible</i>
<i>Flame Demon is dead,</i>

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.117
<i>and we know</i>
<i>what Wang’s Sigil can do,</i>

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.254
<i>so we could probably</i>
<i>defeat them right now,</i>

00:02:57.287 --> 00:02:59.926
<i>even without relying</i>
<i>on Xuelan’s help.</i>

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.866
<i>What really concerns me is...</i>

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.803
[Japanese music playing]

00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:37.421
‐ Damn it!
‐ [pounding]

00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:40.728
This whole thing
is bullshit,

00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:42.231
all of it!

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:43.366
‐ Knock it off, Kaname.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.370
Hurting yourself
won’t fix this!

00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:47.775
‐ That bastard cut
my friend’s fingers off, Ryuji!

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:48.944
I’m killing him!

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:50.447
‐ Trust me, I understand.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.484
Killing Wang is
the one thing I want most.

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:55.457
But I promise Kaede can easily
repair your buddy’s hands,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.962
so just calm down
for a second, okay?

00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:59.064
‐ [groans]

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.507
SHUKA: How do you
feel now, better?

00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:06.078
‐ Yeah. Sorry I
lost my temper earlier.

00:05:06.112 --> 00:05:07.481
But knowing
they’ve got Shinozuka

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.251
is driving me freakin’ crazy.

00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:11.255
‐ Let’s go over the facts again.

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.759
Obviously, our main objective

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:14.663
is to get the hostage
out of harm’s way,

00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:17.067
but we also need to take out
that piece of shit, Wang,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.938
before he hurts more people.
[chuckles]

00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:21.844
So we’ve got everybody
in this room plus Rein.

00:05:21.877 --> 00:05:25.050
Then there’s the reinforcements
from the Danjo Boxing Club.

00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:26.553
We have to work with that.

00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:30.026
Unfortunately, we haven’t
been able to get in touch

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.229
with Miss Number‐One Player.

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:32.599
SHUKA: That’s fine by me.

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:35.203
It’s not like that woman’s
worthy of our trust, anyway.

00:05:35.237 --> 00:05:37.709
We can take care of it
all on our own.

00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:40.013
RYUJI: Well, now that
we’re all on the same page,

00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:41.482
let’s talk strategy.

00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:43.621
According to Rein’s analysis,

00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:46.492
they filmed that video
in a coastal warehouse district.

00:05:47.562 --> 00:05:50.501
SUI: She could tell all that
from only the video?

00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:54.308
‐ She saw a black‐tailed gull
in the corner of one frame.

00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:56.880
I thought it was
just a smudge or something.

00:05:56.914 --> 00:05:58.817
And Wang doesn’t
strike me as the type

00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:00.888
who would plant
a red herring like that.

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:02.859
‐ Shinozuka.

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:04.228
This is my fault.

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:05.297
‐ Don’t blame yourself.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.000
The only people
in the wrong here

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.069
are Wang and his lackeys.

00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:10.575
You couldn’t have known
this was going to happen.

00:06:10.608 --> 00:06:11.944
Your friend was
just unlucky enough

00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:15.217
to get snapped up
by a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.287
The main problem
is that monsters like Wang

00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:18.624
run loose in this world.

00:06:18.657 --> 00:06:21.095
You should blame the world,
if anything.

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.001
‐ Shuka.

00:06:24.034 --> 00:06:25.170
[door opens]

00:06:25.203 --> 00:06:26.974
‐ I’m sorry for the wait,
everyone.

00:06:27.007 --> 00:06:30.213
I’ve finally gathered all
of the necessary information.

00:06:30.247 --> 00:06:32.451
So let’s go rescue the hostage.

00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:35.625
‐ [whimpering]

00:06:35.658 --> 00:06:37.528
Damn, my hands hurt
so freakin’ bad!

00:06:37.562 --> 00:06:39.666
‐ After all that,
we still couldn’t get him

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.035
to tell us where Sudo is.

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:43.373
‐ Seems like he really
doesn’t know anything.

00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:45.544
Oh, well. That doesn’t matter.

00:06:45.578 --> 00:06:48.584
Give it some time, and I’m sure
Kaname’ll come to us.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:51.489
He’ll want to tell us what he
thinks about that video we made.

00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:53.794
‐ So you think the fatso’s
good enough bait?

00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:55.731
‐ You got that right.
Then again,

00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:58.804
we might as well have grabbed
any average joe off the street.

00:06:58.837 --> 00:07:00.875
That Kaname’s
a bleeding‐heart softie.

00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:02.879
He can’t live
with being responsible

00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:05.183
for the death
of another human being.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.553
What he doesn’t understand

00:07:06.586 --> 00:07:09.391
is most people have no problem
at all with killing somebody

00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:10.695
if it means
saving their own skin.

00:07:10.728 --> 00:07:12.899
‐ [gasps] Excuse me, sir!
There’s an emergency!

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.136
‐ What are you
so worked up for, Shinji?

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.707
Is Kaname here already?

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.011
‐ Actually, no. There are
tons of police outside!

00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:19.946
‐ You’re kidding me.

00:07:21.516 --> 00:07:22.685
‐ Squad A here.

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:24.689
We’re stationed
in front of the warehouse.

00:07:24.723 --> 00:07:27.294
<i>‐ Roger.</i>
<i>Wait for SAT to arrive.</i>

00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:28.363
‐ Understood, sir.

00:07:28.396 --> 00:07:30.433
‐ Shit! Just when I
was about to get

00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:32.939
my quality time with Kaname,
the cops have to show up

00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:35.243
out of nowhere
and ruin the whole thing.

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:37.615
<i>‐ What?</i>
<i>Do they know I’m in here?</i>

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:39.953
‐ Hey, uh, do you think
we might have gotten

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:41.790
a little too carried away?

00:07:41.823 --> 00:07:42.759
‐ Huh?

00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:45.598
Well, well, look who’s
got all the answers.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.969
You want me to play it safe
and be a good boy?

00:07:48.002 --> 00:07:48.871
Is that it, Shinji?

00:07:48.904 --> 00:07:50.975
‐ No, I’m not telling you
what to do, sir!

00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:52.244
Uh, I’m sorry?

00:07:52.277 --> 00:07:54.448
‐ Smart. I was just making sure!

00:07:54.481 --> 00:07:56.285
So don’t go pissing your pants.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.889
Nobody can touch Eighth Clan,

00:07:57.922 --> 00:07:59.926
definitely not
that bunch of pigs.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:01.797
Ain’t that right, Kei?

00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:08.009
‐ Damn it. I still
haven’t gotten any response

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:09.311
from Wang and his guys.

00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:11.783
I guess they’re
not open to negotiating.

00:08:11.817 --> 00:08:14.221
‐ Sorry I’m the only backup
we could send.

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:17.662
Danjo Boxing Club suddenly
got attacked by Uroboros.

00:08:17.695 --> 00:08:19.398
‐ It’s possible
that was coordinated

00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:20.968
ahead of time
by the Eighth Clan.

00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:22.471
‐ You’re saying
Uroboros and Eighth

00:08:22.505 --> 00:08:23.574
have some kind of alliance?

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:25.210
‐ I don’t know for certain.

00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:26.947
It could be just a coincidence.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.982
‐ Don’t worry, Inukai.

00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:31.122
With you here, we probably
have enough firepower.

00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:32.825
‐ Hope you’re right, Kaname.

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:34.395
Okay, just so we’re all clear,

00:08:34.428 --> 00:08:35.965
the first objective
of this mission

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:37.902
is saving that guy
they took hostage,

00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:39.572
and the second stage
is getting him

00:08:39.606 --> 00:08:41.610
to the safe zone, right?

00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:43.547
Instead of
exterminating those jerks?

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.254
‐ I know it seems weak,
and maybe it is weak.

00:08:47.287 --> 00:08:48.791
When I think
about taking the life

00:08:48.824 --> 00:08:50.961
of every single
Eighth Clan member,

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:54.836
I just don’t feel
like that’s a line I can cross.

00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:56.873
‐ Well, for right now,
the only thing we can do

00:08:56.907 --> 00:08:59.111
is stand by until we
get word from Shuka.

00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:01.616
Shuka, is the radio reception
coming through okay?

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.419
<i>You can hear me, right?</i>

00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:04.856
‐ Sorry, Rein. I’d love to chat,

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:06.192
but I’m kind of
doing something here.

00:09:06.225 --> 00:09:08.831
<i>‐ I just wanted to confirm</i>
<i>that we had signal.</i>

00:09:08.864 --> 00:09:10.467
‐ Ugh! If you’re gonna bug me,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.972
you should at least
put Kaname on instead.

00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:16.479
KANAME: <i>Hey, Shuka, sorry this</i>
<i>is such a half‐baked plan.</i>

00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:18.584
‐ Oh, you shouldn’t worry
about me, Kaname,

00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:19.953
You’re the boss, after all.

00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:22.725
I’m here to do
whatever makes you happy.

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:24.261
RYUJI: <i>That’s enough, you two.</i>

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:26.232
<i>You can flirt</i>
<i>when this is over.</i>

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:28.035
<i>What’s going on with Eighth?</i>

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:29.539
SHUKA: <i>Oh, yeah, them.</i>

00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:31.643
<i>The police have their place</i>
<i>surrounded right now.</i>

00:09:31.676 --> 00:09:32.645
‐ The police are there?

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:35.518
<i>‐ Uh, Keiichi</i>
<i>just came out alone.</i>

00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:37.755
‐ In that case,
we should make our move.

00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:39.959
‐ You sure that’s a good idea?

00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:41.362
‐ Since they don’t have Sigils,

00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:43.499
the cops are basically
just cannon fodder,

00:09:43.534 --> 00:09:44.903
which means
we can grab Shinozuka

00:09:44.936 --> 00:09:46.640
while Eighth is busy
fighting them off.

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:48.209
RYUJI: Sounds good to me.

00:09:48.242 --> 00:09:50.013
Roger that, Boss!

00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:52.718
‐ You’re Keiichi Katsura
of the Eighth Clan, right?

00:09:52.752 --> 00:09:54.254
Put your
hands behind your head

00:09:54.288 --> 00:09:55.390
and drop to your knees!

00:09:55.423 --> 00:09:58.229
I repeat! Put your hands
behind your head

00:09:58.262 --> 00:09:59.298
and drop to your knees!

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:01.202
‐ Tempest!

00:10:04.274 --> 00:10:06.312
‐ Yeah, nice work, Kei!

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:07.414
Attaboy!

00:10:07.447 --> 00:10:08.550
What did I tell you?

00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:11.388
These pigs are no match for us.

00:10:11.422 --> 00:10:13.694
SHINJI: Uh, right!
Of course, sir!

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:15.196
SHINOZUKA: <i>I don’t believe this.</i>

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.733
<i>Did they just kill a cop?</i>

00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:19.873
‐ But it’ll be a pain
in the ass if they send backup.

00:10:19.906 --> 00:10:22.612
I say we get out of here
while the getting’s good.

00:10:22.645 --> 00:10:23.914
‐ Yes, sir.
‐ Yes, sir.

00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:25.818
‐ What about
roly‐poly over there?

00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:28.757
Think we should take him
to the next place?

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.362
WANG: Eh, he’s probably
not worth the effort.

00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:33.567
We can always
get another hostage.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.303
Let’s waste his ass.

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:36.272
Hey, Shinji,

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:38.811
you’ve never actually
shot anybody, have you?

00:10:38.844 --> 00:10:41.182
[Shinozuka whimpering]

00:10:41.215 --> 00:10:44.354
‐ Why don’t we let this guy
be your first?

00:10:44.388 --> 00:10:46.125
‐ Um, that’s okay.

00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:47.929
I’d prefer not to.

00:10:47.962 --> 00:10:48.764
[saw grinding]

00:10:48.797 --> 00:10:50.033
‐ [gasps]
‐ Wang!

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.605
The police are starting
to cut through the back door!

00:10:52.638 --> 00:10:55.076
‐ Oh, really? So those idiots

00:10:55.109 --> 00:10:56.813
have finally gotten it
through their skulls

00:10:56.847 --> 00:10:59.151
that Kei is stronger
than all of them put together?

00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:02.825
Just wait ’til they get
a taste of what I can do.

00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:04.896
‐ [slice]
‐ [groans]

00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:06.700

‐ What the hell was that?

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:07.969
‐ [slice]
‐ [winces]

00:11:09.004 --> 00:11:11.943
‐ Hi there!
Welcome to my show, officers!

00:11:11.977 --> 00:11:14.616
We’ve got
such a big crowd today!

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:17.287
‐ [yelling]

00:11:19.024 --> 00:11:22.965
‐ They’re mowing down
the police like it’s nothing.

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:25.771
Is this really
the way I’m gonna die?

00:11:29.913 --> 00:11:32.752
‐ Okay. I delivered the phone
like you said to.

00:11:32.785 --> 00:11:34.454
I’m not sure
how he’s supposed use it

00:11:34.488 --> 00:11:35.456
with no fingers, though.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.127
‐ Good job, Shuka.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.097
Now we can move on
to the next step.

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:40.366
<i>‐ You got it.</i>

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.870
KANAME: <i>All right, Shinozuka.</i>

00:11:41.903 --> 00:11:43.907
<i>The rest is</i>
<i>gonna depend on you.</i>

00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:46.445
‐ [gasps] <i>Hello?</i>

00:11:46.478 --> 00:11:48.617
<i>Kaname? Is that you?</i>

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.619
‐ Yeah, it’s me!

00:11:49.652 --> 00:11:51.021
‐ Oh, thank God.

00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:52.892
Are you coming
to get me out of this mess?

00:11:52.925 --> 00:11:55.430
<i>‐ We’re trying, but you</i>
<i>have to listen carefully.</i>

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:56.566
<i>That phone you just got</i>

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.236
<i>has an invite</i>
<i>to Darwin’s Game on it.</i>

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:00.173
‐ I need you to click the link.
‐ Hmm?

00:12:00.206 --> 00:12:03.012
<i>‐ Once you do,</i>
<i>we’ll be able to help you.</i>

00:12:03.045 --> 00:12:06.285
<i>‐ Huh? A game?</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

00:12:06.318 --> 00:12:07.320
<i>My life is at stake.</i>

00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:09.792
‐ I know it sounds crazy,
but you have to! Trust me!

00:12:09.826 --> 00:12:11.495
‐ Okay, fine. I’ll do it.

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:13.032
But my fingers were cut off.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.134
<i>‐ If your hands won’t work,</i>

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:16.171
<i>use your feet,</i>
<i>tongue, whatever!</i>

00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:17.440
<i>Do you want to die?</i>

00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:19.011
<i>‐ No, of course not.</i>

00:12:19.044 --> 00:12:20.814
‐ Okay, then I’ll‐‐
‐ [click]

00:12:20.848 --> 00:12:22.818
‐ Crap! The call
just got dropped!

00:12:22.852 --> 00:12:25.390
‐ Well, we knew teleporting him
using a D‐Game Help Call

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:26.793
was a long shot to begin with.

00:12:26.826 --> 00:12:29.298
‐ Then all that’s left to do
is grab him ourselves!

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:31.402
And we’ll kill Wang
while we’re at it!

00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:32.805
[beeping]

00:12:32.838 --> 00:12:35.410
<i>‐ Damn it.</i>
<i>I accidentally hung up!</i>

00:12:35.443 --> 00:12:38.316
<i>How am I supposed to do</i>
<i>anything without fingers?</i>

00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:39.919
<i>Someone please help me.</i>

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:42.858
KANAME:
<i>If your hands won’t work,</i>

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:44.862
<i>use your feet,</i>
<i>tongue, whatever!</i>

00:12:44.896 --> 00:12:47.267
<i>‐ That’s it. I can’t die here.</i>

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.273
<i>I still have way too many</i>
<i>things that I want to do!</i>

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:54.281
[cell phone warbles]

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:03.065
‐ Whoa. Now what’s happening?

00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:05.871
‐ We’re about ready
to head out, sir.

00:13:05.904 --> 00:13:07.474
‐ I can go get the car anytime.

00:13:07.508 --> 00:13:08.376
‐ Perfect.

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:11.281
We’ll leave
when the cops are disposed of.

00:13:11.315 --> 00:13:14.087
You can eliminate
the hostage for me.

00:13:14.121 --> 00:13:16.158
‐ Me? Oh, no.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.766
Okay. This isn’t my fault.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.569
If Sudo hadn’t
made a fool out of Wang,

00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:24.676
then none of this crap
would’ve ever needed to happen!

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:27.648
‐ [gasps] Hey!
What the hell, man?

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.619
Why are you standing up?

00:13:29.652 --> 00:13:32.223
And how did you
get out of those ropes?

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:33.860
[energy surges]

00:13:37.735 --> 00:13:38.970

‐ [gasps]

00:13:46.318 --> 00:13:48.590
‐ There he is!
I’m gonna run him over!

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:50.360
‐ Stop the car!
This car is sturdy,

00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:53.466
but Keiichi’s Sigil
can still overpower it!

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.535
‐ [tires squeal]
‐ Really?

00:13:57.007 --> 00:13:59.311
‐ [chuckles] They’re lucky
they didn’t charge at me,

00:13:59.344 --> 00:14:01.850
or I would have smashed them
against the building!

00:14:03.587 --> 00:14:05.156
INUKAI: Leave this clown to me.

00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:07.360
You guys proceed with the plan.

00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:08.429
‐ Please be careful, Inukai.

00:14:08.462 --> 00:14:10.601
He’s a higher‐ranked player
than you are.

00:14:10.634 --> 00:14:11.569
‐ Sounds fun.

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:14.675
‐ [gasps]
‐ [yells]

00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:16.713
Just ignore

This is one‐on‐one!

SHINOZUKA: <i>What’s happening?</i>

00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:22.925
<i>Why did he go flying like that?</i>

00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.198
<i>Wait. I think</i>
<i>I sent him flying.</i>

00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:29.037
<i>Suddenly I’m able</i>
<i>to move stuff with my mind.</i>

00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:32.377
<i>It’s like having</i>

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.379
<i>I get it.</i>

00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:36.351
Kaname gave me this power

00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:39.057
so that I could
get myself out of this!

00:14:39.091 --> 00:14:40.661
‐ Hey, what’s going on here?

00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:41.863
What did you do to him?

Well, this is

‐ Oh, shit, him again.

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.970
‐ Watch your back
around this guy, Wang!

00:15:02.003 --> 00:15:03.507
His Sigil is no joke!

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.145
‐ [chuckles] I’m not sure
how he pulled it off,

00:15:06.178 --> 00:15:09.384
but I bet you anything
this is Kaname’s work.

00:15:09.418 --> 00:15:10.486
So where is he?

00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:12.792
I know he’s gotta be
somewhere close by, right?

00:15:12.825 --> 00:15:15.062
Come on out, Kaname!

00:15:15.096 --> 00:15:16.533
Better hurry up
and show yourself,

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:19.371
’cause I’m about to filet
this fat‐ass buddy of yours!

00:15:19.404 --> 00:15:22.210
<i>‐ Nope, this isn’t</i>
<i>a dream at all.</i>

00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:24.582
<i>This guy’s scarier</i>
<i>than my nightmares.</i>

00:15:24.615 --> 00:15:27.387
<i>So if it’s real, then</i>
<i>that means I have to fight!</i>

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.359
<i>Besides, Kaname is</i>
<i>on his way here!</i>

00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:31.563
That’s enough!

00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:34.201
Stop calling me fat‐ass!

00:15:36.371 --> 00:15:39.912
‐ [scoffs] You have no idea
what you’re getting into, kiddo.

00:15:39.946 --> 00:15:41.215
Here’s a preview.

00:15:41.248 --> 00:15:42.818
This’ll take five seconds.

00:15:42.852 --> 00:15:44.555
‐ You’re Keiichi, right?

00:15:44.589 --> 00:15:46.425
I’ve heard about you before.

00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:47.427
You reached the semifinals

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.803
in the 42nd Seishin
All‐Japan Karate Championship.

00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:53.940
You had a decent chance
of winning.

00:15:53.974 --> 00:15:56.345
Too bad you had to drop out
after you accidentally

00:15:56.378 --> 00:15:59.017
killed your opponent
in the middle of a match.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.388
And today you massacred
all those officers.

00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:03.927
I gotta wonder
why a stone‐cold killer like you

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.131
is satisfied with being
Wang’s little lapdog.

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:10.841
‐ You’re a kid. You could never
understand how great Wang is.

00:16:10.874 --> 00:16:12.878
That incident destroyed me.

00:16:12.912 --> 00:16:14.649
Even though
I did it by accident,

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:17.220
his family
refused to forgive me.

00:16:17.253 --> 00:16:19.559
Over time,
it became too agonizing,

00:16:19.592 --> 00:16:20.661
and I quit karate,

00:16:20.694 --> 00:16:22.531
but the pain never went away.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:26.205
Then Wang made me understand
why I was suffering.

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:27.942
WANG: <i>The reason</i>
<i>you’re this miserable</i>

00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:30.179
<i>is because you only</i>
<i>killed that one man.</i>

00:16:30.213 --> 00:16:31.415
<i>In times like this,</i>

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:33.920
<i>the only remedy</i>
<i>is to kill even more.</i>

00:16:33.954 --> 00:16:35.289
<i>Death dilutes death.</i>

00:16:35.323 --> 00:16:37.895
‐ After I became
a part of D‐Game,

00:16:37.928 --> 00:16:39.932
I finally started
to feel better.

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:42.070
You play D‐Game,
and you’re a martial artist,

00:16:42.103 --> 00:16:43.472
so you should get that!

00:16:43.507 --> 00:16:46.178
People die when one
of their organs is destroyed

00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:49.217
or if their heart stops
for a few minutes.

00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:51.956
Human beings are designed to die
from the moment they’re born.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.127
‐ Wow, thanks
for the unsolicited speech.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.363
You said give you five seconds,

00:16:55.396 --> 00:16:57.367
but I think you just blabbed
for a solid minute.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.705
‐ Well, sorry to make you wait.

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:01.543
I guess I should wrap this up.

00:17:01.576 --> 00:17:03.012
Tempest!

00:17:03.045 --> 00:17:05.784
<i>‐ Hah! He’s wide open now!</i>

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.287
[gasps]

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.259
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

00:17:10.293 --> 00:17:11.829
<i>How tough is this guy?</i>

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:13.700
Hey, not half‐bad, bro.

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:16.405
Thanks for making this face‐off
interesting for me.

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:18.242
<i>He shielded himself</i>
<i>with his Sigil</i>

00:17:18.275 --> 00:17:20.079
<i>the moment</i>
<i>he lost sight of me.</i>

00:17:20.112 --> 00:17:22.116
<i>But he doesn’t rely</i>
<i>on just that.</i>

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.956
<i>He really is</i>
<i>an incredible martial artist.</i>

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:27.360
‐ That defensive fall
was a smart move.

00:17:27.393 --> 00:17:29.164
I can see you’ve had
some training.

00:17:29.197 --> 00:17:32.103
Your ability makes you
extremely fast, doesn’t it?

00:17:32.136 --> 00:17:34.107
If I were you,
I’d want to play it safe

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.176
and whip out my knife.

00:17:35.209 --> 00:17:36.378
‐ [scoffs] Against you,

00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:38.182
I feel like a knife
would be overkill.

00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:39.986
<i>Don’t underestimate me.</i>

00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:42.658
<i>I’m a martial artist, too.</i>

00:17:42.691 --> 00:17:44.595
Now I’ll give you a preview.

00:17:44.629 --> 00:17:48.035
Well, except you won’t
be able to see anything I do.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.004
‐ [gasps]
‐ Ready?

00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:50.574
Try to keep up!

00:17:52.043 --> 00:17:53.947
REIN: This is a good spot.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.283
Remember,
the important thing now

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:57.387
is to remain
completely undetected.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.424
It’s up to us
to control the situation

00:17:59.457 --> 00:18:01.996
and support the rescue mission
from the sidelines.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.733
You can handle your part,
right, Sui?

00:18:03.767 --> 00:18:06.071
‐ Um, I’ll try my best!

00:18:06.104 --> 00:18:08.242
[energy warbles]

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.150
Excellent.

00:18:14.054 --> 00:18:15.924
‐ [laughs] Come on.

00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.093
I thought the police

00:18:17.126 --> 00:18:19.130
were supposed to be
way tougher than this.

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:21.603
‐ You’d think so.
Then again, I did use my Sigil

00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:24.575
to disable all their triggers
earlier, remember?

00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:25.811
‐ Yeah, I know.

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:29.518
Still, it just goes to show you
that we’re an unbeatable team.

00:18:29.552 --> 00:18:31.254
‐ Now’s not the time
to get cocky.

00:18:31.288 --> 00:18:33.459
‐ Okay, they’re headed
toward the spot.

00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:34.729
Get ready, Sui.

00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:36.966
Or is it Sota I’m talking to?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.202
[Sota laughs]

00:18:38.235 --> 00:18:40.607
‐ I don’t know. You tell me!
‐ Oh, well.

00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:43.479
I guess it really doesn’t matter
which one of you it is.

00:18:43.513 --> 00:18:44.481
‐ [energy surges]
‐ Here goes.

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:46.284
Lead with the water
toward point A.

00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:49.491
We’ll coordinate it
with your ice attack.

00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:51.461
3, 2...

00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:52.430
<i>1...</i>

00:18:52.463 --> 00:18:54.969
‐ now!
‐ It’s up to you, Sota!

00:18:55.002 --> 00:18:56.939
‐ Right! Don’t you worry!

00:18:56.973 --> 00:18:57.941
‐ [gasps]
‐ Huh?

00:18:57.975 --> 00:18:59.110
What’s up with all the water?

00:18:59.144 --> 00:19:01.549
[gasps]
Who in the hell did this?!

00:19:01.582 --> 00:19:02.618
I’ll kill you!

00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:03.553
‐ Nicely done.

00:19:03.586 --> 00:19:07.026
Now we should hurry
and get point D set up.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.195
SUI: <i>Um, sure.</i>

00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:12.638
[footsteps echoing]

00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:16.979
KANAME: No one’s here.

00:19:17.013 --> 00:19:18.315
‐ That seems odd.

00:19:18.349 --> 00:19:19.885
<i>‐ Something’s not right.</i>

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:22.490
<i>They’re close.</i>
<i>They have to be.</i>

00:19:22.524 --> 00:19:25.229
This doesn’t make sense.
We saw Keiichi.

00:19:25.262 --> 00:19:27.467
‐ I don’t know.
Maybe they escaped out the back?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.270
<i>‐ Wang wouldn’t do that.</i>

00:19:29.304 --> 00:19:31.509
<i>He wouldn’t use Keiichi</i>
<i>as a decoy.</i>

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:33.780
[Wang laughs]

00:19:33.813 --> 00:19:36.986
It took you a while,
but I knew you’d make it.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.957
Good to see you!

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.261
‐ Wang! Let Shinozuka go now!

00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:42.765
‐ Is that the tubby guy?

00:19:42.798 --> 00:19:44.367
I never caught his name before.

00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:47.775
Take it you were inspired by
our special video presentation.

00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:50.246
‐ I’m here to fight you
just like you wanted!

00:19:50.279 --> 00:19:52.350
So you don’t need him
anymore, okay?

00:19:52.383 --> 00:19:54.020
‐ Just like I wanted?

00:19:54.054 --> 00:19:56.324
I think you’re mistaken, Kaname.

00:19:56.358 --> 00:19:58.730
Look, that’s not
why I asked you to meet me.

00:19:58.763 --> 00:20:00.801
You see, the only thing
that I’m interested in

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:03.272
is watching your face
contort with agony and despair

00:20:03.305 --> 00:20:05.209
because of what’s
about to happen here.

00:20:05.242 --> 00:20:07.080
The thing is, Kaname,

00:20:07.113 --> 00:20:09.785
there’s one very important
piece of information

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:11.354
that you seem to be missing.

00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:13.258
You jumped to conclusions.

00:20:13.292 --> 00:20:15.564
You assumed I was still
holding your little pal hostage,

00:20:15.597 --> 00:20:17.100
when I’ve already set him free

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:18.570
and sent him running
in your direction.

00:20:18.603 --> 00:20:21.208
You really
didn’t pick up on that?

00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:25.082
You’re not a very attentive
friend, are you, Kaname?

00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:26.552
‐ So where?

00:20:26.586 --> 00:20:27.521
‐ Go on.

00:20:27.554 --> 00:20:29.859
Feel free to take
another look around the place.

00:20:29.892 --> 00:20:33.265
Trust me. He’s closer
than you might think.

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:36.506
[gasps]

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.847
No.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.859
You’re lying.

00:20:46.893 --> 00:20:48.763
It can’t...

00:20:48.797 --> 00:20:49.832
be true.

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:52.370
‐ Kaname, stop! Don’t!

00:20:56.679 --> 00:20:58.215
‐ It’s him.

00:20:58.248 --> 00:21:00.286
He’s dead.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:03.225
‐ [laughs]

00:21:03.258 --> 00:21:05.797
‐ [wails]

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.366
‐ Wang, you bastard!

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.368
‐ Don’t look at me.

00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:10.206
This whole thing
is Kaname’s fault!

00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:12.143
I used to be
so pure and innocent

00:21:12.176 --> 00:21:14.347
until he deceived me
and made me go crazy!

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.921
‐ My fault? It’s my fault?

00:21:17.955 --> 00:21:19.257
‐ Of course it’s your fault!

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.161
You should’ve known
there’d be consequences

00:21:21.194 --> 00:21:22.798
for making me look like a fool!

00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:23.800
Because of you,

00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:26.639
that innocent little piggy
got chopped to pieces!

00:21:26.672 --> 00:21:30.079
How sad! He probably had
so much left to live for,

00:21:30.112 --> 00:21:33.218
so many hopes and dreams,
so many missed opportunities,

00:21:33.252 --> 00:21:35.524
and I’m sure his family’s
gonna be devastated!

00:21:35.557 --> 00:21:37.059
You cost him everything!

00:21:37.093 --> 00:21:39.030
How does that feel?

00:21:39.063 --> 00:21:41.736

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.806
[sighs]

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.644
Whatever. Kill them.

00:23:25.677 --> 00:23:28.917
‐ I can do it, sir. Sorry I
messed things up the first time.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.123
WANG: Do what you want, Shinji.
It doesn’t matter.

00:23:32.156 --> 00:23:34.093
RYUJI: Pull yourself together,
Kaname!

00:23:34.127 --> 00:23:35.563
‐ [growls]

00:23:35.597 --> 00:23:37.668
