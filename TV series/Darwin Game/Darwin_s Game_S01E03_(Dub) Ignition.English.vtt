00:09:44.702 --> 00:09:48.309
Is killing other people
really that much fun?

00:09:48.342 --> 00:09:49.445
[grunts]

00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:51.048
God damn it!

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:59.632
<i>If I don’t get my hands</i>
<i>on three rings, it’s game over.</i>

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:02.437
<i>I guess in the end,</i>
<i>there’s really no way</i>

00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:04.576
<i>to survive this game</i>
<i>without killing.</i>

00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:06.112
GIRL: Excuse me,

00:10:06.145 --> 00:10:08.584
but are you planning
to get on that elevator?

00:10:08.617 --> 00:10:09.819
[ominous music playing]

00:10:09.853 --> 00:10:11.355
I realize you don’t know me,

00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:14.261
but it’s only fair to warn you
that if you don’t want to die,

00:10:14.294 --> 00:10:17.167
then the smartest choice is
to stay away from that thing.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.202
‐ Huh?

00:10:18.236 --> 00:10:20.541
What’s a little kid like you
doing in here?

00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:22.612
‐ I’m a first‐year
middle‐school student,

00:10:22.645 --> 00:10:23.914
thank you very much.

00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:26.318
Are you trying
to pick a fight with me?

00:10:26.352 --> 00:10:27.722
[elevator bell dings]

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:29.358
Oh, that’s your cue.

00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:31.095
Walk into the deathtrap,
if you want.

00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:33.567
‐ Listen, obviously
I don’t wanna die.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.638
I just want out of this place.

00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:38.409
The stairs are blocked off,
so there’s no other way.

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:39.579
‐ I can’t believe anyone

00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:41.516
would be desperate enough
to set foot in there.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.386
‐ I mean, just look at him.
‐ At who?

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:44.556
[gasps]

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:47.528
What are those things,
more plants?

00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:49.164
‐ Now it’s confirmed
that all four

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:51.402
of this building’s elevators
are dangerous.

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:53.339
You see why I warned you?

00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:54.374
There’s no way of knowing

00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:56.278
how many people
are inside this hotel,

00:10:56.312 --> 00:10:58.817
but at this point,
we’re all trapped like rats.

00:10:58.851 --> 00:11:00.053
The plants holding us in

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.157
are clearly the product
of a player’s Sigil.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.029
‐ You mean one person
has the power to do all this?

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:06.867
When I looked
at the camera before,

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.471
it showed at least 10 people
were inside the building.

00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:11.843
‐ The moment
the event went live,

00:11:11.877 --> 00:11:14.983
I believe there were
25 players in here.

00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:18.790
But now, with the exception of
ourselves and whoever did this,

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:21.863
the chances of anyone else still
being alive are slim to none.

00:11:21.897 --> 00:11:25.905
Which is why I have a proposal
for you, Kaname Sudo.

00:11:25.938 --> 00:11:27.508
Since we’re in the same boat,

00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:29.846
let’s team up
until we escape the hotel.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:32.050
‐ What? How do you
know who I am?

00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:34.722
‐ That’s not important
right now.

00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:37.093
My name is Rein,
though the other D‐Game players

00:11:37.127 --> 00:11:39.933
typically refer to me
as the Analyst.

00:11:42.638 --> 00:11:44.709
[crowd cheering]

00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:46.613
HOST: Wow!
The event’s just begun,

00:11:46.646 --> 00:11:48.884
and things are
already getting intense!

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:51.488
Let’s see the current rankings!

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:53.326
As of now, the player
with the most points

00:11:53.359 --> 00:11:55.129
is Shuka,
the Undefeated Queen!

00:11:55.163 --> 00:11:57.300
She’s collected
six rings so far,

00:11:57.334 --> 00:11:59.471
worth a total of 1,900 points.

00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:00.574
Though her winning streak

00:12:00.608 --> 00:12:02.745
was recently broken
after 49 battles,

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:05.450
the Queen is still
a force to be reckoned with!

00:12:05.483 --> 00:12:07.655
And now
our second‐place competitor.

00:12:07.688 --> 00:12:09.859
Viewers bet on him 8‐to‐1
during the first stage,

00:12:09.892 --> 00:12:11.630
so he’s heavily favored to win!

00:12:11.663 --> 00:12:13.266
Meet Wang,
leader of the Eighth Clan!

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:16.405
With five rings in hand, he’s
running a little behind Shuka,

00:12:16.438 --> 00:12:19.612
but his highly capable clan
now has 18 rings all together!

00:12:19.646 --> 00:12:23.587
You can tell by the smirk on his
face that Shibuya is his turf!

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.760
Third place and below seem to be
a free‐for‐all at the moment,

00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:29.699
but there’s been major drama
at Shibuya Central Tower,

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:32.003
one of the starting points
of the event.

00:12:32.037 --> 00:12:35.544
Check it out! The tower’s
being taken over by plants!

00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:37.815
That’s gotta be the work
of a pretty powerful Sigil!

00:12:37.848 --> 00:12:39.151
Oh, man.
I wonder what’s goin’ on

00:12:39.184 --> 00:12:40.754
with the players
who are trapped inside?

00:12:40.788 --> 00:12:41.756
THEMIS: Hello.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.660
It’s your first time here, yes?

00:12:43.694 --> 00:12:47.233
Wonderful. I hope
you’re profiting so far.

00:12:48.503 --> 00:12:49.939
MAN: That’s kind of you, miss,

00:12:49.973 --> 00:12:51.543
but I only just arrived.

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:53.914
Uh, would you mind
telling me your name?

00:12:53.947 --> 00:12:55.684
‐ I’m sorry. How rude of me.

00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:58.022
I’m Themis,
and I’m the manager of Trinity.

00:12:58.055 --> 00:12:59.592
It’s nice to make
the acquaintance

00:12:59.626 --> 00:13:01.563
of such
a distinguished gentleman.

00:13:01.596 --> 00:13:03.767
‐ The pleasure is all mine,
miss.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.869
HOST: All right!

00:13:04.902 --> 00:13:07.273
Now this is gonna be
an interesting matchup!

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:10.079
Four Gyro Heads
are honing in on Shuka

00:13:10.113 --> 00:13:11.248
to force her into a battle!

00:13:11.281 --> 00:13:13.052
They’ve got their work
cut out for them...

00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:15.223
‐ This chick is tough,
‐ even in a 4‐on‐1 fight,

00:13:15.256 --> 00:13:17.093
‐ but let’s wish them luck!
‐ Surround her!

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.302
[grunts]

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:22.203
[yells]

00:13:22.237 --> 00:13:25.109
‐ Boss, look above you!
‐ Drop dead, bitch!

00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:25.978
[gags]

00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:28.115
[stirring music playing]

00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:30.186
[metal clinks]

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.192
‐ Kayama, get her!

00:13:33.225 --> 00:13:34.127
‐ On it!

00:13:35.096 --> 00:13:36.866
‐ [energy surges]
‐ You’ll pay!

00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:41.108
<i>Yes, perfect timing.</i>
<i>She’s all ours now.</i>

00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:42.511
KAYAMA: <i>My Sigil,</i>
<i>Greedy Missile,</i>

00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:45.183
<i>lets me control the trajectory</i>
<i>of any flying object,</i>

00:13:45.216 --> 00:13:47.354
<i>so she won’t</i>
<i>be able to dodge it.</i>

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.561
‐ [gasps]
‐ [gasps]

00:13:58.242 --> 00:14:00.814
‐ Since the rings I’m carrying
give away my location,

00:14:00.848 --> 00:14:03.219
I keep getting accosted
by casuals.

00:14:04.756 --> 00:14:06.225
I’m guessing Kaname spawned

00:14:06.258 --> 00:14:08.362
in that tall building
over there.

00:14:08.396 --> 00:14:09.832
Well, even without my help,

00:14:09.866 --> 00:14:12.003
I’m sure this treasure hunt’ll
be a breeze for him.

00:14:12.037 --> 00:14:13.607
With his skills,
I wouldn’t be surprised

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.143
if he had 10 rings by now.

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:17.480
‐ [crowd murmurs]
‐ There you have it, folks,

00:14:17.515 --> 00:14:18.550
instant domination!

00:14:18.583 --> 00:14:20.754
That’s why they call her
the Undefeated Queen!

00:14:20.788 --> 00:14:22.725
What a great battle!

00:14:22.758 --> 00:14:24.061
‐ That was incredible.

00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:27.333
This country’s top‐ranked player
is formidable, indeed.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:30.239
WOMAN: If she were a man,
she’d be a good candidate.

00:14:30.273 --> 00:14:33.112
‐ That was awfully exciting
to watch, don’t you think?

00:14:33.145 --> 00:14:36.018
A lovely balance
of class and cruelty.

00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:38.322
And you can tell
she’s mastered her ability.

00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:41.495
After what I’ve seen so far,
I have to admit I’m fond of her.

00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:43.934
MAN: I’m intrigued by D‐Game.

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:47.273
Specifically, I find the Sigils
to be quite remarkable.

00:14:47.307 --> 00:14:50.914
By the way, Themis,
I understand the sponsor

00:14:50.948 --> 00:14:54.087
has given you the privilege
of running this casino,

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:57.460
but do you know the true nature
of this fascinating game?

00:14:57.494 --> 00:14:59.766
‐ No. But if you ask me,

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:01.770
I don’t think
it’s of any significance.

00:15:01.803 --> 00:15:06.078
There are large sums of money
and various Sigils to be won,

00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:08.817
and the feeling of superiority
that comes with them

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.388
is an irresistible treat
to the participants.

00:15:11.422 --> 00:15:14.762
Our modern society is
much fairer and more abundant

00:15:14.796 --> 00:15:16.766
than it was many years ago,
after all.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.639
As a result,
people crave the opportunity

00:15:19.672 --> 00:15:21.543
to look down upon someone else.

00:15:21.576 --> 00:15:22.878
I believe that desire

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:25.216
is more rampant now
than it’s ever been.

00:15:26.418 --> 00:15:27.555
KANAME: Analyst?

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:28.824
‐ Well, simply put,

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:31.295
you can consider me
an information broker.

00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:33.700
Now then, what do you
think of my proposal?

00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:35.571
If we try to go it alone,

00:15:35.604 --> 00:15:39.144
we’ll probably suffer
the same fate as this man did.

00:15:39.177 --> 00:15:41.014
‐ I’m guessing these came
from the same place

00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:43.119
as the plants that are
blocking off the stairwells.

00:15:43.152 --> 00:15:45.123
‐ It’s the same Sigil,
that’s for sure.

00:15:45.156 --> 00:15:47.460
With the stairs obstructed,
the elevators

00:15:47.494 --> 00:15:50.099
became the only way
to move between floors,

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:52.470
so the user
set traps inside them.

00:15:52.505 --> 00:15:55.309
‐ And since both of us have
been backed into a corner,

00:15:55.343 --> 00:15:57.247
you’re asking
to join forces with me?

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.886
You’re putting a lot of faith
in a person you just met.

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:01.288
‐ I told you.
I’m in the business

00:16:01.321 --> 00:16:03.392
of buying
and selling information,

00:16:03.425 --> 00:16:06.265
so I know a lot more about you
than you might expect.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:09.171
For example, the fact
that your player name

00:16:09.204 --> 00:16:10.574
is the same as your real name

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:13.045
indicates that you’re
a rookie who started solo.

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:15.249
You may not have
a violent nature,

00:16:15.283 --> 00:16:18.022
but with three wins
against high‐ranking players,

00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:20.259
you’ve attracted
a great deal of attention.

00:16:20.293 --> 00:16:22.197
Also, you’re not in a clan,

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.836
but you’ve just entered
an alliance with Shuka.

00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:27.040
Your Sigil has yet
to be identified,

00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:28.209
but there are confirmed reports

00:16:28.242 --> 00:16:30.346
that you’ve produced
a handgun and a stun gun

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:33.485
out of thin air
on separate occasions.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.791
‐ Your info’s
not up to date, though.

00:16:35.824 --> 00:16:38.229
My winning streak’s over now,

00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:40.767
thanks to that dude
holding the machine gun.

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:42.437
‐ But we’re
in Battle Royale Mode,

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.476
so individual encounters
don’t influence your record.

00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:47.380
When the event’s done,
dead players’ points

00:16:47.413 --> 00:16:49.317
are distributed
among the survivors.

00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:51.856
‐ So there’s no incentive
for fighting.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:52.892
That’s even more reason

00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:55.463
to avoid the other players
at all costs.

00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:58.269
Works great for me, though,
since I’m kind of a coward.

00:16:58.302 --> 00:17:00.206
‐ Not that I’m
particularly interested

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:01.441
in soothing your insecurities,

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:03.747
but I don’t think
running away is cowardly.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.320
That’s the only reason I’ve been
able to survive for so long.

00:17:07.353 --> 00:17:08.623
‐ [gasps]

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:12.665
[laughs]

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.134
Yeah, you’ve got a point there.

00:17:14.167 --> 00:17:15.804
‐ Sorry, did I
say something funny?

00:17:15.837 --> 00:17:18.409
‐ It’s just all the other
players I’ve met so far

00:17:18.442 --> 00:17:20.948
have been bloodthirsty killers,
so you threw me for a loop.

00:17:20.981 --> 00:17:22.718
All right, fine. Let’s team up.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:25.323
There’s no way I’ll let myself
get killed by stupid plants.

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:27.761
‐ I’m happy to hear that.

00:17:27.795 --> 00:17:28.897
[sighs]

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.634
One more thing.

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:32.136
You laughed at me a moment ago

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.907
when I talked
about running away,

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.243
but out in the real world,

00:17:35.276 --> 00:17:38.550
that’s a far more common
survival tactic than fighting.

00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:41.990
Even in D‐Game, with matches
that have to be judged,

00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:43.158
the avoidance of danger

00:17:43.192 --> 00:17:45.463
is graded based
on its artistic value.

00:17:45.496 --> 00:17:47.935
Typically, the player
who gets challenged to a fight

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:49.371
and survives is the winner.

00:17:49.404 --> 00:17:52.611
Banda, the first opponent
you ever faced,

00:17:52.645 --> 00:17:57.153
was equipped with an extremely
useful Sigil known as Stealth.

00:17:57.186 --> 00:18:00.059
Sigils that help you escape
or ambush the other player,

00:18:00.092 --> 00:18:02.898
rather than deal damage,
are few and far between.

00:18:02.932 --> 00:18:06.438
Still, he went out
of his way to attack you,

00:18:06.471 --> 00:18:08.910
only to have the rug
pulled out from under him.

00:18:08.944 --> 00:18:11.582
‐ You’re making it sound
a lot more involved than it was.

00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:14.087
I just ran around until he
got himself killed. That’s all.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.493
In the end,
I couldn’t even save my friend.

00:18:17.528 --> 00:18:21.068
Luck is the only reason
I’ve survived so far.

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.607
‐ That may have had
something to do with it, sure.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.911
In a game like this,
having fortune on your side

00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:27.915
might be the best way
to come out on top.

00:18:27.948 --> 00:18:30.019
‐ So the luckiest person
will beat us all?

00:18:30.052 --> 00:18:31.656
‐ No, it’s not like
you started this game

00:18:31.689 --> 00:18:34.327
with some kind of guardian angel
looking after you.

00:18:34.361 --> 00:18:35.797
Instead of giving up right away,

00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:40.339
you ran and ran
and kept running.

00:18:40.373 --> 00:18:42.645
It was only then
that the gun appeared for you.

00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:45.049
‐ [sighs]

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:47.186
You certainly
have a way with words.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.525
So now that we’re teamed up,
how do you propose

00:18:49.558 --> 00:18:51.562
we get out of here
without becoming plant food?

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:54.602
‐ Let’s investigate those vines
in the stairwells first.

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:56.371
If there’s a way
to get through them,

00:18:56.405 --> 00:18:57.741
that would work in our favor.

00:18:57.775 --> 00:18:59.912
‐ Wait. Sorry. Hold on a second.

00:18:59.945 --> 00:19:02.918
‐ You’re seriously going to take
the ring back from that corpse?

00:19:02.951 --> 00:19:05.389
You know,
the moment you pick it up,

00:19:05.423 --> 00:19:06.893
the enemy
will know where you are.

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:08.697
‐ [energy crackles]

00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:12.705
[footsteps shuffling]

00:19:12.738 --> 00:19:15.343
REIN: I’d be careful
about touching anything.

00:19:15.376 --> 00:19:16.846
The plants could be a trap.

00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:18.282
‐ Oh, yeah.

00:19:18.315 --> 00:19:20.787
We’re not getting through here
without a chain saw.

00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:21.956
‐ Don’t have one on you?

00:19:21.989 --> 00:19:23.225
‐ Is that a real question?

00:19:23.258 --> 00:19:26.632
‐ I thought maybe you
could make one with your Sigil.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:29.170
‐ No, the power
isn’t that convenient.

00:19:29.204 --> 00:19:32.043
I can come up with a stun gun
and a handgun.

00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:34.381
Other than that,
don’t get your hopes up.

00:19:34.414 --> 00:19:36.151
‐ That’s good to know.

00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:37.688
‐ You think maybe
we could lower ourselves

00:19:37.721 --> 00:19:39.457
out the window
with a rope or something?

00:19:39.491 --> 00:19:41.094
‐ That could work if this wasn’t

00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:44.034
a 40‐story building
without any balconies.

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:46.271
Hard pass
on falling to my death.

00:19:46.304 --> 00:19:48.409
‐ Then we’ll just have
to search the hotel.

00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:51.682
There are
so many body outlines in here.

00:19:51.716 --> 00:19:53.085
How many people died?

00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:55.657
‐ It’s worse
on the lower floors.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.195
‐ Did that plant‐Sigil guy
do all this?

00:19:58.228 --> 00:20:01.001
‐ He’s not responsible
for the dead upstairs.

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.705
That chaos was all due

00:20:02.738 --> 00:20:04.975
to players fighting
each other over rings.

00:20:05.009 --> 00:20:08.248
‐ Our only real goal here is
to collect those stupid things.

00:20:08.282 --> 00:20:10.486
It’s not necessary
for us to kill each other.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.858
‐ Sure, but dead players
can’t attack

00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:14.461
and take whatever you’ve found.

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:17.467
‐ I see. And whoever
ended up surviving this

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.939
was immediately killed
by the plant guy.

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:21.408
What a mess.

00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:24.013
You know who’s responsible
for this, don’t you?

00:20:24.047 --> 00:20:25.449
‐ I don’t know his real name,

00:20:25.483 --> 00:20:28.322
and as far as I know,
no one’s ever seen him before.

00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:29.992
But there’s only one player

00:20:30.025 --> 00:20:32.531
who can murder
on a wide scale like this,

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:34.602
especially given
the distinctive corpses

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:37.340
left behind in the wake
of his devastation.

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:40.714
They call him the Florist.

00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:43.753
He sets traps for his prey and
waits for them to get caught

00:20:43.787 --> 00:20:46.893
instead of attempting to defeat
them in a head‐to‐head battle.

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:48.495
I suppose that we’re safe

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.669
as long as we stay
on the upper floors.

00:20:51.702 --> 00:20:54.374
As far as I can tell,
the Florist only killed

00:20:54.407 --> 00:20:56.679
the people who tried
to take the elevators.

00:20:56.712 --> 00:20:57.981
‐ Okay.

00:20:58.015 --> 00:21:01.154
Wait. There’s something
that isn’t adding up here.

00:21:01.188 --> 00:21:02.958
Why do you think
that’s the case?

00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:05.229
How do we know he killed them?

00:21:05.262 --> 00:21:06.532
‐ The body in the elevator

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:08.202
was covered in his plants,
remember?

00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:10.406
‐ Yeah, exactly,
so why didn’t it disappear

00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:12.544
and leave behind
the usual pop‐art outline?

00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:14.414
‐ I haven’t checked
every corpse,

00:21:14.447 --> 00:21:17.120
but there’s usually a lag time
of several seconds or minutes

00:21:17.153 --> 00:21:18.523
before the bodies teleport away.

00:21:18.556 --> 00:21:20.694
‐ I got a bad feeling
about this.

00:21:20.727 --> 00:21:22.497
If they haven’t
been taken away by now,

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:26.404
then that means
they’re still alive, right?

00:21:27.508 --> 00:21:29.077
Damn it!

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.881
Hurry up!
They’re coming after us!

00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:34.053
‐ Wait. Who? You mean
the players from the elevators?

00:21:34.087 --> 00:21:36.258
If they’re still alive,
then they’re the kind of players

00:21:36.291 --> 00:21:37.426
who were murdering
from the start!

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.397
They might work together
to attack us!

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.001
‐ Just perfect. Either way,

00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:43.438
they’re not gonna be
extending an olive branch!

00:21:43.472 --> 00:21:44.909
‐ Get behind the right pillar!

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:49.952
Keep down. Cover your ears.

00:21:49.985 --> 00:21:51.823
[loud hum]

00:21:53.392 --> 00:21:55.496
[Japanese music playing]

00:21:58.068 --> 00:21:59.437
‐ What was that?

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.540
‐ A flashbang grenade.

00:22:00.574 --> 00:22:02.276
It’s an essential item
for any player

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.412
who chooses flight over fight.

00:22:03.445 --> 00:22:04.982
They sell them by the dozen

00:22:05.015 --> 00:22:06.418
in the D‐Game shop.

00:22:08.288 --> 00:22:09.959
‐ Why have they
teamed up against us?

00:22:09.992 --> 00:22:11.963
I thought they were goners.

00:22:11.996 --> 00:22:13.198
‐ The Florist must have a way

00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:14.835
of controlling them somehow.

00:22:17.306 --> 00:22:20.246
Certain plants do have
narcotic properties to them.

00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:22.383
He may be able
to brainwash the corpses

00:22:22.416 --> 00:22:23.620
with drugs
that they’re producing.

00:22:23.653 --> 00:22:25.322
‐ You’ve gotta be kidding.

00:22:26.526 --> 00:22:29.598
No good. It looks like they’re
headed straight for us.

00:22:29.632 --> 00:22:31.836
How do they even know
where we are?

00:22:31.869 --> 00:22:33.973
It’s not like we have
any rings they can search for.

00:22:34.007 --> 00:22:36.812
‐ Is it possible the plants
have formed some kind of network

00:22:36.846 --> 00:22:38.550
that allows them
to track our movements?

00:22:38.583 --> 00:22:42.156
‐ Now we’re getting into
a whole other type of crazy.

00:22:42.189 --> 00:22:43.526
But if that’s the case,

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.298
I don’t even see
any plants around here.

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:48.068
[gasps]

00:22:48.101 --> 00:22:49.605
So that’s what’s going on.

00:22:49.638 --> 00:22:50.840
I should have figured it out

00:22:50.874 --> 00:22:51.676
from the very beginning.

00:22:51.709 --> 00:22:54.280
All the players
I’ve fought so far

00:22:54.314 --> 00:22:55.382
have either been nut cases

00:22:55.416 --> 00:22:57.654
or complete and
total psychopaths,

00:22:57.688 --> 00:23:00.694
but at least they put
their own lives on the line

00:23:00.727 --> 00:23:02.463
and did their dirty work
themselves!

00:23:02.496 --> 00:23:04.367
This Florist is just a coward.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.541
He’s nothing but a spectator
hiding in the shadows!

00:23:07.574 --> 00:23:10.145
‐ Of course. The cameras.

00:23:10.179 --> 00:23:11.314
The Florist must be

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:13.118
in the security room.

00:23:13.151 --> 00:23:14.487
‐ Yeah, and I’m gonna find him

00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:16.124
and get a good look at his face.

00:23:16.157 --> 00:23:17.995
You hear that,
you voyeuristic asshole?

00:23:22.103 --> 00:23:25.009
FLORIST: So you figured it out.

00:23:25.042 --> 00:23:26.612
I’m impressed.

00:23:26.646 --> 00:23:29.350
However, I sincerely doubt

00:23:29.384 --> 00:23:31.756
you’ll be able
to turn the tables against me.

00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:35.396
After all, this entire hotel
is my garden now.

00:23:35.429 --> 00:23:37.133
There’s no way out for you two.

00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:41.642
Still, I’m pleased to have
a worthy enemy in you, boy.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.986
It makes me feel
a little less guilty.

00:23:48.221 --> 00:23:50.694
KANAME: <i>Next time: "Fireworks."</i>
