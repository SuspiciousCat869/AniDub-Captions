WEBVTT

00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:08.016
[water flowing]

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.389
KANAME: Uh, Shuka?
I have several questions,

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:14.395
but let’s start with,
"Why are you naked?"

00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:15.632
[gasping]

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.134
‐ It’s simple.

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:19.138
I didn’t want
my outfit to wrinkle.

00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:21.877
‐ And you don’t own any pajamas?

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:23.013
‐ What’s your problem?

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:24.983
Even with the help of my Sigil,

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:27.354
it was a real chore
to carry you back here.

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:29.025
And after
I bandaged your wound,

00:00:29.058 --> 00:00:31.830
I was too tired
to put on anything else.

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:33.868
‐ Oh. Well,
thanks for your help, then.

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.372
‐ Uh‐huh.
‐ Now here’s my next question.

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:40.147
That little comment you made
about us "making a family,"

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.684
can you elaborate, please?

00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:42.819
‐ Oh, let me show you.

00:00:42.852 --> 00:00:45.157
Ta‐da! I’ve decided
it’s about time

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.428
for me to start
a clan of my very own.

00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:50.000
See, in Darwin’s Game,
the clans are like families.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.037
No, they’re actually
closer than families.

00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:53.139
They’re sworn companions!

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:55.979
‐ Oh. That makes
a lot more sense.

00:00:56.012 --> 00:00:57.816
So it’s basically like
any other online game,

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.118
where you can join
guilds and stuff.

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:00.254
‐ Huh?
‐ [gasps]

00:01:00.287 --> 00:01:03.093
‐ What, did you think
I meant something different?

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:04.796
‐ [stammers]

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.034
‐ [giggles]

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.370
‐ [stammers]

00:01:08.403 --> 00:01:10.040
Uh, whatever!

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:11.777
Just put your dress on!

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.714
[Japanese music playing]

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.671
KANAME: So, if you use
that shelter item,

00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:50.975
then no one can
challenge you to a match?

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.411
That sounds
pretty handy.

00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:55.017
‐ All the experienced
players use them.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.087
It costs 10 points,
but it means your name

00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:58.958
won’t be on the Class Match
competitor list

00:02:58.991 --> 00:02:59.960
for a whole week.

00:02:59.993 --> 00:03:02.231
‐ Ten points for just a week?

00:03:02.264 --> 00:03:04.435
But I’ve only
got 40 to my name!

00:03:05.404 --> 00:03:07.007
‐ You should have earned
quite a few more

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.243
for defeating me, though.

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:10.080
‐ Oh. Wow, you’re right.

00:03:10.113 --> 00:03:11.950
I’m at 639.

00:03:11.984 --> 00:03:13.053
Thank goodness.

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:14.856
That’ll buy me
a whole lot of shelters.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.129
‐ I wouldn’t spend all my points
on them, though.

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:19.833
See, they don’t prevent
other players

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.438
from approaching you in person
for an Encounter Battle.

00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:24.876
You can also convert
your points into cash,

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.513
but I would do that sparingly.

00:03:26.547 --> 00:03:27.448
‐ Oh, okay.

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:31.690
Well. I’ll use 10 points
right now as a test.

00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:34.361
‐ Anyway...

00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:36.834
you never gave me an answer.

00:03:43.113 --> 00:03:44.081
‐ [chuckles]

00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:45.083
I’ll do it.

00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:47.421
Let’s start our own clan.

00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:50.795
It’ll be good for me
to have an ally in this game.

00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:53.066
‐ Really? I’m so glad!

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.270
But let’s start
by being friends, ’kay?

00:03:55.303 --> 00:03:56.439
‐ Didn’t you say clans

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:58.744
were supposed to be
closer than family?

00:03:58.778 --> 00:04:01.349
‐ Yeah, but you have to be
level B2 or higher

00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:03.521
to create one,
so you can’t do it yet.

00:04:03.554 --> 00:04:05.858
You just keep working hard,
Kaname.

00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:06.927
You’ll get there.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.531
Wait a minute. Your rank is A4,

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:11.035
so you could
establish it yourself,

00:04:11.068 --> 00:04:12.772
‐ couldn’t you?
‐ Nope.

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:15.444
I mean, I could,
but with things like this,

00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:17.549
the man should take the lead.

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:18.651
‐ Huh?

00:04:18.684 --> 00:04:19.586
‐ Okay!

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:21.623
Keep an eye out
for a friend request from me!

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:23.794
I’ll text you again
tonight, too.

00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:24.996
‐ Sounds good.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.733
I’ll talk to you later on.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:27.769
‐ [giggles]

00:04:31.743 --> 00:04:33.346
[laughs]

00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:37.254
<i>‐ Man,</i>
<i>that apartment was fancy.</i>

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:38.524
<i>I guess if I was that loaded,</i>

00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:40.928
<i>I wouldn’t care about</i>
<i>cashing my points, either.</i>

00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:44.936
<i>But then why is she</i>
<i>playing this game?</i>

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.074
<i>It doesn’t seem</i>
<i>like she got sucked into it</i>

00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:48.944
<i>against her will like me.</i>

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:51.282
<i>Eh, it’s none of my business.</i>

00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:54.288
<i>Well, I’d better</i>
<i>find my scooter.</i>

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.831
<i>Oh, great. That factory</i>
<i>is really far away.</i>

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.906
<i>And I don’t have</i>
<i>money for a taxi.</i>

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:04.108
[entry bell chimes]

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:08.784
<i>Okay. I think I’ve got about</i>
<i>50,000 yen left in the bank.</i>

00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:10.353
<i>What?</i>

00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:12.424
<i>It went up to a whole million!</i>

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:16.165
<i>The 10 points I cashed in</i>
<i>must have already posted!</i>

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.535
<i>Wow.</i>

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.238
<i>So this is what you get</i>

00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:20.842
<i>for playing a game</i>
<i>of life or death.</i>

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:25.317
<i>But still, if you die, then who</i>
<i>cares how much money you have?</i>

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.089
<i>Damn it!</i>

00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:29.860
[cell phone buzzes]

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:32.866

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:36.472
<i>Leave me alone already,</i>
<i>you stupid game.</i>

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:45.725
‐ [deep breath]

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:50.033
[grunts]

00:06:00.287 --> 00:06:01.590
You’re mine!

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:03.994
[groans]

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:12.745
[moans]

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:13.714
[sighs]

00:06:13.747 --> 00:06:16.520
I was expecting
a punch there at the end.

00:06:16.553 --> 00:06:19.793
You sure know
how to keep me on my toes.

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:22.732
Say, you’re not the one

00:06:22.765 --> 00:06:26.072
who murdered those 12 people
in Shibuya, are you?

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:28.476
At first, I thought a couple
of flunkies from the Eighth

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.679
might have done it,

00:06:29.713 --> 00:06:32.719
but apparently they think
my clan’s responsible.

00:06:32.752 --> 00:06:34.656
The whole thing’s
a pain in the ass,

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:38.062
but I gotta say I’m eager
to know who the culprit is.

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:42.739
You’re capable of taking down
a dozen people at once, right?

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:44.910
On the other hand,

00:06:44.943 --> 00:06:47.447
it could have been somebody
none of us even know.

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:50.453
I heard that rookie hunter
in the animal costume

00:06:50.487 --> 00:06:53.627
was beaten
by a brand‐new player.

00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:55.765
Recently people
are getting notifications

00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:58.102
for special events
coming up, too.

00:06:58.136 --> 00:06:59.539
And what that tells me is

00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:01.944
this game’s
about to change again.

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:16.339
KANAME: <i>She said to meet</i>
<i>at the Moyai Statue.</i>

00:07:16.372 --> 00:07:17.909
<i>I think this is it.</i>

00:07:17.942 --> 00:07:20.313
<i>Not sure why it’s covered</i>
<i>with a sheet, though.</i>

00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:22.317
‐ Yoo‐hoo, Kaname!

00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:25.290
Have you been waiting
for me long?

00:07:25.323 --> 00:07:27.294
‐ Oh, no.
Actually, I just got here.

00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:29.666
‐ Okay! Our first date is a go!
‐ Huh?

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.770
Hey! Hold on!
You’re supposed to tell me

00:07:31.803 --> 00:07:34.074
about that event notification
we received.

00:07:34.108 --> 00:07:35.645
‐ Did you forget?
‐ Huh?

00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:38.917
‐ The stage for that event
is right here in Shibuya,

00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:42.424
so it’s a good idea for us
to get the lay of the land.

00:07:42.457 --> 00:07:44.294
‐ All right, fine.

00:07:44.328 --> 00:07:45.665
Where are we heading?

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:48.771
‐ First stop is Yoyogi Park.
Ever been there?

00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:50.941
‐ No. But I don’t understand

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:53.446
what that has to do
with Darwin’s Game.

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:54.949
‐ Before we talk
about anything else,

00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:57.622
I need you to stop broadcasting
our situation like that.

00:07:57.655 --> 00:07:59.024
Do I make myself clear?

00:07:59.058 --> 00:08:02.097
Otherwise, it could result
in "game over" for you.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.667
‐ "Game over"?

00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:06.272
You’re saying I could be killed
just for that?

00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:07.809
‐ It’s one of the rules.

00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:10.046
Revealing any information
concerning the game,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.486
regardless of the reason,
is a punishable offense.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.860
All violators
are forcibly teleported.

00:08:16.893 --> 00:08:18.630
‐ Like that guy.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:21.102
His body vanished
piece by piece.

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.441
‐ If you have to mention it when
you’re out in public like this,

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:26.613
it’s safer to refer to it
as "the game."

00:08:26.646 --> 00:08:29.786
Well, some people
call it "D‐Game" too.

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:34.996
‐ D‐Game? D as in "Darwin,"
or D as in "death"?

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.098
Either way, it works.

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:37.735
‐ You should be extra careful

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:39.906
when you’re in Shibuya
right now too,

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:42.010
and not just because
they announced an event.

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:45.584
You saw the blue sheet covering
the Moyai Statue, didn’t you?

00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:47.688
‐ Yeah?

00:08:47.722 --> 00:08:50.193
‐ Something D‐Game‐related
happened there yesterday,

00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:52.632
and 12 people ended up dead.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:53.967
Shibuya’s also home

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.805
to a dangerous clan
known as Eighth,

00:08:55.838 --> 00:08:57.675
and they’ve got
a whole lot of members,

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:00.313
so you have to watch your back
whenever you’re here.

00:09:00.346 --> 00:09:01.583
‐ That’s good to know.
‐ [chuckles]

00:09:01.616 --> 00:09:02.952
[footsteps shuffling]

00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:04.756
‐ So does this park

00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:06.526
have something to do
with D‐game too?

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.536
‐ Nah, not really. But it is
a popular spot for a date!

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.339
‐ Yeah, should’ve guessed.

00:09:13.372 --> 00:09:14.809
‐ Although there is
one other reason

00:09:14.843 --> 00:09:16.680
I wanted to come here with you.

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:19.017
I don’t know any real details

00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:21.857
about what this whole
Shibuya Treasure Hunt thing is,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.529
but this park is
the biggest place in the area,

00:09:24.562 --> 00:09:26.666
so I have a strong suspicion
that it might play

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.670
an important part
in the event proceedings.

00:09:28.704 --> 00:09:31.375
‐ Hey, why would
you want to play

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:32.979
a dangerous game
like this, Shuka?

00:09:34.114 --> 00:09:37.254
You don’t seem to be short
on cash or anything.

00:09:37.287 --> 00:09:38.991
Do you have some other reason?

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.767
Aw, come on.
A beautiful girl like me

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.538
has to have some secrets.

00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:47.407
Anyway, now that we’re
done eating our crepes,

00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:48.744
let’s go back
toward the station.

00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:50.514
I want to scope out the mall!

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.509
but do we really have time to be
shopping for clothes right now?

00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:06.345
‐ We were in the neighborhood,

00:10:06.378 --> 00:10:09.118
and there’s not much
we can do at the moment anyway.

00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:11.288
Besides, I need
to change up my outfit.

Uh, that’s nice.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.331
It, uh, really suits you.

00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:51.636
It’s cute. You should get it.

Now for the next one!

00:10:57.548 --> 00:10:59.218
‐ Wait. Next one?

00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:00.921
You’re kidding!

‐ Ah, that’s interesting.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.063
You’re absolutely certain

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:07.200

GIRL: All of my predictions
are based on probabilities,

so it’s impossible for me
to fully confirm anything.

00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:19.091
‐ Oh, well.
82% is pretty good odds.

00:11:19.124 --> 00:11:20.159
But you can guarantee

00:11:20.193 --> 00:11:22.632

that my intention is to sell it

it’s worth the price tag.

‐ [sighs] I don’t think that’s
relevant to the conversation.

00:11:54.762 --> 00:11:55.864
I’m much more interested

something more useful

Let’s have a little chat.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.460
KANAME: Wait! What do you want?

00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:20.333
Are you a player too?

‐ Just shut up and follow me

If you want your phone back,
that is.

Dude, where are you taking me?

00:13:31.355 --> 00:13:33.927
Whatever you want to talk about,
let’s get on with it!

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.898
‐ Wow. You’re way too careless

00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:37.868
with the phone
that has D‐Game on it.

00:13:37.902 --> 00:13:39.639
You really don’t get it, do you?

00:13:39.672 --> 00:13:41.008
<i>‐ I see.</i>

00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:44.582
<i>If he does something in the app</i>
<i>using my phone, then...</i>

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:46.653
‐ Whoa, that freaked you out.

00:13:46.686 --> 00:13:49.358
I bet I can guess what you’re
thinking about right now.

00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:52.932
Don’t worry about me using it.
For some reason,

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:55.336
you can’t play the game
with someone else’s phone.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.975
That said, any player
who lost their phone

00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:59.879
would be totally screwed.

00:13:59.912 --> 00:14:01.549
You’d never know
if you were in a battle.

00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:03.954
You wouldn’t be able
to search for your opponent.

00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:08.095
Worst of all, you couldn’t buy
a shelter to avoid matches.

00:14:08.129 --> 00:14:09.464
With the right connections,

00:14:09.498 --> 00:14:12.070
you might be able to redownload
the game onto another phone,

00:14:12.103 --> 00:14:13.740
but that would be
a major hassle.

00:14:13.774 --> 00:14:16.378
So you’d essentially be dead.

00:14:16.412 --> 00:14:18.015

some more tips.

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:28.169
You’re famous. You know that?

00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:30.039
Everyone’s been
talkin’ about the noob

<i>‐ That panda prick and Shuka?</i>

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.853

00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:39.525
for a solo player to even
survive their first battle,

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:42.497
so when you defeat two famous
players like them in a row,

00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:43.567
you’re obviously gonna start

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.036
makin’ a reputation
for yourself.

00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:46.472
Well, I say, "famous,"

00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:50.046
but the rookie hunter
was just a weird dude.

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:55.056
As for Shuka, that girl’s
a genuine A‐class solo player.

00:14:55.089 --> 00:14:58.062
She achieved that rank
without a single loss.

00:14:58.095 --> 00:15:00.099
She hunted the Roppongi area
so hard,

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:02.605
there are barely
any players left there.

00:15:02.638 --> 00:15:03.907

I gotta challenge you myself!

any reason to fight with you.

00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:13.159
I joined this dumb game
by accident!

00:15:13.192 --> 00:15:14.562
‐ Oh, I see.

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:15.898
You don’t wanna play.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.436
Not much point in me
keeping this, then.

00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:20.106
‐ Whoa, you could’ve
given me some warning!

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:22.076
‐ But the nifty thing
about this app

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.481
is that if you don’t have
a reason to fight,

00:15:24.515 --> 00:15:25.918
it’ll create one for you.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.375
that Danjo’s Boxing Club
has nothing to do with it,

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:14.014
but I’m still looking
into the Eighth Clan.

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:17.153
Their newest member

I don’t have much meaningful
intel on him as of yet,

00:16:20.126 --> 00:16:22.798
but I do know that they
call him "Flame Demon,"

00:16:22.832 --> 00:16:24.702
so he’s probably not our guy.

00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:26.639
The main problem is Wang.

00:16:26.673 --> 00:16:28.577
There’s no dirt on him, either.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.812
Not surprising for a person

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:32.551

I’ll wait ’til she’s here.

00:17:15.804 --> 00:17:18.108
I heard you two

00:17:18.142 --> 00:17:20.046
At first, I was planning

the easy way.

00:17:24.922 --> 00:17:26.526
‐ Forget it.

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:27.493
Don’t get cocky on me

00:17:27.528 --> 00:17:29.932
just because you landed
one good hit.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.936
And I’m not working with Shuka.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:32.972
‐ What the hell?

00:17:33.005 --> 00:17:35.076
You better not be
trying to trick me.

00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:37.413
‐ Don’t let your guard down,
dumb‐ass!

00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:40.353
‐ [electricity crackles]
‐ [screams]

00:17:40.386 --> 00:17:41.522
[groans]

00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:44.695
A stun gun?
Where’d that come from?

00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:45.797
‐ [yells]

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.799
‐ Wait. I get it.

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.335
That’s your Sigil, huh?

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:53.279
‐ Don’t you move!

00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.122
Take one more step,
and I’ll fry this thing!

00:17:58.155 --> 00:17:59.324
‐ How did you...

00:17:59.357 --> 00:18:00.827
‐ Should’ve paid more attention.

00:18:00.861 --> 00:18:04.869
Take your own advice and
keep a closer eye on your phone!

00:18:04.902 --> 00:18:06.338
‐ What? You little...

00:18:06.371 --> 00:18:09.679
Do you think that’s all it takes
to beat me, smart guy?

00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:17.594
[gasps]

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:22.671
‐ We haven’t
officially made a clan yet.

00:18:22.705 --> 00:18:25.309
‐ Yeah, but we’re
still friends, aren’t we?

00:18:27.046 --> 00:18:29.117
‐ So you guys
are working together.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.453
‐ Back off,
or I’ll destroy this,

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:32.290
and you’ll have to fight us
without it.

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:34.695
Your move!

00:18:34.729 --> 00:18:35.631
‐ [sighs]

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:37.768
You...

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.976
Son of a bitch.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.180
Fine!

00:18:44.214 --> 00:18:45.817
You win this time.

00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:47.153
I surrender.

00:18:47.186 --> 00:18:49.725
[cell phone warbles]

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:51.395
‐ [sighs]

00:18:52.463 --> 00:18:54.802
You can have this back now.

00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:56.773
‐ Hey, you in high school?

00:18:56.806 --> 00:18:58.610
‐ Uh, yeah, second year.

00:18:58.643 --> 00:19:00.647
‐ What?
You’re a year older than me?

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:03.820
[sighs] Anyway,
I’m with Danjo Boxing Club.

00:19:03.853 --> 00:19:04.722
Name’s Inukai.

00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:07.360
‐ Why are you acting
all chummy with us now?

00:19:07.393 --> 00:19:08.997
You’re still our enemy.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.034
‐ What’s the harm
in makin’ friends?

00:19:11.068 --> 00:19:13.405
Most D‐Game players
are older than we are.

00:19:13.439 --> 00:19:16.879
And honestly, I’m kind of
ashamed to be a part of a clan.

00:19:16.913 --> 00:19:18.315
You understand, don’t you?

00:19:18.349 --> 00:19:20.787
‐ Yeah, I understand.

00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:21.889
[cell phone chimes]

00:19:21.923 --> 00:19:23.292
KANAME: Oh, that’s me.

00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:25.396
The Treasure Hunt Game,

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:27.467
it starts in less than a minute?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.172
What kind of event
do you think this is gonna be?

00:19:30.206 --> 00:19:31.776
‐ Uh, well, I don’t know.

00:19:31.809 --> 00:19:34.481
This’ll be the first event
that I’ve participated in.

00:19:34.515 --> 00:19:37.220
‐ So you also got
that weird invitation?

00:19:37.253 --> 00:19:38.656
Cool! That makes three of us!

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.296
‐ Wait a minute. So you knew you
were about to be doing an event,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.935
but you started a battle
with somebody anyway?

00:19:44.969 --> 00:19:45.937
You’re stupid.

00:19:45.971 --> 00:19:47.541
‐ Hey! Shut your mouth!

00:19:48.643 --> 00:19:50.212
‐ You’ve got
a good point, though.

00:19:50.246 --> 00:19:52.216
We probably should have
prepared a little more.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:53.318
‐ In what way?

00:19:53.352 --> 00:19:55.590
‐ Like do we need a shovel
to dig holes with?

00:19:55.624 --> 00:19:58.462
INUKAI: Right,
’cause it’s a treasure hunt!

00:19:58.495 --> 00:20:01.636
KANAME: Never mind.
Shibuya’s all concrete, anyway.

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:03.673
INUKAI: Judging by the title,
it doesn’t sound like

00:20:03.707 --> 00:20:07.013
it’s supposed to be
a battle‐royale kinda situation.

00:20:07.046 --> 00:20:08.817
Maybe it’s something peaceful!

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.086
KANAME: That’d be nice.

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:12.090
Whoa! Now what?

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:14.729
‐ Relax.
It’s just teleportation.

00:20:14.762 --> 00:20:15.831
‐ Isn’t that bad?

00:20:15.864 --> 00:20:18.368
‐ I guess this means we’ll be
going our separate ways.

00:20:18.402 --> 00:20:20.239
Try not to die, okay, guys?

00:20:20.272 --> 00:20:22.443
After all, I want to fight you
again sometime.

00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:25.617
‐ Kaname, we might not end up
in the same location,

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.955
so our first priority
will be finding each other.

00:20:27.988 --> 00:20:29.057
‐ Good plan.
‐ [crackle]

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.359
I’ll text you when I‐‐

00:20:30.392 --> 00:20:31.729
[dramatic music playing]

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:34.902
I guess this means
it’s Treasure Hunt time.

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:37.240
Maybe no one’ll get killed.

00:20:37.273 --> 00:20:38.342
Yeah, as if!

00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:40.814
Whatever happens,
it’s gonna be bad!

00:20:40.847 --> 00:20:43.586
‐ Well, that was unexpected,

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.524
but at least I had
the presence of mind

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:47.995
to grab this
before I got teleported away.

00:20:48.028 --> 00:20:49.999
Let’s see here.

00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:51.836
So we’re collecting some rings?

00:20:51.869 --> 00:20:55.443
That seems easy
until you read the fine print.

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:58.683
It says here, for any player
who can’t complete the objective

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.388
of gathering three rings
within the time limit,

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:03.258
the result is "game over."

00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:04.929
The problem is...

00:21:04.962 --> 00:21:07.634
I can’t imagine the management
providing enough rings

00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:09.839
for every player
to get three of them.

00:21:09.872 --> 00:21:12.544
Which means that instead
of a peaceful treasure hunt,

00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:15.584
it’s going to be a vicious
scramble for survival.

00:21:15.617 --> 00:21:18.890
WANG: Slaughtering other people
to save my own skin, eh?

00:21:18.923 --> 00:21:20.760
This could be right up my alley.

00:21:20.794 --> 00:21:24.134
And here in Shibuya,
I got the home‐field advantage!

00:21:24.167 --> 00:21:25.570
Thanks a lot, D‐Game!

00:21:25.604 --> 00:21:28.041
You really are too good to me!

00:21:28.075 --> 00:21:29.344
[laughs]

00:21:29.377 --> 00:21:31.782
<i>‐ No! That’s Wang,</i>
<i>the leader of the Eighth Clan!</i>

00:21:31.816 --> 00:21:34.254
<i>I’m screwed</i>
<i>right out of the gate!</i>

00:21:34.287 --> 00:21:36.191
<i>Then again,</i>
<i>it could be my chance</i>

00:21:36.224 --> 00:21:38.630
<i>to eliminate a key player</i>
<i>early on!</i>

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:41.067
‐ Huh?

00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:42.170
Hey, girlie.

00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:44.040
Tryin’ to get
your death over with fast?

00:21:44.073 --> 00:21:46.846
‐ Actually, no, you’re
the one who’s going to die.

00:21:46.879 --> 00:21:50.119
In fact, the game’s
already over for you.

00:21:50.152 --> 00:21:51.923
‐ Huh?

00:21:51.956 --> 00:21:53.392
[grunts]

00:21:53.425 --> 00:21:54.595
‐ And I get to kill you

00:21:54.628 --> 00:21:56.966
without challenging you
to a real fight!

00:21:56.999 --> 00:21:59.337
That’s 4,000 degrees!

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.143
Now burn, bones and all!

00:22:02.176 --> 00:22:03.847
[energy surges]

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.815
