Don’t I have any other friends

at the station, right?

‐ Sorry, Shinozuka, but I have
no idea why you’re so excited.

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:20.923
Are they about to open
a cool new shop

‐ Nah, this is way better!

It’s that

These things have been
poppin’ up all over Shibuya!

And no one knows
who the artist is.

00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:37.088
Somebody’s carving ’em
into the streets and walls,

one night to finish!

you and Hamada

You must have
a sweet part‐time job then.

another guy, will you?

Actually, wait.
I just remembered.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.986

A free‐to‐play game?

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:32.365
Don’t tell me he got
so wrapped up in this thing

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:33.869
that he’s out skipping school.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.406
‐ Eh, it looks
kinda like spam to me.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.910
I would just ignore it.

00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:40.414
‐ It says right here
that it’s free to play.

00:05:40.448 --> 00:05:42.586
If he liked it that much,
maybe it’s good.

It’s called Darwin’s Game.

whatever you do!

Is it gonna charge me?

for some reason.

you can you return to class?

‐ Not yet.

‐ Okay.

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:20.535
I’ll ride over to your house

everything you need to know.

I’m gonna call an ambulance

00:13:16.594 --> 00:13:18.497
‐ Damn it.
I really screwed this up.

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:19.600
That guy’s still alive,

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:23.541

run away before it’s too late.

with that crazy asshole?

00:13:44.048 --> 00:13:45.952
How did he
turn invisible like that?

00:13:45.985 --> 00:13:48.958
‐ That’s the kind of Sigil
he has, I guess.

00:13:48.991 --> 00:13:52.331
Kaname, this is Darwin’s Game.

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:55.872

but it is not a game.

00:13:55.905 --> 00:13:57.909
Anyway, stop talking.

We did it.

We threw him off our trail.

00:14:28.938 --> 00:14:32.078
That’s it. Just keep
walking away from us.

00:14:33.013 --> 00:14:34.115
Good. He’s gone.

00:14:34.148 --> 00:14:36.252
Now I have the time
to call for an ambulance.

00:14:36.286 --> 00:14:39.993
‐ Don’t bother. You can’t
get ahold of them right now.

00:14:40.027 --> 00:14:42.298
When you’re in Darwin’s Game,
your only connection

00:14:42.331 --> 00:14:44.636
to the outside world
is through the app itself.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.574
I’m screwed.

00:14:46.607 --> 00:14:48.043

00:14:48.076 --> 00:14:50.447
You’re not making any sense.
Just hold on!

00:15:24.015 --> 00:15:25.785
<i>Did he hear that?</i>

00:15:25.819 --> 00:15:28.591
<i>No, I think we’re good.</i>

00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:30.995
<i>He probably can’t hear much</i>
<i>with that mask on.</i>

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:33.668
Sorry. I probably
should have silenced that.

00:15:33.701 --> 00:15:34.970
But I think it’s okay.

00:15:35.003 --> 00:15:36.941
I’m pretty sure he hasn’t
figured out where we are.

00:15:36.974 --> 00:15:39.847
I guess that means my phone
is working, though, huh?

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.318
Man, talk about
the worst timing ever.

00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:45.491

<i>Can all this really be</i>
<i>happening because of this game?</i>

00:15:51.837 --> 00:15:53.340
<i>I saw a snake when it launched.</i>

00:15:53.373 --> 00:15:56.246
<i>Then I got attacked</i>
<i>by a panda mascot</i>

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:58.316
<i>right after a panda</i>
<i>appeared on the screen.</i>

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.391
<i>Is Darwin’s Game causing</i>

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:05.464
<i>"Help"?</i>

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:07.836
<i>This Shuka person,</i>

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.413

Too late to back out now,
silly boy!

00:16:21.296 --> 00:16:24.570
The snake’s already bitten you.
Don’t you remember?

00:16:24.603 --> 00:16:27.274

<i>I guess the search function</i>

Hey, can you move?

00:16:58.236 --> 00:17:00.474
This is our best chance

00:17:00.508 --> 00:17:01.710
‐ Just run, Kaname.

00:17:01.744 --> 00:17:03.313
Forget about saving me.

00:17:03.346 --> 00:17:06.554
I can just lay low on this floor
until the timer runs out.

00:17:06.587 --> 00:17:07.689

00:17:07.722 --> 00:17:09.025
‐ I told you, go!

00:17:09.058 --> 00:17:10.193
You’re the one
who’s fighting him,

00:17:10.227 --> 00:17:12.064
so you’re the only one
who can be found

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.300
by him searching in the app.

00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:16.172
I’m in more danger

00:17:17.943 --> 00:17:20.480
‐ Okay, then. Wait for me here.

00:17:21.917 --> 00:17:23.921
I promise
I’m gonna finish this game

00:17:23.955 --> 00:17:26.192

00:19:14.375 --> 00:19:17.782
so I swiped the gun off
that cop I killed back there!

00:19:17.816 --> 00:19:19.820
I’m pretty smart, ain’t I?

00:19:22.959 --> 00:19:25.397

00:19:28.971 --> 00:19:31.844

00:19:33.446 --> 00:19:35.752
‐ I can see you just fine now!

00:19:36.854 --> 00:19:38.591

‐ [Banda panting]

just run into something?

00:20:23.748 --> 00:20:26.553
‐ There’s a huge dent
in your bumper!

00:20:26.587 --> 00:20:28.056
‐ But I don’t see anything.

00:20:28.089 --> 00:20:29.760
That guy doesn’t look hurt.

00:20:29.793 --> 00:20:32.097
Let’s get going.
We’re gonna be late.

00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:33.601
‐ Yeah, I guess we’re good.

Of all the shitty luck.

00:21:02.859 --> 00:21:03.861
Losin’ to a brat

00:21:03.894 --> 00:21:07.401

how to use his Sigil yet.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.038
[chuckles] Ah, well!

00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:12.645
Darwin’s Game was fun
for a little while, at least.

00:21:12.679 --> 00:21:15.718
Way better
than my boring job any day!

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.655
‐ [gasps]

00:21:17.689 --> 00:21:21.129

in this nightmare

if you can, kid,

00:21:22.431 --> 00:21:25.303
’cause you ain’t ever
gettin’ out of it!

00:21:25.337 --> 00:21:27.642
‐ I don’t understand.
Hold on!

00:21:27.675 --> 00:21:30.147
You have to tell me
what the hell Darwin’s Game is!

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.888
‐ What is it?
Boy, am I glad you asked!

00:21:33.921 --> 00:21:35.190
Once you get used to it,

00:21:35.223 --> 00:21:38.363
there’s nothin’ in the world
that can give you such a rush!

00:21:38.396 --> 00:21:40.400
But like with
everything else in life,

00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:42.672
you won’t know until you try it!

00:21:42.705 --> 00:21:43.607

‐ Yes. Right.

00:22:00.541 --> 00:22:02.177
My friend was
stabbed in the stomach

00:22:02.211 --> 00:22:04.883
by a random attacker. Yes.

00:22:05.818 --> 00:22:07.822
On the third floor
of a parking garage.

00:22:07.856 --> 00:22:10.393
What’s that? No,
I haven’t called the police.

00:22:10.427 --> 00:22:12.297
He’s hurt really badly,

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.401
so please come
as soon as you can!

00:22:14.435 --> 00:22:17.374
Kyoda, I managed
to get ahold of somebody!

00:22:17.407 --> 00:22:18.844
You’re saved!

00:23:10.548 --> 00:23:11.683
In spite of the odds,

00:23:11.717 --> 00:23:14.321
the beginner
still defeated the hunter.

00:23:14.355 --> 00:23:16.492
I’m quite impressed
with you, Kaname.

00:23:16.526 --> 00:23:20.735
I hope we get to play
Darwin’s Game together soon.

<i>Should I tell Shinozuka?</i>

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:56.873
<i>No. I can’t get him</i>
<i>mixed up in this too.</i>

00:23:58.076 --> 00:24:00.948
<i>I still don’t understand</i>
<i>what Darwin’s Game is</i>

00:24:00.982 --> 00:24:03.453
<i>or how this app</i>
<i>is supposed to work.</i>

00:24:04.823 --> 00:24:07.227
<i>There’s a gacha function too?</i>

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.064

<i>Is someone here?</i>

00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:24.996

00:24:27.635 --> 00:24:29.271
[nervous chuckle]

00:24:29.305 --> 00:24:30.841
It’s a gun.

00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:32.645
I hate this game.

00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:34.916
For now...

00:24:34.949 --> 00:24:37.588
I should learn everything I can
about this app.

00:24:38.957 --> 00:24:42.565
If it throws me into
a surprise match like yesterday,

00:24:42.598 --> 00:24:45.170
then I’m definitely
gonna get killed.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.076
All right!

00:24:52.117 --> 00:24:52.919
‐ Hey, Wang!

00:24:52.952 --> 00:24:56.392
I think this loser’s
still conscious.

You’re with Eighth, aren’t you?

00:25:01.435 --> 00:25:03.439
No one picks a fight
with Akita‐kai

00:25:03.473 --> 00:25:04.909
and lives to tell about it!

00:25:04.943 --> 00:25:07.147

00:25:09.018 --> 00:25:11.155
I hate to tell you,

00:25:11.188 --> 00:25:12.792
but it seems you’re laboring

00:25:12.825 --> 00:25:16.032

misconception, underboss.

00:25:16.065 --> 00:25:16.933
‐ [gasps]

00:25:16.967 --> 00:25:20.140

Akita‐kai’s been disbanded,

00:25:20.173 --> 00:25:23.079
seeing as how you’re
the only member left alive.

00:25:23.112 --> 00:25:24.916
‐ [gasps]
‐ Look at that!

00:25:24.949 --> 00:25:28.122
Even your fearless leader’s
been cut down to size.

00:25:28.156 --> 00:25:30.460
‐ Boss, no!

00:25:30.493 --> 00:25:33.901
I swear, I’ll kill you bastards
if it’s the last thing I do!

00:25:33.934 --> 00:25:35.971
‐ With pathetic underlings
like you,

00:25:36.005 --> 00:25:39.278
I’d say the poor guy’s
better off dead anyway.

00:25:39.311 --> 00:25:42.652
If he were still alive, you’d
be cutting your fingers off.

00:25:42.685 --> 00:25:45.457
But don’t worry.
I can take care of that myself.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:46.793
‐ Go ahead and try,

‐ [screams]

00:25:55.978 --> 00:25:57.882
‐ You really went
and did it, Wang.

00:25:57.915 --> 00:26:00.921
Now Shibuya belongs
to the Eighth Clan.

00:26:02.859 --> 00:26:04.763
‐ Don’t celebrate yet, though.

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:07.735
We still have one more loose end
to take care of.

00:26:07.769 --> 00:26:09.304
‐ We know that she
has to be with either

00:26:09.338 --> 00:26:12.612
the Danjo Boxing Club
or the Kanehira Insurance Union,

00:26:12.645 --> 00:26:14.214
so let’s destroy both of them!

00:26:14.248 --> 00:26:16.118
‐ We can’t do that. After all,

00:26:16.152 --> 00:26:18.289
we’re supposed to be clear
about who our enemies are.

00:26:18.322 --> 00:26:21.328
I mean, the Eighth Clan is
a team of righteous heroes

00:26:21.362 --> 00:26:23.032
who protect Shibuya, remember?

00:26:23.065 --> 00:26:25.470
‐ Uh, of course.
Sorry about that, Wang.

00:26:25.504 --> 00:26:27.073
I was way out of line there.

00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:28.476
‐ Anyway...
‐ [gasps]

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.612

00:26:29.646 --> 00:26:31.750
and pick those loose digits up
off the floor.

00:26:31.783 --> 00:26:34.188
I wanna pickle ’em
inside this jar.

00:26:34.221 --> 00:26:37.194
I’m gonna let you boys take
a swig of this stuff tonight

00:26:37.227 --> 00:26:38.496
to celebrate our victory.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.901

00:28:37.635 --> 00:28:39.171
You must be Shuka.

00:28:39.204 --> 00:28:41.175
Are you really here
to give me some information

00:28:41.208 --> 00:28:43.580
about Darwin’s Game?
Because anything helps!

00:28:43.614 --> 00:28:46.853
‐ Yeah, sure, if you convince me
that you’re trustworthy.

00:28:46.886 --> 00:28:48.857
But since you went
to the trouble of meeting me,

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.226
I guess I could answer
one question

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.600
without any conditions.
Go ahead. Ask!

00:28:53.634 --> 00:28:55.838

00:28:55.871 --> 00:28:57.708

Here’s what I wanna know!

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.818
How the hell do you
get out of Darwin’s Game?

00:29:02.852 --> 00:29:04.522
I got wrapped up in this mess

00:29:04.555 --> 00:29:06.025

anything about it!

00:29:06.058 --> 00:29:08.396
‐ Really?
The same question again?

00:29:08.429 --> 00:29:10.668
If you’d actually read
my message yesterday,

00:29:10.701 --> 00:29:11.836
then you’d know
there’s no function

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.172
that allows you
to exit the game.

00:29:13.205 --> 00:29:15.611
‐ No, there has to be
a way to make it stop.

00:29:15.644 --> 00:29:17.147
Games don’t operate like that!

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.521
‐ Don’t blame little old me.
I didn’t design it!

00:29:20.554 --> 00:29:24.361
Look, if you really want
to leave, then just go and die!

00:29:24.394 --> 00:29:27.334
<i>‐ So quitting means</i>
<i>giving up your life?</i>

00:29:27.367 --> 00:29:30.340
Every game in existence
has some kind of off switch.

00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:33.880
I refuse to believe that I’m
trapped here until I die!

00:29:33.914 --> 00:29:35.049
Besides, it’s illegal

00:29:35.083 --> 00:29:37.521
to hold someone captive
against their will!

00:29:37.555 --> 00:29:38.890
And if I can’t escape,

00:29:38.924 --> 00:29:40.995
then how do I survive
from here on out?

00:29:42.097 --> 00:29:43.734
Even if you don’t do anything,

00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:45.871
people hunt you down
and attack you!

00:29:45.904 --> 00:29:48.409
I never agreed
to be part of a sick game

00:29:48.442 --> 00:29:49.846
where I end up getting killed!

00:29:49.879 --> 00:29:52.017
‐ Then you’ll
just have to win it!

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.386
‐ [gasps]

00:29:53.419 --> 00:29:54.822
‐ You kill, you win.

00:29:54.856 --> 00:29:56.091
You win, you live.

00:29:56.125 --> 00:29:58.362
That’s all you want, isn’t it?

00:29:58.396 --> 00:29:59.799
Pretty simple, really.

00:29:59.832 --> 00:30:03.306
‐ What? Are you telling me
I should kill people?

00:30:03.339 --> 00:30:04.174
[gasps]

00:30:04.207 --> 00:30:05.744
All right, look,
if I can’t quit,

00:30:05.778 --> 00:30:06.946
could you at least tell me

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.950
a way to keep people
from coming after me?

00:30:08.984 --> 00:30:11.488
Otherwise, how am I
supposed to sleep at night?

00:30:11.523 --> 00:30:12.758
‐ [laughs]

00:30:12.792 --> 00:30:14.829
Well, I won’t say
there isn’t a way.

00:30:14.862 --> 00:30:17.033
But, as you know,
I won’t spill any more answers

00:30:17.067 --> 00:30:19.872
until I figure out whether
or not I can trust you, Kaname.

00:30:19.906 --> 00:30:21.208
That’s our deal, remember?

00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:23.680
‐ Okay, then how can I
get you to trust me?

00:30:23.714 --> 00:30:26.185
I have no intentions
of hurting you, I promise!

00:30:26.218 --> 00:30:29.458
‐ First off, I want you
to tell me what your Sigil is.

00:30:29.491 --> 00:30:32.364
Then you have to give me
a thorough demonstration.

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:34.368
I can’t be expected
to trust a player

00:30:34.401 --> 00:30:37.140
who doesn’t understand
his own Sigil or how to use it.

00:30:37.173 --> 00:30:39.912
<i>‐ Huh? Sigil?</i>

00:30:39.946 --> 00:30:41.415
<i>What does that mean?</i>

00:30:41.448 --> 00:30:43.219
<i>Some kind of in‐game jargon?</i>

00:30:43.252 --> 00:30:46.425
Look, I don’t even know
what a Sigil is, okay?

00:30:46.458 --> 00:30:47.427
Like I told you,

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.999
I’m totally in the dark
about this entire thing!

00:30:50.033 --> 00:30:52.370
‐ You were bitten
by the Darwin’s Game snake,

00:30:52.404 --> 00:30:53.607
though, weren’t you?

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.778
A Sigil is
a special type of evolution

00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:56.946
that the snake gave you

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.451
to help you battle
opponents in the game.

00:30:59.484 --> 00:31:02.323
‐ Evolution? I’m so confused.

00:31:02.357 --> 00:31:05.998
I had a hallucination of
a snake when this all started,

00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:08.970
but I’m clueless about Sigils.

00:31:09.004 --> 00:31:11.108
‐ That’s impossible.

00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:13.112
Even if nobody
tells you what it is,

00:31:13.145 --> 00:31:15.684
you should be able
to use it instinctually.

00:31:15.718 --> 00:31:18.890
It’s supposed to come to you
as naturally as breathing does,

00:31:18.924 --> 00:31:20.961
as if it’s something
that you’ve been doing

00:31:20.994 --> 00:31:22.531
since the day you were born.

00:31:22.565 --> 00:31:24.000
‐ Maybe it’s like that for you.

00:31:24.034 --> 00:31:26.506
‐ [sighs] Fine.
Whatever, then.

00:31:26.539 --> 00:31:29.411
Sounds like you just haven’t
realized what yours is yet.

00:31:29.444 --> 00:31:30.379
Try checking out

00:31:30.413 --> 00:31:32.885
your detailed personal
profile screen on the app.

00:31:32.918 --> 00:31:36.024
It should tell you which Sigil
was assigned to you.

00:31:36.058 --> 00:31:37.862
<i>‐ What’s she talking about?</i>

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:39.097
<i>This?</i>

00:31:39.131 --> 00:31:42.404
"Kaname Sudo,
one battle, one win.

00:31:42.437 --> 00:31:44.307
Class D3."

00:31:44.341 --> 00:31:47.815
Why does that part say,
"Error: unable to analyze"?

00:31:47.848 --> 00:31:48.917
‐ That can’t be right.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.788
I’ve never heard
of that happening.

00:31:50.821 --> 00:31:52.223
‐ It says right here!

00:31:52.257 --> 00:31:53.627
[gasps]

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.331
‐ Even if you’re
telling the truth,

00:31:56.365 --> 00:31:59.237
I shouldn’t trust a person
who doesn’t know their Sigil,

00:31:59.271 --> 00:32:01.509
so I’m afraid
I can’t help you anymore.

00:32:01.543 --> 00:32:03.713
<i>‐ Uh‐oh. Something tells me</i>

00:32:03.747 --> 00:32:06.485
<i>she isn’t gonna let this end</i>
<i>with a polite goodbye.</i>

00:32:06.519 --> 00:32:08.289
You can trust me! I promise!

00:32:08.322 --> 00:32:10.326
You know I don’t want
to fight, at least!

00:32:10.359 --> 00:32:13.098
‐ Then you won’t mind me seeing
what you have in your backpack.

00:32:13.132 --> 00:32:15.269
As long as you don’t have
any weapons in there,

00:32:15.303 --> 00:32:17.641
I can let you off the hook
this one time.

00:32:17.675 --> 00:32:18.577
‐ [gasps]

00:32:19.912 --> 00:32:21.716
[engine puttering]

00:32:21.749 --> 00:32:24.488
<i>I’m glad I decided to leave</i>
<i>the gun tucked away at home.</i>

00:32:24.522 --> 00:32:27.393
<i>Didn’t want to risk getting</i>
<i>questioned by the police.</i>

00:32:28.663 --> 00:32:31.101
<i>Being unarmed is scary, though.</i>

00:32:31.135 --> 00:32:33.305
<i>Wish I had</i>
<i>some kind of weapon.</i>

00:32:33.339 --> 00:32:36.111
<i>Maybe something</i>
<i>a little more legal.</i>

00:32:37.247 --> 00:32:38.717
[gasps]

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.486
Okay!

00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:42.625
‐ I’m waiting.

00:32:42.658 --> 00:32:44.060
Aren’t you going to show me?

00:32:44.094 --> 00:32:46.198
<i>‐ Well, crap! How do I explain</i>

00:32:46.231 --> 00:32:48.068
<i>the whole month’s worth</i>
<i>of living expenses</i>

00:32:48.102 --> 00:32:50.406
<i>in self‐defense items I have?</i>

00:32:50.439 --> 00:32:53.145
So hypothetically,
how upset would you be

00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:54.715
if I had a very small number

00:32:54.749 --> 00:32:56.986
of extremely minor weapons
inside my bag?

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.155
‐ Well, that settles it.

00:32:58.189 --> 00:33:00.961
The only option left
is to kill you.

00:33:00.994 --> 00:33:03.432
[dramatic music playing]

00:33:03.465 --> 00:33:04.936
<i>‐ That was sudden!</i>

00:33:04.969 --> 00:33:08.175
‐ [metal scrapes]
‐ Say goodbye, Kaname.

00:33:08.209 --> 00:33:10.514
‐ Oh, yeah?
That’s how you wanna play?

00:33:13.319 --> 00:33:14.354
‐ [gasps]

00:33:16.458 --> 00:33:17.427
‐ See you!

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.797
‐ You jerk!

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.268
What kind of man just runs away?

00:33:21.301 --> 00:33:23.640
<i>‐ Like being a man matters</i>
<i>right now! Given the choice,</i>

00:33:23.673 --> 00:33:26.478
<i>I’m probably more afraid</i>
<i>of a girl with a weapon!</i>

00:33:26.513 --> 00:33:29.785
<i>Anyway, I wasn’t expecting that</i>
<i>flashlight to be so intense.</i>

00:33:29.819 --> 00:33:32.591
<i>Talk about</i>
<i>a worthwhile investment!</i>

00:33:32.625 --> 00:33:35.196
[door rattling]

00:33:35.229 --> 00:33:38.202
<i>Ugh. Of course the door</i>
<i>is remote‐controlled!</i>

00:33:38.235 --> 00:33:41.074
<i>Don’t panic. There’s enough</i>
<i>room to slide through!</i>

00:33:41.108 --> 00:33:44.314
<i>Wait. Something’s off,</i>
<i>but what?</i>

00:33:44.347 --> 00:33:46.051
<i>Why do I have</i>
<i>such a bad feeling?</i>

00:33:46.084 --> 00:33:48.557
<i>This is my only escape route.</i>

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.563
[gasps] <i>This is</i>
<i>my only escape route!</i>

00:33:54.635 --> 00:33:56.338
[chain rattles]

00:33:56.371 --> 00:33:57.675
‐ I missed!

00:33:57.708 --> 00:33:59.912
‐ Or you dodged it.
‐ [groans]

00:33:59.946 --> 00:34:02.483
‐ Nice moves, Kaname, but...

00:34:02.518 --> 00:34:04.655
<i>‐ That was close!</i>

00:34:04.689 --> 00:34:06.859
<i>If her vision comes back,</i>
<i>I’m as good as dead.</i>

00:34:06.893 --> 00:34:09.632
<i>All I can do now</i>
<i>is hide somewhere!</i>

00:34:09.665 --> 00:34:12.337
<i>Is there another exit?</i>
<i>Or am I about to be forced</i>

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.609
<i>to fight someone</i>
<i>to the death again?</i>

00:34:19.785 --> 00:34:22.323
‐ Ooh, the game’s back on.

00:34:22.357 --> 00:34:24.829
Let’s make it even more fun.

00:34:29.471 --> 00:34:30.239
<i>‐ Lights?</i>

00:34:30.273 --> 00:34:32.110
<i>Now I’m really out of luck.</i>

00:34:34.649 --> 00:34:36.418
‐ Ah, there you are.

00:34:36.451 --> 00:34:39.391
Just so you’re aware,
all of the doors are locked,

00:34:39.424 --> 00:34:40.961
so there’s no point in trying

00:34:40.994 --> 00:34:42.898
to weasel your way out
of fighting with me.

00:34:42.932 --> 00:34:44.936
‐ [grunts] Shit!

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:46.806
‐ Weren’t you listening?

00:34:46.839 --> 00:34:47.908
It’s impossible!

00:34:47.942 --> 00:34:50.881
Better fight back,
or you’re gonna die!

00:34:50.914 --> 00:34:52.518
You see? [giggles]

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.124
Wow. That was a nice dodge!

00:34:56.158 --> 00:34:57.861
You have some good reflexes.

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:59.397
If I don’t take
this fight seriously,

00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:00.968
you might just stand a chance!

00:35:01.001 --> 00:35:02.605
‐ No way! That was a fluke!

00:35:02.638 --> 00:35:04.609
So why don’t you
ease up on me a bit?

00:35:04.642 --> 00:35:06.980
‐ But if you don’t show me
your Sigil pretty soon,

00:35:07.013 --> 00:35:08.182
I may start getting impatient!

00:35:08.215 --> 00:35:11.288
‐ I told you before I have
no clue what that means!

00:35:11.321 --> 00:35:14.094
It’s time to go
with my last resort!

00:35:15.998 --> 00:35:18.335
‐ Hmm. You brought
a stun gun too?

00:35:18.369 --> 00:35:19.672
‐ [gasps]
‐ Look at you,

00:35:19.705 --> 00:35:21.509
being accidentally clever.

00:35:23.513 --> 00:35:24.280
‐ [gasps]

00:35:24.314 --> 00:35:27.186
‐ Aww. Is this where it ends?

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.659
If so, then I have to say
I’m pretty disappointed.

00:35:29.692 --> 00:35:33.065
<i>‐ Her chains,</i>
<i>they move like snakes.</i>

00:35:33.098 --> 00:35:34.635
‐ I’ve been holding back
this whole time

00:35:34.669 --> 00:35:36.873
in case you decided
to behave reasonably

00:35:36.906 --> 00:35:38.442
and show me your Sigil.

00:35:39.645 --> 00:35:41.148
But forget it.

00:35:41.181 --> 00:35:43.586
I’ll finish you off.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.691
Prepare to die, Kaname.

00:35:47.393 --> 00:35:50.934
<i>‐ "Sigil." Let me think here.</i>

00:35:50.967 --> 00:35:52.838
<i>From the looks of it,</i>
<i>Shuka’s Sigil</i>

00:35:52.871 --> 00:35:55.610
<i>gives her the ability to</i>
<i>control those chains at will.</i>

00:35:56.546 --> 00:35:58.717
<i>And apparently</i>
<i>I was the unlucky sap</i>

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.921
<i>who didn’t get one!</i>

00:36:00.954 --> 00:36:02.223
<i>Oh, this sucks!</i>

00:36:02.256 --> 00:36:05.296
<i>One good smack from</i>
<i>that spiky chain, and I’m dead!</i>

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:08.135
<i>But there’s no way I can</i>
<i>avoid these things forever!</i>

00:36:08.168 --> 00:36:09.805
<i>If she operates ’em</i>
<i>with her mind,</i>

00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:13.045
<i>then it’s only a matter of time</i>
<i>before she lands a hit!</i>

00:36:13.078 --> 00:36:16.819
<i>Ugh. Not only did I get roped</i>
<i>into this without my consent,</i>

00:36:16.853 --> 00:36:19.859
<i>but now a really good player’s</i>
<i>gonna kill me just like that?</i>

00:36:19.892 --> 00:36:21.228
<i>It’s not fair!</i>

00:36:21.261 --> 00:36:23.700
<i>Well, what can I expect?</i>

00:36:23.733 --> 00:36:27.073
<i>Given the circumstances,</i>
<i>I think I did pretty well.</i>

00:36:27.106 --> 00:36:29.244
<i>Nothing else</i>
<i>I could have done, right?</i>

00:36:29.277 --> 00:36:31.014
<i>I don’t accept this.</i>

00:36:31.048 --> 00:36:32.551
[laughs]

00:36:32.584 --> 00:36:34.287
<i>No matter how I feel about it,</i>

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.626
<i>this is reality, and</i>
<i>there’s no way to change it!</i>

00:36:36.659 --> 00:36:39.030
<i>Why even bother</i>
<i>running for my life?</i>

00:36:39.064 --> 00:36:41.001
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

00:36:41.034 --> 00:36:43.472
<i>Yeah, this really is bullshit.</i>

00:36:43.506 --> 00:36:46.278
<i>I’d love to track down the guy</i>
<i>who invented this lousy game</i>

00:36:46.311 --> 00:36:48.015
<i>and put a bullet in his head,</i>

00:36:48.048 --> 00:36:50.453
<i>but that Shuka girl</i>
<i>took all my weapons!</i>

00:36:50.486 --> 00:36:52.991
<i>I’m totally helpless!</i>

00:36:53.025 --> 00:36:54.494
[laughs]

00:36:54.528 --> 00:36:57.601
<i>But let’s be real here.</i>
<i>Even if I had a weapon,</i>

00:36:57.634 --> 00:37:00.172
<i>it’s not like I’d be able</i>
<i>to beat someone like her.</i>

00:37:00.206 --> 00:37:03.646
