[rain pattering]

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:09.720
[music playing]

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:19.171
‐ [music stops]
‐ [gunshot]

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:25.217
‐ That’s better.
He was on my nerves.

00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:31.029
[rain pattering]

00:00:31.062 --> 00:00:33.166
REIN: Yes,
I understand.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.304
But are
you sure about this?

00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:37.742
I thought you were
against Ryuji’s plan.

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:39.412
KANAME: <i>We got here too late.</i>

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:42.919
<i>No, I took too long</i>
<i>to make a decision.</i>

00:00:42.953 --> 00:00:45.692
Once again, I caused
a friend to be killed.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:47.094
[Rein sighs]

00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:48.463
‐ Back me up, you guys.

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:50.902
I’m about to have to use
that privilege I got.

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:52.906
‐ What happened to Shinozuka
was terrible,

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:53.908
but it wasn’t your fault.

00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:56.312
<i>Please, don’t blame yourself.</i>

00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:58.884
‐ That’s easier said
than done, Rein.

00:00:58.918 --> 00:01:00.420
‐ Why are we standing around?!

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:01.757
‐ Let’s waste these gu‐‐
‐ [gunshot]

00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:04.228
KANAME: Sorry.

00:01:04.262 --> 00:01:06.767
I thought I gave you plenty
of reason to shoot me before,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.802
but I guess not.

00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:09.640
Honestly...

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:12.846
my mind wasn’t made up
to kill you until a second ago.

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:15.885
I’d convinced myself the only
reason you guys were murderers

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:17.722
was because you’re in D‐Game.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:21.029
D‐Game forces us
to slaughter each other.

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:24.001
Players do anything it takes
to survive.

00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:25.905
Until now,
if anyone outside the game

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.809
had given me crap
over what I did,

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:29.211
I’d have been ticked off.

00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:31.717
Then I realized
that for you guys,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.288
it wouldn’t have mattered
if we were in a game or not.

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:37.494
Yep. I was thinking
about it all wrong.

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:39.533
Because, when you
get down to it,

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.872
there really is no "inside"
or "outside" D‐Game.

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:46.079
Oh, right.
I have to set it to Clan Battle.

00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:48.450
It’s funny.
I feel like I’ve come so far

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.089
since I started playing,
but this is my first time

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:52.257
initiating a fight.

00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:54.228
RYUJI: Are you ready to do this?

00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:56.834
‐ Yeah. I’ve been so naive.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:59.438
These punks aren’t human at all.

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:02.912
They’re trash, and somebody’s
gonna have to take them out.

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:05.017
You’ll help me do that,
won’t you?

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.989
‐ Don’t have to
ask me twice, Bossman.

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:10.628
‐ [cell phone warbles]
‐ A Clan Battle, then.

00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:11.864
Let’s finish this.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.670
‐ [gasps] Why are you fools
still standing there,

00:02:14.703 --> 00:02:17.007
gawking at him?
Fill them full of lead!

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:18.878
‐ Uh, ye‐‐
‐ [gunshots]

00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:20.682
[bodies thud]

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:22.952
RYUJI: You could at least
leave some for me.

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:26.159
‐ Sorry. They went down a lot
easier than I expected them to.

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:29.933
They’re like babies
compared to Xuelan and Danjo.

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.603
‐ Damn! That’s it, kid!

00:02:31.637 --> 00:02:34.475
I’m about to break you
like the pitiful toy you are!

00:02:36.012 --> 00:02:37.281
Just die, already!

00:02:37.314 --> 00:02:39.686
‐ You always stick
to that same pattern.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.055
‐ [gags]

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.625
What is this thing?

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.228
‐ Shuka, take over.

00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:45.430
‐ Sure. I’ve got this.

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:48.036
Do you want to come
my way, big guy?

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.773
Never mind.
You don’t get a choice!

00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:51.476
‐ [groans] You bitch!

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.712
Go to hell!

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.484
[rock music playing]

00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:59.125
‐ Aw, Kaname wasn’t kidding.

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:01.162
You really are
a one‐trick pony, huh?

00:03:01.195 --> 00:03:04.235
Come on, boy.
Let’s go for a walk!

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.307
I wanted to kill all of you.

00:03:07.341 --> 00:03:08.577
But I don’t even think

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:11.482
that would be enough
to satisfy me now.

00:03:11.517 --> 00:03:13.654
[chains clink]

00:03:13.687 --> 00:03:17.161
I’ll slice you up so thin,
you’ll look like sashimi!

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.131
‐ No, thanks.
That sounds kinda gruesome.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.501
‐ You sure talk a big game

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.572
for somebody
who’s always running away!

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:26.947
‐ [grunts]

00:03:31.122 --> 00:03:32.458
[grunts]

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:36.199
Is that all you got?
I barely felt it!

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:37.569
‐ Surround them!

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:39.506
It’s just two of them
against us!

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.144
There’s no way they can
overpower the Eighth Clan!

00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:44.381
[Ryuji sighs]
They’ve got us cornered.

00:03:44.415 --> 00:03:46.920
Go hide.
You don’t have bulletproof gear!

00:03:46.954 --> 00:03:50.060
‐ It’s fine.
I’ll attack them from the front.

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:50.995
You handle the rest.

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:54.569
‐ Huh?

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:57.609
[blade whistles]

00:03:57.642 --> 00:03:58.778
[gunshots]

00:04:01.182 --> 00:04:02.217
[rock music playing]

00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:03.687
RYUJI: <i>He’s friggin’ crazy.</i>

00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:05.591
<i>Guess he did catch ’em</i>
<i>off guard, though.</i>

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:08.998
Hey, guys, hope you’re
hungry for some bullets,

00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:10.968
’cause I got loads of ’em!

00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:12.337
‐ <i>The hell?</i>

00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.308
<i>What is with this guy?</i>

00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:16.914
<i>We came in here with 10 people!</i>

00:04:16.947 --> 00:04:19.886
<i>It’s not like</i>
<i>he’s super fast or anything.</i>

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.659
<i>And his Sigil isn’t</i>
<i>some extremely deadly attack</i>

00:04:22.692 --> 00:04:24.028
<i>like Wang’s is.</i>

00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:25.464
<i>His only advantages</i>
<i>in this fight</i>

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:27.401
<i>are really good reflexes</i>

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:30.040
<i>and a little bit of talent</i>
<i>for using guns and knives.</i>

00:04:30.073 --> 00:04:31.242
<i>And yet...</i>

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:34.816
<i>he just wiped out</i>
<i>our entire squad!</i>

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.785
[whimpers]

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:38.824
[groans]

00:04:38.858 --> 00:04:40.460
‐ Did we get all of ’em?

00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:42.699
‐ Uh‐huh, we’re finished here.

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:44.435
Let’s go help Shuka.

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:48.644
Time for our final objective,
killing Wang.

00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:49.579
[music stops]

00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:57.227
‐ Where are you,
my little kitten?

00:04:57.261 --> 00:04:59.900
I know you’re hiding
around here somewhere!

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:01.904
Come on out and play with me!

00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:05.210
By the way, I’ve decided
how I’m gonna kill you!

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:07.414
First I’ll chop off
your arms and legs,

00:05:07.447 --> 00:05:09.820
but I won’t let you
bleed out from that!

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:10.822
After I’m finished,

00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:13.059
I’m gonna sit you down
next to your buddy Kaname,

00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:14.596
who got the same treatment,
obviously.

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.502
And then I’ll take turns
corn‐holing the both of you

00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:19.004
’til you finally die!

00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:21.175
That’ll be hours of fun.

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:23.446
‐ You’re one sick
son of a bitch.

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.483
God must have
made you by accident.

00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:27.522
You’re like the crap
he forgot to flush.

00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:30.493
‐ [laughs] Ah,
there you are, kitty cat.

00:05:30.528 --> 00:05:33.266
I did my homework
on you before you got here.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.368
Despite being a woman,

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:36.573
you’ve got the nerve
to be A‐rank like me.

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:38.476
You fight with a pair of chains

00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:40.380
that you control
with your Sigil.

00:05:40.413 --> 00:05:42.384
They call you
the Undefeated Queen,

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:45.290
but your title’s a joke
since Kaname beat you.

00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:47.461
Hey, once you lose to me,
we’ll have to call you

00:05:47.494 --> 00:05:49.866
the Twice‐Defeated Queen,
won’t we?

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.570
‐ Come on.
It’s not like I’m the one

00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:53.406
who decided
to call myself that name.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.479
And Kaname’s special,
so I didn’t mind losing.

00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:59.451
I’m sure my wish will come true
if I can be patient.

00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:01.389
After all, even though
he was a total beginner,

00:06:01.422 --> 00:06:04.128
Kaname completely dominated
during our battle.

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:07.367
He’s the only one
capable of that.

00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:10.106
I knew right away that he was
the man of my dreams.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.879
‐ I don’t want to hear about
your boyfriend, you ditzy bitch!

00:06:12.912 --> 00:06:15.050
‐ Point is, there’s one man
good enough to beat me,

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.187
and it’s not you!

00:06:17.221 --> 00:06:20.561
‐ That lousy Sigil ain’t gonna
save you now, sweetie pie!

00:06:20.595 --> 00:06:23.032
I’ll slice
that pretty face to pieces!

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:25.504
‐ I’m sorry,
but I didn’t quite catch that.

00:06:25.538 --> 00:06:26.907
Try to speak more clearly.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.278
I know you’re upset,
but if you garble your words,

00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:31.182
I can’t understand you.

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:32.184
‐ What the...

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:33.887
[gasps]

00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:35.156
[squelch]

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.599
[screams]

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:42.772
What did you do to my leg,
you little cow? I’ll kill you!

00:06:42.805 --> 00:06:45.511
‐ Oh, goodness.
You must have cut it off

00:06:45.544 --> 00:06:47.782
with your Sigil by accident,
silly boy!

00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:50.688
<i>‐ No. I would never</i>
<i>do anything that clumsy.</i>

00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:53.393
I don’t know how,
but it had to be her.

00:06:53.426 --> 00:06:55.965
Damn it!
Now I’m really gonna kill you

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:57.535
a thousand times over!

00:06:57.568 --> 00:06:59.806
‐ I wish you could see
how funny you look right now.

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.979
Do you actually
expect me to be scared?

00:07:03.012 --> 00:07:06.252
<i>‐ Yeah, yeah, go ahead and</i>
<i>yuck it up, you arrogant whore.</i>

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:08.958
<i>You’re well within my range</i>
<i>from here.</i>

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:11.964
<i>Beelzebub allows me</i>
<i>to control space itself!</i>

00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:14.301
<i>My Sigil is</i>
<i>on a completely different level</i>

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:16.405
<i>than those pathetic chains</i>
<i>you’re using.</i>

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:19.211
<i>First, I’ll jump</i>
<i>two meters above your head.</i>

00:07:19.244 --> 00:07:22.217
<i>While I’m falling, I’ll find</i>
<i>the best opening to attack.</i>

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.256
<i>Then, I can strike</i>
<i>from behind you!</i>

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.192
[gasps]

00:07:27.795 --> 00:07:29.365
[screams]

00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:30.601
How the hell?

00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:32.004
‐ [groaning]
‐ Look at that.

00:07:32.037 --> 00:07:34.909
I can’t believe you
just chopped off another limb.

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:36.580
Keep making
these careless mistakes,

00:07:36.613 --> 00:07:38.851
and you won’t have
a leg to stand on.

00:07:40.855 --> 00:07:44.294
‐ How do you keep doing this
to me without moving?

00:07:44.328 --> 00:07:45.798
It doesn’t make any damn sense!

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.269
‐ Wow, there’s blood everywhere.

00:07:48.303 --> 00:07:50.173
How much can you lose
before it kills you?

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:52.411
<i>‐ Damn it.</i>

00:07:52.444 --> 00:07:53.781
<i>She’s trying</i>
<i>to torture me to death.</i>

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:55.551
<i>I’m the one who’s</i>
<i>supposed to do the torturing,</i>

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:57.020
<i>not the other way around.</i>

00:07:57.054 --> 00:07:59.659
<i>And she’s about to learn</i>
<i>that lesson the hard way.</i>

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:02.164
<i>Still, how did she do that?</i>

00:08:02.197 --> 00:08:04.234
<i>I don’t understand it.</i>

00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:05.905
<i>When my leg</i>
<i>got cut off earlier.</i>

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:08.376
<i>I was over</i>
<i>10 meters away from her!</i>

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:10.280
<i>Even Beelzebub’s</i>
<i>space‐cutting range</i>

00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:12.618
<i>is only about a meter.</i>

00:08:12.652 --> 00:08:15.390
<i>Does that mean this broad</i>
<i>has a space‐slicing ability</i>

00:08:15.423 --> 00:08:17.494
<i>that’s more powerful</i>
<i>than mine is?</i>

00:08:17.528 --> 00:08:19.899
‐ Have you gotten
your tourniquet in place yet?

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:22.204
I mean, you’re about to lose
your other limbs,

00:08:22.237 --> 00:08:23.507
so I guess it doesn’t matter.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.580
‐ Up yours, you bitch!
How dare you make fun of me?

00:08:26.613 --> 00:08:29.284
<i>How am I supposed to stop this?</i>

00:08:29.318 --> 00:08:30.888
<i>I thought</i>
<i>all her Sigil could do</i>

00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:33.026
<i>was control</i>
<i>those stupid chains,</i>

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:33.961
<i>Blood?</i>

00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:36.432
I see.

00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:38.469
You did it all with wires.

00:08:38.504 --> 00:08:40.608
‐ You finally noticed?

00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:42.612
Right before we started,
I strung up

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:45.116
these super‐thin wires
all over the warehouse.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.588
Which means you did slice off
your own arm and leg

00:08:47.622 --> 00:08:49.091
while I just stood here
and watched you!

00:08:49.124 --> 00:08:51.730
‐ What? That can’t be!
A couple of wires

00:08:51.763 --> 00:08:54.034
wouldn’t be strong enough
to cut through human bone!

00:08:54.068 --> 00:08:56.372
You need to have some kind
of huge blade or saw!

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:57.542
‐ Oh, that’s right.

00:08:57.575 --> 00:08:59.478
You’re the expert
on this stuff, aren’t you?

00:08:59.512 --> 00:09:01.583
Well, you came close
to figuring it out.

00:09:01.616 --> 00:09:03.654
My Sigil, Queen of Thorns,

00:09:03.687 --> 00:09:06.893
allows me to control anything
with a stringlike structure.

00:09:06.927 --> 00:09:09.999
That includes chains,
wires, thread, whatever.

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:12.337
And I can do more
than wave them around.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.578
I can make them vibrate
quietly in place.

00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:17.380
‐ What do you mean, vibrate?

00:09:17.414 --> 00:09:20.086
[groans]

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.355
‐ Watch this.

00:09:21.388 --> 00:09:22.692
They’re harmless right now,

00:09:22.725 --> 00:09:25.698
but if I use my Sigil
to make them pulsate a little...

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:28.871
<i>‐ Damn this girl! I had</i>
<i>no idea she could do this!</i>

00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:31.643
<i>It’s like trying to fight</i>
<i>some kind of souped‐up jigsaw!</i>

00:09:31.676 --> 00:09:34.549
‐ Let’s see here.
What should I do with you now?

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:35.785
I guess I should probably

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:38.289
let Kaname and Ryuji
finish you off.

00:09:38.322 --> 00:09:39.726
‐ Watch it, sweetheart!

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:42.899
If I use Beelzebub to leap,
I’ll be free in a second!

00:09:42.932 --> 00:09:44.969
‐ Maybe, but that’ll
only work for you

00:09:45.003 --> 00:09:47.107
if there aren’t any wires
where you land.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.244
‐ [gasps] <i>For all I know,</i>

00:09:49.278 --> 00:09:51.650
<i>she’s set traps all over</i>
<i>the freakin’ warehouse,</i>

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:53.754
<i>and my Sigil’s</i>
<i>about to run out.</i>

00:09:53.787 --> 00:09:55.891
<i>I shouldn’t waste any more.</i>

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.062
<i>Wait.</i>

00:09:58.095 --> 00:10:00.266
<i>Why am I thinking</i>
<i>about escaping from her?</i>

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.302
<i>This isn’t right!</i>

00:10:01.335 --> 00:10:04.007
<i>I’ve always been the hunter,</i>
<i>never the hunted!</i>

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:07.882
<i>I know. There’s one more</i>
<i>counterattack I can try.</i>

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:10.888
<i>Normally I can’t use Beelzebub</i>
<i>to teleport someone else,</i>

00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:12.324
<i>but there’s one exception</i>
<i>to that rule!</i>

00:10:12.357 --> 00:10:14.696
‐ Yeah, I think I’d prefer
to do the honors myself.

00:10:14.729 --> 00:10:16.600
<i>‐ I can exchange positions</i>

00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:18.904
<i>with my opponent</i>
<i>in the blink of an eye!</i>

00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:21.910
Hah! I win!

00:10:21.943 --> 00:10:23.514
‐ [gasps]

00:10:23.547 --> 00:10:24.716
‐ [laughs]

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.786
‐ Aw, good try.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.657
‐ [slice]
‐ [gags]

00:10:30.193 --> 00:10:32.532
How? What happened?

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:34.602
I should’ve had you!

00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:36.405
A‐Am I dreaming this?

00:10:36.438 --> 00:10:37.909
‐ I’ll give you points
for creativity,

00:10:37.942 --> 00:10:40.079
but switching places with me
doesn’t really help you much

00:10:40.113 --> 00:10:42.484
if I’m still the one who’s
controlling the wires, dummy.

00:10:42.518 --> 00:10:44.488
And besides, I already knew
you would do that.

00:10:44.522 --> 00:10:46.927
‐ How did you know
about the ace up my sleeve?

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.496
You’re not supposed to be able

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.466
to pull that cheap crap
in D‐Game.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.672
‐ You think the game
is the problem here?

00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:54.441
You really are stupid, huh?

00:10:54.474 --> 00:10:56.345
It’s your fault
for challenging me.

00:10:56.378 --> 00:10:57.515
‐ [groans]

00:10:57.548 --> 00:10:59.384
Hey, come on, D‐Game admins!

00:10:59.418 --> 00:11:00.420
Are you seeing this?

00:11:00.453 --> 00:11:02.190
I found some kinda bug here!

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:03.292
Hurry up and fix it!

00:11:03.326 --> 00:11:05.196
Answer me, you bastards!

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.867
I know you can hear me!

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.037
‐ Oh, boy, this is pathetic.

00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:09.906
‐ [moans]

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:11.810
‐ You’ve always been a loser,

00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:14.181
a fool posing as a king.

00:11:14.214 --> 00:11:15.885
‐ How could I lose?

00:11:15.918 --> 00:11:18.657
No. That’s impossible!

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.861
Because I’m
the main character of D‐Game!

00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:24.234
‐ Don’t worry. I’ll be happy
to assume control of Shibuya

00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:26.238
in your place, Your Majesty.

00:11:26.272 --> 00:11:28.175
‐ No. Stay away.

00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:29.411
Don’t hurt me!

00:11:29.444 --> 00:11:30.748
Just‐‐Just leave me alone.

00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:31.783
I’m not ready to die!

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.987
I don’t wanna die!

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:36.593
‐ If history’s
taught us anything,

00:11:36.626 --> 00:11:38.630
there’s one destination
for a failed ruler

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:40.534
after he’s removed
from his throne.

00:11:40.568 --> 00:11:42.003
It’s the guillotine for you!

00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:43.574
‐ [sobbing]

00:11:43.607 --> 00:11:45.443
‐ Queen of Thorns.

00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:47.314
‐ Help me, please!

00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:52.959
Hey, what the hell?
Why am I up here?!

00:11:52.992 --> 00:11:53.760
[wails]

00:11:53.794 --> 00:11:56.131
How did I teleport this high?

00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:59.606
No matter how much I focus,
I can only jump 10 meters!

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.810
<i>I have to teleport again now!</i>

00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:05.016
<i>It’s the only way for me</i>
<i>to cancel this momentum!</i>

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:05.985
<i>Beelzebub!</i>

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.222
[groans]

00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:10.928
I did it.

00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:13.099
I escaped certain death!

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:16.706
Yeah. I really am
the main character of D‐Ga‐‐

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.909
KANAME: You’ve lost weight.

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:20.380
Shoe’s on the other foot now,
isn’t it, Wang?

00:12:20.413 --> 00:12:22.985
Do you finally understand
how your victims must have felt

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:24.522
when they were
on the chopping block?

00:12:24.555 --> 00:12:25.858
[Ryuji laughs]

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:27.762
Man, our scary little princess

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:29.766
did a real number on you,
didn’t she?

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:32.203
I bet you’d die
if we left you here.

00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:33.372
‐ [whimpers]

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:35.176
Come on! Don’t kill me!

00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:36.947
I surrender, okay?
I admit defeat!

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.084
You guys beat the Eighth Clan
fair and square!

00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:41.488
‐ It was an A‐ranked Clan Match!
‐ ANNOUNCER: <i>The game is over.</i>

00:12:41.523 --> 00:12:42.858
‐ Your team gets
1,800 points from us!

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:44.061
<i>‐ Clan Sunset Ravens wins!</i>

00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:45.764
‐ That should be
more than enough reward

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.233
for a battle like this!

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.102
‐ Let’s see.

00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:51.643
I could cash that in
for 180 million yen.

00:12:51.676 --> 00:12:53.179
Not enough.

00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:54.916
That doesn’t even
begin to make up

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:57.655
for everything you and
your squad took away from us,

00:12:57.688 --> 00:13:00.393
which is why I’m taking
everything from you.

00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:01.630
‐ Huh?

00:13:01.663 --> 00:13:03.466
‐ You play poker, Wang?

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:05.504
Do you know what "all‐in" means?

00:13:05.537 --> 00:13:08.009
It’s a winner‐take‐all strategy.

00:13:08.042 --> 00:13:10.914
I bet every chip I got,
which, in turn,

00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:13.352
forces my opponent
to do the same thing.

00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:15.557
‐ Poker? You’re crazy!

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:19.732
‐ In other words, if you guys
have fewer chips than we do,

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.836
that means
you’re up the creek, pal.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.041
I’m the High Roller.
When the game begins,

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:26.312
I’ve got the power
to bet any amount I like

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:27.480
to increase my payout.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:31.455
It’s the privilege
I received from a D‐Game admin.

00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:37.000
It looks like I had 8,869 points
transferred to me for this game.

00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:39.204
You guys had
quite a bit saved up,

00:13:39.237 --> 00:13:42.043
but it’s still
way less than we’ve got.

00:13:42.077 --> 00:13:46.218
Too bad. You and your clan
just lost it all.

00:13:46.251 --> 00:13:47.120
[Inukai sighs]

00:13:47.153 --> 00:13:49.792
So this is how it ends, huh?

00:13:49.826 --> 00:13:51.195
‐ [laughs]

00:13:51.228 --> 00:13:53.099
You lucked out
at the bell, Inukai.

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:56.071
I’m gonna find out if karate
works on demons in hell.

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:02.918
‐ Good job, Kaname.

00:14:02.952 --> 00:14:05.023
You finished this after all.

00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:11.603
‐ [gasps]

00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:12.838
[Japanese music playing]

00:14:12.872 --> 00:14:14.274
‐ It’s over?

00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:15.778
This is how I go out?

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:19.351
But it isn’t fair. Why me?

00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:21.923
All this time,
I was sure I was the king.

00:14:21.956 --> 00:14:23.927
<i>Darwin’s Game, huh?</i>

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.131
<i>Is this what Shinji’s</i>
<i>been playing?</i>

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.135
<i>This is great! With my power,</i>

00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:31.108
<i>I can tear up my enemies</i>
<i>like toilet paper!</i>

00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:33.379
<i>We don’t have to worry about</i>
<i>those pain‐in‐the‐ass cops</i>

00:14:33.412 --> 00:14:35.617
<i>anymore, ’cause I</i>
<i>slaughtered ’em all!</i>

00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:37.722
<i>This town is ours</i>
<i>for the taking!</i>

00:14:37.755 --> 00:14:39.424
<i>‐ Wow, that’s amazing, Wang.</i>

00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:40.561
<i>You’re unstoppable now!</i>

00:14:40.594 --> 00:14:43.199
<i>I guess we should think of you</i>
<i>as the king around here.</i>

00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:46.940
<i>‐ "King Wang."</i>
<i>I like the sound of that!</i>

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:49.512
REIN: <i>That’s why</i>
<i>you’re the King of Venom.</i>

00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:51.549
<i>Huh? King of what now?</i>

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:55.056
<i>‐ They would imprison hundreds</i>
<i>of poisonous creepy‐crawlies</i>

00:14:55.089 --> 00:14:57.260
<i>inside of an urn,</i>
<i>and eventually</i>

00:14:57.293 --> 00:14:59.932
<i>the sealed creatures</i>
<i>would kill each other off.</i>

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:03.406
<i>As time went on,</i>
<i>all of the insects would die</i>

00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:05.376
<i>one by one by one,</i>

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:09.151
<i>until only the strongest</i>
<i>contender was left alive.</i>

00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:11.623
‐ Yeah, I think I understand.

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:14.361
The strongest insect,

00:15:14.394 --> 00:15:15.798
the King of Venom.

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:18.469
Better listen up, Kaname.

00:15:18.503 --> 00:15:22.143
It’s time for the king to leave
his successor with some advice.

00:15:22.177 --> 00:15:24.515
Just because you’ve squashed
one poisonous bug

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.185
doesn’t mean you get to relax.

00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:28.990
No matter what, people are
gonna keep dropping like flies

00:15:29.024 --> 00:15:30.226
everywhere you look,

00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:32.163
because we’re all the same,
you know that?

00:15:32.197 --> 00:15:34.100
We’re nothing but a bunch
of worthless insects

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.639
trapped in a giant urn
called Darwin’s Game,

00:15:36.673 --> 00:15:38.209
and don’t you forget it!

00:15:38.242 --> 00:15:39.211
[laughs]

00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:43.052
[gunfire]

00:15:45.557 --> 00:15:47.093
[coughs]

00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:48.362
[gags]

00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:51.368
[music ends]

00:15:52.505 --> 00:15:53.439
RYUJI: Thanks for that.

00:15:53.472 --> 00:15:56.044
I thought he’d never
stop running his mouth.

00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:58.182
[waves lapping]

00:16:00.486 --> 00:16:01.388
KANAME: I...

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:05.496
‐ Hey, looks like we
all got out alive.

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:06.966
Did you win, Kaname?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.006
‐ No, I lost.

00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:11.910
I failed to save a friend again.

00:16:11.943 --> 00:16:14.347
‐ Yeah, but at least
our enemy’s dead.

00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:16.051
The scumbag
who murdered your friend

00:16:16.084 --> 00:16:18.289
and my little brother
is burning in hell.

00:16:18.322 --> 00:16:21.061
That counts for something,
right?

00:16:21.094 --> 00:16:24.836
KANAME: Whatever the reason,
killing is bullshit.

00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:25.871
But letting yourself

00:16:25.904 --> 00:16:29.010
or your friend get killed
is even worse.

00:16:29.044 --> 00:16:31.181
And the biggest piece of shit
is the Game Master

00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:33.452
who created this nightmare
in the first place,

00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:38.095
which is why I’ve decided to put
an end to D‐Game for good.

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:40.868
And I’ll take down
anyone who gets in my way.

00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:43.038
That’s the goal
of the Sunset Ravens,

00:16:43.072 --> 00:16:45.209
the clan I put together.

00:16:45.243 --> 00:16:48.148
I hope you’re prepared
to see this through with me.

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:51.188
SHUKA: Kaname.

00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:53.927
Remember what I said before?

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.096
I believe that a clan

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:57.500
is supposed to be
just like a family.

00:16:57.535 --> 00:16:59.371
Promise me this one thing.

00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:03.379
I want you to swear
never to die or go away.

00:17:03.412 --> 00:17:06.285
I don’t care if you lose
or embarrass us.

00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:10.159
All that matters to me is
that you always come home.

00:17:10.192 --> 00:17:14.234
I can’t bear the thought
of losing more family!

00:17:20.514 --> 00:17:21.448
‐ Okay.

00:17:21.481 --> 00:17:24.354
I promise that no matter
what it takes,

00:17:24.387 --> 00:17:25.489
I won’t die.

00:17:27.193 --> 00:17:30.099
It turns out surviving is
something I’m pretty good at,

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:31.536
don’t you think?

00:17:33.105 --> 00:17:34.274
‐ Yeah, you’re right.

00:17:34.307 --> 00:17:37.648
Well, then I promise
to stay by your side.

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:40.186
‐ And don’t bother asking
what my plans are,

00:17:40.219 --> 00:17:42.423
’cause my mind’s been
made up for a long time.

00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:45.463
‐ Same for me.
That ship’s sailed by now.

00:17:45.496 --> 00:17:47.333
And without me around
to help guide it,

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:48.770
it’ll probably capsize.

00:17:48.803 --> 00:17:50.306
SUI: I’ll do my best, too!

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:52.945
I mean, I’m sure I’ll end up
getting in your way, though.

00:17:52.978 --> 00:17:54.582
‐ Well, I’m with
a different clan,

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.318
but I promise I’ll come
lend you guys a hand

00:17:56.351 --> 00:17:57.521
whenever I’ve got time.

00:17:57.554 --> 00:17:59.457
‐ If it’s true
every clan’s a family,

00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:01.128
then we’re one of those
dysfunctional ones

00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:03.132
that always has
awkward get‐togethers.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.835
REIN: Just because
we’re not blood‐related

00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:06.104
doesn’t mean
that we don’t have

00:18:06.138 --> 00:18:07.908
a special bond
that connects all of us.

00:18:07.942 --> 00:18:09.845
‐ Oh, no! Don’t say that, Rein!

00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:11.683
It makes us sound
like a mafia group!

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.387
‐ True, but I don’t mind it
all that much.

00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:18.863
‐ [giggles]

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.600
Let’s get going, Kaname.

00:18:20.634 --> 00:18:23.005
If we’re a family,
then we need a home, don’t we?

00:18:23.038 --> 00:18:25.978
‐ We sure do,
and we’ve made bank,

00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:28.850
so let’s seize a place
with a huge yard.

00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:37.100
[birds chirping]

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:38.202
OBORO: Wow.

00:18:38.235 --> 00:18:41.208
Kaname’s clan won
with no casualties.

00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:43.012
He’s so incredible.

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.414
Be still, my heart.

00:18:44.447 --> 00:18:46.184
[buzzing]

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:48.022
Hey, what can I do for you?

00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:50.560
GAME MASTER: <i>Oboro,</i>
<i>can you talk for a moment?</i>

00:18:50.594 --> 00:18:51.562
‐ Certainly.

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:53.132
I just finished a job,

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.635
so I’m all yours.

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:58.008
How can I be of service
to you today, Mr. Game Master?

00:18:58.042 --> 00:19:00.781
‐ There’s been
a big development in the game.

00:19:00.814 --> 00:19:02.918
Can you guess who it involves?

00:19:02.951 --> 00:19:04.855
<i>‐ Ooh, I know! Is it Kaname?</i>

00:19:04.889 --> 00:19:06.559
‐ Nothing gets past you.

00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:09.097
I’m putting him
under special observation,

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.368
so I’ll need you
to stay away from him.

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:13.640
‐ [sighs] <i>You’re no fun at all!</i>

00:19:13.673 --> 00:19:15.744
<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>he’s gonna replace Wang, then?</i>

00:19:15.777 --> 00:19:17.480
‐ Oh, no, not exactly.

00:19:17.514 --> 00:19:20.152
My original reason
for observing Wang so closely

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:21.355
was because I had predicted

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:23.727
he would eventually
be the eye of the storm.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.363
And then, just as I intended,

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:27.200
the game was made
even more interesting,

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:30.473
because the mighty Kaname Sudo
entered the scene.

00:19:30.507 --> 00:19:32.544
In other words, Darwin’s Game

00:19:32.578 --> 00:19:34.815
is about to advance
to the next stage,

00:19:34.849 --> 00:19:35.684
which means that you’ll have

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:38.155
a much more important role
to play soon.

00:19:39.124 --> 00:19:41.194
‐ [Japanese music playing]
‐ MAN: Hurry up!

00:19:41.228 --> 00:19:42.631
The early bird gets the worm!

00:19:42.664 --> 00:19:44.367
WOMAN: I know. I know.

00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:46.839
All right, I set a clan flag.

00:19:46.873 --> 00:19:49.310
MAN: Those Eighth Clan pricks
are finally out of the picture,

00:19:49.344 --> 00:19:50.814
so if we’re quick,
maybe we can claim

00:19:50.847 --> 00:19:52.350
this territory for ourselves.

00:19:52.383 --> 00:19:54.020
‐ [gasps]
Someone’s got eyes on us.

00:19:54.054 --> 00:19:55.489
‐ But how can there be a sniper?

00:19:55.524 --> 00:19:57.360
This is the tallest building
in the area!

00:19:57.393 --> 00:19:59.264
‐ Keep your damn voice down.

00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:01.703
‐ Point five
has been dealt with.

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:03.338
We’re lucky
to be up against a clan

00:20:03.372 --> 00:20:05.544
who’s stupid enough
to place their flag on a roof.

00:20:05.577 --> 00:20:09.017
I’m returning to my lookout
duties now. Over.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.386
[Ryuji laughs]

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:12.223
Man, this is so awesome!

00:20:12.256 --> 00:20:13.325
With the conceal function,

00:20:13.358 --> 00:20:15.597
I can really let loose
on these punks!

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.566
‐ [gasps]

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:19.772
‐ Sorry, but these
are the consequences.

00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:20.874
Didn’t I warn you guys

00:20:20.907 --> 00:20:23.412
that playing D‐Game wasn’t
allowed in our territory?

00:20:23.445 --> 00:20:25.149
‐ What’s wrong with you freaks?

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:27.320
You’re stuck in the game
the same as we are!

00:20:27.353 --> 00:20:28.556
‐ Look, this’ll be easier

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.727
if you just tell me
what you came for. Spill!

00:20:30.761 --> 00:20:33.165
SUI: Wait, Ryuji!
We have a rule about this!

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:35.971
No killing
unless we have to, right?

00:20:36.004 --> 00:20:37.708
‐ Of course I remember.

00:20:37.741 --> 00:20:38.676
Just calm down.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.914
If you’ll notice,
I haven’t killed anybody.

00:20:40.947 --> 00:20:42.116
‐ Uh‐oh.
‐ [moaning]

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.222
‐ Um, are you still alive?

00:20:45.256 --> 00:20:48.897
‐ Yes, we’re all alive.
Please let us go now!

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.366
‐ Oh, I’m so relieved!

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:52.871
I was afraid Sota
got carried away.

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:54.240
‐ Crap!

00:20:54.274 --> 00:20:56.011
We just can’t outrun her!

00:20:56.044 --> 00:20:57.681
We’re gonna
have to take her out!

00:21:00.887 --> 00:21:01.856
[gags]

00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:02.858
‐ How ’bout this?

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:07.534
‐ [grunts]

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:11.909
[gasps]

00:21:11.943 --> 00:21:12.845
[woman gags]

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.416
‐ [sighs]

00:21:15.449 --> 00:21:17.721
I’m done with my part too,
Kaname.

00:21:17.754 --> 00:21:19.090
<i>It was so easy.</i>

00:21:19.124 --> 00:21:20.560
<i>It kinda bummed me out.</i>

00:21:20.594 --> 00:21:23.533
‐ You didn’t wipe all
of them out, did you, Shuka?

00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:25.570
<i>‐ What? No, of course not.</i>

00:21:25.604 --> 00:21:28.510
<i>Let me see.</i>
<i>Oh, there’s one left.</i>

00:21:28.543 --> 00:21:31.916
‐ Copy that. It’s almost dawn,
so let’s meet at point one.

00:21:31.949 --> 00:21:33.820
<i>‐ On my way!</i>

00:21:33.853 --> 00:21:35.122
‐ And that’s a wrap.

00:21:35.156 --> 00:21:36.626
Just so we’re clear,
you do understand

00:21:36.659 --> 00:21:38.228
why I didn’t kill you,
don’t you?

00:21:38.262 --> 00:21:39.899
‐ No, I don’t get it at all!

00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:41.201
What is your problem?

00:21:41.234 --> 00:21:45.009
Why leave me alive
when you butchered the rest?

00:21:45.042 --> 00:21:48.315
‐ Because I want you to go tell
every single person you can

00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:50.352
that D‐Game
is strictly prohibited

00:21:50.386 --> 00:21:52.223
within Sunset Ravens territory.

00:21:52.256 --> 00:21:54.160
‐ It’s strictly prohibited?

00:21:54.194 --> 00:21:55.797
What are you,
some kind of watchdog?

00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:59.470
‐ Watchdog? I’d prefer you
to think of me as a raven.

00:21:59.505 --> 00:22:01.174
They’re tough, aggressive birds,

00:22:01.208 --> 00:22:03.212
clever to the point
of being sneaky.

00:22:03.245 --> 00:22:06.484
They hold grudges for life,
but they’re also compassionate.

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:09.725
Wherever you see this mark,
D‐Game is outlawed.

00:22:09.758 --> 00:22:13.065
That’s the decision
enforced by Sunset Ravens.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.438
‐ Sunset Ravens?

00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:18.877
KOTORI: Wow,
that was a ballsy move.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.782
A single clan
is imposing a ban on D‐Game?

00:22:21.816 --> 00:22:25.155
Kaname’s more of a heavyweight
than I took him for.

00:22:25.189 --> 00:22:26.526
I guess it’s
only a matter of time

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:30.399
before the matchmaking function
in the app stops working.

00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:33.272
Yikes. That probably
means all of Kanto.

00:22:33.305 --> 00:22:34.508
This is huge!

00:22:34.542 --> 00:22:37.581
All right, what are you
gonna do now, Kotori?

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:48.836
[song continues]

00:23:40.072 --> 00:23:41.976
[birds chirping]

00:23:44.515 --> 00:23:47.888
‐ Damn it, Game Master,
where did you set it this time?

00:23:47.921 --> 00:23:51.428
I swear, one day,
I’m gonna teach you a lesson.
