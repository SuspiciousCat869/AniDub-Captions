WEBVTT

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:09.418
‐ Do you think they’ll show up?

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:10.588
It’s quiet.

00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:13.159
‐ I know they will.
They would never turn down

00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:15.397
a chance to collect
15 more rings.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.003
Wang is the kind of person
who does whatever it takes

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:21.009
to satisfy his desires,
and he doesn’t hesitate.

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:23.079
He’ll happily kill anybody
who gets in his way,

00:00:23.113 --> 00:00:25.785
whether it’s a yakuza boss
or a harmless child.

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:27.656
He’s not the leader
of the Eighth Clan

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.091
for nothing, after all.

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:31.462
‐ [chuckles]
I’m glad to hear it.

00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:34.836
Now that I know, I won’t lose
any sleep over eliminating him

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.840
and every scumbag
he’s bringing with him.

00:00:36.874 --> 00:00:38.443
‐ To the best of my knowledge,

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.316
other than Wang, who’s
the number‐one threat here,

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:43.320
there are two others
to watch out for.

00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:45.057
If we want to be victorious,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.027
the best course of action
is separating them

00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:48.764
and taking them out
individually.

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:51.336
First, there’s Keiichi Katsura,

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:54.041
who’s been close to Wang
for quite some time.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:55.812
He’s highly skilled in karate,

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:57.181
but his Sigil
can crush opponents

00:00:57.214 --> 00:00:58.951
without the use of his fists.

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:00.187
‐ That sounds dangerous.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.959
I assume it must be
some sort of energy attack.

00:01:02.993 --> 00:01:05.230
‐ Unknown, but I think
it’s classified

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:06.600
as a telekinetic type.

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:09.472
It seems to be limited
to point‐blank range, though,

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:12.646
so it would probably be wise
to engage him from a distance.

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:16.219
Anyway, the real problem
is the other person.

00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:18.691
He actually hasn’t been
with the Eighth Clan for long.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.062
Still, he’s rapidly risen
through their ranks.

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:23.266
His power is pyrokinesis,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.705
which makes him
a natural enemy to you.

00:01:25.738 --> 00:01:27.274
‐ Pyrokinesis.

00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:32.017
‐ There are several varieties of
pyrokinetic Sigils in the game,

00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:34.488
but the type that he uses
is incredibly rare.

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:37.996
It allows him to engulf
his entire body in flames.

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:40.602
His actual name and background
are a mystery,

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:42.872
but his associates
have come to refer to him

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:44.776
as Sig, the Flame Demon.

00:01:46.714 --> 00:01:47.816
‐ He fights with fire.

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.855
I’ll probably lose this battle.

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:53.326
Even so,
getting out of this alive

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.698
has never been
a real option for me.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.489
REIN: <i>There are</i>
<i>more players</i>

00:03:31.523 --> 00:03:34.061
<i>exploring the station</i>
<i>than I expected.</i>

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:35.531
<i>But it’s the center of the map,</i>

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:37.802
<i>so I guess it’s not strange</i>
<i>that people have gathered here,</i>

00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:40.541
<i>even if they haven’t</i>
<i>discovered the coordinates.</i>

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:43.113
<i>And if there are other players</i>
<i>who have figured it out,</i>

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:46.486
<i>we’re the only ones who have</i>
<i>the code for the diamond ring.</i>

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.860
<i>If only I knew</i>
<i>the meaning of this number.</i>

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:50.862
[gasps]

00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:52.464
<i>An Eighth Clan jacket!</i>

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.870
<i>They must have</i>
<i>solved it too.</i>

00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:57.074
[gasps]

00:03:57.107 --> 00:03:58.744
<i>That’s Wang!</i>

00:03:58.778 --> 00:04:00.380
<i>And he brought so many!</i>

00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:02.050
<i>Judging by their numbers</i>
<i>at the hotel,</i>

00:04:02.084 --> 00:04:04.255
<i>I didn’t think they’d have</i>
<i>such a large group here.</i>

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:05.691
<i>Of course!</i>

00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:08.430
<i>He must have gathered people</i>
<i>who aren’t part of the event!</i>

00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:10.200
<i>I can’t search</i>
<i>for the treasure now!</i>

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:11.335
[no audible dialogue]

00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:14.141
MAN: The place
is full of hostiles.

00:04:14.175 --> 00:04:15.845
Are we really
gonna barge in there?

00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:18.316
The Eighth Clan already
beat us to the punch,

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.153
so we might as well
cut our losses now.

00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:21.924
WOMAN: But we have
a plan, remember?

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:24.395
After everyone kills each other
in the big confrontation,

00:04:24.428 --> 00:04:26.065
we’ll swoop in
and collect all the loot.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:27.367
‐ Why should we?

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.140
We’ve got enough
to get through the event alive.

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:32.545
There’s no reason
to do anything risky, right?

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:34.883
‐ Don’t you get it?
With a diamond ring,

00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:37.589
we’d have a complete set,
which has to mean something.

00:04:37.622 --> 00:04:40.260
There’s more to this event
than they’ve told us about.

00:04:40.293 --> 00:04:42.431
You’re with me on this one,
aren’t you, bro?

00:04:42.464 --> 00:04:45.003
‐ Maybe. There’s not much
evidence to go on,

00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:47.942
but there has to be some reason
why the game designers

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:50.515
made seven different‐‐[gasps]

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:52.117
[groans]

00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:53.854
‐ [laughs]

00:04:53.888 --> 00:04:55.758
‐ [groans]
‐ [whimpers]

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:57.027

‐ [growls]

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.568
Good. Now we have enough rings

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:03.206
for every member
of the Danjo Boxing Club.

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:04.241
‐ Awesome!

00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:06.379
‐ Let’s get moving.

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:08.784
It’s too dangerous
to hang around here.

00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:09.853
‐ True.

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:13.159
<i>They’ve started a war</i>
<i>over that diamond ring.</i>

00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:15.998
<i>Sheesh.</i>
<i>This is gonna be a bloodbath.</i>

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:19.471
‐ [yelling]

00:05:21.677 --> 00:05:23.547
‐ [groans]

00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:25.585
<i>He’s stronger than I thought.</i>

00:05:26.687 --> 00:05:27.454
‐ [growls]

00:05:27.487 --> 00:05:29.391
You can’t run from me!

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:31.663
<i>‐ He really is</i>
<i>my perfect enemy.</i>

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:33.132
<i>If not for Rein’s warning,</i>

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.970
<i>he would have killed me</i>
<i>on the spot!</i>

00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:38.911
<i>My plants up ahead</i>
<i>can be deployed as barricades.</i>

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:39.913
<i>But with his Sigil,</i>

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:42.050
<i>he’ll probably blaze</i>
<i>right through them!</i>

00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:45.090
<i>What else can I do?</i>

00:05:45.123 --> 00:05:48.797
<i>Perhaps I could set a barricade</i>
<i>with grenades inside it.</i>

00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:51.302
<i>I’m sure his power would</i>
<i>protect him from the heat,</i>

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:52.639
<i>but would he be able to weather</i>

00:05:52.672 --> 00:05:54.643
<i>the debris</i>
<i>and force of the blast?</i>

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.684
<i>It’s the moment of truth,</i>
<i>Flame Demon,</i>

00:05:58.717 --> 00:06:00.420
<i>Let’s see what you’re made of!</i>

‐ [gags]

00:06:16.018 --> 00:06:18.791
‐ Hey, perfect timing, Keiichi.

00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:22.364
‐ The elevators
are on the fritz,

00:06:22.397 --> 00:06:23.867
and the stairwells
have been blocked off,

00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:26.072
so I had to break in here
the old‐fashioned way.

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:29.245
‐ Lucky! I sure wish I had
a Sigil that would let me fly.

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:31.282
I’m jealous.

00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:32.484
‐ It’s not flying.

00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:35.390
I just make a scaffolding
out of air and climb up.

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:37.962
Honestly, it kinda wears me out.

00:06:37.996 --> 00:06:39.064
‐ [gasps]

[both gasp]

00:06:49.218 --> 00:06:51.957
‐ You just saved
our asses, Keiichi.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.228
‐ The bastard was suicidal.

00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:55.932
‐ And stubborn, too.

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:59.071
That fight should’ve killed him
a million times over.

00:06:59.104 --> 00:07:00.240
‐ He’s on his way out.

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:04.481
I guess we’d better finish him
off to be sure, though.

00:07:04.516 --> 00:07:07.789
[heart beating]

00:07:07.822 --> 00:07:11.195
<i>‐ My Sigil’s</i>

<i>I’m at my limit.</i>

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:15.771
<i>It’s strange</i>
<i>that it doesn’t hurt.</i>

00:07:15.805 --> 00:07:18.811
<i>In the end, death is easier</i>

00:07:18.844 --> 00:07:22.384
<i>Escaping the hotel</i>
<i>by leaving the rings as bait,</i>

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:26.526
<i>Rein came up with</i>
<i>that backup plan for nothing.</i>

00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:28.897
[footsteps shuffling]

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:31.837
‐ Ah, so this is
where you were hiding.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.774
You’re pretty tough
for an old man.

00:07:33.807 --> 00:07:36.145
‐ How fortunate.

00:07:36.178 --> 00:07:37.314
‐ Huh?

00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:39.719
‐ I didn’t think
you two would come to me,

00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:43.493
but now, before I die,
I’ll get to witness

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:46.933
the pain and surprise
on your faces.

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:48.169

‐ What?!

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.773
An earthquake!

00:07:49.806 --> 00:07:52.344
‐ No! This is
something different!

00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:54.783
‐ What the hell did you do,
damn it?

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:56.419
‐ You may not understand this,

00:07:56.452 --> 00:07:59.358
but plants are far mightier
than any beast is.

00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:01.897
From an animal’s perspective,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.869
plants have no intellect
and can’t move.

00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:08.142
Their only purpose is to be
eaten by other creatures.

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:11.750
On the other hand,
from a plant’s point of view,

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:15.223
the animals are servants
that can be used to reproduce.

00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:17.862
‐ [gasps]
Quit your babbling already!

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:20.266
‐ You’ve seen
their strength before,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.870
the way a beautiful flower

00:08:21.903 --> 00:08:23.941
can break through the asphalt
and bloom!

00:08:26.646 --> 00:08:28.149
‐ This is getting bad, Keiichi!

00:08:28.182 --> 00:08:31.523
Listen, if he’s using his Sigil
to make this happen,

00:08:31.556 --> 00:08:34.028
then all we have to do
is kill him!

00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:35.330
‐ It’s too late.
‐ Huh?

00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:37.401
‐ Look at him.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.271
The guy’s dead.

00:08:46.419 --> 00:08:47.555

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:50.528
<i>When did you get here?</i>

00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:53.132
<i>Say something next time.</i>

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:54.602

00:08:54.636 --> 00:08:56.573
<i>Uh, I’m sorry.</i>

00:08:56.606 --> 00:08:59.011

00:09:03.554 --> 00:09:07.628
<i>Oh, wow, the gerbera daisies</i>
<i>from our garden.</i>

00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:08.864
<i>They bloomed again this year.</i>

00:09:08.897 --> 00:09:10.935
<i>‐ Do you know</i>

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:14.141
<i>‐ Red is progress,</i>
<i>pink is greatest love,</i>

00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:16.245
<i>orange mean enduring,</i>

00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:17.849
<i>and the white ones are hope.</i>

00:09:17.882 --> 00:09:19.586
<i>But if you ask me, the florists</i>

<i>Ask any florist.</i>

00:09:28.604 --> 00:09:31.075
<i>Gerberas are the best of all.</i>

RYUJI: Do you still
want to go in there?

00:09:56.993 --> 00:10:00.935
‐ Come on. Let’s bring
this damn game to an end.

00:10:04.742 --> 00:10:07.114
REIN: <i>I didn’t think</i>
<i>there’d be this many.</i>

00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:09.919
<i>It’ll be hard to get</i>
<i>through here undetected.</i>

00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:12.892
[panting]

00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:13.694
[gasps]

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:15.096
‐ What does he mean,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.635
we should "look for
the real treasure"?

00:10:17.668 --> 00:10:18.670
It’s not the rings?

00:10:18.704 --> 00:10:21.075
‐ Nope. Wang said
it was something else.

00:10:21.108 --> 00:10:24.782
It might not even show up
on the AR Camera.

00:10:24.816 --> 00:10:27.420
‐ So he wants us to check out
the whole station?

00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:30.895
Wouldn’t it be easier if we
focused on the diamond code?

00:10:30.928 --> 00:10:33.332
‐ We gotta make the first move.

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:36.606
Plus, whoever finds the treasure
gets 1,000 bonus points.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.579
Just capturing a player
who’s got info is worth 100.

00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:42.885
‐ Sure, but what if
nobody knows anything?

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:45.423
‐ Think about it, man.
If a player shows up here,

00:10:45.456 --> 00:10:46.693
it means they’ve
cracked the code

00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:48.697
and they know that this is
where the treasure is.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.337
In other words,
we should kidnap anybody we see.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.511
‐ Hey, that’s pretty smart.
Wang’s a genius!

00:10:55.544 --> 00:10:56.880
‐ [gasps]

00:10:56.913 --> 00:10:59.519
<i>So they don’t know the exact</i>
<i>location of the treasure.</i>

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:01.890
<i>Which means I can still win.</i>

00:11:01.923 --> 00:11:03.594
<i>Now’s my chance to move.</i>

00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:05.063
‐ There’s a girl here.

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:08.537
My Sigil picks up
even the slightest scent.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.440
That’s why
it’s called Wolf Nose.

00:11:10.473 --> 00:11:12.745
<i>‐ Oh, no. They’ll find me.</i>

00:11:13.814 --> 00:11:15.718
‐ There you are! You’re mine!

00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:17.989
‐ Don’t kill her.
We need her alive!

00:11:18.022 --> 00:11:20.260
‐ Trust me,
we’ll get her to talk!

00:11:21.462 --> 00:11:23.366
‐ Hey, who the hell are you?

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:25.236
‐ Hurry up, and grab her!

00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:30.313
‐ Get back here!
‐ [train clanking]

00:11:30.346 --> 00:11:31.917
‐ That little brat!
‐ Relax.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.687
We’ve got the whole station
locked down,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.526
and none of these trains
are stopping!

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.131
Let’s spread the word
and corner her!

00:11:39.164 --> 00:11:40.133
EIGHTH CLAN: Right!

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:40.935
<i>‐ It’s okay!</i>

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:42.538
<i>As long as I</i>
<i>don’t run into Wang,</i>

00:11:42.572 --> 00:11:44.107
<i>I can force my way</i>
<i>through here!</i>

00:11:45.343 --> 00:11:46.713
<i>Laplace!</i>

00:11:46.746 --> 00:11:48.951
<i>Good, he’s not anywhere nearby.</i>

00:11:48.984 --> 00:11:51.188
<i>There’s my escape route!</i>

00:11:51.222 --> 00:11:53.860
‐ Boo!
‐ [gasps]

00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:56.398
<i>‐ What? Where did he come from?</i>

00:11:56.432 --> 00:11:58.169
<i>Laplace should</i>
<i>have detected him!</i>

00:11:58.202 --> 00:11:59.037
[gasps]

00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:02.177
‐ You’re not going anywhere,
little lady,

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.849
not ’til you and I
have a quick chat.

00:12:04.882 --> 00:12:07.287
Now I want you to tell me

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.424
everything you know
about the real treasure

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:10.861
and where I’m
supposed to find it.

00:12:10.894 --> 00:12:13.934
‐ I don’t know
a thing about that,

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:16.840
and I don’t have any rings
to give you, either.

00:12:16.873 --> 00:12:18.744
‐ Ah, playing dumb, are we?

00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:21.750
You’d better
not take me lightly, kid.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.956
I asked you to tell me
everything you know.

00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:27.060
‐ And I told you
I don’t have any rings.

00:12:27.093 --> 00:12:30.066
[bone snaps]

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:31.168
[sobbing]

00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:33.339
‐ [laughter]
‐ You see how nice I am?

00:12:33.372 --> 00:12:35.844
I’m showing you
the severity of your situation

00:12:35.878 --> 00:12:37.615
without even using my Sigil.

00:12:37.648 --> 00:12:39.585
‐ [laughter]

00:12:39.619 --> 00:12:41.388
‐ All right, you win.

00:12:41.422 --> 00:12:43.359
‐ I’ll tell you.
‐ Attagirl.

00:12:43.392 --> 00:12:45.564
You’re not so bad when
you’re cooperating with me.

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:49.071
‐ You want to find out what
the real treasure is, right?

00:12:49.104 --> 00:12:52.578
You already broke my arm,
so please let go, and I’ll talk.

00:12:52.612 --> 00:12:53.614
‐ Dumb‐ass.
‐ [wails]

00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:54.749
‐ You’re in no position

00:12:54.782 --> 00:12:56.786
to be making
the demands here, girlie.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.792
‐ [panting]

00:12:59.826 --> 00:13:01.563
That’s why you’re
the King of Venom.

00:13:01.596 --> 00:13:04.736
‐ Eh? King of what now?

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:06.138
‐ ’Kay, here it is.

00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:09.378
I’ll let you in on the real
secret of this treasure hunt.

00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:13.386
Actually, it’s based
on a centuries‐old concept.

00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:14.789
You see, in ancient China,

00:13:14.822 --> 00:13:17.762
they used a deadly
venom‐based poison.

00:13:17.795 --> 00:13:21.035
‐ So what? I’m not interested
in a history lesson.

00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:23.607
I want to hear what you know
about the treasure!

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.109
‐ You’ll just
have to be patient.

00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:27.915
This is going somewhere,
but I need a minute.

00:13:27.948 --> 00:13:30.019
Well, I’ve given it
a lot of thought,

00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:31.823
and I’ve concluded that D‐Game

00:13:31.856 --> 00:13:33.994
is similar
to that ancient poison.

00:13:34.027 --> 00:13:38.670
In China, they usually used it
as a form of assassination.

00:13:38.704 --> 00:13:39.872
They would imprison hundreds

00:13:39.906 --> 00:13:42.611
of poisonous creepy‐crawlies
inside of an urn,

00:13:42.645 --> 00:13:44.515
and eventually
the sealed creatures

00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:46.986
would kill each other off.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.694
As time went on,
all of the insects would die

00:13:50.728 --> 00:13:52.798
one by one by one,

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:56.171
until only the strongest
contender was left alive.

00:13:56.205 --> 00:14:00.514
Does that remind you of yourself
at all, King of Venom?

00:14:00.547 --> 00:14:01.783
I bet so!

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:04.756
‐ I’m gonna cut off your fingers
one at a time,

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:06.025
then your ears.

00:14:06.058 --> 00:14:07.928
‐ [winces]
‐ Don’t worry.

00:14:07.962 --> 00:14:11.468
I’ll save that rattling tongue
of yours for last.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.243
[grunts]

00:14:17.347 --> 00:14:19.652
Damn you!

00:14:19.685 --> 00:14:21.088
REIN: Finally.

00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:24.061
You sure took your time
getting here, but thank you.

00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:26.833
‐ Listen, I’m doing
the best I can, all right?

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.204
‐ [growls] Who the hell are you?

00:14:29.237 --> 00:14:31.275
‐ You’re the Eighth Clan boss,
right?

00:14:31.308 --> 00:14:33.613
The way I see it,
we can either negotiate

00:14:33.647 --> 00:14:34.982
or kill each other right here.

00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:36.786
So what would you rather us do?

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.657
‐ Huh?

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.794
You’re not the brightest,
are you, boy?

00:14:40.828 --> 00:14:42.932
Do I look like
a guy who negotiates?

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.938
‐ Maybe. We happen to have
some important information

00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:47.575
about the Treasure Hunt event,

00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:50.146
so I think you might want
to make a deal with us.

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:52.952
‐ [laughs]
‐ [Eighth Clan laughing]

00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:54.287
‐ What do you say, gang?

00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:57.026
Do we need to negotiate
with a bunch of toddlers?

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.964
‐ They really think
they can take us?

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:00.734
Let’s waste them all right now!

00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:03.907
‐ All but one.
We still need that info, huh?

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.343
‐ Well, there you have it.

00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:08.550
The Eighth Clan only deals
in take‐and‐take situations.

00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:11.689
In other words, we take intel,
and we take your lives!

00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:14.127
‐ I told you
these Eighth Clan guys

00:15:14.161 --> 00:15:17.233
weren’t sophisticated enough
to talk this over like adults.

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:18.570
‐ Yeah, I get it. You’re right.

00:15:18.603 --> 00:15:22.043
‐ Fine by me.
Fighting’s more my style anyway.

00:15:22.076 --> 00:15:24.515
‐ They’re not giving us
much of a choice, are they?

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.151
‐ Oh, no! What should I do?

00:15:27.053 --> 00:15:29.257
‐ If you insist.

00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:30.928
‐ Attack!

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.798
KANAME: Can you run?

00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:33.934
Of course I can.

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:35.336
I refuse to die here!

00:15:36.438 --> 00:15:38.309
Follow me.
My Sigil will lead the way!

00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:39.277
RYUJI: Come on now!

00:15:39.311 --> 00:15:41.482
You thought those peashooters
would work on me?

00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:44.421
‐ Don’t get cocky just ’cause
you have a bigger gun!

00:15:44.454 --> 00:15:46.860
‐ [gasps]
‐ [wails]

00:15:46.893 --> 00:15:48.997
‐ [gags]

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:51.168
‐ What the...

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.343
‐ [whimpers] I can’t do this!

00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:57.815
Shuka, put me down!
I’m starting to get dizzy!

00:15:57.848 --> 00:15:59.585
‐ You remember your job, Sui?

00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:02.056
‐ I know. I know. I’ll do it.

00:16:03.058 --> 00:16:04.361
<i>Pollux Light!</i>

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:08.970
<i>The rest is up to you, Sota.</i>

00:16:09.004 --> 00:16:10.874
SOTA: Ha! Thanks for letting me

00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:12.745
join in on the action, too!

00:16:12.778 --> 00:16:15.283
Castor Light!

00:16:15.316 --> 00:16:16.218
‐ What happened?

00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:18.657
‐ I don’t know!
Just try and go around it!

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.159
‐ You useless punks.

00:16:20.193 --> 00:16:23.132
Quit staring off into space,
and crush them!

00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:25.203
‐ Look out behind us, Sis!

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.077
‐ [machine gun clicks]
‐ If you want them,

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.183
then you’re gonna have to go
through Ryuji Maesaka first!

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:36.960
‐ [sighs]
You’re getting on my nerves.

00:16:36.993 --> 00:16:39.231
[Ryuji sighs] This’ll be fun.

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:42.303
I’ve been waiting for a chance
to bust a cap in your head!

00:16:42.337 --> 00:16:45.142
‐ I’d like to see you
try it, big guy!

00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:48.717
REIN: I’m sorry.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.288
If I hadn’t gotten caught,
this wouldn’t have turned into

00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:53.927
an all‐out confrontation
with the Eighth Clan.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.000
‐ It was inevitable.
Don’t blame yourself.

00:16:57.033 --> 00:16:58.135
‐ Kaname.

00:16:58.168 --> 00:16:59.137
‐ I’ll get you somewhere

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.541
that’s at least kind of safe.

00:17:00.574 --> 00:17:03.479
After that, I want you to do
the thing that only you can do.

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:06.853
‐ There’s something
that only I can do?

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:10.226
‐ Crack the final code
and find the treasure.

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:12.497
We’ll buy you
the time you need somehow.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:16.940
Rein, I swear we’re gonna
clear this game together.

00:17:16.973 --> 00:17:17.942
RYUJI: That’s sad!

00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:20.012
Looks like all
your Sigil’s good for

00:17:20.046 --> 00:17:21.481
is running away!

00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:23.820
‐ I’m not running away.
I’m just thinking about

00:17:23.853 --> 00:17:25.824
all the fun ways
I can annihilate you!

00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:28.763
‐ Hah! Likewise, buddy!

00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:30.199
<i>That’s what I thought.</i>

00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:33.640
<i>The range of his teleportation</i>
<i>is about five meters maximum.</i>

00:17:33.673 --> 00:17:36.345
<i>And his slice attack</i>
<i>reaches about a meter.</i>

00:17:36.378 --> 00:17:39.451
<i>The trick is, he can’t</i>
<i>do both at the same time.</i>

00:17:39.484 --> 00:17:41.723
<i>So basically he’s a swordsman</i>

00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:44.729
<i>who can close a five‐meter gap</i>
<i>in a single instant.</i>

00:17:44.762 --> 00:17:46.431
<i>I think I can work with that.</i>

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:49.872
<i>If I shoot from 10 meters away,</i>

00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:53.813
It’s like he knows
he’s barely out of reach.

00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:55.550
‐ Wang! We did like you said

00:17:55.584 --> 00:17:57.922
and pulled people
from the south entrance!

00:17:57.955 --> 00:17:59.057
‐ Good to know.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.161

00:18:01.194 --> 00:18:03.566

‐ Looks like you lost
the Treasure Hunt.

00:18:29.017 --> 00:18:32.357
But you did win yourself
a consolation prize.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.396
You get to watch me
carve you up.

00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:36.733

00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:53.520

‐ [laughter]

so you’ll have to wait
until I finish carving this guy.

00:21:51.054 --> 00:21:53.458
Afterwards,
I’ll do the same to you.

‐ I think you might want
to hear what I have to say.

I already found the treasure

‐ Huh?

00:22:02.878 --> 00:22:05.817
‐ And you’re looking
at the key that opens it.

00:22:05.851 --> 00:22:09.390
I’ll hand it over to you
in exchange for my own safety.

00:22:09.424 --> 00:22:12.463
I call this "give and take."

00:22:12.496 --> 00:22:17.039

an impression, don’t you?
