00:09:57.093 --> 00:09:59.498
‐ I don’t have a lot of strength
in me right now,

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.703
but I should still
be able to make it work.

00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:04.274
The problem is,
I had to put down my weapons.

00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:06.312
‐ That’s an easy fix.

00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:09.986
We’re gonna survive, Shuka.

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:11.590
‐ Hey, Shinji!

00:10:11.623 --> 00:10:14.361
Bring those grenades over,
the whole box!

00:10:14.394 --> 00:10:15.764
‐ O‐Okay! Be right there!

00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:18.971
‐ Good. Now pass those babies
out to all our buddies here.

00:10:19.004 --> 00:10:20.908
Make sure we all
get three of ’em.

00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:22.745
They’re pretty easy
to use, ’kay?

00:10:22.778 --> 00:10:24.983
‐ All you do is pull out...
‐ No! Please don’t!

00:10:25.016 --> 00:10:27.187
‐ the pin and chuck it
as hard as you can.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.857
After five seconds...

00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:30.828
‐ [whimpering]
‐ it goes boom!

00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:33.667
‐ Shouldn’t have
had rings on you!

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.236
[explosion]

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.911
‐ [groans] Those dumb‐asses
are wasting our weapons again.

00:10:38.944 --> 00:10:40.815
Oh, well. At least, now we know

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:42.417
we can access the shop
during events.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.925
You’re a real genius, Wang.
I’m always amazed by you.

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.995
By the way, what are you
doing on your phone?

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:49.999
‐ Tell me, Kei,
how do you think

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:52.839
someone’s supposed to win
this Treasure Hunt?

00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:55.376
‐ The winner is the clan
that gathers the most rings

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.314
before time’s up, right?

00:10:57.347 --> 00:10:59.384
‐ Attaboy. You know something?

00:10:59.418 --> 00:11:00.955
This event would be
a whole lot easier

00:11:00.988 --> 00:11:04.194
if the rest of those idiot
players were as smart as you.

00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:05.163
‐ Whoa, really?

00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:07.869
Thanks! No one’s ever
called me smart before!

00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:10.541
‐ That’s a shame.
You’re very smart.

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:13.412
‐ [bells tolling]
‐ KEI: Huh?

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.097
[bells stop]

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.901
It stopped?

00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:25.303
‐ [cell phone buzzes]
‐ [gasps]

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.175
Looks like it’s time.

00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:31.482
All right! We just got
ourselves 30 more people,

00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:33.854
so I think we’re ready
to get to work.

00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:37.628
This is the end.

00:11:37.662 --> 00:11:40.433
Let’s go take that hotel down.

00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:47.715
‐ [sighs]

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:49.218
[Sui whimpers]

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.192
‐ Hmm?

00:11:57.067 --> 00:11:59.739
‐ So what do you think
we should do, Kaname?

00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:05.183
‐ About what? I can’t keep up.

00:12:05.216 --> 00:12:08.322
‐ Listen, I totally
get your story, kid,

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:11.362
but do you think I should let
you off with just an apology?

00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:12.565
SUI: Um, no!

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:16.038
I hurt you,
and I know that’s a bad thing.

00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:18.075
Saying sorry won’t fix it!

00:12:18.109 --> 00:12:21.415
So I’m giving up fighting,
if that helps at all.

00:12:21.448 --> 00:12:24.555
I want to live, but it isn’t
worth killing somebody else.

00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:25.591
‐ Is that so?

00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:26.726
Okay, then die.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.129
‐ [gasps]

00:12:28.162 --> 00:12:30.901
See, normally I would have
killed you on the spot.

00:12:32.137 --> 00:12:33.807
But in light
of the circumstances,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.644
I’ll forgive you this time.

00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:37.581
In fact, if I’m
being totally honest,

00:12:37.615 --> 00:12:39.619
I’m kind of grateful
for what you did.

00:12:39.652 --> 00:12:41.523
Turns out, trapping me
behind that ice wall

00:12:41.556 --> 00:12:42.792
was just the thing

00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:45.096
to bring my relationship
with Kaname to the next level.

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:48.670
‐ Um, okay. You’re welcome?

00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:51.375
‐ I’m glad to see
everything ended peacefully.

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:52.410
Though, I gotta say

00:12:52.444 --> 00:12:55.016
I’m surprised you’re dating
such a crazy chick.

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:56.786
‐ She is that,
but for the record,

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.356
Shuka and I aren’t dating.

00:12:58.389 --> 00:13:00.159
We only met two days ago.

00:13:00.193 --> 00:13:02.531
‐ Hey, have you planned
our next move yet?

00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:05.537
I’d like to change out
of these soaked clothes soon.

00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:08.677
‐ Good point. All three of us
are completely drenched.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.547
‐ I’m sorry! That’s my fault.

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.553
Um, listen. If you don’t mind,

00:13:13.587 --> 00:13:17.528
I’d be happy to use my Sigil
to dry them out for you.

00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:19.899
[water flowing]

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:23.139
‐ That’s quite a convenient
ability you’ve got there!

00:13:23.172 --> 00:13:24.441
I’m impressed.

00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:26.445
‐ Oh, it’s nothing.

00:13:26.478 --> 00:13:28.282
‐ Yeah, that’s handy.

00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:29.284
If you really wanted to,

00:13:29.318 --> 00:13:31.088
you could use it
to slaughter your enemies

00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:32.658
by slowly wringing
all the moisture

00:13:32.692 --> 00:13:33.794
out of their bodies.

00:13:33.827 --> 00:13:35.864
‐ No! I would never
do something so horrible!

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:38.035
And besides,
even if I wanted to,

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:40.473
I can’t make the water
move around that quickly.

00:13:40.507 --> 00:13:42.010
Sota’s a lot better than I am

00:13:42.043 --> 00:13:43.880
when it comes
to using our Sigils.

00:13:43.914 --> 00:13:45.383
‐ Sorry, who’s that?

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:48.657
‐ Oh, he’s my twin brother.
I mentioned him to you earlier.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.961
‐ Aww, you have
an imaginary friend!

00:13:50.994 --> 00:13:52.865
‐ No, he’s not imaginary!

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:56.005
I’m serious. My brother and I
share the same body.

00:13:56.038 --> 00:13:57.942
There was an accident.

00:13:57.975 --> 00:14:00.079
He died, and his soul came back,

00:14:00.113 --> 00:14:03.019
because that was
what I wished for in D‐Game!

00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:06.559
RYUJI: Hold on. That’s what you
"wished for" in D‐Game?

00:14:06.593 --> 00:14:09.331
‐ Yeah, that’s how it works!
My friends at school said so!

00:14:09.364 --> 00:14:12.838
In D‐Game, you end up with
whatever Sigil you wish for.

00:14:12.872 --> 00:14:14.842
RYUJI: I think
somebody told you wrong.

00:14:14.876 --> 00:14:16.813
‐ But I promise
that’s what happened.

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:19.184
‐ It’s settled.
I don’t know what your deal is,

00:14:19.217 --> 00:14:21.388
but you’re interesting,
so you’re part of our clan now.

00:14:21.422 --> 00:14:22.658
‐ Huh?

00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:24.562
‐ That’s cool, right, Kaname?

00:14:24.595 --> 00:14:27.300
‐ Oh, is that the big dilemma
we’re focusing on?

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.337
Sure. I don’t have
a problem with it.

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:31.676
‐ Wow. You don’t?

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.914
Well, I appreciate
your kindness and all,

00:14:33.947 --> 00:14:37.454
but unfortunately I’m not
really cut out for fighting.

00:14:37.487 --> 00:14:40.026
‐ That’s totally fine.
I mean, it’s not like

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:41.696
there’s any rule
that says you have to fight.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.702
‐ But if I can’t fight,
then how can I be useful to you?

00:14:44.736 --> 00:14:46.305
‐ You can clean
and do the laundry.

00:14:46.338 --> 00:14:49.512
‐ Oh. I’m good at that stuff.
I guess.

00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:52.083
‐ She almost kills Shuka,
and we give her a job?

00:14:52.117 --> 00:14:54.387
‐ Looks that way. At least
now we have enough people

00:14:54.421 --> 00:14:56.893
to say we’re a real clan,
so that’s good.

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:59.030
‐ Go ahead and recruit
all the freaks you want.

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:00.466
It makes no difference to me.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.772
As long as I make sure
Wang from Eighth Clan

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:04.141
fails this event, I’ll be happy.

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:05.978
‐ I’m not a mind reader
or anything,

00:15:06.011 --> 00:15:08.884
but it’s pretty obvious you
have it out for this Wang guy.

00:15:08.917 --> 00:15:10.554
Just remember one thing.

00:15:10.587 --> 00:15:13.960
We didn’t form this alliance
so that you can murder Wang.

00:15:13.994 --> 00:15:16.131
We did it so we could all
live through this event.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:19.204
‐ I guess that means we have
a difference of opinion then.

00:15:19.237 --> 00:15:22.477
[chuckles] I might as well do
what you say for now, though.

00:15:22.511 --> 00:15:23.880
I do owe you that much.

00:15:23.914 --> 00:15:25.016
‐ [explosion]
‐ [gasps]

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.990
Looks like they started early.

00:15:29.024 --> 00:15:31.529
It’s kinda hard to see
what’s going on from here.

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:33.934
KANAME: My guess is, when
that diamond ring popped up,

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:35.938
everyone dropped what they
were doing and went for it.

00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:38.810
‐ Should I take the rings
and act as a decoy?

00:15:38.844 --> 00:15:41.816
The plan was for us
to hide in the hotel, right?

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.354
‐ No. You’re not back
to full strength yet.

00:15:44.387 --> 00:15:46.258
Besides, with that
diamond ring in the mix,

00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:48.329
the hotel’s gonna be a war zone.

00:15:48.362 --> 00:15:51.970
<i>Not to mention the code</i>
<i>that Rein found.</i>

00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:54.509
<i>If my hunch</i>
<i>turns out to be right...</i>

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:55.611
[cell phone buzzes]

00:15:55.644 --> 00:15:58.349
That’s her! Let’s see here.

00:15:58.382 --> 00:15:59.417
[sighs]

00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:00.319
SHUKA: What’s wrong?

00:16:00.353 --> 00:16:03.192
‐ Shuka, throw away
all the rings you have.

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:05.429
We don’t need them anymore.

00:16:05.463 --> 00:16:06.231
‐ Huh?

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:07.701
‐ We’re gonna focus our energy

00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:09.204
on getting ahold
of the real treasure

00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:11.475
and putting this crazy‐ass event
behind us for good!

00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:14.982
HIIRAGI: What did Kaname say?

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:17.253
‐ Apparently he wants
to ditch the rings

00:16:17.287 --> 00:16:19.024
in a bid to clear the event.

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:20.393
I’m going to move on that.

00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:23.399
‐ A bold choice,
as I’d expect from him.

00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:25.971
‐ And what will you do,
Mr. Hiiragi?

00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:28.510
Even if all five of us
were in the hotel right now,

00:16:28.543 --> 00:16:30.246
I’m not confident
we’d stand a chance

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:31.916
at defeating that many enemies.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.321
‐ Hey, attack squad!

00:16:34.354 --> 00:16:35.122
You ready?

00:16:35.156 --> 00:16:36.659
Whatever this tree thing is,

00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:37.828
we’re gonna blast through it!

00:16:37.862 --> 00:16:40.466
‐ I can see almost 20 of them
on the ground.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.607
No matter how you look at it,
we’re severely outnumbered.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.276
‐ Go. You should
get out of here.

00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:47.948
Do me a favor, though,
and give Kaname my apology

00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:50.019
for not helping you guys out
in the end.

00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:51.789
‐ Wait. Does that mean
you’re planning to stay?

00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:55.631
‐ My daughter has a bad heart,
so I’m in dire need of funds.

00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:57.902
And that being the case,

00:16:57.935 --> 00:17:00.273
rather than an obscure
clearing of the game,

00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:02.778
I’m focusing on rings
’cause of their point values.

00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:06.953
I’ve even been lucky enough
to get the diamond ring.

00:17:06.986 --> 00:17:09.257
Come to think of it,
my daughter’s 12 now.

00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:11.696
She’s about
the same size as you.

00:17:11.729 --> 00:17:14.167
‐ Well, I’m actually 13.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.804
‐ Oh, I’m sorry.

00:17:15.837 --> 00:17:19.879
I know there’s quite a bit
of difference between 12 and 13.

00:17:19.912 --> 00:17:22.183
‐ Mr. Hiiragi,
if I were your daughter

00:17:22.217 --> 00:17:24.187
and I found out
that my father was gone,

00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:26.258
that he had died
in some strange place

00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:27.828
and I’d never see him again

00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:30.567
or hear him laugh again
or call my name,

00:17:30.601 --> 00:17:34.742
I’m certain that would be far
sadder than any disease I had.

00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:36.746
Anyway, that’s all I wanna say.

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:50.373
so I’ll do whatever I must.

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:52.310

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:54.548
Attack squad, advance! Go!

00:17:54.582 --> 00:17:57.821
‐ Weird. The hotel squatters
aren’t retaliating.

00:17:57.855 --> 00:18:00.627
‐ Those cowards, they probably
just laid a few traps and hid.

00:18:00.661 --> 00:18:03.432
Stay here.
I’ll go and see what’s up.

00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:06.104
‐ Hey, Sig,
you’re in charge of the front.

00:18:06.138 --> 00:18:08.475
‐ Don’t worry.
I won’t let you down.

00:18:10.313 --> 00:18:13.319
‐ Looks like they planted some
explosives around the place.

00:18:13.352 --> 00:18:14.555
‐ Well, that’s no sweat, then.

00:18:14.588 --> 00:18:16.926
All we have to do is
set ’em off from a distance.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.195
‐ That’s right. Come on!

00:18:18.228 --> 00:18:19.865
We’re gonna rampage
through this joint.

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:21.502
After all,
if we run out of grenades,

00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:23.105
we can just keep
buying more, right?

00:18:23.138 --> 00:18:26.078
‐ What’s up with
all these weird plants?

00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:28.182
It’s frickin’ creepy, dude.

00:18:28.215 --> 00:18:30.052
SIG: My guess is
it’s probably the Sigil

00:18:30.086 --> 00:18:31.455
of someone hiding here.

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:35.864
Actually, I’ve heard rumors
about a guy who controls plants.

00:18:35.897 --> 00:18:38.369
I think he goes by the Florist.

00:18:38.402 --> 00:18:39.905
‐ Hey, Sig, what do we do?

00:18:39.939 --> 00:18:41.375
To get up to the next level,

00:18:41.408 --> 00:18:44.447
we either gotta take an elevator
or the emergency stairs.

00:18:44.481 --> 00:18:46.786
‐ If we were being cautious,
we’d take the stairs.

00:18:46.819 --> 00:18:49.759
However, since our opponent
seems to controls plants,

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:50.861
that’s a different story.

00:18:50.894 --> 00:18:54.234
I can’t think of a more perfect
match for my Sigil!

00:18:57.708 --> 00:18:59.144
Doesn’t look like a trap.

00:18:59.177 --> 00:19:00.714
Cool. I’ll go do recon.

00:19:00.747 --> 00:19:03.887
‐ Hold on. Shouldn’t we send
a few people with you?

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.624
‐ Nah, there’s no need for that.

00:19:05.657 --> 00:19:08.462
I’ll call you guys up
soon as I’m sure it’s safe.

00:19:10.634 --> 00:19:14.374
Well, guess I could start
with the top floor first.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.282

00:19:18.315 --> 00:19:20.353
The Florist is definitely
in here somewhere.

00:19:20.386 --> 00:19:22.090
Good thing I can do this!

00:19:22.123 --> 00:19:23.660

00:19:31.976 --> 00:19:34.715
How anticlimactic.

00:19:36.018 --> 00:19:37.453
Hey, I guessed right.

00:19:37.487 --> 00:19:39.692
Looks like all the rings
are here on the top floor.

00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:43.265
Scattered throughout the rooms,
from what I can tell.

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:44.635
I don’t get it, though.

00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:47.608
They only left a few traps?
No ambush?

00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:50.212
Don’t tell me they
just dumped 20 rings up here,

00:19:50.246 --> 00:19:52.383
then ran away
and left them for us to find.

Nice, he did it!
I knew Sig had this!

00:19:57.427 --> 00:19:59.030
‐ I’m really glad to hear that.

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.166
I wasn’t looking forward

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.569
to walkin’ up
40 flights of stairs.

00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:03.640
‐ I’m sure this won’t come
as any surprise,

00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:07.046
but we’re not gonna fit in
one elevator at the same time,

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.150
so we’ll take two trips.

00:20:09.184 --> 00:20:11.188
The enemy hasn’t given us
a welcome yet,

00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:13.693
but they probably
won’t be as shy upstairs!

00:20:13.727 --> 00:20:15.196

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:50.574

00:22:53.345 --> 00:22:56.184

00:22:56.218 --> 00:22:57.654
<i>I thought maybe</i>
<i>they could be ranked</i>

<i>by the value</i>
<i>of the corresponding gem,</i>

00:22:59.892 --> 00:23:01.562
<i>but determining</i>
<i>the value of the gems</i>

00:23:01.596 --> 00:23:04.635
<i>by type and weight alone</i>
<i>is no simple matter.</i>

00:23:05.804 --> 00:23:06.739
<i>Okay, then.</i>

00:23:06.772 --> 00:23:08.643
<i>Is there some</i>
