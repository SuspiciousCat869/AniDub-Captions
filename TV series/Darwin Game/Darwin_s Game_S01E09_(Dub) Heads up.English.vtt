[tense music playing]

00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:11.189
‐ I heard about the player
who won the special privilege

00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:13.794
of organizing for‐profit matches
within D‐Game.

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.565
‐ A lot of customers
are interested

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.203
in martial arts battles
that allow Sigils.

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:20.073
These fights
are relatively safe

00:00:20.107 --> 00:00:21.710
compared to other
in‐game matches,

00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:22.979
so that’s a bonus.

00:00:23.013 --> 00:00:25.417
Normally,
a duel between you and me

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.856
would attract
a pretty big audience,

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:30.628
but it’s only us here today.

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:34.970
‐ So are there any rules, or is
it literally anything goes?

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:36.372
‐ Anything goes.

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:38.778
The idea of challenging
your opponent

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:40.347
with no limitations whatsoever

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.754
comes from the Brazilian
fighting style of Vale Tudo.

00:00:43.788 --> 00:00:46.827
But "no holds barred" means
something different to everyone.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.234
For me, I’m a martial artist,
so I don’t use tools.

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:53.206
‐ So the "anything goes"
just applies to me, then.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.210
Sweet. I’ll take
any handicap I can get.

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:58.985
‐ You can use your Sigil,
weapons, anything you want.

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:00.655
That said, I have two requests,

00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:03.961
no destroying the building,
and no intentional killing.

00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:06.399
Does that sound like
a fair fight to you, kid?

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:09.338
‐ Oh, so if I kill you
by accident, that’s okay?

00:01:09.372 --> 00:01:11.810
‐ You’ll be the referee, Inukai.

00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:12.913
‐ Me? Really?

00:01:12.946 --> 00:01:15.384
<i>I can’t referee</i>

00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:16.887
<i>Come on!</i>

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:19.693
Okay. This’ll be
a 10‐minute match,

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:20.962
so I’ll start the timer now.

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:24.101
The duel is over when one of you
can’t or won’t fight anymore.

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:25.370
‐ Intentional killing‐‐

00:01:25.404 --> 00:01:28.009
When do I get to start
using my Sigil?

00:01:28.043 --> 00:01:29.345
DANJO: Whenever you like.

00:01:29.378 --> 00:01:31.382
We’ll use the activation
of your power

00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:32.919
as the signal
to start the match.

00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:35.725
‐ Hey, wait a second. Do you
want me to be the ref or not?

00:01:35.758 --> 00:01:37.662
‐ Here we go!

00:01:45.712 --> 00:01:47.181
Inukai was right.

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:49.820
You’ve got excellent reflexes
and plenty of resolve.

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:51.222
Not bad at all.

00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:54.261
But you still haven’t proved
you’re worthy of an alliance!

00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:56.767

I’m just getting started.

I showed up

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.159
at a good time.

00:03:33.193 --> 00:03:34.663
‐ I’m surprised
you’re here.

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:37.201
Did you meet up
with that insurance guy?

00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:39.639
‐ Yes. The whole thing
went off without a hitch.

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:41.844
So how are things going
over here?

00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:42.846
‐ Slow.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.215
They just started the fight.

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.399
<i>And I was right!</i>

00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:57.007
Whoa!

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.780
<i>He’s survived for this long</i>

00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:20.487

00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:22.458
<i>What’s gonna happen?</i>

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:24.195
‐ The machete’s new.

00:04:24.228 --> 00:04:26.399
What is that,
your little secret weapon?

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.468
‐ This is nothing.

00:04:27.502 --> 00:04:29.472
I’m full of fun surprises!

00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:33.079
‐ I’ll give you one thing.

00:04:33.113 --> 00:04:35.016
You’re keeping me on my toes!

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.789
‐ Since when does Kaname
have a Skorpion?

00:04:37.822 --> 00:04:38.691
That’s a good gun.

00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:41.129
‐ You really know
your stuff, Analyst.

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:43.433
Don’t go selling
Kaname’s info now.

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:45.505
‐ Come on.

00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:48.076
Do you actually think
I’m that kind of person?

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:50.147
‐ Well, you’re not the only one

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.917
who’s been hard at work
during all of this.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.392
He picked up that gun and blade
from an arms dealer I know.

00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:58.496
He needed more firepower,

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.233
and that was
the fastest way to do it.

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:02.104
‐ [sighs] Did you
take him to Lee’s?

00:05:02.137 --> 00:05:03.941
‐ [grunts]
‐ That place is such a rip‐off.

00:05:03.974 --> 00:05:05.678
‐ You do know everything!

00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:09.118
Remind me
not to get on your bad side.

00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:10.688
And, yeah, my old buddy’s place

00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.092
is a little cheaper
than that, but...

00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:14.896
‐ You mean the one in Shibuya?

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.067
Good thinking.
It’s probably safer for us

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.104
to stay away
from Eighth Clan territory.

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:21.777
‐ Am I that easy to figure out?

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.716
Either way,
looks like it’s working.

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:28.022
He’s holding his own against
the fourth‐best D‐Game player.

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:30.193
‐ Yes, naturally,
a submachine gun

00:05:30.227 --> 00:05:32.397
is effective
against an unarmed opponent.

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:35.003
It’s certainly helping him
keep his distance.

00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:38.544
Problem is, Kaname’s already
laid all his cards on the table,

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:41.148
and Danjo still
hasn’t revealed his Sigil.

00:05:41.182 --> 00:05:42.150
That’s not good.

00:05:42.184 --> 00:05:44.756
If something
doesn’t change soon,

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.729
I’m not sure whether this
alliance is going to pan out.

00:05:47.762 --> 00:05:49.265
KANAME: <i>Damn it.</i>

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:51.135
<i>I’m running out of ideas.</i>

00:05:51.168 --> 00:05:52.505
<i>Here’s one more grenade.</i>

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:55.611
<i>Crap! He saw it coming!</i>

00:05:58.383 --> 00:05:59.920
<i>No way.</i>

00:05:59.953 --> 00:06:02.291
<i>How is he that strong?</i>

00:06:02.324 --> 00:06:03.861
‐ I hope you’re ready.

00:06:03.894 --> 00:06:05.631

[gasps]

00:06:15.116 --> 00:06:16.219
‐ I’d keep going,

00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:18.824
but that would be
just too cruel.

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:21.495
‐ Yeah? I thought we weren’t
gonna hold anything back!

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.667

00:06:29.713 --> 00:06:32.518
[crackling]

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:37.695
The hand grenade was a bluff.

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.766
You used a flashbang instead.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:43.406
So your victories against
A‐rankers weren’t just luck.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.978
‐ Well, blowing myself up
would only get me so far.

00:06:46.012 --> 00:06:48.249
Have you had enough already?

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.420
‐ All right, kid,
you’ve won me over!

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:53.627
I’ve decided you have
what it takes to be my ally!

00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.365
That said, I’m not ready
for the fun to end yet!

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.434
Let’s go!

00:06:57.467 --> 00:06:59.906
‐ This hasn’t been fun for me,
but okay!

than he was on video.

00:07:29.064 --> 00:07:31.803
‐ Is she a friend of Danjo’s
or something?

00:07:31.837 --> 00:07:34.174
‐ Oh, dear. Xuelan’s involved.

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:35.443
She isn’t a bad person.

00:07:35.477 --> 00:07:37.347
She’s just
a bit troublesome at times.

00:07:37.381 --> 00:07:40.120
‐ Xuelan?
As in the number‐one player?

00:07:40.153 --> 00:07:41.690

Kaname’s been kidnapped?

00:07:53.112 --> 00:07:54.315
You just stood there
and watched?

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:55.651
‐ Of course I didn’t!

00:07:55.685 --> 00:07:58.189
I hate to say it,
but I couldn’t do a thing!

00:07:58.222 --> 00:08:01.262
‐ Before I knew it, Kaname
was out cold on the gym floor.

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:03.266
Then she gave us one look,

00:08:03.299 --> 00:08:05.370
and bam,
we were unconscious too!

00:08:05.403 --> 00:08:08.242
‐ What are you saying?
That makes no sense!

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:09.646
RYUJI:
I don’t understand either!

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:13.386
‐ Whoever she is, it sounds
like her Sigil’s really scary.

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:17.227
‐ Actually, that ability doesn’t
come from her Sigil at all.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.298
‐ Seriously?

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:20.735
‐ She was using that technique

00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:22.972
before she had
anything to do with D‐Game.

00:08:23.006 --> 00:08:25.578
According to Danjo,
it’s a practice

00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:28.617
that originated
in ancient Eastern martial arts.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.355
When her "energy swords"
hit their target,

00:08:31.389 --> 00:08:33.594
the effect is like
a simulated death.

00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:35.731
I don’t want
to believe it, but...

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.771
SHUKA: How can we be sure that
Danjo is trustworthy, though?

00:08:38.804 --> 00:08:41.777
Because it kinda sounds
like he laid a trap for Kaname.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.578
‐ Not true.

00:08:42.612 --> 00:08:44.214
It’s obvious that Danjo

00:08:44.248 --> 00:08:45.985
considers Xuelan to be an ally,

00:08:46.018 --> 00:08:49.324
and maybe she’s even
something of a mentor to him,

00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:51.162
but he seemed
as surprised as we were.

00:08:51.195 --> 00:08:53.967
‐ I’m not sure if I’m
willing to believe that.

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.838
RYUJI: Either way,
Kaname’s our leader.

00:08:55.871 --> 00:08:57.909
We have to figure something out.

00:08:57.942 --> 00:08:58.944
‐ That’s a given.

00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:01.917
We’re getting him back,
no matter what it takes.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.023

where to look for him.

00:09:05.056 --> 00:09:06.192

’Cause I
tracked him down myself.

Liu Xuelan.

00:09:23.527 --> 00:09:25.865
You’re the highest‐ranked
player in D‐Game,

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.436
so what the hell
could you want with me?

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:31.910
‐ Call me Xuelan.
I’ll call you Kaname.

00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:34.214
I much prefer
not to stand on ceremony.

00:09:34.248 --> 00:09:37.187
‐ Okay, but don’t you think
tying me up is overdoing it?

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.959
‐ No, I’m taking
the appropriate precautions.

00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:42.431
I can’t risk letting you
use that Sigil of yours.

00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:46.172
Finally, someone who’s more fit
to be an assassin than I am.

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:47.542
‐ Assassin?

00:09:47.575 --> 00:09:49.746
‐ I’ve also been
called a hit woman.

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:50.948
Same thing, really.

00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:52.552
‐ A hit woman?

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:55.023
‐ I come from a long line
of assassins

00:09:55.056 --> 00:09:57.628
that goes back
more than 2,000 years.

00:09:57.662 --> 00:09:58.764
Through the ages,

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:01.302
we’ve influenced history
from the shadows.

00:10:01.335 --> 00:10:02.772
No matter the era,

00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:05.043
there’s always a demand
for the work I do.

00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:07.915
‐ Whatever.
Just tell me what you’re after.

00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:09.819
I figure if you
wanted to kill me,

00:10:09.853 --> 00:10:12.090
you would have
just done it already!

00:10:12.124 --> 00:10:13.226
‐ Of course.

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:15.363
I’ll get straight to the point.

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:17.400
I want to employ you.

00:10:17.434 --> 00:10:19.171
‐ Employ me?

00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:22.077
‐ Trust me, I’ll have
plenty of challenging tasks

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.012
to keep you busy.

00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:24.816
But once you know
what the reward is,

00:10:24.849 --> 00:10:26.753
I believe you’ll find
that it’s worth your while.

00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:28.189
‐ Give me a break.

00:10:28.222 --> 00:10:30.694
There’s no way I’m gonna
kill people for money.

00:10:30.728 --> 00:10:33.534
‐ Do you have any idea
how gifted you are?

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:34.536
‐ Huh?

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:36.372
‐ Just an average high‐schooler

00:10:36.405 --> 00:10:38.844
unknowingly harboring
a great talent,

00:10:38.877 --> 00:10:42.618
until D‐Game allowed you
to fully manifest it.

00:10:44.254 --> 00:10:46.492
‐ I’m guessing
you’re talking about my Sigil?

00:10:46.526 --> 00:10:47.795
‐ Oh, don’t play dumb.

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:51.202
A good Sigil
is just icing on the cake.

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:53.005
Surely you realize by now.

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:55.978
Your real talent is for combat.

00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:59.986
Specifically war,
the most brutal kind.

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:02.592
You have more potential
for that than anyone.

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:05.163
When you face your enemy
and rush into battle

00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:08.537
with your vast arsenal
of weapons at your fingertips,

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.306
your body is
overwhelmed with euphoria,

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.214
but your mind remains
stone‐cold sober to the core.

00:11:14.248 --> 00:11:15.818
‐ Are you crazy?

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:17.020
‐ Those who are capable enough

00:11:17.053 --> 00:11:19.391
to truly step up
and shine in a war zone

00:11:19.424 --> 00:11:20.995
are few and far between.

00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:23.867
Luckily, you’re sitting
with the one person alive

00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:25.036
who can take your talent

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:27.407
and develop it
into something unbelievable.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.779
It just so happens my family

00:11:29.812 --> 00:11:32.885
has recently been thinking
about welcoming a successor.

00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:35.490
‐ You can’t be serious.

00:11:35.524 --> 00:11:37.160
‐ Of course I’m serious.

00:11:37.193 --> 00:11:41.335
It would be such a tragedy to
let our skills die out with me.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.005
Therefore,

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:45.376
I would very much like
to bear your child.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.880
Doing so would ensure

00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:49.351
the stability
of the next generation.

00:11:49.384 --> 00:11:50.821
‐ That was either a joke

00:11:50.854 --> 00:11:52.992
or the worst pickup line
in the world.

00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:55.330
‐ [radio crackles]
‐ [gasps]

00:11:55.363 --> 00:11:57.300
‐ Pardon me, My Lady,

00:11:57.334 --> 00:11:59.271
but we’re being chased.

00:11:59.304 --> 00:12:00.674
Shall I shake them off?

00:12:00.708 --> 00:12:02.912
[dramatic music playing]

00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:05.851
‐ He’s in the car, and it
looks like he’s unharmed!

00:12:05.884 --> 00:12:08.389
REIN: Apparently,
the transmitter I placed on him

00:12:08.422 --> 00:12:09.559
has been destroyed,

00:12:09.592 --> 00:12:11.663
but his cell phone’s
still intact.

00:12:11.696 --> 00:12:13.499
‐ Thanks for that.
It’s a good thing

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:15.169
you’re always
one step ahead, Rein.

00:12:15.203 --> 00:12:18.142
‐ I had a feeling we would
run into something like this.

00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:21.315
Kaname stood out too much
during the Treasure Hunt event.

00:12:21.348 --> 00:12:22.450
‐ That’s enough chitchat!

00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:24.154
Floor it, already!

00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:25.958
Just smash into them!

00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:30.066
[dramatic music playing]

00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:37.414
‐ So my threat
didn’t scare them away?

00:12:37.447 --> 00:12:39.652
You’re quite
a popular young man.

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:41.923
There must be
some affection there.

00:12:41.957 --> 00:12:44.529
Or they’re just stubborn fools.

00:12:44.562 --> 00:12:46.198
But you’re not a fool, right?

00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:48.804
So you know they have
no chance against me.

00:12:48.837 --> 00:12:50.406
Tell them to retreat now.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.843
[phone line ringing]

00:12:51.876 --> 00:12:53.614
‐ SHUKA: Kaname?
‐ Shuka, hey!

00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:55.951
<i>‐ Is that you?</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>

00:12:57.454 --> 00:13:00.493
‐ Cause a crash if you have to!
Just stop this car!

00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:01.997
I’ll figure out the rest!

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.065
‐ [gasps]

00:13:03.099 --> 00:13:05.938
You don’t know
when to give up, Kaname.

00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:08.577
That’s all right.
I like that quality in a man.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.914
‐ Listen,
I can see you’re a badass,

00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:13.352
maybe even
the best assassin there is.

00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:16.158
That’s why you’re
the top‐ranked player.

00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:18.095
But there are a lot of problems

00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:20.734
that can’t be solved
by killing people!

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:23.974
In fact, I’ve stayed
alive for this long

00:13:24.007 --> 00:13:26.378
because I haven’t
taken any lives.

00:13:26.412 --> 00:13:29.952
I refuse to obey someone
who only knows how to kill.

00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:32.223
So how about this?
I challenge you

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:34.394
to escape my clan,
the Sunset Ravens,

00:13:34.428 --> 00:13:35.798
without killing a single soul!

00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:37.802
If you can do that,
I’ll be your employee,

00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:39.806
your husband,
whatever you want!

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:42.578
‐ Really, now?
And how do I know you mean it?

00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:45.751
‐ Are you kidding me?
I’d fall in love with any woman

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:48.557
who could pull off
an escape like that.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.426
‐ Can’t this thing
go any faster?

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.428
I only bought this car

00:13:51.462 --> 00:13:53.366
because you told me
it was quick and sturdy!

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.704
‐ I’ve got the pedal
to the metal, I swear!

00:13:55.738 --> 00:13:57.875
Don’t worry. We’re closing in!

00:13:57.908 --> 00:14:00.013
‐ I’m going
to shoot out their tires.

00:14:00.046 --> 00:14:02.450
Please try to keep the car
as steady as possible.

00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:04.121
‐ What about your injury?

00:14:04.154 --> 00:14:07.093
‐ It’s all right. I was just
about to start rehab anyway.

00:14:07.127 --> 00:14:09.899
‐ But, Rein,
is it safe to use guns?

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:10.901
The police might‐‐

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.303
‐ Sui, I need you to initiate

00:14:12.337 --> 00:14:14.141
an Encounter Battle
in the D‐Game app!

00:14:14.174 --> 00:14:17.882
‐ I get it. We can use
D‐Game’s concealment mode!

00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:19.786
The clan battle’s starting now!

00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:22.157
‐ Right on!
It’s time for our first fight

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.227
as the Sunset Ravens!
Let’s do this!

00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:26.331
‐ I know this
isn’t important right now,

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.970
but where’d "Sunset Ravens"
come from?

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:31.175
What do ravens
have to do with us?

00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:33.145
Who decided to call us that
and when?

00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:34.414
‐ Hey, ravens are adorable!

00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:36.118
‐ ’Cause they’re
the toughest birds in the world!

00:14:36.151 --> 00:14:38.022
SUI: ...protect their families
so it make sense!

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:45.571
‐ All right.
Time to even the score.

00:14:46.873 --> 00:14:48.008
Laplace!

00:14:51.482 --> 00:14:53.620
It’s no good.
The tires are bulletproof.

00:14:53.653 --> 00:14:55.524
We need to try something else!

00:14:55.557 --> 00:14:57.026
RYUJI: They’re slowing down.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.162
Hang on. I’ll catch up!

00:14:58.195 --> 00:15:00.166
‐ No, this is close enough!

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.636
Let me take over from here.

00:15:01.669 --> 00:15:03.105
‐ Keep tailing them!
‐ Roger!

00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:09.017
‐ I see. Turns out
the source of your confidence

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.221
is this little thing.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.731
If I can subdue her,
then you’ll be all mine.

00:15:15.764 --> 00:15:17.100
‐ I’d tell you to surrender,

00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:19.438
but I’m about to kill you,
so why bother?

00:15:19.471 --> 00:15:23.245
‐ Oh, dear. Don’t you see
the gap in our abilities?

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.316
Let’s make this quick
so Kaname and I

00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:28.222
can get back to talking
about him falling for me.

00:15:28.255 --> 00:15:29.291
‐ Die!

00:15:31.428 --> 00:15:32.598
‐ [chuckles]

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.367
I promised I wouldn’t kill.

00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:36.873
I just want you
to feel the pain.

00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:38.810

[rock music playing]

00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:57.280
‐ It’s rare for an opponent
to be able to move

00:15:57.313 --> 00:15:59.785
so soon after my energy sword
hits them.

00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:02.357
And you’re such a young girl.
Aren’t you afraid to die?

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.729
‐ The way I see it,
if I didn’t want to die,

00:16:04.762 --> 00:16:06.064
I shouldn’t have
been born at all.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.935
RYUJI: <i>Does Shuka</i>

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:09.505

00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:12.277

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.426
<i>I need to disarm her!</i>

<i>Now!</i>

SHUKA: Keep your guard up!

00:16:43.607 --> 00:16:45.343

‐ Ryuji, you have to keep
the car moving straight!

‐ I’m trying, but it’s
not cooperating with me!

00:17:07.053 --> 00:17:09.926
I think she must have messed
with the steering somehow!

00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:45.396
<i>And if she can’t restrain me</i>
<i>with her weapons, then...</i>

00:17:45.429 --> 00:17:46.331
‐ [gasps]

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.137
‐ Do it!

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.741
‐ Castor Light!

00:17:52.578 --> 00:17:54.548
[tires squealing]

00:17:56.084 --> 00:17:57.521
‐ Everybody hold on!

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:00.794
‐ [grunts]

00:18:00.827 --> 00:18:02.731
[sparks crackling]

00:18:05.837 --> 00:18:07.206
[engine hisses]

00:18:08.944 --> 00:18:10.647
‐ Shuka! Are you okay?

00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:11.716
‐ Kaname!

00:18:11.749 --> 00:18:12.985
Thank goodness!

00:18:13.018 --> 00:18:14.889
That girl didn’t molest you,
did she?

00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:16.926
‐ She sure as hell tried.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.228
Wait. Where’d she go?

00:18:18.262 --> 00:18:19.932
‐ Well, look at you.

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:22.270
You’ve actually put together
a decent team.

00:18:22.303 --> 00:18:24.074
‐ Yeah, and we beat you,

00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:25.811
so you have to honor our deal.

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:27.715
‐ Oh, that’s adorable.

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:29.084
After the way things played out,

00:18:29.117 --> 00:18:31.188
do you honestly believe
you can claim the win?

00:18:31.221 --> 00:18:33.994
We both know that
your greatest asset in battle

00:18:34.027 --> 00:18:36.164
is dangling
from that beam over there,

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:38.737
which means this area
is under my control.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.272
<i>‐ She’s right.</i>

00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:42.511
<i>Shuka’s the only one</i>
<i>on her level.</i>

00:18:42.544 --> 00:18:45.316
‐ I’m ready to hear
your admission of defeat now.

00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:48.288
‐ With all due respect,
Madam, we lost this match.

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:50.493
‐ And what on Earth
makes you think that, Ximing?

00:18:50.527 --> 00:18:53.232
‐ For one thing,
I’m concerned about the damage

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.469
our car suffered
in this confrontation.

00:18:55.504 --> 00:18:57.173
It would be dangerous
to drive it

00:18:57.206 --> 00:18:58.710
without having it inspected.

00:18:58.743 --> 00:19:01.516
And of course Kaname’s vehicle
won’t be drivable again

00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:04.287
until they’re able
to replace all of the tires.

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:06.626
‐ I’m willing to wait
for those things to happen.

00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:09.832
‐ But without a car,
we can’t escape from that girl,

00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:11.602
so despite
your promise you made,

00:19:11.636 --> 00:19:13.506
I believe
it’s no longer possible

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.178
to leave this battle
without killing.

00:19:16.211 --> 00:19:17.648
As I’m sure you’re aware,

00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:20.386
it takes time to reel in
a big fish like this.

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:24.729
Therefore, let’s make time
our ally, not our foe.

00:19:24.762 --> 00:19:25.530
‐ [annoyed] Really.

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:28.503
I wasn’t expecting that
from you.

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:32.043
<i>I’m not sure I’d call him</i>
<i>an undiscovered genius.</i>

00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:35.016
<i>Perhaps a diamond in the rough.</i>

00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:37.020
All right. Then I lose.

00:19:37.053 --> 00:19:39.024
ANNOUNCER: <i>The game is over!</i>

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:41.963
<i>Sunset Ravens were victorious!</i>

00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:43.600
‐ Did we really win?

00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:46.038
‐ To be fair, it’s more
like she stopped the fight

00:19:46.071 --> 00:19:47.140
as a show of mercy.

00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:48.242
SOTA: Good enough for me!

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:49.545
A win is a win!

00:19:49.578 --> 00:19:52.050
RYUJI: I guess so.

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:53.987
‐ Are you sure this is okay?

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.289
‐ Yeah, it’s great.

00:19:55.322 --> 00:19:57.226
We went up against
the top‐ranked player

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.032
and beat her
with zero casualties.

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:01.368
Listen up, Xuelan.

00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:03.506
No recruiting my teammates.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.911
If we work together,
we need ground rules.

00:20:05.944 --> 00:20:07.313
‐ Nonsense.

00:20:07.346 --> 00:20:11.188
If you recall, I never promised
anything if you won the match.

00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:12.925
Why would I negotiate
about something

00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.929
I never agreed to
in the first place?

00:20:14.962 --> 00:20:15.931
‐ [gasps]

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:17.133
<i>She’s right.</i>

00:20:17.166 --> 00:20:19.304
<i>We never worked out</i>
<i>her end of the deal.</i>

00:20:19.337 --> 00:20:22.477
‐ But that doesn’t mean
I won’t help you.

00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:26.552
I’ll join Sunset Ravens,
and Ximing will follow suit.

00:20:26.586 --> 00:20:28.623
This way, I can judge
whether you’re enough of a man

00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:30.493
‐ to stand at my side.
‐ [gasps]

00:20:30.527 --> 00:20:32.263
‐ [both gasp]
‐ [chuckles]

00:20:32.296 --> 00:20:34.367
Sounds like a perfect setup.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.637
‐ I won’t allow it!

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.108
’Cause she’s arrogant!
She won’t listen to you!

00:20:38.142 --> 00:20:39.477
‐ Don’t do it, Kaname.

00:20:39.512 --> 00:20:41.248
You’re letting a fox
in the henhouse!

00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:42.951
‐ We shouldn’t make deals
with an outsider,

00:20:42.985 --> 00:20:45.022
much less allow her
to be in our clan!

00:20:45.055 --> 00:20:46.091
KANAME: That’s true.

00:20:46.124 --> 00:20:48.663
I’m sure she has
no sense of camaraderie

00:20:48.696 --> 00:20:51.869
and she would betray us all
at the drop of a hat.

00:20:51.903 --> 00:20:54.909
But she isn’t the type
to go back on her word.

00:20:54.942 --> 00:20:56.846
She proved that to us today.

00:20:56.879 --> 00:20:59.985
So I’m gonna let you
join the Sunset Ravens

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:01.856
if you can make me one promise.

00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:03.025
‐ What’s that?

00:21:03.058 --> 00:21:06.398
‐ If you ever decide
to betray our clan,

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.770
then you come after me first.

00:21:08.803 --> 00:21:12.243
I refuse to let you attack
anyone else before me.

00:21:13.613 --> 00:21:15.917
‐ [chuckles]
Fine, I promise.

00:21:15.951 --> 00:21:16.853
If that ever happens,

00:21:16.886 --> 00:21:19.124
then yours will be
the first back that I stab.

00:21:19.157 --> 00:21:20.259
‐ [gasps]

00:21:21.261 --> 00:21:24.000
Hmph. Then welcome
to the Sunset Ravens.

00:21:25.637 --> 00:21:28.576
I guess that
makes us allies, right?

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.987
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:02.731 --> 00:23:04.602
‐ [static crackles]
‐ WANG: <i>Hey, Shinji,</i>

00:23:04.635 --> 00:23:05.870
<i>turn the camera on, would you?</i>

00:23:05.904 --> 00:23:07.808
‐ [sobbing]
‐ <i>I’m already filming, sir!</i>

00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:09.612
<i>‐ Then you</i>
<i>gotta come in closer.</i>

00:23:09.645 --> 00:23:12.183
<i>Otherwise, we’re never</i>
<i>gonna get the message across!</i>

00:23:12.216 --> 00:23:13.686
<i>‐ Uh, right!</i>
<i>‐ All right.</i>

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.559
<i>Kaname Sudo,</i>
<i>are you watching?</i>

00:23:16.592 --> 00:23:18.161
<i>It’s your buddy, Wang.</i>

00:23:18.195 --> 00:23:19.497
<i>I couldn’t</i>
<i>get in touch with you</i>

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:21.334
<i>on account of not knowing</i>
<i>where you’re hiding,</i>

00:23:21.368 --> 00:23:22.671
<i>so I decided I would make you</i>

00:23:22.704 --> 00:23:24.508
<i>a little video greeting</i>
<i>to say hello.</i>

00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:28.081
<i>And you’ll probably recognize</i>
<i>my chubby costar here.</i>

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:30.553
<i>Hey! Lift up your head!</i>

00:23:30.587 --> 00:23:33.458
<i>Poor pathetic bastard!</i>
<i>Kinda looks like his days</i>

00:23:33.492 --> 00:23:35.964
<i>of holding chopsticks and</i>
<i>teacups are over for good.</i>

00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:38.168
<i>And if you don’t</i>
<i>come to talk to me soon,</i>

00:23:38.201 --> 00:23:39.470
<i>he’s not gonna</i>
<i>be able to take</i>

00:23:39.505 --> 00:23:41.709
<i>any more</i>
<i>afternoon strolls, either.</i>

00:23:41.742 --> 00:23:44.414
<i>You can figure out the location</i>
<i>for yourself, dumb‐ass.</i>

00:23:44.447 --> 00:23:45.817
<i>I’ll see you there.</i>

00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:50.159
KANAME: <i>Next time: "Old One."</i>
