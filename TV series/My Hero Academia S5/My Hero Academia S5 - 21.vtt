00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.681 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] When superpowers
first appeared, it was chaos.

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:17.017 position:50% align:center
People across the planet
had to find peaceful ways

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.310 position:50% align:center
to adapt to a new reality.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:23.773 position:50% align:center
Eventually, an ideology started
circulating among metahumans.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.860 position:50% align:center
Not Quirk suppression,
but liberation.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
Many believed the freedom
to use meta abilities

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
was a natural right.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.117 position:50% align:center
Especially Chikara Yotsubashi.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
He called himself Destro,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.413 position:50% align:center
the man who would
destroy the present.

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] In his time, he brought
together likeminded people

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.005 position:50% align:center
and formed the
Metahuman Liberation Army.

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
After confronting the government

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.593 position:50% align:center
and struggling against them,
they were defeated.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
Members were arrested,

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
and the organization was
thought to be dissolved.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50% align:center
Destro ended up writing
a book in prison

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.311 position:50% align:center
before committing suicide.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.483 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] When he left this world,
Destro had no idea

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.235 position:50% align:center
that he had a child. An heir.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.614 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
How are things progressing?

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.032 position:50% align:center
We managed to track down someone

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.242 position:50% align:center
who has solid connections
to the League.

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.120 position:50% align:center
If we're going to approach them,
the sooner the better.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.706 position:50% align:center
They're enemies of the
Liberation Army.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.209 position:50% align:center
If the government continues
to stand idly by,

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:27.337 position:50% align:center
we have no choice but to
deal with them ourselves.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.756 position:50% align:center
We will take down
the League of Villains.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.675 position:50% align:center
In Destro's name.

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center
[SPINNER]
Welcome to the suburbs.

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
Completely unremarkable.

[TWICE]
I like the atmosphere.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.027 position:50% align:center
This place sucks!

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.740 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS] There's
a force 110,000 strong below?

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50% align:center
Once Machia wakes up
in an hour and 40 minutes,

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:24.454 position:50% align:center
he'll chase Shigaraki
to this stage.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:25.705 position:50% align:center
When he makes his entrance,

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50% align:center
he'll run into the
so-called Liberation Army.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center
Hopefully we last
until the curtain call.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
How did I get tricked
into going along

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center
with such a stupid plan?

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Giran introduced
you to the League, too?

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center

What's that matter?

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center

[SLIDIN' GO]
A friend approaches!

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
I have been commanded
to act as your guide today,

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
so if you want to speak
with our esteemed leader,

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
you can follow my lead!

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
A hero?

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
Though not a well-known one.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.368 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
There's nobody here.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
I get it. It's the whole city.

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50% align:center

Isn't that Hanabata,

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
from the Hearts and Mind Party?

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center

lying about their numbers!

[TWICE]
It doesn't matter!

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
We're here! Where's Giran?

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
You must mean the broker.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
He's with our grand commander.
I'm sure he's being entertained.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Didn't you say you'd
give him back if we came.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
I must interview you.

[pants]

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
Nope.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
[GIRAN]
You made two mistakes.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
First, you're treating an old
man as the damsel in distress,

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
which is embarrassing
for everybody.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
Second, if they let a
bioengineered Nomu loose,

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
your people here don't
stand a chance against it.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
They won't be releasing
any of those monsters.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
There are three reasons.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50% align:center
Seems I'm more
informed than you.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.279 position:50% align:center
One: ever since Camino,
we haven't seen

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
any widespread use of
the creatures, even though

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
the League is still active
and carrying out plots.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center
Two:

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
there's that high-performance
Nomu that appeared in Kyushu.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center
What's most important
here is the gray Nomu

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
that the black one discharged.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
That's what I'm interested in.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
Even though they played
around with some humans,

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
they didn't seem to possess
extraordinary power.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
And three...

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:34.769 position:50% align:center
The only reason I'm here is
to retrieve my fallen Nomu.

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] Dabi said he
was collecting the black one.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:39.357 position:50% align:center
Which means they don't have
a surplus of other Nomu

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
that could be employed to
take the powerful one's place.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
From this, I can
deduce some things.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center
Nomu are support goons from
their patron All For One

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center
and it's clear they
don't have enough.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.830 position:50% align:center
They're having to
ration the monsters

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:57.125 position:50% align:center
that made them viable opponents.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:00.295 position:50% align:center
A League of Villains
that can't use Nomu

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
is nothing more
than a social club.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
Every one of them
is strong! No fair!

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center

That's why you're
such a nuisance.

Look at the news.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center

cause, and yet you're famous.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
You fascinating girl.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you hate
being interviewed.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
That's a pity.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center

a long time ago.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:42.545 position:50% align:center

I'll have you bare
your soul to me now.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.634 position:50% align:center
The public's interest
in the League is one thing,

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center

If you want to
stay alive longer,

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50% align:center

to do the interview.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
and hiding yourself!

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50% align:center
There are warriors
within our ranks

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
who are more than willing
to become bombs for the cause!

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
So at 17, you're
the oldest daughter

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
of the Toga family,
born August seventh.

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
Last seen at your
middle school graduation.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
Did you catch the candid
interview with your parents?

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.038 position:50% align:center
And they spoke to
your classmates, too.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.456 position:50% align:center
Everyone said the same!

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:45.085 position:50% align:center
"She was a cheerful and
obedient child always."

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
So how'd ya end up here?

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:50.548 position:50% align:center
When did things first
go off the rails?

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:53.301 position:50% align:center
Why did you throw away
a normal life?

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50% align:center
I understand what happened.

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.894 position:50% align:center
You feel so much pain.
But instead of observing it,

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
I want to hear it
from you directly.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] Kizuki.
You won't grab the hearts

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
of the masses with clinical
words such as these.

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
Dusty facts and hearsay

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.157 position:50% align:center
aren't what will draw
people to our cause.

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.450 position:50% align:center
Conduct interviews.

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
Look at the faces
of your subjects.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
In order to guide
public opinion,

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
you must appeal to emotion
first and foremost.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
[KIZUKI] I will convince
the public with your story!

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
It's all for the
Liberation Army!

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
All you have to do is tell me
how you went insane!

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:37.095 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
I threw away a normal life?

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:38.930 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:46.271 position:50% align:center
[KIZUKI] An iconic face.
She's like a doll.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:49.065 position:50% align:center
You're finally opening up to me.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] The Liberation Army
is trying to build

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:55.405 position:50% align:center
a wonderful world,
so I love you.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
I love you so much it hurts.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
But I believe my life
right now is normal.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
[NEWSCASTER 109A] Sources tell
us that the middle schooler

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
who mauled her classmate,
injuring him badly,

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
is still on the run.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
No motivation for the attack
has been offered.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 109A] Toga was
always smiling and friendly.

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
I still can't believe she'd
do something so brutal.

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
I saw her. Toga.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
She stuck a straw
into Saito's wound.

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
It looked like
she was in a trance.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.278 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
So good.

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 109B]
She...

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
She had the most repulsive look
of bliss on her face.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
[TOGA'S MOM]
We're so terribly sorry.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
We did our best,
but we obviously failed.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:50.794 position:50% align:center
That child is a demon.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
Mommy. Daddy.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.881 position:50% align:center
This little birdie's
cute, isn't he?

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
I love him!

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
[KIZUKI]
You think you're normal?

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
An interesting thought.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
Tell me, is this your true face?

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
I knew it, my instincts
are as sharp as ever.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
You are the embodiment of a
repressed superhuman society.

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
[KIZUKI]
Poor lost child.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
You're ragged inside and out.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
An unfortunate soul
who sacrificed herself

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:26.371 position:50% align:center
through the suppression
of your meta powers.

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
That is who you are, correct,
you pitiful girl?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.919 position:50% align:center
Because of the meta
ability you have,

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
you grew up obscenely
fascinated by blood.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
So cute. So pretty.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center
[KIZUKI]
But do you know who is to blame?

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
This world.

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
What you felt was
completely natural.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
You were interested in blood,

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
but society couldn't
comprehend that.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
It's not your fault the world
wasn't ready to accept you.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
That's why you put a lid on your
desires, suppressing yourself,

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
wearing a mask over
your true identity.

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
[TOGA'S MOM]
Stop it! What are you doing?

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
[TOGA'S DAD]
Quit smiling like that!

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
It's so creepy.
You look like a deviant!

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
[TOGA'S MOM] Why can't you
just be a regular girl?

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
Why can't you be normal?

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
You shut your mouth!

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:24.387 position:50% align:center
[KIZUKI]
Detnerat's patented Chain Ring!

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
[KIZUKI]
Curious Flattener!

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
There's no difference
between your "normal"

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
and the Liberation Army's goal.

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
They're one and the same.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
This is the ultimate truth of
the Liberation Army's ideals.

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50% align:center
Your life will be written
about in our modern-day

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
"holy book," as a shining
example of that truth.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
Please tell me
if my thoughts seem

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
incomplete in any way.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
If not, this interview
won't be finished.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:58.129 position:50% align:center
I can't have a subject this good
die before their final words.

00:13:58.213 --> 00:13:59.756 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
No!

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
Where will you run to?
The League cannot overpower us!

00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:06.805 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
I don't like her!

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:09.724 position:50% align:center
Doesn't she get
that I love my life?

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
When I'm happy, I smile big.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] You may kiss someone you
like, but my way is different.

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
I suck the blood
of those I love.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare
feel bad for me!

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:28.618 position:50% align:center
It's your reserve of blood!
Oh, I think I'm tearing up!

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:30.370 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.455 position:50% align:center
[KIZUKI] I know that meta
ability only allows you

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:34.624 position:50% align:center
to change your appearance.

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
You must want to look
cute at the end.

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
What a beautiful tragedy.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:43.299 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] The last bit of blood I
had from back then was Ochaco's.

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
Izuku trusts her,
so I was saving it.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.472 position:50% align:center
Lucky. Must be nice.

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:52.726 position:50% align:center
I wanna get close
to someone I love, too.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
[KIZUKI]
Please, give me... your story!

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:01.276 position:50% align:center
No!

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:09.409 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
I want to be like you, too.

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] Every day I was chased
by the police and heroes.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:22.797 position:50% align:center
I became so sensitive to what
was happening around me.

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.300 position:50% align:center
When I pretended to be
a high school girl,

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
the world became kinder.

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
Don't get caught.
Keep on moving.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
Don't get caught.

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
Am I using Ochaco's Quirk?

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.566 position:50% align:center
On her form, it said
she could only change

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
her physical appearance!

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me...

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
She level-ed up just now?

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
The fear of death
evolved her meta power.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
Yes.

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
I will love, live,
and die normally.

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.795 position:50% align:center
I want to become more...

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.672 position:50% align:center
...like those I love!

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center
What a wonderful
headline that makes.

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
This will be my
greatest feature.

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:21.064 position:50% align:center
We keep chopping them down,
but there're too many.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
You haven't killed
a single one of 'em.

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:26.820 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Toga's gone. Where is she?

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
[TOGA panting]

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
I'm a mess. Just like Izuku was.

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:37.706 position:50% align:center
It's better not to kill,
leave 'em to the big guy.

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
But I wanna do it
myself. Because...

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
The things we hate...

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
...should be destroyed.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
Right, Tomura?

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
I'm sleepy.

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] When you're
this tired, sometimes

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.900 position:50% align:center
stuff looks like it's
moving when it's not.

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
You hallucinate things
that aren't there.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:13.158 position:50% align:center
Like you're being overwhelmed
with information.

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
I know that my body's
glitchy right now.

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
What's this?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Another flashback.

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:27.464 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
I don't recall this happening.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
All I remember is how I felt.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:34.471 position:50% align:center
At that time, it was like a
weight lifted off my chest.

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Why was that again?

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be fine.
I've got you!

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:45.482 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] If you're gonna show
me a memory, show me all of it.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
I'm rooting for you.

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
Know that, Tenko?

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
It's like a corrupted stream.

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
Oh, great. Now I feel sick.

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
[retches]

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
[SPINNER] Is there something
wrong with my eyes?

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:15.637 position:50% align:center
Just now.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
It looked like his Decay spread

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
even though he didn't
touch all of them.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
Shigaraki. Did you...?

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:26.272 position:50% align:center
If our leader's
sparing no lives,

00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
then I'll have some fun, too.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
I've never been good
at not killing people--

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.784 position:50% align:center
Ice, huh? What a thrill.

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:41.705 position:50% align:center
Nice job sneaking up on me
even though you're a tank.

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
I should warn you
that I've gotten

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center
pretty strong lately.
Upped all of my abilities.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
Which is how
I know you're tough.

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center
[GETEN]
Dabi, wielder of the blue flame.

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:54.843 position:50% align:center
The only person in the League
with a ranged attack.

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:57.303 position:50% align:center
Why won't you use
your fire right away?

00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:58.763 position:50% align:center
Are you waiting
for me to strike,

00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
or is there something wrong
with your meta ability?

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:04.310 position:50% align:center
Hey, it looks like
you've got a lot to learn.

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
It's a complicated concept,
but I guess I'll teach you.

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
Ice melts.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
[GETEN]
I see. That's not good.

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
Speaking of having a lot
to learn, pay attention.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center
I control ice.

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
I've been training my power
for as long as I can remember.

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
Not even taking
time for my studies.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
Training much longer than any
hero or villain for that matter.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
The grand commander
helped me push my limits.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a wonderful
life, you idiot.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
Now die.

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
[GETEN] Don't think
flames as weak as that

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.806 position:50% align:center
will impact my creations.

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.978 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS grunts] Dammit!
You're ruining our stage!

00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
Everyone's been split up.
Let's see. Dabi is over there.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
Shigaraki and Spinner
were together.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
Toga ran ahead and is missing.

00:19:57.072 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
Where's Twice? He was
here a second ago!

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
No way. It's true.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
You ran off somewhere
alone and I was worried.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
Totally calm.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
Damn it, what happened?

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
Toga! This can't be real.

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:15.298 position:50% align:center
It is!

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.550 position:50% align:center
I can't believe someone
can feel this cold.

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center
Crap! She's burning up.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
Shut it! How can I?

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
There's blood everywhere!

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
Is she breathing?

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
Yes! No.

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:25.558 position:50% align:center
Her face is a mess.

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
Is it the enemy's blood?

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
No, it's hers!

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I'll wipe
it off for you.

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center
Remember this?

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
It's the handkerchief
you gave me.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:35.110 position:50% align:center
Give it up. This
girl's about to die.

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
No, you have to live!
You're where I belong.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
You make the League
a place we want to be.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
You're the only one who needed
this failed human being.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:48.790 position:50% align:center
Damn it! I'll kill them!

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU]
Twice has found Toga.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
They're in the storage
shed at Ikeda's.

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
The girl is still alive.

00:20:56.548 --> 00:21:00.385 position:50% align:center
But we need to make sure she's
dead for Curious's feature.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
Jin Bubaigawara. Twice.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
Meta ability: Double.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center
In a sense, he's the
complete opposite of Toga.

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:11.104 position:50% align:center
He made copies of himself,
was almost killed

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:13.940 position:50% align:center
by those duplicates,
and lost his own sense of self

00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
in the process.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
To live your intended life,

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:20.238 position:50% align:center
you liberated your meta
powers, but that resulted

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
in a wounded soul.

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:24.784 position:50% align:center
[TWICE screams]

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:27.829 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Tomoyasu Chikazoku.

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
MLA code name: Skeptic.
Meta ability: Anthropomorph.

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
He can change things with
about the same mass as humans--

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
like fridges or desks--
into sentient puppets.

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU]
With your abilities at hand,

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
no matter what
happens to Re-Destro,

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:43.636 position:50% align:center
we can bring him back!

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.098 position:50% align:center
We will not repeat
the tragedy of Destro!

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:49.267 position:50% align:center
So now are you
starting to get it?

00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
Such great power!

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
It's time that you begin to
understand your own worth.

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
I will persuade you to
join the Liberation Army!

00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:30.785 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:32.078 position:50% align:center
A revival party put on

00:23:32.162 --> 00:23:34.330 position:50% align:center
by the Meta Liberation
Army turns deadly.

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:36.374 position:50% align:center
While facing such
incredible numbers,

00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:38.668 position:50% align:center
the League of Villains,
led by Shigaraki,

00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:42.172 position:50% align:center
are driven into a corner.

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:43.757 position:50% align:center
How will Twice react
when he learns

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.427 position:50% align:center
the extent of Himiko
Toga's injuries?

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.096 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Sad Man's Parade."

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.057 position:50% align:center
Quirk: Double.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.517 position:50% align:center
That can result
in a sorrowful march.

00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:57.062 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
