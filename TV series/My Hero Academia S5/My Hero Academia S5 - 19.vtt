00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:12.387 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] It's okay
if you don't forgive me.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.266 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Because I
don't want forgiveness.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.018 position:50% align:center
I want to atone.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.436 position:50% align:center
[NATSUO whimpers]

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
The shape of the Todoroki family

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
was about to transform.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.446 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I hoped that this change
would be an improvement,

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
even if only a slight one.

00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:06.376 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Our work-study took up
the entire winter break.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.962 position:50% align:center
Still, it felt like
was over in a flash,

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.840 position:50% align:center
and then, the third term began.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.634 position:50% align:center
Our first year at UA
seemed like it'd flown by,

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:17.721 position:50% align:center
and suddenly, there were
just three months left.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:20.432 position:50% align:center
My classmates!
A Happy New Year to you all!

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.308 position:50% align:center
Yes, Happy New Year, everyone.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.811 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] Today's class will
consist of a practical briefing.

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.563 position:50% align:center
We'll each share our
accomplishments, challenges,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.815 position:50% align:center
et cetera from over
the winter break.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.526 position:50% align:center
So, comrades,
it's time to suit up...

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
...and head over
to Ground Alpha!

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.655 position:50% align:center
Quiet! Time to get started--

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.616 position:50% align:center
Happy New Year, Mr. Aizawa!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.285 position:50% align:center
An auspicious New Year, sir!

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:43.163 position:50% align:center
I've apprised them of the
schedule, per your instructions.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.372 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Good.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:46.166 position:50% align:center
Man, Iida, you're really
revving hard today!

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.542 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.502 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, Manual, the hero
with whom I apprenticed

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.671 position:50% align:center
at my work study,
is a leader in Hosu.

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:55.050 position:50% align:center
It was just one week,
but he taught me well.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.427 position:50% align:center
How to work hard
without being uptight!

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.179 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah!
That's the only way to live!

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:00.722 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Heh. I take it back.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:03.391 position:50% align:center
He's like a bike where
the chain keeps coming off.

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
[SERO] Wouldn't Iida
be a motorcycle, though?

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50% align:center
I mean, with his
engines, and all?

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:07.604 position:50% align:center
[PA chime rings]

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.022 position:50% align:center
[PA VOICE 107A]
Mr. Aizawa.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
Please report to
the staff room immediately.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.862 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Oh! Ochaco, that a new costume?

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50% align:center
It looks amazing!

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] Yeah, that
new style is great on you!

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Heh. You think so?

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.244 position:50% align:center
Aw, thanks, guys!

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.663 position:50% align:center
What's this?
A new Uraraka Wrist?

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap, that's heavy!

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] Yeah, there's
wire stuffed inside.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
Thanks to my Quirk, the weight
of it isn't a handicap.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.922 position:50% align:center
The case sure is heavy, though.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
Hey, whatcha got in here?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.801 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center
Is that the...

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO gasps]

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Hmm...?

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:58.363 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO gasps]

00:03:58.446 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center
I knew it!

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
It's not what you think, Ashido!

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
[giggling]

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
It's really not. I promise.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Huh?

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
I'm just, um,
keeping it close for now.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
Keeping it safe.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.966 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] Whoa! You mean you
mastered that weird new power?

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:20.343 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU] Mm-hmm.
--For real?!

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
Dang, that was quick!

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
That dark energy thing?

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
That black ribbon stuff that
shot out of your arm, Midoriya?

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yeah, it's called Blackwhip.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] Hey, it's pretty
freakin' cool, if you ask me.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
That's what happens, you learn
faster when your work study's

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
with Number One!

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center
Like, you grow at
a higher rate, huh?

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.529 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] But I still can't
control it for more than

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
a moment, and its
uses are pretty limited.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
But it's strong!

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
No! Midoriya!

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.456 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Bakugo! What's your problem?!

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
Stupid!

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Oh, man!

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
Is that his
gray matter oozing out?!

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
Midoriya!

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
Basically, I gotta...
make my body...

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.051 position:50% align:center
...move as fast as my brain.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
I am here!

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
The symbol of sweets!

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] The sense of
speed is too different,

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
so you can't keep
it going if you get...

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Uh, guys?

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
I put "all my might"
into this one gag,

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
and you're
completely ignoring it.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, All Might?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
I'm fine! And, I am here!
The symbol of sweets!

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
Get it? Sweet?

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
--Cotton. Candy? Get it?
--Wait a second.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
Where's Mr. Aizawa?

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
Ah. An urgent matter arose.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
So, he had to leave school
and take care of it immediately.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Can't you make
this thing go any faster?

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Enough already. Relax.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA grunts]

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
During the fight at the USJ,

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
he didn't act like he would've.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
If he were...

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
How low will these bastards go?

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
This is too far.

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
I, for one,
refuse to believe it.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:06.366 position:50% align:center
I bet Mr. Tsukauchi and the
others have just got it wrong.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.580 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI] I know I'm not
telling you anything new.

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
But indulge me.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.292 position:50% align:center
Nomu are humans whose bodies
have been radically

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center
bio-engineered to
withstand multiple Quirks.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.839 position:50% align:center
However...

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI]
...they're not living humans.

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
They're complete messes--

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
everything from their
brains to their hearts.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.687 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
Nomu truly are puppets.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
They're marionettes,
with no will of their own.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
Or, at least,
that's what we thought.

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Gran Torino, we skipped
our classes to come here.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
So let's get
to the point, shall we?

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Aizawa.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Calm down, bro.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
We have to provide background,
and be thorough,

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
or else what you're about to
hear might be too much to bear.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.342 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
This guy's a core member

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
of the League of Villains.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI] If we can
get him to spill some intel,

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.848 position:50% align:center
we'd be able to hit them
where it hurts.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
But, unfortunately, he's shown
no sign that he'll open up.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.437 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI]
He'll talk about trivial stuff,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
but when it comes to info
that would put the League

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.400 position:50% align:center
at a disadvantage,
he suddenly goes non-responsive,

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.611 position:50% align:center
like someone flipped
his off switch.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Okay?

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI] It's sophisticated,
so it took us a long time

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
to figure out what was going on.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
They've combined
a bunch of quirk factors:

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50% align:center
a base, with others added
to form a single new quirk.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.252 position:50% align:center
We've identified the factor
that served as the base.

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI] Turns out,
it belonged to a kid

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
you were quite familiar
with in your UA days.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center
A young boy who
lost his life way too soon--

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50% align:center
while working to save others.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI] We found
out that this base quirk is

00:07:57.394 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
a very close match to
Oboro Shirakumo's.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.282 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Once upon a time,
we were working hard

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
to become heroes together.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAKUMO]
Shota! Hizashi!

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
I been thinkin'
when we graduate,

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.666 position:50% align:center
we should start a hero agency!

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.626 position:50% align:center
When we combine
powers and work together,

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
we can handle
just about anything!

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:26.006 position:50% align:center
I mean, there's
three of us, after all.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
So, even if one of us slips up,
there's no doubt the other two

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
will always have his back.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.553 position:50% align:center
You know what I'm always sayin'.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
Shota's got an eye
for detail, no pun intended.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.975 position:50% align:center
Hizashi's a master
at negotiating!

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
Let's start an agency!
So what do you say?

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.439 position:50% align:center
Heh! Sure, but no fighting
about money, 'kay?

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
Goes without saying!

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
Shota, You in?

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.529 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Gotta think it
over before I agree.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
Ah, What is
there to think about?

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.992 position:50% align:center
Let's just do it!

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
When Oboro Shirakumo died,

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
he and I were doing
our work-study together.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:05.378 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] He got caught
in a collapsing building.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
There one second
and gone the next.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] He dreamed of the three
of us starting an agency,

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
but died right after
sharing those plans with us.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
In other words,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50% align:center
Kurogiri is a kind of Nomu,
and there's a high probability

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
that the base of his quirks...

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:32.697 position:50% align:center
...was adapted by using
Oboro Shirakumo's remains.

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
You remember
what they used to call us?

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
Class A's Three Dumbigos.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.372 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
This doesn't make
any damn sense!

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE] Do you want to
know why we often attack UA?

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
It's simple, really.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50% align:center
Where else can one find
such a concentration

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.675 position:50% align:center
of outstanding quirks?

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
A rather logical, strategic
move, don't you think?

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
He went on to say it was
like being a dog

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
under the table at
a five-star restaurant.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
How disgusting.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
But I imagine
that before the cremation,

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:08.441 position:50% align:center
he just swapped out
Oboro Shirakumo's body,

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
and turned him into one of
his insane Nomu marionettes.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
It'd be a mistake
to expect this all

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
to make sense, Mic.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
It's pure evil, which rarely,
if ever, makes sense.

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
Well, screw it, anyway.

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI] Right now,
we've got him sedated.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
'Cause if we don't,
he'll try to use his quirk.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
You still haven't explained why

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
you brought us here.

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
Do you think our connection
will lead to a miracle?

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.302 position:50% align:center
You've been watching
too many movies.

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
Miracles do happen,

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
and they often lead
to possibilities.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
Take the Nomu that
Endeavor defeated in Kyushu.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
The report says it had
a distinct personality,

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:53.778 position:50% align:center
and that it displayed a hyper
fixation on powerful fighters.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
When they analyzed
its DNA, they found that

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center
its original body belonged
to a common hoodlum

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.036 position:50% align:center
who made his living as
an underground street fighter.

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:03.163 position:50% align:center
Makes sense, doesn't it?

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Meaning, it still
had aspects of its personality

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
from before death?

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:10.045 position:50% align:center
Well, remember--
I fought Kurogiri at UA.

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] He spoke completely
differently than Shirakumo,

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.300 position:50% align:center
and he didn't have any
notable reaction to me.

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI] Maybe 'cause
they did experiments on him.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
To see if his altered memories--
or even memories they erased--

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
would affect the way
he carried out orders.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
But I'll emphasize again.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
If you can just get him
to talk, it'd be a major break

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
in the case.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:32.817 position:50% align:center
Present Mic.

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center
Eraser Head.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:41.284 position:50% align:center
I want you to reawaken
Oboro Shirakumo's mind.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:01.930 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Hah!

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
You really think we
can reawaken Shirakumo?

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
So, what, should we
talk about old times?!

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI]
Try anything.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
His family?

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
If you two can't
get through to him...

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
...we're going to
ask them to see him next.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
I would never allow his
parents to think their son

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
became something so disgusting.

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI groaning]

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.210 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 107A]
He's awake.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.129 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and start.

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI] What's this...?
What an unexpected guest.

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
I don't think we've met
since the UA raid.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Even when Eraser looks at him,

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.059 position:50% align:center
the haze hangs around.

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
I guess his body doesn't
have a normal form.

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] Looks like you
guys got it wrong, after all!

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
This freak is nothing like
our old friend Shirakumo.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
How is Tomura Shigaraki doing?

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
He hasn't been captured, has he?

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:07.412 position:50% align:center
I don't know!

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
I see. What a shame.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
Are you concerned
about Shigaraki?

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI] Indeed, it's
my duty to look after him.

[AIZAWA gasps]

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center

have to take care of

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
I've never questioned it.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
I'm not the type
to neglect a friend.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center

[KUROGIRI]
Hmm?

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center

No response.

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Don't you remember?
I was always hesitating.

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.476 position:50% align:center

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.357 position:50% align:center
Hi, I'm Shirakumo.

So nice to meet you,

Shota! The cafeteria seats
are gonna fill up! C'mon!

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
I'll lend you my goggles.

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
They'll hide and protect your
eyes, so you can get in close!

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center

Check it out, now we match!

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:34.165 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
You acted on instinct.

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50% align:center
I overthought,
but you pulled me along.

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
Is this a confession?

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
Well, we aren't in a church,
and I'm certainly not a priest.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Nothing could
ever dampen your spirits.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
You were always looking ahead.

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
Never worrying
about consequences.

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
Despite the fact
that a single misstep

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
would mean your death.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] You know.
Yamada and I are teachers now.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center

quite a few of them.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.581 position:50% align:center

Did you see how grumpy

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:18.585 position:50% align:center
Old Eraser's face was today?

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.128 position:50% align:center

It's always scary!

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 107A] No, dude,
this was, like, super scary.

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center
As bad as when he expelled us.

[STUDENT 107B]
Yikes!

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
I still have recurring
nightmares about that day.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
I thought it was
all over for me!

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
[FUWA]
It wasn't so bad.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:35.060 position:50% align:center
I mean, it sucked, but we all
grew because of that experience.

[STUDENTS]
No, no, no.

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
There are plenty of ways to help

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 107B] Expulsion goes
on our permanent record.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:42.942 position:50% align:center

[NEZU] The authority
to expel and reenroll them?

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Yes, sir.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.365 position:50% align:center
Sacrifice for
others is different

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
than throwing your life away.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.619 position:50% align:center
When these naïve kids
get the two mixed up.

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:56.414 position:50% align:center
I can expel them--give 'em a
little death, so they'll learn.

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:57.749 position:50% align:center
Then I'll reenroll them.

00:15:57.832 --> 00:15:59.084 position:50% align:center
That way they know
what's at stake,

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
and they'll strive
to reach even higher.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
I urge you to authorize it, sir.

Hmm...

[AIZAWA]
Do you know why I did it?!

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
I didn't want them to make
the same fatal mistake you did!

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:21.815 position:50% align:center

[AIZAWA] At the same time,
I wanted them to be like you!

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
I wanted to
shape them into heroes

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.536 position:50% align:center
who motivate and inspire!

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] And I want all
the greatest heroes...

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
...to live long, happy lives!

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Shirakumo!

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center
If you're in there--
if there's any trace

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
of my friend left at all...

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
The three of us--
we can still do it.

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
We can be heroes!

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:01.312 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 107A]
Brain wave anomaly!

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?!

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 107A]
He's agitated!

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
Who is producing the Nomu?
Where's Shigaraki hiding?

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.365 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Even if what they say is true,

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:16.077 position:50% align:center
and all that's left of my friend
is sitting behind this glass...

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
It doesn't matter.

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
Nothing will ever
bring him back.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.543 position:50% align:center
He'd never be the person I knew.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
Tell me! The monster
who did this to you...

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:30.300 position:50% align:center
Where'd they take you
to mess with your brain?!

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
I-I don't...

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
When you last saw me,

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:38.433 position:50% align:center
when you attacked UA, did you
really feel nothing at all?

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
I don't--

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
I... have no idea what
you're... talking about!

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
Damn it, talk to us!

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.859 position:50% align:center
Answer the question, Shirakumo!

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
I... am... Kurogi...

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
The three of us were
in class 2-A together

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center
at UA High School!

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
And we were all going to
become heroes together!

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC, AIZAWA]
You're Oboro Shirakumo!

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI] I don't... know...
what you mean...

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:15.387 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI] I am Kurogiri, the
protector of Tomura Shigaraki.

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC gasps]

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI] Nothing you're saying
makes any sense to me.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
Shirakumo...

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 107A]
His brain waves!

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI]
Quiet!

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:32.612 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
Sh...

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Sh...

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
Sho...

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
Yes, you can fight this!

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Shirakumo!

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:45.250 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAKUMO] I mean,
there's three of us, after all.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
So, even if one of us slips up,

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
there's no doubt the other two
will always have his back.

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAKUMO]
It was... in the... hospital...

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:58.763 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Hey!

00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:00.598 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
I am...

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
I am...

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI]
Eraser Head, Present Mic.

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:13.194 position:50% align:center
That's enough.
You did well.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
Hey, are your eyes okay?

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
They're a bit dry,
but no big deal.

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
He said, "hospital."

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] It seemed like
we were close to getting

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
something more specific.

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
Sorry we couldn't be of
more use, or if it was a waste.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
No, far from it.

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
How's Kurogiri?

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
He shut down, like he short
circuited, or something.

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
But, anyway, we took
a big step forward.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO] The three
of you had some big dreams

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:55.362 position:50% align:center
back in the day,
and you chased them together.

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
I made you reopen
painful wounds,

00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.784 position:50% align:center
but, trust me, something good
has come out of it.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] These Nomu...
What exactly are they?

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
What's the point of
creating such monsters?

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
I don't know why you people
refuse to understand.

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:16.841 position:50% align:center
It's like making a fine wine.

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
To get the juice,
one must trample the grapes.

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.430 position:50% align:center
And all I really want

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
is to continue savoring
all the delicious notes.

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
Who can say?

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
Who cares?

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.649 position:50% align:center
My sole concern here
is ensuring there will be

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
no further victims.

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever that requires.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
I'm just hoping
to see some progress.

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:48.123 position:50% align:center
Right, then.

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:50.542 position:50% align:center
I'd better send
this up the chain.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:54.045 position:50% align:center
"Hospital." Even if that
alone doesn't tell us much,

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center
it gives us a place
to start, at least.

00:20:57.841 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
[CHAIRWOMAN] I see.
We appreciate your hard work.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 107A]
There's a thug raging around

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:06.766 position:50% align:center
at Wakagumo Hospital.
Requesting backup!

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I'm busy right now.
I'll have to pass.

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
What was that?

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:13.356 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] They're always
turning to me, man.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Oh, hero work?

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:17.652 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Yeah, I mean, I'm the
number two guy, after all.

00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Impressive!

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:20.030 position:50% align:center
You're no big deal, man!

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna grab
a drink real quick.

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
You want anything?

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:23.700 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Black coffee.

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
With lots of milk
and tons of sugar!

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.203 position:50% align:center
Cool, you got it.

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Hospital.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
The pieces have
fallen into place!

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
All that's left now is...

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] A human with his ego
still perfectly intact!

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.051 position:50% align:center
Who possesses unlimited power!

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:43.470 position:50% align:center
The ultimate being,
whom All For One and I

00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
have sought all this time!
My masterpiece!

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.392 position:50% align:center
Excellent, Tomura Shigaraki!

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:53.229 position:50% align:center
You're coming along nicely.
Better than I ever imagined!

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:58.693 position:50% align:center
[laughs maniacally]

00:23:29.617 --> 00:23:30.952 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.036 --> 00:23:34.247 position:50% align:center
We travel back in time,
about two months.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.167 position:50% align:center
All For One's former
bodyguard, Gigantomachia,

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.627 position:50% align:center
appeared before
the League of Villains.

00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:41.546 position:50% align:center
The goal was to determine
whether Shigaraki

00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:43.381 position:50% align:center
was a worthy successor.

00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:46.509 position:50% align:center
As we work hard to hone and
increase our power as heroes,

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:49.679 position:50% align:center
Shigaraki and the other villains
are refining their skills, too.

00:23:49.763 --> 00:23:52.223 position:50% align:center
Next time,
"My Villain Academia."

00:23:52.307 --> 00:23:55.352 position:50% align:center
Class is a battlefield,
and death's on the line.

00:23:55.435 --> 00:23:57.604 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
