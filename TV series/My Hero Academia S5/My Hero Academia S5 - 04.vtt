00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:13.930 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] It was my first
time living at school.

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.474 position:50% align:center
And as the second
semester neared its end...

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.352 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Aren't you excited?

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
Don't you get cold
like that, Hagakure?

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE laughs]
Yeah, I'm freezing.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.524 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Everyone's costumes have changed

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.067 position:50% align:center
since we started school,
haven't they?

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.819 position:50% align:center
They've adapted just as we have!

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:28.695 position:50% align:center
You're a champ.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.906 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you lasted through
the summer in all that gear.

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:33.241 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Kacchan's is different, too!

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
Huh? If you've got
something to say,

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:36.995 position:50% align:center
then say it to my face, nerd!

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.039 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Look who we have here.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.208 position:50% align:center
Relaxed and full of
yourselves as always.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
Come on, Class A!

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.964 position:50% align:center
Let's see who's the best
once and for all!

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.427 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] The teachers in
UA High School's hero course

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.139 position:50% align:center
decided to pit Class 1-A against
Class 1-B in combat training

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:58.224 position:50% align:center
to test how our
skills had grown.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Shinso, who wants to
transfer into the hero program,

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.650 position:50% align:center
was also included
in the matches.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.406 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
As the first round got underway,

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:17.118 position:50% align:center
my classmates found themselves
in trouble almost immediately.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.883 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] Some of you
don't know much about it,

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
so I'll give a
simple explanation

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.553 position:50% align:center
of my brainwashing Quirk.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
First off,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.349 position:50% align:center
I focus my attention
on the target and think,

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.642 position:50% align:center
"I'm going to brainwash
this person."

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
If I can get the target to
answer me after I do that,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.731 position:50% align:center
the effect is complete.

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
The target will move
according to my orders.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.986 position:50% align:center
If they get shocked, they might
break free of the power,

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
depending on how
well it took hold.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
I've never tried
it before, but I think

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
it's probably impossible to
brainwash many people at once.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
My focus would be
too splintered.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
No matter what,
it's a powerful move,

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
especially if they're
not expecting it.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Keep in mind.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
I can't make the person
I brainwash talk.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
Also, orders that require them
to think are off the table.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
For example:

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
I can show the target the words
"Tsuyu Asui" and order them

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.349 position:50% align:center
to write it because
they can see it.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
But I can't ask them
what your name is

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:48.228 position:50% align:center
and get them to answer.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
I know we all kinda
deal with this,

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
but isn't it hard when people
learn about your Quirk?

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:54.859 position:50% align:center
Will anyone talk to you?

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
That's why I have this.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
It acts like another
set of vocal cords.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
A vocal modulation mask.
Persona Cords.

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:05.203 position:50% align:center
If my voice goes through
a mic or megaphone,

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
it loses its effect.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
So it has to be your real
voice that they respond to.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] Yes. Through the
variation and resonance

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.963 position:50% align:center
of a number of plates,
this mask can change

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center
how I speak while still making
my voice heard directly.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:21.219 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I get it.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
It changes your tone,
but it's still your voice.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
Wow! You gotta be
unbeatable with that thing!

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
And... start!

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI gasps]
Well, that was fast.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
We don't have a plan,

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:34.691 position:50% align:center
but let's just to go for it.

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] Whether or not
this mask is effective...

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
...depends on me!

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] All right!
Take them down, Shishida!

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
Consider this our win already.

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
Shinso talked with my voice.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:01.259 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
The monster's gonna murder me!

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Huh?

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.308 position:50% align:center
[TSUBURABA] He copied my voice
and brainwashed Shishida?

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.478 position:50% align:center
[TSUBURABA]
How did that happen?

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Now's the time to strike!

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
[TSUBURABA]
I got this. Air Prison!

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO gasps]

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
Wake up, Shishida.
Come on, you beast!

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
[TSUBURABA]
Shinso from general studies.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
He brainwashes you if you answer
him, but you can break free.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
I heard about his Quirk
from my classmates.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
But nobody mentioned
he could copy voices.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.679 position:50% align:center
Ah! No good. He's fast!

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
Ya got a good grip there, bro?

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.937 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA groans]

00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA groans]

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Dang.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:03.905 position:50% align:center
He almost fought
through that jolt!

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
Shishida!

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:08.576 position:50% align:center
I got you now!

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah! Throw that
dude in jail, Tsu!

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA growls]

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
Why aren't you passed out?

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Dang, d'you see him?

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50% align:center
That guy is super powerful.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
Faster, Tsu, c'mon!

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.850 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
Trust our classmates.
They've got this.

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
Koda!

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] The air wall should
be weak enough to break easily.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Nope. Pretty tough.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
In that case...

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:53.121 position:50% align:center
Let's do this!

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
[KODA]
Thanks, Kirishima!

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.628 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
I won't let him escape!

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50% align:center
Nice!

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
And we'll make sure
to stop this guy.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50% align:center
[KODA] Fly to me, little ones.
Please lend me your strength.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
Come get some! Red Gauntlet!

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
Back to my human mode.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Jurota Shishida. Quirk: Beast.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
His physique bulks up
whenever he activates his power.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.447 position:50% align:center
But he goes back to normal
when he turns it off.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
And the animal returns!

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA, KODA grunt]

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA] Only one of you
can stand up to my strength.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
You're a tough one, Kirishima.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
So you'll go first.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA screams]

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.339 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
That's where she is!

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.887 position:50% align:center
I've spotted a lost sheep,
plummeting from the sky.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA screams]

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! I can't believe
they caught him!

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:58.978 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Agreed.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.856 position:50% align:center
But Asui managed
to ensnare Tsuburaba.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
The odds are still even.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.862 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
No. They're definitely not.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
[KODA muffled grunting]

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:14.786 position:50% align:center
[KODA]
I can't talk. He's too strong!

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
[sniffs]

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA]
I know what you're trying!

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI, TSUYU gasp]

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA] I evaded, but Koda
is not making this easy.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
I can't fight
while carrying him.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.638 position:50% align:center
Best to withdraw.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
And tilt the scales of
this battle in our favor!

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
And with that,
we're up two to one.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.692 position:50% align:center
[KODA sighs]

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Sorry I failed, Koda.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
I can't believe she captured me.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center
[TSUBURABA]
With her tongue!

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.836 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI grunts]
This is stronger than it was

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
at the sports festival.
He got better.

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.467 position:50% align:center
Class B's been training hard!

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:11.885 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they've definitely
upped their game

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
since we last fought 'em, huh?

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
One more!

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Oh? What's this?

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
Class B is already
pulling ahead?

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
Each team has three
competitors left,

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
but it's obvious Class B is
setting themselves up for a win.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
I can't say I'm surprised,
given their brains and brawn.

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
My superior students
are attacking furiously.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.155 position:50% align:center
Looks like they'll
finally crush Class A!

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Keep bringin'
the truth, Mr. Vlad!

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
Stop with the biased commentary!

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:39.788 position:50% align:center
That beast is strong.
He'll be hard to take down.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
And his sense of smell
is no joke either.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Shinso. I'm afraid
your inexperience is showing.

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] He was ready to attack
with the binding cloths.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.509 position:50% align:center
But he reacted after
seeing the enemy.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
He can't keep up with the
intense speed of the battle.

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.306 position:50% align:center
They need another way
to take advantage

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
of Shinso's abilities.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
What should we do, Tsu?

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
We're losing.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU] We spent too much
time trying to understand

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
Shinso's Quirk
instead of planning.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
They took us
completely by surprise.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.322 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
This is my fault.

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
I should've been able to
move faster to capture them.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
No, we should be apologizing.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
You ended up having
to fight the other team

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
without any help from us.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
I blame myself for not
having a smarter strategy.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Yeah, don't beat yourself up.

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
For someone who's not used to
this, you had solid intuition.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.466 position:50% align:center
No one got too hurt.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.844 position:50% align:center
And I needed to be rescued, too.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
This kinda thing just comes
with the territory, I guess.

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:40.473 position:50% align:center
I know you said earlier

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
you weren't planning
on making friends.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.854 position:50% align:center
But I like you, Shinso.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
You're totally a future hero.

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Whatever. We need a new plan.

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
I have an idea.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
Kaminari, look
for your pointers.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
Uh... Okay.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:08.168 position:50% align:center
[SHIOZAKI] You used me
as a decoy for an ambush?

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
Ah, what a sinful
act of deception.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.465 position:50% align:center
I fear I must whip you now.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
Wait. What?

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
But we succeeded in our mission!

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
If we catch two more members
of their team, we can beat them!

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.099 position:50% align:center
Now we know about
Shinso's voice changer,

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
so if we grab him and Asui,
while ignoring Kaminari,

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
there's no way we can lose.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.733 position:50% align:center
That sounds about right.

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
It's disappointing that
we lost Tsuburaba, though.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
[sniffs]

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
Trickery!

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.910 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
What is it, Shishida?

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.995 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA]
This will sound strange.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what it means.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
But there are three
Asuis heading our way!

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
Three frogs?

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
So that must be their strategy.

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
They're fooling
your sense of smell.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
I must chastise them.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
[SHIOZAKI] Devious schemes
are hallmarks of defilement.

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA] There are three
Asuis heading our way!

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
[KAIBARA] I don't get
what Shishida's saying.

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:24.911 position:50% align:center
She can't multiply herself
like Mr. Ectoplasm does, right?

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
There should only be one of her.

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
Is this the plan
I think it is?

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.543 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's that power.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
She told us all about it,

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
but I've never actually seen
her put it in action before!

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:37.799 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
So let's talk Quirks.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
I'll go first if you want.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.971 position:50% align:center
Obviously, I can jump high and
cling to pretty much any wall.

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
And of course,
there's my tongue.

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
I can stick it out
about 20 meters.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, and I can
spit out my stomach

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
so I can clean it.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
That's not really useful.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
Finally, I also
secrete a toxic mucus.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
It just stings a bit.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Toxic mucus saves the day!

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] She coated her
two teammates with it

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.114 position:50% align:center
to cover their smell!

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:02.949 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
Even we almost forgot about it,

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:07.078 position:50% align:center
so there's no way Class B
will guess what's going on.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU] Kaminari,
look for your pointers.

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Uh... Okay.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
During the fight earlier,

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
one of them stuck
to Shishida's pocket.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
My pointer babies stick
wherever they happen to land.

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.842 position:50% align:center
And with these
super-cute glasses,

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.886 position:50% align:center
you can always pinpoint
their location.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
You were really
watching carefully, huh?

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
Amazing, Tsu!

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
I would say it's more amazing
that you didn't notice yourself.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.356 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU] Shishida's nose might
be their biggest asset.

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
I sniffed you out with
my acute sense of smell!

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.571 position:50% align:center
We should assume that,
no matter what we try,

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
he'll always know our locations.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] And we'll use
that against him. Right?

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] Three people
who smell like Tsu.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
So as long as he doesn't see us,

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:51.915 position:50% align:center
he'll have no idea
which one of us is which!

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:52.832 position:50% align:center
It looks like
he hasn't noticed

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
the pointer yet, either.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
He's just hangin' out.

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Ideally, we would know where

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center
his other two classmates are.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:00.924 position:50% align:center
Instead of trying
to figure that out,

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
we should get the
beast man while we can!

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.969 position:50% align:center
His powers are way
too much trouble.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, are you okay, Tsu?

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
You went flying earlier.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
I was mostly able
to control the fall.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.229 position:50% align:center
But I doubt I'll have much luck
if I try fighting him head on.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.360 position:50% align:center
[SHIOZAKI]
By the power of my true name:

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
Vine.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:24.656 position:50% align:center
I will judge the
wretched schemers.

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:26.491 position:50% align:center
Via Dolorosa!

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:28.993 position:50% align:center line:10%
Locations.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center line:10%
Sniff them out for me,
Apocalypse Beast.

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.540 position:50% align:center
[sniffs]

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.626 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA]
Ten o'clock.

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
Twelve o'clock.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.045 position:50% align:center
Two o'clock.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
They've fanned out and
are heading this way!

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
And one more thing.

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
Do not call me
"Apocalypse Beast."

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
My hero name is still Gevaudan!

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
If all three of them
are approaching,

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
they must know where we are.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
Is there anyone on their
team who has recon powers?

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh. Hey wait, Apocabeast?

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.151 position:50% align:center
Something's stuck to you.

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
It looks like part
of Kaminari's gear.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.407 position:50% align:center
[SHIOZAKI]
One person captured.

00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
I will drag them
into the light.

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Be ready for anything.
We don't know who it is!

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
Kaminari could be coming in hot.

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
Right about that!
Sucks to be you!

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
Hope you had a good time.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:25.759 position:50% align:center
'Cause you three're about
to taste a triple shock!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center
A sacrificial lamb.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.846 position:50% align:center
Ah--

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.598 position:50% align:center
[SHIOZAKI]
Faith's Shield!

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
[SHIOZAKI] The many layers
of vines have sealed off

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.523 position:50% align:center
his electricity, and even
if anything gets through,

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
the shield will cast it aside.

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:45.028 position:50% align:center
It's a perfect protector.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
Oh, I got this.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
Your overgrown hair
extensions won't save you!

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
If I'm within ten
meters of a pointer,

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.205 position:50% align:center
my powers shoot straight for it.

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
[groans] No way!

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.592 position:50% align:center
That was close!

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Hiryu Rin. Quirk: Scales.

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.389 position:50% align:center
He generates hard scales
all over his body!

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center
He can shoot them,
or they can act as armor!

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] Next! Hurry up
and get your vines ready.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.022 position:50% align:center
Right. Where are
the others hiding?

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
No! That wasn't me
talking just now!

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
It was Shinso's voice modifier!

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Vines? Seriously?

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:36.037 position:50% align:center
We're gonna have to deal
with Shiozaki, too.

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
It's over if she catches us.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:38.873 position:50% align:center
Should we turn back?

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
Hold up.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center
It's possible I have an idea.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:45.380 position:50% align:center
What if I'm the only one
of us who gets captured?

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
But why?

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
If they think I'm like
the big bad out here,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.177 position:50% align:center
I'm the last person
they'll wanna draw close.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
And during the sports festival,

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.222 position:50% align:center
Shiozaki had to use
a ton of vines

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
to protect against
my electricity.

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:57.726 position:50% align:center
I'll go wild and
become the focus

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
of their attacks, then she'll
have fewer vines to work with.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
You get it?

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
Pretty smart guy, huh?

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:06.443 position:50% align:center
Denki out!

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:09.404 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] Maybe I
underestimated my teammates.

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
Even he can be clever.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
That's the difference
experience makes.

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.415 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
This is the hero course.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.761 position:50% align:center
[RIN] I can't tell where
the voice came from.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
He's using echoes
to hide his position.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
Shishida? Where is
the enemy hiding?

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
Using words would be helpful.

00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
Hello? Seriously?

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
Ai-yah. You'd be
safe if you just

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.735 position:50% align:center
looked at my mouth, you know.

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
Okay fine, new plan
is to wake Shiozaki up.

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
I can jump faster than you can
shoot your Scale Bullets.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
She's too agile for me to hit.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:06.002 position:50% align:center
Shishida! Asui's here!

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:08.713 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Communication's breaking down.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.590 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Ribbit!

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
[RIN groans]

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA] Based on the
movement of the scent,

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
I can tell where
the true Asui is.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
Which means the
person hiding here

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
is definitely Shinso.

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:30.568 position:50% align:center
Impressive. You say
you're behind us.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.531 position:50% align:center
But you're a
terrifying opponent.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
I consider you a
proper threat already.

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
You're pretty good.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:53.967 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA]
I won't fall for that ruse!

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
But Eraser Head taught me well.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Binding cloth!

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:12.152 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA]
Not bad. Not bad at all.

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
But villains aren't
taken out so easily.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
They'd never be defeated
by something like that!

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Dodge!

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:22.954 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA]
I told you!

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Behind you!
Look out, Apocabeast!

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:29.085 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA] I won't let you
Brainwash me ever again!

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
Huh? "Apocabeast"?

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
C'mon! Duck! Please!

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA grunts]

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA grunts]

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.272 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Yes! Expertly done.

00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
Hey, Shinso's awesome.

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
I'd say he's good to transfer.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
No. Asui and Kaminari's
quick thinking let him shine.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.740 position:50% align:center
That's why he did so well.

00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:00.575 position:50% align:center
That's teamwork.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:03.328 position:50% align:center
By erasing their smells
with Asui's mucus,

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
making them hard to pinpoint,
and using the vocal modifier,

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
they made it so the other
team couldn't communicate.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.506 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] With enough time
to prepare, he was able

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
to control the fight and use
their paranoia against them!

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
Brainwashing.

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center
It's an even more annoying Quirk
than I thought it was before.

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] With his voice
changing support item

00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
and the binding cloth,

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
he's completely different
from the person

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
I fought at the
sports festival.

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he's
been training hard

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
this whole time
without us knowing.

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] You can't help the
things your heart longs for.

00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] He's working hard
to achieve his dream.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.001 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
In order to become a hero.

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shiozaki, wake up!
Come back to earth.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Why am I
in the prison?

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
What happened here?

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
[yelps] I was forced to
complete these vile actions?

00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
I failed my flock.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.399 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.
I have sinned.

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
[TSUBURABA]
No! Shiozaki! Stay with me!

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:18.278 position:50% align:center
We just got you back!

00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
And I'm already
countless steps behind.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
I need to prove myself.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
You're not behind at all.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
I don't think we could have won
this fight without you, Shinso.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] I'm not nearly
where I need to be.

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
I can't let others carry me.

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
I need to grow strong enough
to become a pro hero on my own.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.438 position:50% align:center
Despite their failures,

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.400 position:50% align:center
the team of Class A plus
Shinso are the winners!

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:31.411 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:35.040 position:50% align:center
It's the second match in the
battle between Classes A and B.

00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:37.375 position:50% align:center
The Class B team learned
from their classmates' loss

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:39.627 position:50% align:center
in the first round and have
come up with an elaborate plan

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.921 position:50% align:center
that centers around Kendo.

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:44.341 position:50% align:center
With Tokoyami's Dark
Shadow taken out of play,

00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:47.135 position:50% align:center
will the Class A team be
able to pull off a victory?

00:23:47.177 --> 00:23:50.263 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Operation
New Improv Moves."

00:23:50.305 --> 00:23:52.474 position:50% align:center
Tokoyami's new power
will finally be revealed

00:23:52.515 --> 00:23:54.893 position:50% align:center
for the first time in Japan.

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:57.270 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
