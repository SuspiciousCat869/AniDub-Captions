[KATSUKI]
What the crap?

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.732 position:50% align:center
My sister invited
everyone for dinner.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.066 position:50% align:center
Why the crap?

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.985 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] Because she
wanted to meet my friends.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] You march in there
right now and tell her

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.864 position:50% align:center
we aren't and never will
be friends, hear me?

Kacchan!

[FUYUMI]
Come on in!

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
Thank you for making time
in your busy schedules

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center
to drop by for a bite.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
I'm Fuyumi, Shoto's older

Thank you both for
watching out for him!

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:46.713 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] During our work studies
at Endeavor's agency,

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:50.175 position:50% align:center
Kacchan and I got an unexpected
invitation to Todoroki's house,

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
where we shared a meal
with his family.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.061 position:50% align:center
[NATSUO]
Sorry, but I just can't do this.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.115 position:50% align:center
Listen, I... It's not
that I don't sometimes

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.742 position:50% align:center
feel the way Natsuo does.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:16.910 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI gasps]

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:18.078 position:50% align:center

But...

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.747 position:50% align:center
Now is our chance to fix this.

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:26.294 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Todoroki. I know
it's not my business.

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:27.754 position:50% align:center
But I think, deep down,
you're ready

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:29.798 position:50% align:center
to move forward with your dad.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.800 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI gasps]

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:33.009 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Don't get me wrong though,

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.053 position:50% align:center
if you don't forgive
him, that's up to you.

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:37.972 position:50% align:center
No one can force you
to accept him.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.474 position:50% align:center
Thing is...

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:42.435 position:50% align:center
...you're a really
caring person.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.064 position:50% align:center
Seems like you're just
waiting for something.

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:47.816 position:50% align:center
If that's what's going on,

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.527 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll know how
to feel when the time comes.

[POLICE OFFICER 106A]
We've got this villain covered.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
He won't be a problem.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
You did a fine job. Thank you.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.545 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] You're thinking
All Might would've settled

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
the matter 30 minutes
sooner aren't you?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
You wish he'd answered the call.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
No, sir. Nothing of the sort!

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
That villain is
no joke. Watch him.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
[POLICE OFFICER 106A]
Yes, sir!

[ENDING]
Ahh... Endeavor.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:54.025 position:50% align:center
It's been so long.

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.362 position:50% align:center
You left such a strong
first impression on me.

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center
You blazed like
a walking inferno.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center
A star in the form of a man.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
One look and I knew nothing
could outshine you.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
Do you remember, Endeavor?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.212 position:50% align:center
It was the day when
I'd lost all hope.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
Even the autumn clouds
seemed to be mocking me.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
I saw you just after you
captured a thief named Takami.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
Ever since that day,
you have been my only hope.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
Seven years ago,
my dream almost came true,

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
but you took me alive.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.482 position:50% align:center
The only thing a man should
get to choose for himself

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.109 position:50% align:center
is his ending. 

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center

At last!

The day has come
for us to meet again.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
What do you think I did first
after getting out of prison?

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
Before I even ate.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
The most important thing.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
I started digging into
your personal life!

00:04:56.254 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
Why, you ask? Isn't it obvious?

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.222 position:50% align:center
[ENDING]
I want you to end me.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
Yes, Endeavor.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50% align:center
You are the one I long for.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Another brother?

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
I thought you three
were close.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
So I figured you would have
told them all about Toya.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
It's not exactly an
easy subject to broach.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
Natsu and Toya were incredibly
close when we were growing up.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
They spent their days
playing together.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center
It happened soon after
Mom was hospitalized.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
Somehow... her condition
got even worse

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.762 position:50% align:center
when she was committed.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:50.141 position:50% align:center
To the point that Shoto
couldn't go see her.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
But things have
gotten much better.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.606 position:50% align:center
Especially since Shoto
started visiting.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
Our family's been
making progress.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
Except Natsu.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
He can't let go of his
anger toward our dad.

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:07.701 position:50% align:center
In his mind,

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
our father basically
killed Toya.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
So, that's why his
face was all angsty.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to
drop this on you.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.131 position:50% align:center
No! You're good!

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center

I want to see you progress

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
Look at shifting your schedules.

In addition to our weekends,

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
I want you all working two days
during the school week.

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
That's how it was
for Uraraka, Kirishima,

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
and the others last time.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.582 position:50% align:center

Ever since I found

Not so fast!

Finally. You remember
me, don't you?

Say you do!

Seven years ago.

You were on the verge
of a rampage.

But I showed up.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
You went by a villain name.

But you gotta understand.

You had so many things

Not in 1,000,000 years.

That's why I admire you!

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
Wrong, nerd.

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
Huh? You finally
picked one? Tell me!

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
Don't even ask!

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
No way in hell
I'll ever tell you.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:21.828 position:50% align:center
You can drop dead!

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
How about me then?

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
Forget it! You can share
the nerd's coffin.

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
There's someone I
gotta run it by first.

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Hawks. Looks like
you've got sharp eyes.

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS sneezes]

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Somebody's talking about me.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Aw. Is it you, Endeavor?

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
With the madman captured,

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.827 position:50% align:center
Endeavor took us back to school.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center
Eventually, Todoroki told me
what happened afterward.

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:33.460 position:50% align:center
You were attacked by a villain?

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.129 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.131 position:50% align:center
Shoto and those friends
of his rescued me.

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:40.008 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI]
Seriously?

00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:41.217 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:48.224 position:50% align:center
I already talked to Shoto
and Natsuo about this.

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
I know you're trying to get
things to where your mother

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:54.064 position:50% align:center
is able to come back
home peacefully.

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:55.774 position:50% align:center
That's such a burden.

00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:59.444 position:50% align:center
And we ended up making
you do all the work.

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.738 position:50% align:center
Don't worry anymore.

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.615 position:50% align:center
I'll build a new house
somewhere that's in

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:07.243 position:50% align:center
a more convenient location
for the two of you.

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:10.789 position:50% align:center
You can welcome your
mother home there.

00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
According to her
attending physician,

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:15.043 position:50% align:center
she'll be discharged soon.

00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:16.836 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the
last-minute notice,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.422 position:50% align:center
but start preparing for a move.

00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:21.257 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI]
Wait, Dad!

00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:24.552 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI]
What about you?

00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:30.058 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
What can I do for my family?

00:22:30.141 --> 00:22:32.352 position:50% align:center
Where do I begin?

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:35.146 position:50% align:center
These questions keep
me up at night.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.736 position:50% align:center
Recently, I've been
having the same dream.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.447 position:50% align:center
My wife and children
look like they're having fun

00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:46.324 position:50% align:center
around the dinner table.

00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:50.120 position:50% align:center
Laughing over simple things.

00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:56.584 position:50% align:center
They share moments of joy.
Happy to be together.

00:22:56.668 --> 00:23:00.839 position:50% align:center
But... I'm never at that table.

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:06.720 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Yes, if I truly
care about them...

00:23:09.264 --> 00:23:12.642 position:50% align:center
Are you going to come
and live with us or...?

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:14.102 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
I'll remain here.

00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:15.395 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:18.773 --> 00:23:23.737 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
If I truly care about them,

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.488 position:50% align:center
I'll stay away.

00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:32.120 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:34.539 position:50% align:center
The third term has
begun at UA High!

00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:37.083 position:50% align:center
We try to improve our skills
as we tackle both schoolwork

00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:38.877 position:50% align:center
and work studies,
juggling patrols,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.837 position:50% align:center
training, and textbooks.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.381 position:50% align:center
While we work hard,
Mr. Aizawa and Present Mic

00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:46.760 position:50% align:center
go see Kurogiri, who's locked
up inside of Tartarus.

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:49.387 position:50% align:center
What is Kurogiri's
terrible secret?

00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:52.474 position:50% align:center
Next time: "More of
a Hero Than Anyone."

00:23:52.557 --> 00:23:55.602 position:50% align:center
A tragic truth we never
saw coming is revealed!

00:23:55.685 --> 00:23:57.771 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
