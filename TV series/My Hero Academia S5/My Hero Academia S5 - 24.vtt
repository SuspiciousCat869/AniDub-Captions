be driven into a corner.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
Now we must be careful of Dabi

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
in a meta ability fight
with the League.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
His flame attacks have
an impressive reach.

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
Geten, you are the
cornerstone of our army.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
[GETEN]
I'm so sorry, Re-Destro.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
I made you worry.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:07.125 position:50% align:center
[GETEN groans]

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
[HANABATA]
We must protect our leader!

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.172 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Giran! Pick up the pace!

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
Quick! Get to Re-Destro!

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI gasps]

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:37.197 position:50% align:center
So, 150 percent you said?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
You going all "Plus Ultra"
on me or what?

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.411 position:50% align:center
[GIGANTOMACHIA]
Master's successor.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] We seek
freedom from suppression.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.710 position:50% align:center
We believe that using
meta abilities at will

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
is a natural human right.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
After suffering and awakening,

00:11:57.092 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
it's as though this
man has changed.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] He's been
liberated from everything.

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
I see.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
That's what this throbbing
in my chest is.

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI grunts]
Have to get outside his range.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:25.620 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE] Do not be afraid.
Try thinking of it this way--

00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
People's livelihoods.
Their dreams. Their breath.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
All of it rests in
your powerful hands.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.672 position:50% align:center
You can crush them,

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
or make them your playthings.
Whatever you wish.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
If you can meld
both hate and joy

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:47.100 position:50% align:center
in your heart,
then you will be free.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
Destroy it all.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Did your feet touch the ground?

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
Too bad.

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center
You must have cut them off

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
to keep your body
from disintegrating, huh?

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Hey. Remind me.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:14.437 position:50% align:center
Why were we fighting again?

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, it's because
you made us come out here.

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
[HANABATA]
Re-Destro!

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.370 position:50% align:center
The grand commander
has been hurt.

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:31.371 position:50% align:center
It can't be.

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:32.789 position:50% align:center
[HANABATA]
Don't just stand there,

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
go save our glorious leader!

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
[HANABATA] Incite was
negated! It can't be!

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
Trumpet.

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
Any more fighting...

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.059 position:50% align:center
...would be pointless.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
Free use of meta abilities.

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.988 position:50% align:center
Not suppression, but liberation.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
I understand... Great Destro.

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
The one who should be at
the forefront of liberation.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:15.832 position:50% align:center
The one who will create
the world you dreamed of.

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
Is a person who
embodies freedom.

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
This young man
laughed off our history

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
and bloodline, saying
they were restricting me.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
I see it so clearly now.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
The figure before me
is a shining beacon.

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
This army agrees with my--

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:44.569 position:50% align:center
no, with Destro's principles.

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
They are prepared to become
martyrs for the cause.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.032 position:50% align:center
It's as you said.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
I picked a fight
and you prevailed.

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
Kill me if you like.

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to sacrifice myself
for Destro's dying wish.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
The Meta Liberation Army

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
is now under your command.

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
The Successor.

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS] If we'd
worked with the Hassaikai,

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
then maybe we'd be enjoying

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
a fancy platter of sushi
in a nicer room.

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:27.320 position:50% align:center
So tell me.

00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
You're the CEO
of Detnerat, right?

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.867 position:50% align:center
Which means that you're rich.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Tragedy struck a peaceful city.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
Criminals used a fake
emergency to lure heroes

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
to a faraway location
so they could attack

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
without fear of interference.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
Facing an unexpected
threat, the residents

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
of Deika City banded
together in resistance.

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.102 position:50% align:center
The heroes joined the fray

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
after realizing
they'd been tricked.

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
By that time, many residents
had lost their lives.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
Eventually, all 20 members of
the criminal group were killed.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
The heroes closed the case.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
The news reported that
Detnerat's president and CEO

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
happened to be present in Deika
City at the time of the attack.

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
He managed to survive.

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center
Although he had to
amputate both of his legs.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Some said the untrained
civilians did more harm

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:34.804 position:50% align:center
than good by using their Quirks
to fight against the threats.

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
But the world at large
couldn't stop talking about

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
the heroism of the residents.

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, the incident
left behind many mysteries.

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
Huzzah. We live to fight on.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:52.155 position:50% align:center
What doesn't kill us
makes us stronger.

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
You didn't actually do
that much to help.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
Oh, come off it.
Running away has its merits.

00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
[SPINNER] Dabi, if you don't
eat, there'll be nothing left.

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
Meh. Eat all you
want, I hate fish.

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Toga, please forgive me!

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
But if you hadn't shared
your blood with Toga,

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
then right now,
other Toga would be...

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] Please stop
babbling at that pic.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
I'm still alive and
you're creeping me out.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Yeah, let's stop doing
what other people don't like!

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
My leg's moving on its own!

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.184 position:50% align:center
Don't kick without
my permission!

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
I was a bad boy. Don't hit me.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? What did
you just say, me?

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
I thought your broken psyche

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
got stitched back together.
But you seem worse.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sounds like there
are more of you now.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
Guess trauma
doesn't just vanish.

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU]
It's time. Come.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Bite me!

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
We're still eating our
sushi in here, ya jerk!

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU] Sushi that was
purchased using our funds.

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
The medical treatment,
video editing,

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
and Toga's new coat
were also benefits

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
of our financial sponsorship.

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Yeah, well don't forget,
if it weren't for us,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.466 position:50% align:center
baldy would be in the hospital
instead of in a swanky hideout.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
You must put a stop
to this, Skeptic.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
These are who the grand--I mean,

00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:01.016 position:50% align:center
Re-Destro chose to lead
our people into the future.

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
Re-Destro's words
are Destro's words.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
That makes them absolute.

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.483 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] Welcome,
and thank you for coming.

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
Liberation warriors!

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
I am Re-Destro.
It's a pleasure to see you.

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
Today, the Metahuman
Liberation Army

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50% align:center
will be reborn!

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] I thought all of
Tomura's hands got busted

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
while he was fighting.

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:28.293 position:50% align:center
[SPINNER]
Nah. One was still intact.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
It's a miracle the thing made it
off that battlefield unscathed.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] At least he doesn't have
to come up with a new trademark.

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] I believed without
a doubt that the League

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.762 position:50% align:center
was an obstacle
until I faced them!

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
I had blinders on!
But now I have seen the light!

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
A new dawn is ahead of us.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
I was a prisoner of my blood.

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
Unable to break free from
what I'd been taught!

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.691 position:50% align:center
But then I witnessed
real liberation!

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
This is not me
surrendering, my friends!

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
It's me doing what's
best for our cause.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
Tomura Shigaraki is truly free!

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:03.578 position:50% align:center
He filled me with awe, which
necessitated my abdication!

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
From this moment,
the Liberation Army recognizes

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
Tomura Shigaraki
as grand commander.

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
As we move toward
freedom and strive

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
for Destro's world,
the Metahuman Liberation Army

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
and the League of Villains
unite under a new name!

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
Ooh, here we go, here we go!

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] The idea came
from myself and Spinner

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.348 position:50% align:center
from the League!

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
Now, the name please,
Tomura Shigaraki!

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] "The Paranormal
Liberation Front"!

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:35.193 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] We got rid of the
term "villain" and expanded

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
on the whole "meta" angle
to be a little more inclusive.

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
The nine people on stage
are my lieutenants.

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
Teams will be assigned
to them based on our needs.

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the name's the same
as this hand a decoration.

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:55.714 position:50% align:center
We'll do what we want.

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
[LIBERATION ARMY]
Yeah!

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
Excellent work today,
grand commander!

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.225 position:50% align:center
Can I interest you
in something to drink?

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Go.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
With pleasure!

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
Trumpet! We're leaving.

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
[HANABATA] How painful.
I hate seeing him like this.

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
--[SHIGARAKI grunts]
--[SPINNER] Whoa.

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
He took so much damage,

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
it's a miracle he's still alive.

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] "The Paranormal
Liberation Front."

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
That's what I call
a flashy name.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess it's better
than something tacky

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:32.751 position:50% align:center
like "the League of Villains."

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
Machia listened to me.
I played your damn game.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
And I think I reached
that minimum level

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
you were talking about.

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:43.094 position:50% align:center
Yes. Your memory is back,

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
and you've returned to your
original self, Quirk included.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:52.604 position:50% align:center
So, as I promised,
I will grant you power.

00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
If you're sure
that's what you want.

00:23:29.451 --> 00:23:30.910 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.704 position:50% align:center
Tomura Shigaraki
is now in control

00:23:32.787 --> 00:23:35.331 position:50% align:center
of the entire Liberation Army.

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:37.500 position:50% align:center
When the heroes
get this information,

00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:42.172 position:50% align:center
they begin preparations to go
up against a horde of villains.

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:44.215 position:50% align:center
A terrible fight approaches.

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:45.925 position:50% align:center
And we UA High
students get caught up

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:49.095 position:50% align:center
in the whirlwind of
turmoil and confusion.

00:23:49.179 --> 00:23:51.890 position:50% align:center
Next time,
"The High, Deep Blue Sky."

00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:54.768 position:50% align:center
The signal fire for
total war has been lit.

00:23:54.851 --> 00:23:57.187 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
