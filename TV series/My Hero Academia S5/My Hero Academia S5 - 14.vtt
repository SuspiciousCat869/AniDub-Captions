00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:13.013 position:50% align:center
[DABI]
Hawks.

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
What happened the other
day was unfortunate.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.226 position:50% align:center
Yeah, agreed.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.144 position:50% align:center
Most the problems coulda
been avoided though

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
if you'd just given
me a heads up.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:35.494 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I get that plans change,
but I would've liked

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
to have dealt with things
a little more efficiently.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
[DABI] You're talking too much.
You can't trace this call.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:42.459 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Gimme a break.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.711 position:50% align:center
You gotta have more
faith in me than that.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.256 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 102A squeals]
Look!

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
Hawks is on the phone!

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.260 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 102B]
Who's he talking to?

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.427 position:50% align:center
His girlfriend?

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
It's a secret!

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:56.932 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Who is she, Hawks?

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
All I want's for you
to believe in me.

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:00.477 position:50% align:center
I work with pros every day

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.105 position:50% align:center
and there's one thing
I know for certain.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:08.735 position:50% align:center
The profession of "hero"
needs to be done away with.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
No way you can cast me aside.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.448 position:50% align:center
You're reaching out
to me like this

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:17.452 position:50% align:center
because you know how
much I'm worth to you.

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:20.455 position:50% align:center
For now I'll keep playing
the fool, then you'll focus

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.585 position:50% align:center
more on how I can help you
than the risks I may pose.

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
It's in your interest
to make good use of me.

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:34.803 position:50% align:center
[DABI]
This is your last chance.

00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:36.180 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Knew it.

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.348 position:50% align:center
[DABI] I'll have you
show your loyalty.

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:39.975 position:50% align:center
Not just to the
League of Villains,

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:43.020 position:50% align:center
but the entire the
anti-establishment cause.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.523 position:50% align:center
Make it someone other than
the number-one hero this time.

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.695 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Dabi contacted me again.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.448 position:50% align:center
He's still not convinced
I'm on his side.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:59.578 position:50% align:center
My guess is someone's observing
me and my conversations.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.539 position:50% align:center
It'd be smart to send
everything in code from now on.

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:06.793 position:50% align:center
I'll pinpoint the location of
the Nomus as soon as I can.

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:09.254 position:50% align:center
That's all. I'm off.

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:16.720 position:50% align:center
[BEST JEANIST] It's unusual
for you to come visit me.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.473 position:50% align:center
How are you holdin'
up these days?

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:21.892 position:50% align:center
[BEST JEANIST]
Much better. Thanks.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.940 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you just ask
that ancient nurse at UA

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.441 position:50% align:center
to help out with your recovery?

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:31.944 position:50% align:center
[BEST JEANIST] She can't restore
what's been taken away,

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.321 position:50% align:center
and I lost a lung
in that battle.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.448 position:50% align:center
But fortunately, it's possible
for humans to live

00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:38.534 position:50% align:center
with only one of them.

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:40.702 position:50% align:center
What about your hero work?

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:43.580 position:50% align:center
[BEST JEANIST] I plan to return
to the public eye soon.

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:48.001 position:50% align:center
There are many eager for me
to be on the streets again.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:49.837 position:50% align:center
You don't say.

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
This doesn't feel right.

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
It's past our meeting time and
I still can't get a hold of him.

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:10.107 position:50% align:center
Nothing on the Hero Network
about the League

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.109 position:50% align:center
being spotted either,
so there shouldn't

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.528 position:50% align:center
be a holdup or anything.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.990 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?
Did I do something wrong?

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
This change in behavior
is unnerving.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
I don't like it.

00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:34.214 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I can't start
doubting my resolve

00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:36.258 position:50% align:center
on the last day of the year.

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
New Year's Eve!

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
I'd thought it might be out of
the question for us to go home

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:17.985 position:50% align:center
since we moved to the dorms.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
But thanks to escorts from
pro heroes, we were able

00:05:20.404 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
to spend the night celebrating
with the people we cared about.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
Thanks to Uraraka and Shinso,
it turned out fine,

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
but that dark energy was scary!

00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:30.581 position:50% align:center
You should've scene it explo-- 

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.374 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU'S MOM sobs]
--[IZUKU] Mom?

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU'S MOM] My heart hurts
to hear you say such things.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.717 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.468 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Oh, uh! By the way!

00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:44.553 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
Remember that girl
I told you about?

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.848 position:50% align:center
Eri, the one we rescued.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:48.891 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU'S MOM]
I do.

00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:50.726 position:50% align:center
Well, look here.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
She wrote me the nicest letter!

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
Isn't that cool?

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.441 position:50% align:center
She did it while practicing
her spelling and stuff.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I couldn't help her
as much as I'd have liked to.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.988 position:50% align:center
But she did her best
writing this for me.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
I think it's incredible.

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
Mom, come on!

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center
The Koike family downstairs
will think there's a leak!

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.292 position:50% align:center
Ever since you were little,

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
you've been trying
to copy All Might.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
Saying you'd save people even
though you weren't that strong.

00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
Even if you got hurt.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.928 position:50% align:center
If there's one thought
I've had more than any other,

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:29.890 position:50% align:center
it's that, as a mother,
I have to protect my son.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
That's gone through
my head so often.

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50% align:center
But talking to you like this...

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
Seeing that look on your face...

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:42.319 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'll
worry as much anymore.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU, IZUKU'S MOM sobbing]

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Just like that,
a new year began.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.211 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU'S MOM]
You have everything?

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.379 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Mm-hm.

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:01.839 position:50% align:center
Promise me you'll
take care of yourself?

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:02.673 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
And text as much as you can.

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.928 position:50% align:center
Give your all at your
work study, 'kay?

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
I promise, Mom.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.735 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Endeavor's agency awaited.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
What's up, I'm back.

00:07:29.408 --> 00:07:31.535 position:50% align:center
[SLIDIN' GO] Oh? I didn't
realize you'd flown off

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:32.703 position:50% align:center
somewhere, Number Two.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Yeah, sorry. Gabbed a coffee.

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:36.623 position:50% align:center
The stuff here
tastes like sewage.

00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:39.126 position:50% align:center
[SLIDIN' GO] You can't keep
comin' and goin' as you like!

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.253 position:50% align:center
You should get permission
for whatever you do.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Ugh.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.923 position:50% align:center
[SLIDIN' GO] Don't forget,
I outrank you here, Hawks!

00:07:45.007 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:47.134 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Sir!

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.052 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU] Outrank?
Are you sure about that?

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:50.470 position:50% align:center
[SLIDIN' GO]
Huh?

00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:52.514 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU] It's my first time
hearing such a thing.

00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:54.850 position:50% align:center
Then, you must also be
in a position to obtain

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.978 position:50% align:center
classified information
from influential heroes.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.188 position:50% align:center
Well, sort of.

00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:01.857 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU]
Current locations! Call records!

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.984 position:50% align:center
Real-time feeds
of conversations!

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.361 position:50% align:center
Hawks provides these.

00:08:06.445 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the countless micro
devices installed in his wings,

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:14.203 position:50% align:center
we'll expose everything
about the heroes.

00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:16.205 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU] A grunt like
you can off us a peek

00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
at the Hero Network at best.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.585 position:50% align:center
But as the number-two hero,
Hawks can go much deeper!

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.171 position:50% align:center
He's a valued asset.

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.298 position:50% align:center
I was watching you
the whole time.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:30.093 position:50% align:center
You almost bought black
coffee and freaked out.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
What can I say,
I like it sweet.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the
Endeavor Agency.

00:08:42.648 --> 00:08:45.526 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I
have to train you.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:50.280 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] I gave my permission
reluctantly as a favor to Shoto,

00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
but I wish he'd come on his own.

00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:54.326 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] It's already
done, so don't complain.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.661 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Wha-- Shoto!

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking since
supplementary lessons.

00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:00.541 position:50% align:center
You're a jerk.

00:09:00.624 --> 00:09:03.669 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Son, are you really
friends with this deliquent?

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] But, if I can see
how the top hero works,

00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
I don't really care.

00:09:07.506 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] I told you to
choose your allies wisely!

00:09:09.842 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
We appreciate you allowing us

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.220 position:50% align:center
to do our work studies
with you, sir.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.516 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Flame Hero, Endeavor.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
Currently the top pro.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
His intensity and intimidation
make him stand out.

00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:25.774 position:50% align:center
My strongest impression of him
is from the sports fest.

00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:29.236 position:50% align:center
I generally think
he's a scary guy.

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.572 position:50% align:center
But something
about him's changed.

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Joining Endeavor, huh?

00:09:35.826 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
All three of you?
That sounds perfect!

00:09:38.537 --> 00:09:40.163 position:50% align:center
It's a great opportunity.

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:44.126 position:50% align:center
What should we do about
my One For All training, though?

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.712 position:50% align:center
I think it's going smoothly
for the time being.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
Sure, you have Blackwhip
to deal with now.

00:09:48.881 --> 00:09:52.426 position:50% align:center
But you haven't felt any other
Quirks manifesting, right?

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
If you can visualize the locking
and unlocking properly,

00:09:55.137 --> 00:09:56.180 position:50% align:center
I don't think you need to worry

00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:58.098 position:50% align:center
about it getting out
of control again.

00:09:58.182 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:01.268 position:50% align:center
If I were you, I'd try
to bust all of 'em out.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
Well, uh...

00:10:02.895 --> 00:10:05.147 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] This is good timing
for you, too, Young Bakugo.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:09.276 position:50% align:center
I'd say you and Endeavor
are similar in many ways.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
It'll be worthwhile for you
to see what he's really like.

00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:14.323 position:50% align:center
He appears to be transforming.

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.201 position:50% align:center
Do your best.

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:20.746 position:50% align:center
If you two wanna be top heroes,
this is a solid next step!

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
We'll do our best to
learn from you, sir!

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.293 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to work with
the number-one hero!

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
Shoto is not me.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.763 position:50% align:center
You said that.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
Sorry about this.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:45.521 position:50% align:center
But I only intend
to look after my son.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.566 position:50% align:center
If you wanna learn,
then stand back and watch!

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
What are your instructions!

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.907 position:50% align:center
Like I said. Just stand back!

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
[STARSERVANT] I have received
a divine revelation

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
from the universe!

00:11:07.543 --> 00:11:10.587 position:50% align:center
Run. Flee this place, citizens!

00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
The corners of Pluto's mouth
twist with loneliness!

00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:18.929 position:50% align:center
The hour of your demise
is nigh at hand.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.686 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Well, dang.
This is crappy timing.

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
He ordered us to hold back.

00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:47.791 position:50% align:center
We can't watch if
we don't follow him.

00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:53.839 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Endeavor started running
before the sound of the impact.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.175 position:50% align:center
It's not just a
matter of being fast!

00:12:01.847 --> 00:12:05.309 position:50% align:center
[STARSERVANT] The universe has
whispered into my brain.

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:09.730 position:50% align:center
The wicked stars are colluding!
They must be stopped at once!

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.148 position:50% align:center
[OFFICE WORKER 102AA]
That's the Servant of the Stars

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.566 position:50% align:center
from the second ward.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.902 position:50% align:center
[OFFICE WORKER 102A] What's he
yelling about so early?

00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:19.573 position:50% align:center
[STARSERVANT] This land will
soon be devoured by darkness.

00:12:22.326 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center
[OFFICE WORKERS yelp]

00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
[OFFICE WORKER 102A]
He's sucking up all the glass!

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
Are there any heroes
around here to help us?

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
[STARSERVANT] Run, citizens!
For it is I who must act.

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:37.049 position:50% align:center
And destroy the source
of this rottenness.

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.427 position:50% align:center
[STARSERVANT] 
No more hiding.

00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:41.595 position:50% align:center
Come forth!

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.932 position:50% align:center
Show yourself,
Messenger of Pluto!

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:47.935 position:50% align:center
[STARSERVANT grunts]

Flashfire Fist.

[ENDEAVOR]
You control glass, old man?

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:59.112 position:50% align:center
You show great skill.
Why create such chaos?

00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:04.243 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I can't let
you get away with this.

00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:07.329 position:50% align:center
[STARSERVANT screams]
My throat is burning!

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:10.040 position:50% align:center
[LOCAL HERO 102A]
Endeavor!

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.792 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Handle evacuations.

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
[STARSERVANT]
Do it.

00:13:22.094 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Huh? What's this?

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.563 position:50% align:center
Got yourself some followers.

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
It's Hawks!

00:13:34.273 --> 00:13:37.442 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Sorry, I was just
a little faster than you.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:42.114 position:50% align:center
I thought Endeavor might
need a bit of help out here.

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
Does it look like
I was in trouble?

00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:46.952 position:50% align:center
I mean kinda.
What do you think, kid?

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.829 position:50% align:center
Oh. Um.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.707 position:50% align:center
I said to warn me
before showing up.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.419 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Didn't have time.
I was already in the area.

00:13:57.671 --> 00:14:00.257 position:50% align:center
[UNDERLING 102A] We were just
following Starservant's orders!

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.718 position:50% align:center
[UNDERLING 102B]
We couldn't disobey him!

00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center
[STARSERVANT]
Let go!

00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:06.722 position:50% align:center
If you don't release me
to my duties, all is lost!

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
[LOCAL HERO 102A] Don't worry.
I'll take over from here.

00:14:08.599 --> 00:14:09.600 position:50% align:center
Sounds good.

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.768 position:50% align:center
[STARSERVANT]
Him! He's the source!

00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:14.730 position:50% align:center
The fire he gives
off blinds you!

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:17.691 position:50% align:center
He will be the demise
of our world!

00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:21.320 position:50% align:center
You got it done with
no casualties again.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
As long as we have
you to protect us,

00:14:23.614 --> 00:14:25.616 position:50% align:center
this town will know peace, sir.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.166 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Nice to meet you, sir.

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
I'm from UA High's
hero course.

00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:39.004 position:50% align:center
I'm in Class 1-A.
My name is Izuku Midoriya!

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:42.174 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Yeah. You're the kid
who destroys his fingers.

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:44.468 position:50% align:center
I've heard about you
from Tsukuyomi.

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.887 position:50% align:center
Man, I was hopin' I'd get
to work with him again soon,

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
but not today.

00:14:48.347 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Where is Tokoyami?

00:14:50.182 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
Isn't he continuing his
work study at your Agency?

00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:54.228 position:50% align:center
I've pawned him off
on my sidekicks

00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:56.730 position:50% align:center
to train for the moment.
I feel bad, but I've got

00:14:56.813 --> 00:15:00.067 position:50% align:center
a ton of stuff on my plate
and don't have time for him.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.945 position:50% align:center
You may be quick, but I
was still faster than you.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Really? Hm.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.074 position:50% align:center
Well? What is it
you want, Hawks?

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Oh. Nothing much.
Actually, I do have a question.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center
You happen to have
read this book?

00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:16.625 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Meta Liberation War?

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:18.210 position:50% align:center
What is this about?

00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:21.046 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Eh, it's gotten
really popular recently.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
It was written a while back,
but it has predictions

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:26.426 position:50% align:center
about the future that seem
pretty relevant today.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.928 position:50% align:center
Like this passage.

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.931 position:50% align:center
"If you grant freedom to
a limited number of people,

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:34.101 position:50% align:center
then the burdens of the world
will go to the others."

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:35.853 position:50% align:center
I highlighted some parts
if you don't have time

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:39.648 position:50% align:center
to plow through the whole thing.
I suggest you read those.

00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:41.567 position:50% align:center
The leader of the
Meta Liberation Army

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.777 position:50% align:center
was named Destro. What he wanted

00:15:43.861 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
was a society upheld
by personal responsibility!

00:15:47.573 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
Trendy idea lately.

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
Sorry to beat around
the bush here, man.

00:15:53.996 --> 00:15:55.414 position:50% align:center
And your point is?

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:57.875 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
If that comes to fruition,

00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
we'll have too much
time on our hands.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
I'm probably being watched,

00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center
so I can only tell
you like this.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.719 position:50% align:center
Please, understand
my message, Number One!

00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:13.432 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I just wanna take it
easy and have some fun.

00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:15.267 position:50% align:center
My goal is to make this
a world where heroes

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.145 position:50% align:center
have too much time
on their hands.

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Why do I feel as
though something's not right?

00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
That look on his face.

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.278 position:50% align:center
What does it mean?

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.616 position:50% align:center
Make sure you read
through it, okay?

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:33.869 position:50% align:center
A book that Hawks is pushing?
I should check it out, too.

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center
Maybe the secret to his speed
is hidden inside of it!

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
Here you go! I brought
extras just in case!

00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] So prepared!
Where did they come from?

00:16:42.753 --> 00:16:43.712 position:50% align:center
Train hard!

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.881 position:50% align:center
It's the age of
the number-two pro!

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
If you want speed,

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
the power to predict what's
coming helps you get it.

00:16:51.178 --> 00:16:53.222 position:50% align:center
He's even too fast
at passing them out!

00:16:53.305 --> 00:16:55.516 position:50% align:center
You really love this
book, I guess, huh?

00:16:55.599 --> 00:16:57.351 position:50% align:center
You've got so many copies of it.

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:58.936 position:50% align:center
He's trying to spread the word!

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.479 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
That's right!

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:03.315 position:50% align:center
I've been recommending it
to heroes across the country.

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:05.484 position:50% align:center
You watch. By the
time I'm though,

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:09.613 position:50% align:center
there will be a groundwork
for the liberation ideology.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:12.407 position:50% align:center
You should at least look over
the highlighted lines.

00:17:12.491 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
Read them closely.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
I recommend the second part.

00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:21.917 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Do your best with the
work studies, all four of you!

00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
[CHAIRWOMAN] Train your work
study students thoroughly,

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:27.881 position:50% align:center
Endeavor.

00:17:30.092 --> 00:17:31.385 position:50% align:center
He may seem super carefree,

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:33.637 position:50% align:center
but I guess he's actually
socially conscious.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.514 position:50% align:center
And only 22 years old!

00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.766 position:50% align:center
And already the
number-two hero.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.268 position:50% align:center
That guy's annoying!

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.728 position:50% align:center
Yes. He is.

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
Upheld by personal
responsibility!

Call us the Flaming Sidekickers!

00:17:57.411 --> 00:18:00.581 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Holy whoa, it's the
famous sidekick, Burnin!

00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:02.541 position:50% align:center
First work study for
two of you, huh?

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.877 position:50% align:center
We'll get you whipped
into shape in no time here.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
You're gonna learn a lot!

00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:09.715 position:50% align:center
This agency is totally different
than classroom you're used to.

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
This is a gigantic operation!

00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
We've got more than
30 sidekicks employed!

00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:16.847 position:50% align:center
In other words, you're gonna
have to work hard to shine here!

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:17.764 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
You don't say!

00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:21.268 position:50% align:center
So we'll just have to beat
the pros at their own game.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
You can try.

00:18:22.728 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
[KIDO] And Shoto, you won't
get special treatment

00:18:24.897 --> 00:18:26.190 position:50% align:center
'cause you're the boss's kid.

00:18:26.273 --> 00:18:27.983 position:50% align:center
Just try to keep up
with us if you can!

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.276 position:50% align:center
There's a new dispatch request.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
Where is it?

00:18:30.194 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 102AA]
Area 37.

00:18:32.196 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 102A] Contact the
patrol team immediately!

00:18:34.198 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 102B]
It's too far from them.

00:18:35.324 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
We should go now!

00:18:36.742 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
There's so much going on!

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
[KIDO]
It is the number-one agency.

00:18:40.746 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center
Never a dull moment
around these parts.

00:18:43.624 --> 00:18:45.584 position:50% align:center
We get dispatch calls,
patrol jobs.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.044 position:50% align:center
Not to mention events.

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
Over 100 different requests
filter through this office

00:18:49.463 --> 00:18:50.631 position:50% align:center
on any given day.

00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:52.299 position:50% align:center
Then why are we just
standing around here

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
when we could be working?
I'm still ticked off

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:57.179 position:50% align:center
that damn bird rushed in
and stole my thunder!

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:58.931 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you
talking about Hawks?

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
[KIDO]
You got a fiery spirit.

00:19:00.516 --> 00:19:02.434 position:50% align:center
But wait for Endeavor's
orders, okay?

00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:04.937 position:50% align:center
You said there were over
100 requests, right?

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.605 position:50% align:center
--Send us out somewhere!
--[IZUKU] Kacchan!

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.357 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Please, it's our first day!

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.945 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
It makes no sense.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.613 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Now that you're number one,

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:16.949 position:50% align:center
I want you to be
a dependable leader.

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:19.576 position:50% align:center
You gotta stand proud,
Endeavor, and tell everyone

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.663 position:50% align:center
that there's nothing
for them to worry about.

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:25.332 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Why did he sound so different?

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
Upheld by personal
responsibility!

00:19:27.793 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
Trendy idea lately.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.841 position:50% align:center
It's like he was completely
negating everything from before.

00:19:33.924 --> 00:19:39.221 position:50% align:center
He usually has that vapid smile,
saying whatever comes to mind.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:43.267 position:50% align:center
But earlier, he wasn't
joking around at all.

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:50.232 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Why the change?

00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:53.944 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] You should at least look
over the highlighted lines.

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
Read them closely.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.198 position:50% align:center
I recommend the second part.

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
It didn't even sound like him.

00:20:04.246 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center
There's something he can't say.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
So he's trying to get
information across another way.

00:20:12.254 --> 00:20:14.131 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
"The second part."

00:20:36.028 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR gasps]

00:20:37.446 --> 00:20:38.614 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
That's it!

00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
The second word from
each highlighted part.

00:20:42.618 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
They're connected.

00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:50.584 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I'm sure the
commission has deciphered

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.586 position:50% align:center
my encrypted code.

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:55.756 position:50% align:center
I just hope Endeavor
picks up on it.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:59.510 position:50% align:center
Maybe I shoulda figured out
something easier for him.

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:01.637 position:50% align:center
With the number of
heroes secretly joining

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.847 position:50% align:center
the liberation front,
the commission won't want

00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:07.601 position:50% align:center
anything I've discovered
to be made public.

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:09.645 position:50% align:center
Can't believe I made
"serious eyes" at him

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:11.980 position:50% align:center
to try to get him
to pay attention.

00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
Had no choice, though.

00:21:13.524 --> 00:21:16.485 position:50% align:center
Don't have too many ways
I can communicate right now.

00:21:22.074 --> 00:21:23.700 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
"The enemy..."

00:21:26.328 --> 00:21:29.248 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
"...is the liberation army.

00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
They number..."

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:36.380 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
"...over 100,000."

00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:41.343 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
"In four months..."

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:53.272 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] In four months,
we need to be prepared.

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:55.774 position:50% align:center
Because that's when they strike.

00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:31.370 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:34.248 position:50% align:center
As we continue our work studies
at Endeavor's Agency.

00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:36.500 position:50% align:center
Kacchan, Todoroki, and I
face the weaknesses

00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:39.127 position:50% align:center
each of us have to work on.

00:23:39.211 --> 00:23:41.255 position:50% align:center
I need learn to control
my power and to be able

00:23:41.338 --> 00:23:44.716 position:50% align:center
to perform at my best,
no matter the situation.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.804 position:50% align:center
It's okay to go slowly as
long as I'm moving forward.

00:23:48.887 --> 00:23:51.348 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"One Thing at a Time."

00:23:51.431 --> 00:23:53.058 position:50% align:center
This is a crucial step
in me becoming

00:23:53.141 --> 00:23:55.018 position:50% align:center
the greatest hero in the world!

00:23:55.102 --> 00:23:57.187 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
