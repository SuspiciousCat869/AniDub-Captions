My name is Izuku Midoriya.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.973 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's been almost ten months
since I enrolled

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center line:84%
at UA High School,
putting me on the path

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
to become pro hero.

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:23.606 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm staying super busy.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's winter right now,
and on top of

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.570 position:50% align:center line:84%
my regular classes, I'm
participating in a work study

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:31.406 position:50% align:center line:84%
four days a week at
the Endeavor agency.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
Run by the number-one hero.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
[POLICE laughing]

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
[IZUKU]
This is the story of a case

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
that fell into
our laps recently.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center line:84%
And a criminal who
ended up being both

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center line:84%
frightening and absurd.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:34.154 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DETECTIVE A] There have already
been more than 50 incidents.

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DETECTIVE A]
Endeavor, will you help us

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:39.325 position:50% align:center line:84%
bring this vandal to justice?

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.454 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're asking <i>me</i> to track down
a mere graffiti artist?

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:43.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm begging you.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR]
Denied! Send more officers.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center line:84%
This job is beneath me.

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:50.170 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please, sir. We've tried.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
The man known as "Mr. Smiley"
keeps eluding our forces.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center line:84%
His Quirk's too strong.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now you've got my interest.

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.762 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KIDO]
What kind of power does he have?

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everybody who looks at
Smiley's face loses their mind.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center line:84%
They convulse
in fits of laughter.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's your problem?

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's agony.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.399 position:50% align:center line:84%
Victims writhe on the ground
unable to stop cracking up.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:15.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's more, this lasts
for two full hours.

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.782 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whenever we try to arrest him,
he makes us laugh

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
and slips through our fingers.

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:25.080 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, very well.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center line:84%
I suppose we can keep
an eye out for this comedian

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
while we're out on patrol.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DETECTIVE A]
The city thanks you, sir!

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR]
I can't believe they're foisting

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center line:84%
such a trivial case on us.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KIDO] Yikes.
The graffiti's pretty bad.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ONIMA]
Yeah. Does this guy think

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center line:84%
he's Banksy or something?

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.393 position:50% align:center line:84%
He can force his opponents
to start laughing.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which means, he's a lot
like Ms. Joke.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perhaps the easiest option
would be to arrest him

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center line:84%
without looking him in the face.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why are you scumbags taking
this guy so seriously, huh?

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR]
I'm going home for a bit.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center line:84%
Patrols are on you.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:02.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BURNIN, KIDO, ONIMA]
Roger!

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMADA]
Zounds!

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center line:84%
They sent you after some
third-string gutter punk?

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now that's what I call
a disrespectful gig,

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mr. Number One.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're telling me.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
I should focus on the
Paranormal Liberation Front.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center line:84%
They're already turning
into a headache.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.900 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR gasps]
No. What is this?

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR]
He's mine!

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR growling]

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
[yelps] Endeavor, sir!

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR]
I want our entire agency

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center line:84%
after this scourge of
society named Mr. Smiley.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
Got it?

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
We got it, sir!

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
He's more passionate
all of a sudden.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TODOROKI]
Apparently, the man graffitied

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center line:84%
the side of his house.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
Talk about a short fuse.

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.520 position:50% align:center line:84%
Quiet, brats!

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SIDEKICK A]
This is Team B.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
We've found the perp
and are moving in.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR]
Let's go!

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:18.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR] He should be
around here somewhere.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SIDEKICKS laughing]

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.078 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait, you hear that?

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center line:84%
Calm down, man!

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.923 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR]
Split up and find him, now!

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Right!

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:56.064 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUSINESSMAN A laughing]

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, he's obviously
the suspect.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50% align:center line:84%
Stop right there!

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center line:84%

Mr. Smiley!

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.074 position:50% align:center line:84%

[ENDEAVOR]
Deku!

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ENDEAVOR]
It's him!

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I approach from
the back I should be--

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
[VOICE A]
Mr. Smiley!

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center line:84%
[laughs]

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:36.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KATSUKI]
You're done for, idiot.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center line:84%
Open wide.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center line:84%
Taste my AP Shot!

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
Like that?

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.779 position:50% align:center line:84%
[VOICE A]
Mr. Smiley!

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KATSUKI laughs]

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:05.133 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TODOROKI] It looks like his
Quirk has a limited range.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.676 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's good.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shoto here.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've caught the
villain in question.

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center line:84%
[VOICE A]
Mr. Smiley!

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TODOROKI muffled laughing]

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shoto! Which way did he go?

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:29.532 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BURNIN]
Escaped again.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MR. SMILEY]
My name is Mr. Smiley,

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
and I'm a wandering
artistic genius.

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.667 position:50% align:center line:84%
The art world is full of hacks

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.544 position:50% align:center line:84%
who refuse to acknowledge
my obvious talent.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:44.214 position:50% align:center line:84%
So in order for my work
to reach the world,

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center line:84%
I paint in secret day and night.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
An aloof virtuoso using
the city as his canvas.

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.847 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's over, Smiley!

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50% align:center line:84%
[VOICE A]
Mr. Smiley!

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MR. SMILEY]
There's no force on Earth

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center line:84%
that can keep me from
creating my masterpieces.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's right. Nothing.

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
He will suffer and
then be locked away.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.293 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm gonna kill that clown!

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:25.046 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't believe I disgraced
myself in public.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.049 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KIDO] I'm just glad
my face was covered up.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:32.554 position:50% align:center line:84%
He's certainly a formidable foe.
That power of his is incredible.

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes. Somehow it even worked
on me with a remote image.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
If he ever used that Quirk
on live television,

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
it would be a nightmare.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50% align:center line:84%
[IZUKU]
Yeah.

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, how are we supposed
to catch him?

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TODOROKI]
With stealth?

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
We could attack and trap him
from a distance with my ice

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50% align:center line:84%
or Endeavor's fire.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center line:84%
He paints in busy spaces,
where his art

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center line:84%
will be seen by the most people.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
It'd be best if
we can get in close

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
so we can minimize
collateral damage.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know!

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.543 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mei Hatsume from
the support course

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center line:84%
here to answer your request.

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center line:84%
[POWER LOADER] You said you want
to borrow some kinda robot?

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, sir, Mr. Power Loader,
that's right.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.218 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because of the
culprit's ability,

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:13.803 position:50% align:center line:84%
we can't face him head on.

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center line:84%
I figured as much,
so I came prepared!

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've been saving
this capture robot

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mr. Power Loader and I
built together!

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center line:84%

[ROBOT A] I look forward
to working with you.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
How's an oversized
toy gonna help?

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:35.992 position:50% align:center line:84%
[yelps] The hell?

This won't do.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center line:84%
Trying to stamp out a painter's
creativity once again?

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're rude and you lack taste.

Don't tell me what to do!

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.469 position:50% align:center line:84%
Damn ner--

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center line:84%

Kacchan. Forgive me.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why did you protect me?

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or, wait.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:57.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
Was it my painting you were
trying to save and not me?

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't really get your art,

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I do get that it's
super important to you.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
I bet it's something that
comes from deep inside you.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:10.215 position:50% align:center line:84%
Still, drawing on a building
owned by someone else

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center line:84%
is a clear violation of the law.
Even if it's a minor one.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
If your work means
so much to you, please,

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center line:84%
you should put it on display
in a proper venue.

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
Creating art that the world
isn't going to see feels futile.

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center line:84%
What would be the point of that?

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center line:84%
[IZUKU] Whatever happens,
chase your passion.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know how you're feeling.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was told I couldn't be a hero.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:39.744 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I didn't give up.

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks to the support of many
people, I'm on my way now.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please, Mr. Smiley.

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:51.631 position:50% align:center line:84%
Keep on chasing your dreams
and I'll help you how I can.

00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center line:84%
You wise child.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see it now.

00:18:56.845 --> 00:19:00.306 position:50% align:center line:84%
This whole time I thought I was
sticking it to the art critics.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
But maybe I was just
running away out of fear.

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's not too late to change.

Fighting's not really my style.

I won't give up on art.
