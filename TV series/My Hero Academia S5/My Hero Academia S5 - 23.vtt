burned myself.

in the midst of an awakening!

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
So fast!

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] He kept his
preparatory movements

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
to a minimum. Moving
with cat-like grace.

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.392 position:50% align:center
If he had this much physical
ability in the past,

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
he should have been able
to take down heroes at Camino.

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.314 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] They wouldn't
have stood much chance.

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:09.401 position:50% align:center
He's been training since then.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:10.819 position:50% align:center
And these movements...

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
They could only
have been mastered

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
through harsh conditioning.

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:16.658 position:50% align:center
Constant life-or-death training
over an extended period.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:21.621 position:50% align:center
I know because I've focused
on training my ability.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
I'm almost impressed.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
It was premature to
judge you as inferior.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.461 position:50% align:center
Seeing as how you
didn't disappear

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
after taking that damage.
You must not be a double.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
Eighty percent liberation!

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
No more games.

Come on now. Don't cry.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
You're going to
make me sad, too.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] My grandmother
and grandfather were kind.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:15.967 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Wait. No.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
I remember everything.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.641 position:50% align:center
I didn't need them
to be kind back then.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.894 position:50% align:center

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
Please, sir. You have
to be on your guard!

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.904 position:50% align:center
He's heading your way!

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center

Can you hear me?

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.182 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
I can't believe it.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
Burden extracts stress

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
and turns it into
something tangible.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
Then blasts it over a wide area.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
It's the apex of
the meta ability

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:17.570 position:50% align:center
I've been refining
since childhood.

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
It's not something
you can simply dodge.

[heartbeats]

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:30.208 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] He touched it!
In that instant!

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
He ignored his
survival instincts

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
for the sake of destruction!

My senses have been sharpened.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] The details are
rising to the surface.

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
Like everything
happened yesterday.

Only one. Put in
place by my father.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
No talking about heroes.

It's already time for dinner.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
And his allergies and the
scratching are getting worse.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
He knows what the rules are.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.159 position:50% align:center

his place in this society,

My father was a businessman

who accrued a fortune
at a young age.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
He built an impressive house

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
and invited his

No, dear. Stop scratching.

wanna be a hero?

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Mh-mm. Mikkun and Tomo

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.914 position:50% align:center
were both being
left out at school.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
So I told them we should
all play together

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center
and make up our own game.
And they said yes.

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
We played heroes. You know.
Saving people 'n stuff.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
And eventually...

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
Mikkun said,

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
"Ten, you should be All Might."

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
Because I was nice
and played with them

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
even though no one
else wanted to.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
Why does Dad get mad
at me all the time?

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
Does he hate me?

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
Will he like me more
when I have a Quirk?

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.943 position:50% align:center
Your father doesn't hate you.

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
He just knows...

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
...how hard it is to be a hero.

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:13.246 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] An adult's words
are absolute to a child.

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:20.045 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] That's why I wanted
to hear it from my family.

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:21.838 position:50% align:center
Just once.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
But the house my father built

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:28.762 position:50% align:center
masked rejection with kindness.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.140 position:50% align:center

I found a secret.

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:36.186 position:50% align:center

She's a hero!

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] Wow. But why
are you showing this to me?

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.862 position:50% align:center
Because Dad gets mad
when you play pretend.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
But I'm with you!

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center

Tenko! You went into my study?!

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
The humidity after the rain

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
caused my ragged skin to sting.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.158 position:50% align:center
What did you see?

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Yes. Kids are sneaky.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
[HANA] Tenko said that--that
he had a secret to show me,

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
I didn't know!

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] The itching
welled up from deep inside.

[KOTARO]
That's not your grandmother.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:54.848 position:50% align:center
She abandoned her family

leave suddenly, but your mom

has to go fight a really
bad man right now.

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:29.632 position:50% align:center
I'll be thinking of you,
though. The whole time!

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
I'd never forgive myself
if this bad man

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
did something mean to you.

That's why. We can't be
together anymore, Kotaro.

You might end up hating me.

I love you, my son.

and that you'll be happy.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
Always smiling.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
I'll be watching over you.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
Promise.

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
Even... if it's from above.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
It would've been better
if you'd never loved me.

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI'S MOTHER]
No more of this.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
I went too far. How are they?

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center
We're through with your rules.

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:22.519 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare raise
your hand to him.

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:25.271 position:50% align:center
Our family deserves to be happy.

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] It wasn't
supposed to be like this.

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:36.199 position:50% align:center
That's it. I can't
take this anymore, Mon.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:41.705 position:50% align:center
It's too much.
It hurts! I hate it.

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
Everyone. Everyone.
My whole family.

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.586 position:50% align:center
I hate them.

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
What just...

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
[HANA]
Tenko. I was looking for you.

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:07.564 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.941 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have blamed
you for that earlier.

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who
found the picture

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
and said it was a secret.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:17.157 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.616 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
Don't go!

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
I can't talk! So itchy!

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
Hana! You came
to apologize, right?

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center
Hey! Then protect me next time!

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
Help me!

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] When Mon crumbled, I
thought a villain was after us.

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
That it was an attack.

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
And when Hana fell apart...

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
It was the same.
I thought it was someone else.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI wretches]

00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI'S MOTHER gasps]

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Well, maybe not.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Thinking back,

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
I might've already understood
what was going on by that point.

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] Why did they make
excuses for my father?

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:19.928 position:50% align:center
Why did they tell me not
to cry instead of helping?

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
I can't take this anymore.

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] The resentment
piled up, little by little.

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
I hate everyone!

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI'S MOTHER]
Tenko.

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
[NANA] I hope your life
is full of laughter

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.845 position:50% align:center
and that you'll be happy.

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Dad. I... I didn't know.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:10.979 position:50% align:center
The itch. I'm so sorry, Daddy.

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.279 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO screaming]

00:21:19.362 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Father! Please!

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
Stop it, Tenko!

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] But I know,
when I touched my father...

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
...I intended to kill.

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Die!

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:40.967 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
An absurd sense of pleasure

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
shot through my entire body.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:48.641 position:50% align:center
Somewhere in my heart,
this was what I'd always wanted.

00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:50.477 position:50% align:center
It was my dream.

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
And just like that,
I didn't itch anymore.

00:23:29.534 --> 00:23:31.077 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:35.749 position:50% align:center
He had nothing left.
Not even a reason to live.

00:23:35.832 --> 00:23:37.876 position:50% align:center
Perhaps that's why the
hand that reached out to him

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:42.088 position:50% align:center
one fateful day changed
Tenko Shimura's life forever.

00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:46.843 position:50% align:center
That was the moment the
devil's successor was born.

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:49.971 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"Tomura Shigaraki: Origin."

00:23:50.055 --> 00:23:51.848 position:50% align:center
Unrestricted, unafraid.

00:23:51.931 --> 00:23:54.434 position:50% align:center
Let the urges
inside you surface.

00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:56.603 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
