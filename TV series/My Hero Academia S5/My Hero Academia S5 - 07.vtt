00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.096 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Look who we have here.

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center
Relaxed and full of
yourselves as always.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
Come on, Class A!

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
Let's see who's best
once and for all!

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.780 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Classes 1-A and 1-B
from the hero course at UA high

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:34.534 position:50% align:center
are battling it out against one
another in team combat training.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.661 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] For the first match,
Class A pulled off a win

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.872 position:50% align:center
with the help of Shinso,
a special participant

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
from general studies.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Then, in the second battle,

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.215 position:50% align:center
Yaoyorozu's situational analysis
shined, but it was Kendo's

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
advanced planning that ended up
being the key to success.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50% align:center
Class B's team managed
to take home the victory,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.891 position:50% align:center
meaning we're currently
tied with one win each.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:35.488 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI coughing]

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.616 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that, Tokoyami.
You want a cough drop?

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.243 position:50% align:center
I don't need your pity.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.454 position:50% align:center
Fair enough. At least
see Recovery Girl

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.997 position:50% align:center
and get some medicine
for your throat.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
[TRANSPOBOT 95A] Humans can't
get stronger without training?

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.130 position:50% align:center
What inefficient beings.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.798 position:50% align:center
[TRANSPOBOT 95B]
Why must we carry the injured?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.842 position:50% align:center
Rescue protocol needs reform.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.179 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] The grounds
were completely wrecked.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
It was so different
from the first match.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] This is what training
in the hero course is like.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:09.272 position:50% align:center
That said, they did
go a little overboard.

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
Fukidashi! Kendo!

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.734 position:50% align:center
Remember your surroundings.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
Damage should be kept
to a minimum.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
--[FUKIDASHI] Yes, sir!
--Sorry 'bout that!

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Right, so, when will
Komori's mushrooms disappear?

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.869 position:50% align:center
They'll be gone in two
hours, give or take.

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
Then it would be logical
to change locations.

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Maybe take a break as well.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
[laughing] That match was
an overwhelming victory

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
for the superior Class!

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:40.220 position:50% align:center
Just like at the
school festival,

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
Class B is certain
to come out on top.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
It couldn't be more obvious!

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
Aw, you poor losers,
no need to look so frustrated.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.270 position:50% align:center
It's not your fault.
We're just better.

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:50.772 position:50% align:center
Accept inferiority!

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
Apologies.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
He's a broken record
that needs to be set on fire.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
I don't know why
he talks like that

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
when he knows she's
gonna smack him.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.742 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50% align:center
Dang, your class has
some heavy hitters.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
You're blowin' my mind here.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
I'd say the same thing
goes for you guys.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Fukidashi, I didn't know

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
you could make something so big!

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.627 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI] My throat gets
scratchy when I do!

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
But I'm trying to learn
to power through it!

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.089 position:50% align:center
It's not just their Quirks.

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
You have to factor in
attitudes and mental strength,

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
which both contribute
to overall growth

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
and lead to better performances
on the battlefield!

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
You're sure writing a lot.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
You know, you've grown
a ton, too, Deku.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I hope so.

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] Nowhere near
as much as me, though.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I don't see it.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
I'm not talking about my height!

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
[whispering] I am here.
Without startling you.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
Oh, All Might!

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Young Midoriya,
a moment, please?

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU] Sure!
--[ASHIDO] That's cool. Bye!

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] Feels like
Midoriya's with All Might

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
every other second
these days, doesn't it?

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
It seems that way.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50% align:center
I heard he's been helping Deku
with practice outside of class.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
Ooh, shocker, shocker.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
Of course you've got
the deets on Midoriya.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center
Uh! No! I just
heard it, that's all,

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.051 position:50% align:center
from somebody else, probably.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
Ah! I'm so sorry!

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
Don't use your Quirk
before our match starts!

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
You're wasting your power!

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO laughs]
Nice!

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
Clock this breakdown!

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Young Midoriya,
have you sensed anything strange

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
in your Quirk since that night?

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.359 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] No. Nothing I've
noticed, at least.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Interesting. As I mentioned,

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
this is all new territory.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of a
spontaneous activation before.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:26.409 position:50% align:center
But I'm planning to ask Gran
Torino if he knows anything.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:29.371 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Great! That would
be super helpful.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center
[whispering] Be careful
in that fifth battle.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
Things could get weird.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
After all, the vestiges of One
For All did first appear to you

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
during a match
against Young Shinso.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll be on high alert.

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.095 position:50% align:center
--Again?
--[IZUKU] Yikes!

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
Kacchan, where did
you come from?

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
Uou two asked me to keep
your relationship a secret.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
But you're always sneaking
around like this.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.061 position:50% align:center
Are you stupid?

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT gulps]

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
Don't you gulp at me!

00:05:56.856 --> 00:06:00.527 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?
And don't lie.

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Well... Actually...

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.660 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
In your sleep?

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
Huh. You're so hopeless,

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
I can't tell if you're
improving or failing.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Honestly? I don't know, either.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] When are you
gonna master One For All?

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
Soon? I've gotten stronger since

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
the last time we fought,
so you'd better be keeping up.

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
I'm trying. I swear.

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Young Bakugo
is being considerate

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
in his own special way.

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
The hell're you smiling at?
I'm dead serious, ya idiot,

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.650 position:50% align:center
and that dumb look on
your face pisses me off!

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Or not.

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Young Midoriya
seeing vestiges of One For All.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
And he'll be fighting the person

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
who first triggered
their appearance.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.205 position:50% align:center
I feel like everything
is connected somehow.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Master.
What are you and the other

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
previous users of our Quirk
trying to tell us?

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
How's my patient doing?

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
With these minor injuries,
you'll be back to normal

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center
in half an hour.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:09.804 position:50% align:center
You should be thankful

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.432 position:50% align:center
that your young body
heals so quickly.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.018 position:50% align:center
And that skin! So supple.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.772 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] The third match
will take place in an area

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.608 position:50% align:center
two blocks east of where the
previous rounds were held.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.652 position:50% align:center
The cages have been moved
to your new bases.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
This little breather is over!

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.782 position:50% align:center
Prepare for the
third training battle!

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.246 position:50% align:center
It's finally Iida's
turn to fight.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] This group has
Todoroki's two wide-range

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
ice and fire attacks,
Iida's unmatched speed,

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.005 position:50% align:center
Shoji's superior scouting
capabilities, and Ojiro,

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
who excels at close combat.

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
Talk about a balanced team.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center
Lucky draws.

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] We've got Todoroki,
so it should be an easy win.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.224 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't count your grapes
before they're grown, boys.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
My grapes are huge!

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.812 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Todoroki.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what's up?

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.606 position:50% align:center
Your throat feeling any better?

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
Yes, I took the
prescribed medication.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.235 position:50% align:center
I will endure.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
Glad to hear.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.280 position:50% align:center
I performed shamefully
out there.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
Please avenge us.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50% align:center
Wait, why is it up to me?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
Our mentors, Hawks and Endeavor.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
We studied under
the heroes who fought

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.083 position:50% align:center
the last great battle
still in people's minds.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50% align:center
That makes it our duty to uphold
the honor of the top two heroes.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.549 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.969 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
"The last great battle." Sure.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
I'll go Plus Ultra.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
Prominence Burn!

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Shoto.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
You must learn this move
if you're to advance.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
Do not run from me.
Do not run from your nature!

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.286 position:50% align:center
Stand up!

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:59.247 position:50% align:center
Quit pretending to be weak!

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
Toya had the potential.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
He had even more
firepower than me.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
But he had your mother's
weak constitution.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
He was close. Until...

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.304 position:50% align:center
It's on you now, Shoto!

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
It has to be.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
You're the only one
who can do this move!

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
You can fulfill my ambition!

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.897 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Todoroki.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center
Todoroki?

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
You have quite a puzzled
look on your face.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
It's true. Are you
worried about something?

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:35.617 position:50% align:center
No, I'll be okay.
Thank you for asking.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
He's not exactly the
most expressive person,

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.330 position:50% align:center
so I didn't notice.
That's impressive, Tenya.

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
It's my responsibility.
I am class representative.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
I must aid any of
our troubled peers.

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
You seem really cheerful.
More than usual.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
Yes, I am!
My brother's recovery

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
has been going well lately.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Oh. That's great to hear!

00:09:54.844 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
You know, I think the
hero Ingenium is finished.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
At least for me.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] No! You still
have so many people

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.107 position:50% align:center
to help and inspire, brother.
This can't be true.

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50% align:center
[TENSEI]
That's why...

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
I want you to take the name.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
Will you do that? For me, Tenya.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.203 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] I also have the duty
to uphold my brother's honor

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
and live up to his name.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
I'm watching everyone
closely, but that means

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
everyone's watching me, too.

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
I was third place
at the sports festival!

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:33.383 position:50% align:center
I'll show everybody that
I'm a worthy successor!

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
A worthy successor? Huh.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU] People always
treat me like I'm some kinda

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
hardheaded moron without a clue,

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
but I got accepted into UA
just like you guys.

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
It's not like I rush into things
without thinkin' of the endgame.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
This unbalanced team
we're stuck with!

00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
We don't have any scouts.

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.411 position:50% align:center
That's gonna spell
big trouble for us.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
[KAIBARA]
You have a point.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
Then, what'll we do?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.206 position:50% align:center
Huh, guys?

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:06.541 position:50% align:center
We just talked about our pl--

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
I'll tell ya what.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
We'll have to level this place!

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
Terrible idea!

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
[KAIBARA]
Are you nuts?

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
Mr. Vlad said to keep
damage to a minimum.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU] Smashy, smashy,
smash, smash, smash!

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
Okay. Maybe I should start

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
shouting directly
in the kid's face.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:28.563 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
What's that?

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI] I hear the screeching
sounds of metal against metal.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:35.278 position:50% align:center
My guess? Tetsutetsu's loose.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.572 position:50% align:center
Level thise whole place!

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Class B, Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
Hero name: Real Steel.
Quirk: Steel.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] He can turn
his entire body into metal.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
That means he's both a deadly
sword and the perfect shield.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
Take this! And this!

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
No cheap tricks needed!
It's a fight to the death!

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
A brawl for the ages!

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
The other team's
got Todoroki on it!

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
Don't care!

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
I thought you said
you were thinking!

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
You're just being obstinate.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI] Well, we can work
with this, too, I suppose.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
And your thinking's
too flexible, Juzo!

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
Ah, jeez! You're gonna dog-gone
blow it for us, metalhead!

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
You hear, what you're
making Pony sound like?

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:14.526 position:50% align:center
Is this what you want?

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI] Tetsutetsu
doesn't mean any harm.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:19.739 position:50% align:center
In fact, his approach
even plays to our strengths.

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
Great, now you're the one
who sounds crazy.

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
[laughing] Bring it on,
ya villains!

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
The sound is getting louder.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.332 position:50% align:center
Based on the reverberations,

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
I believe he's destroying
their surroundings.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
He's a good brawler.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
They must intend
to fight us head-on.

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
I welcome the approach.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
It'll make it easier
for us to deal with them.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
Agreed.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
All right.

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
Time to make our class proud.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.100 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Team 3!

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
[KIDO] The villain is continuing
to flee down route five.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.039 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 95A laughs]

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:11.791 position:50% align:center
[KIDO]
Looks like we've been successful

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
at driving him
toward the harbor.

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 95A]
Not catchin' me.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 95A]
E-Endeavor?

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
You won't escape!

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 95A]
I'll take a hostage!

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Get outta here! Run!

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
[BOYS scream]

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.948 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 95A]
Damn you. Let go of me!

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:51.039 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 95A yels]
No, stop, please!

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
I'll go quietly!

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:56.711 position:50% align:center
[ONIMA]
Good work, Endeavor!

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:57.754 position:50% align:center
Clean arrest.

00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Collateral damage?

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:00.382 position:50% align:center
[KIDO]
Little to speak of.

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
[ONIMA] Yeah, not many
people at the harbor.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
It was a smart plan.

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:05.804 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.098 position:50% align:center
[BOY 95C]
Um. 'Scuse me.

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
What is it?

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:11.226 position:50% align:center
We just wanted to say thank you!

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
For saving us!

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.689 position:50% align:center
Any of you hurt at all?

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.607 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
No, sir!

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Best be off then.

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
[BOYS]
Bye!

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
Endeavor, sir?

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center
We've had another hero ask
about teaming up with you.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
You want me to make
the usual report?

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
Just compile a list
of active requests.

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
With Fuyumi's help.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
I finally, finally got
Shoto's contact info.

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:45.677 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Shoto, there's something

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
I want to tell you once more.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
So stop ignoring my messages!

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
I'm not the same person
who disregarded

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
what you wanted in life!

00:14:56.438 --> 00:15:01.151 position:50% align:center
Do not run from me.
Do not run from your nature!

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
Stand up!

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
Quit pretending to be weak!

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.199 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Now that you're
working toward becoming

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:11.578 position:50% align:center
your own hero, I want
to teach you that move,

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.288 position:50% align:center
like a good father.

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.748 position:50% align:center
To do that...

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
...you have to stop
ignoring my messages.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
Shoto!

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Shoto!

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
[ONIMA] His kid's probably
in class, right?

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
[KIDO] It feels like
all this "Shoto" shouting

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
is getting worse by the day.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
[sneezes]

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.057 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Are you okay?

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
I didn't think
you ever got sick!

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Yes. I'm sure I'm fine.

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
We're almost there.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.982 position:50% align:center
You know the plan,
let's all spread out.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.108 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
On it!

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
Make it count, Todoroki.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.032 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI]
Tetsutetsu!

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
The other team's
not gonna show up

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
just because you're
making a racket!

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center
They'll think it's a trap!

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:54.245 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
No.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
I'd head this way
if I were them.

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.375 position:50% align:center
Get Shoji to figure out
what's going on,

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
then have Todoroki unleash
a powerful attack.

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center
If I thought the other team

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
was standing around
out in the open...

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] That's our super
strong ice master!

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center
So cool!

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.060 position:50% align:center
And he made the ice
so it's not blocking

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
their line of sight.
He's gotten better!

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:22.232 position:50% align:center
Now we know where
Todoroki is. The others?

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.442 position:50% align:center
Can't see them!

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] Even if Honenuki
has used his Quirk

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
to soften the ground on us,

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
it won't matter if we
stick them in place.

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
With their movements inhibited,

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
we'll take them in one swoop.

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Reciproburst!

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
Come get some!

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
What?

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
Blasting ice is a cheap move.

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
Though if you'd been
coldhearted and used fire,

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.474 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't have been
able to trap you.

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Class B, Juzo Honenuki.

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
Hero name: Mudman.
Quirk: Softening.

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
He makes the things
he touches turn soft.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
They go back to normal
when he touches them again.

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:08.111 position:50% align:center
Doesn't work on living
things though.

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.112 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Juzo!

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center
Gotta love how flexible
that power is.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:13.742 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] This relaxed
rockstar took one of

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center
Class B's
recommendation spots!

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:19.831 position:50% align:center
He must have activated his Quirk
the moment the ice appeared.

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.416 position:50% align:center
A fast reaction.

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
I'll retreat for now
and wait for--

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI] Found you!
I softened a bunch of random

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
stuff around here, so it'd
be smart to watch your step.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.469 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Class B does an excellent job

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
of brushing off
Todoroki's area attack!

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
Now, to show their stuff!

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
[SERO] Honenuki guessed
that the ice was coming?

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.104 position:50% align:center
[SATO] That, or he
improvised crazy fast.

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
Is he really that good
at reading the situation?

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:48.276 position:50% align:center
I hope our classmates
haven't been thrown off.

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:51.613 position:50% align:center
Nice job, Juzo!
I'll handle Ojiro!

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO grunts]

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] I can't guard
against this for long!

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Class B, Sen Kaibara.

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:01.581 position:50% align:center
Hero name: Spiral.
Quirk: Gyrate.

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:05.085 position:50% align:center
He can make any part of his body
spin like a supercharged drill!

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Ojiro!

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
Caught again?

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.135 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
Your legs are only as strong

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
as what you're standing on.

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
The ground beneath
the ice is also softened.

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:20.558 position:50% align:center
You're difficult to deal with.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
So I'll leave you trapped
in the muck for now.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] Are you trying to keep
us from working as a team?

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
Villain! Your wickedness
knows no bounds!

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
He really gets into character.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.905 position:50% align:center
It's going to be hard for
them to get around now.

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
Class B's team doesn't have
anyone good at reconnaissance.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center
But as long as their opponents
are trapped in one place,

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
that's not a disadvantage.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
With his ice off the table,

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:44.624 position:50% align:center
Todoroki is operating
at half his power.

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
Correctomundo.

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
All that's left is
to overwhelm them.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
In this situation,

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:55.343 position:50% align:center
I can't use my Quirk
to the best of my abilities.

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
Should I go to the front?

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
Then there'd be no one
to guard Shoji as he scouts.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
What?

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI]
I was betting they'd keep Shoji

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
in what they thought
was a safe place

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
far from where we are! Like...

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
...hidden behind their
so-called "ace" Todoroki!

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:14.029 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Class B, Pony Tsunotori.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
Quirk: Horn Cannon.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
She can send her horns flyin'!

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
Currently, she can control
up to four of them

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
once they've shot off her head!

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
She's pretty particular
about keeping them polished.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI grunts] These are
stronger than I expected.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.460 position:50% align:center
Tetsutetsu!

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
Here we go.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
Horn Dash Hammer!

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
Are my teeth chattering?

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
You're so freaking cold,

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
my brain feels like
it's gettin' frosty.

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
If I weren't on top of things,
you'd freeze my steel solid!

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.685 position:50% align:center
Think you can beat me
in a hand-to-hand fight?

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
You don't stand a chance!

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
Man's been paying attention.

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
He's doing what Mr. Aizawa said
I shoulda done in my match.

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
Nah, I bet he's not
thinkin' all that much.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:20:00.784 position:50% align:center
Honenuki seems like the one
who's calling most of the shots.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
You keep on dodging!

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
Be good and stay there, okay?

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
You are evil incarnate!

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.379 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
Sorry 'bout it.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center
Recipro has a time limit, right?

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
Not so smart to use it
right at the beginning.

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm gonna go
help Tetsutetsu.

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
A time limit?

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
That was a while ago, Mudman.

00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
Ingenium will rush
anywhere at anytime.

00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:34.734 position:50% align:center
That's what these legs are for!
They won't be constrained!

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
You see?

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
I've been at full throttle
this entire time!

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
New Style. Recipro Turbo!

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
Seriously?

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
[TENSEI]
Congrats on getting your

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
provisional license, little bro.

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Thanks, Tensei.

00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
You're abusing your Engine
a bit much though, aren't you?

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.261 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mom.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
He's getting close
to that age, you know?

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
Don't you think it's time?

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
[TENYA'S MOM]
Well, he's matured,

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
but I still feel like it
might be too soon for that.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Tuning my Engine?

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.357 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Training is good,

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
but you can also pull
your mufflers out.

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
Do it right, and parts that
can take more of a beating

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.948 position:50% align:center
will grow back in their place.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center
It's a technique passed
down from our grandfather

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
so that the Iida family
can help more people

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
and do it faster
than anyone else.

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
This will be painful, though.

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
And it takes a lot
of dedication.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.798 position:50% align:center
But if you want to improve your
quirk, this is the way to do it.

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
I've raised Recipro's horsepower

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:48.641 position:50% align:center
and lowered fuel consumption
to the minimum!

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:50.226 position:50% align:center
Ten minutes!

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
For ten minutes,

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
nobody can stop me!

00:23:30.243 --> 00:23:32.203 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:32.245 --> 00:23:34.372 position:50% align:center
The Class A team is being
driven into a corner

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:36.541 position:50% align:center
by Honenuki's flexible response.

00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:39.127 position:50% align:center
The key to their recovery from
this dire situation is Iida's

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:43.465 position:50% align:center
new and improved Recipro Turbo,
and Todoroki's left side.

00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:45.216 position:50% align:center
Burn bright, Todoroki.

00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:47.093 position:50% align:center
You have to use that
power if you're serious

00:23:47.135 --> 00:23:50.347 position:50% align:center
about becoming the hero
I know you want to be!

00:23:50.388 --> 00:23:53.058 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"Match 3 Conclusion."

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:55.518 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be
one intense finale.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.687 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
