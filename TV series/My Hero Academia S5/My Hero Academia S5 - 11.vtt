[IZUKU]
What?

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.810 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

[ALL MIGHT]
Vlad! Aizawa!

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:31.281 position:50% align:center
You have to stop this match.
Something's wrong.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
Deku! Please, calm down!

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:44.044 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Shinso, quick!

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:48.548 position:50% align:center
Your power! Use it to help Deku!

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.393 position:50% align:center
Midoriya!

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.937 position:50% align:center
Stop playing around
and fight me!

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.294 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA grunts]

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:27.128 position:50% align:center
[KODAI]
Release.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.505 position:50% align:center
Now fire!

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.761 position:50% align:center
Nice timing, you guys!

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.763 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Are the two of you okay?

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:39.224 position:50% align:center
There they are!
Try and dodge this!

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:41.434 position:50% align:center
Midoriya! Uraraka! You okay?

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
The whole team's here now.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.397 position:50% align:center
It's a brawl!

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.778 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:55.198 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I refuse to accidentally
hurt anyone again!

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:59.953 position:50% align:center
We need a plan, but there's
too much to think about!

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
What do you think, Eraser?

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.763 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
All Might.

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
Let's wait. We'll
see what happens.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
What? But, Aizawa...

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.771 position:50% align:center
This is far from over.
The match continues.

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
You sure about that?
Midoriya's acting weird.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
We don't know what
that was earlier.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
If it happens again,
I'll stop the match at once.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
I can take him to a safe place.

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
Shinso was able to subdue him
with brainwashing before.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
And if this power
stems from his Quirk,

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
then I can always erase it.

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
Aizawa. Why do this?

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Because they're
still determined.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
Midoriya and Shinso.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
No. It's not just those two.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
Everyone is trying their
hardest to win this round.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Heh.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
Deep down, you're
a big softy, huh?

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA sighs]
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO grunts]

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
He was stronger than you?
That makes no sense!

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.873 position:50% align:center
I won't risk using my Quirk
if I can't control it.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
It's not ideal, but I can't
put everyone in danger again.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Then let's fall back.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.589 position:50% align:center
We can make a new plan!

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
We'll lose if we retreat now.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.844 position:50% align:center
Shinso's standing right
in front of me. Waiting.

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center
This is our chance to win!

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
But... Deku, does that mean

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
you're going to fight Quirkless?

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
Against someone with his power?

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Uraraka. I have a favor to ask.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Acid Shot!

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
[KODAI]
Big!

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.371 position:50% align:center
I can't be taken off the
field or we're done for!

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
Twin Impact... Fire!

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
[SHODA gasps]

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
Grape Buckler!

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Mineta!

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] I'm the only one my
Pop Off balls don't stick to.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
I bounce right off 'em!

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
It looks like I threw them
randomly to be traps

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
for the enemy, but they're also
personal trampolines for me!

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
This was part of the
plan from the start.

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
Not only did it give me
a way to block Twin Impact...

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
It lemme smash into these!

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.697 position:50% align:center
I don't think so!
Take this, creep!

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.907 position:50% align:center
Acid Layback!

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
Grape-Pinky Combo comin' atcha.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
Mineta Bounce!

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
You're the worst!

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
Stop dodging me!

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.211 position:50% align:center
[SHODA]
I wish we could withdraw,

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:21.047 position:50% align:center
but they're so fast that we
don't have time to strategize.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.924 position:50% align:center
They've practically
got us trapped here now.

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:24.092 position:50% align:center
[KODAI]
Yeah.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.261 position:50% align:center
Our classmates are
putting up a good fight!

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.596 position:50% align:center
If Ashido can get into
range, it's game over!

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.265 position:50% align:center
She's doing so awesome!

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
Our girls aren't great
at close combat,

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
so Shoda is having
to protect them himself.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
We outnumber them,
but that's backfiring on us.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
Didn't our teachers
run out there

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
to put a stop to this fight?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.403 position:50% align:center
And where are
Midoriya and Uraraka?

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] It's impossible
to get stronger on my own.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
I'm not meant
to be a protagonist.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
I copy other people's Quirks.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
Still.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
I don't feel bad or resent
the power I was born with.

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.719 position:50% align:center
Because in every
masterpiece ever created,

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:11.765 position:50% align:center
there are supporting characters
who outshine the leads!

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
Your power's mine.

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.729 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Don't tell me.

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
I've got you now!

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.858 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
He copied One For All?

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
An unprepared body
can't fully inherit it.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
Your arms and legs would
shoot off if you tried to.

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.532 position:50% align:center
Wait, Monoma. Don't do it!

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.034 position:50% align:center
Too late!

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Not so fast.

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
Gunhead Martial Arts!

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center
He doesn't have
your Quirk, Deku!

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
It's a bluff! Keep going!

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
It won't activate.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:45.382 position:50% align:center
Aw man, no fair.
I drew a blank?

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Monoma!

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
Release!

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
I've wanted to fight you again.
Ever since the festival.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
Come at me!

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
If I lose sight of him,

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
the entire flow of this battle
will change in an instant.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
Shinso. You're too
much of a threat!

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Eraser. Midoriya's attacking.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
I know. I'm watching.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO yelps]

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
It took you six years to learn

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50% align:center
how to use these binding cloths.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
Does someone like me
really stand a chance

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.465 position:50% align:center
at mastering them
like you did?

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
I practiced a long time,
but I was learning from scratch.

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:33.596 position:50% align:center
No one was there to
shepherd my progress.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
People like you and me
have to be resourceful.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center
When the time comes,

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
if we can't look
out for ourselves,

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
then we're as good as dead.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
Keep on practicing.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:44.858 position:50% align:center
And remember,

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
I'm not the type to waste
my time on hopeless cases.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] I'm different
from who I was back then.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
This is my fault.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.831 position:50% align:center
I should've been able to move
faster to capture them.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
I need to grow strong enough
to become a pro hero on my own.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
Midoriya!

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.599 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
It's not like earlier.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
Somehow, my worries
are totally gone.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
What's important is keeping
tabs on your heart.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] It's because that man's
presence and words reassured me.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
Something about him reminded
me a lot of All Might.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
[5TH WIELDER]
Control your heart...

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
[5TH WIELDER]
...and master using those

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50% align:center
who live in this power.

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I'm not afraid
of this power anymore.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
It's on my side.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
An ally that's rooting for me.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
If I can just
control my heart...

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.072 position:50% align:center
Young man.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
You, too, can become a hero.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] The faith All Might
had in me back then.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
The time we spent together
training at the beach.

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
I must remember
where I started.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
Seeing how far I've
come makes me feel...

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
...like I can do
just about anything.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
Don't go.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:44.102 position:50% align:center
He's behaving
differently than before.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:47.522 position:50% align:center
I'm betting he asked Young
Uraraka to use her Quirk.

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
That allowed him to focus
on this new power.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] What happened
in these last few minutes?

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
Something changed.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
The hell?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
I thought that was
too dangerous.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center
Was going on a rampage
earlier just for show?

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
Stop playing around
and trying to trick me!

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
It's gone.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
A new power.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
It disappeared?

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
And now I've got a pain inside
that's making me feel numb.

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:26.186 position:50% align:center
This Quirk has evolved.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
Blackwhip's got the might of
One For All swirling within it.

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
Which means it's much stronger
now than when it was mine.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] My body can't keep up
with the improved version

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
of his Quirk.

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
It's not a power that can
be used with a max output

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
of 20 percent yet.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
I can tell from how it feels.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
This ability is one I won't
be able to use for a while.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
It's something
I won't truly unlock

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.878 position:50% align:center
until I've fully
mastered One For All.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I can use Air Force, but
I'm still trying to perfect it.

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
I can't go too hard
with it, either.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
So I'll maintain One For All
at eight percent.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] I won't be able to
brainwash Midoriya at this rate.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
Gotta retreat. Sorry, Monoma!

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI] Don't you think
Midoriya's spooky?

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center
We stumble even a little,

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
and it'll end up
like the last match.

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
He'll destroy us.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
True. So we'll make
Midoriya our top priority.

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] Well, we won't
be able to do anything

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center
unless we stop him somehow.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
We're counting on you, Shinso.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
You went through the effort

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
to create an opening for me!

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
I can't let things
end like this!

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.350 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] Guess Poltergeist
won't get me outta this mess.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:48.727 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
It's almost been five minutes

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
since we started fighting.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.647 position:50% align:center
Monoma's Copy only
lasts that long.

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] I know you probably
think you're in the clear,

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
but I've extended my
Quirk to ten minutes.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
If I attack suddenly,
what will you do?

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
Man, aren't you a shrewd one.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
She's not talking in case

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:09.372 position:50% align:center
I have Shinso's
Brainwashing, too.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
Do you know how many
powers I can copy?

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.796 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] He definitely
has Yanagi's Poltergeist.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.799 position:50% align:center
As well as Kodai's Size.

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
Strategically, it'd make sense
for him to have Shinso's.

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Guessing three? Ha, ha!

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
You think that must be the case
because I've got three clocks.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
So what happens if I was just
pretending to have that many

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
and can actually hold four now?

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
There are a lot
of different kinds

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
of Quirks I could copy.

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:38.109 position:50% align:center
I can't activate more
than one at a time, true,

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:41.446 position:50% align:center
but their residual effects
are sometimes long lasting.

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
Things I use on
objects and not people

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.283 position:50% align:center
are especially handy
in that way.

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
Kodai's Size, for example.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
That effect sticks around.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
If I make something big,
it stays oversized

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:55.460 position:50% align:center
even if I switch over
to a different Quirk. [laughs]

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:56.961 position:50% align:center
Do you see yet?

00:13:57.045 --> 00:14:00.215 position:50% align:center
Do you understand that when
I say "Fire" it's all over?

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
This supporting character
has an ace up his sleeve.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Did Monoma do something to Deku?

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
When?

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:14.979 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
But...

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Uraraka. I have a favor to ask.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.568 position:50% align:center
I need for you to
make me weightless,

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
then I can sneak up
and surprise Shinso.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
I trust you can handle
Monoma on your own.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
After that, go help
Ashido and Mineta.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.703 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me!

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.379 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] If I face him
head-on, I can't win.

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
So, I'll have to make
it my kind of fight!

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.262 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO gasps]

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
He's too fast! I'm done for.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
Time to fire.

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunts]

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.439 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Twin Impact.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
After I hit a target,
it lets me cause a second,

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
stronger impact remotely.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.572 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Sorry, Shinso.

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
I didn't plan on getting caught.
I hope I gave you an advantage.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Monoma?

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
He must've used Shoda's Quirk
to replay his earlier attack!

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO grunts]

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:20.879 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
And this is why they
call me a mobile "god-bod"!

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Nice work.

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
If we catch one,
the rest will be goners!

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO grunting]

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.637 position:50% align:center
Ashido! Melt them!

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha, there ya go!

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
Shoda! Yanagi!
Let's carve 'em up!

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.106 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I can't forget.

00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I have to remember.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:47.697 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO yells]

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
How far I've come!

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
Reiko!

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:59.000 position:50% align:center
[KODAI]

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
Yanagi! Kodai!

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.963 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Don't worry about me!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I'll be fine. I will win!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
No. I waited so long for this.

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] To show you how much
I've grown since last time.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
But you're classes are moving
forward without stopping,

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:37.205 position:50% align:center
racing further and further
ahead while I crawl along.

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
"Go beyond," right?

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
"Plus Ultra." Damn it.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
The hero course is amazing.

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:59.269 position:50% align:center
[MIDNIGHT] Things looked awfully
dangerous for a second there,

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
but the fifth match
has now concluded.

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
This marks the end
of today's training.

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
You've learned about your
enemies and yourselves.

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
You fought bravely,
and showed your pro potential.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
Now, without further
ado, the results!

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:16.161 position:50% align:center
Match one: A.

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
Match two: B.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.415 position:50% align:center
Match three: draw.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
Match four: A.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
Match five: A.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:28.423 position:50% align:center
The winners of the
hero-course battle

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
are Class 1-A!

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.469 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
I wasn't feeling
super competitive,

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
but this loss definitely stings.

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
I know. Talk about
a frustrating end.

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
I witnessed such
sinful deceptions!

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Mr. Aizawa.

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:50.362 position:50% align:center
I couldn't stand
against him on my own.

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
I'm still not strong enough.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
This test also decided

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
if I was ready
to transfer, right?

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.788 position:50% align:center
How'd you know?
Did you tell him?

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] No. I figured
it out on my own,

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
thinking about the
timing and format.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
It seemed like
a prime opportunity

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
to evaluate my progress.

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:13.385 position:50% align:center
Plus, I was the only one
who fought twice.

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
This isn't finished until
we've gone over your critiques.

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
Rejoin your team.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
It's time for the rundown.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Uh, let's just
start with Midoriya.

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
What was going on with you?

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Well...

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
A sinister darkness
manifested in you.

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
You were raging out there.
Was that your Quirk?

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
It may be a new move,

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
but it was different from
your normal super strength.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to figure out
what it was myself.

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
I was overflowing with power
and couldn't hold it back.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
It was like something
I'd trusted up until now

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
suddenly bared its fangs at me.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.387 position:50% align:center
I was terrified.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
I didn't know what was going on.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.142 position:50% align:center
But thanks to Uraraka
and Shinso stopping me,

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
I was able to get
a handle on things.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
And I realized that
whatever this is,

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:08.398 position:50% align:center
it isn't something
I should fear.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
If Shinso hadn't made me calm
down with his Brainwashing,

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
I don't know how
things would've gone.

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
Shinso asked if my lack
of control was a trick,

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
but I really had no idea
what was happening.

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
So thanks to both of you!

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] I was just trying
to get him to talk

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:29.878 position:50% align:center
so I could use Brainwashing.
Was he that scared?

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
He obviously wasn't
acting out there.

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
[MIDNIGHT]
What a thrill!

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
When Midoriya went out of
control, Shinso did great,

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
but Uraraka's swift response
has me overflowing with pride!

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.723 position:50% align:center
Putting your body on the line

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
to help a friend
is true devotion!

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
Yes! So much passion!

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50% align:center
I can't stand it!

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO] Uraraka, you
jumped to him right away

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
and saved the day!
You never even hesitated.

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
Bet ya hugged him
real hard, didn't ya?

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.868 position:50% align:center
True, I didn't think
twice about butting in.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
Maybe that means I need
to be calmer when fighting?

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
Although, it's
probably much better

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:10.710 position:50% align:center
than not doing anything and
regretting it later, right?

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
I want to...

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
...to save people.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.638 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] You've grown up
quite a bit, Uraraka.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Hm?

00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] I didn't act out there
solely for Midoriya's sake.

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
I just did what Uraraka
told me to do.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:32.899 position:50% align:center
And anyway...

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:34.776 position:50% align:center
I saw Monoma and the
others being attacked

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
by the dark energy.

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
I knew our team
was going to lose

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:40.532 position:50% align:center
unless somebody
responded quickly.

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
You see, I stopped
him selfishly.

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
I wanted to fight
Midoriya and win.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
Everything else was
just coincidence.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
If I'm being honest,

00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
it was all I could do to
take care of myself and--

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:56.756 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] No one asked any more
than that from you, Shinso.

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:02.345 position:50% align:center
Everyone here has
been training for months

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:06.349 position:50% align:center
to become heroes who can
save the people of this world.

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
No one can master being
a hero right away.

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
Except maybe All Might,
but he doesn't count.

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
Before becoming a pro hero,

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
you have to make sure you're
taking care of yourself.

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you'll fail.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.905 position:50% align:center
If you don't have the
power to stand your ground

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
on your own, then you
can't protect anyone else.

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.327 position:50% align:center
With that in mind,

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
what you showed us was enough
to earn a passing grade.

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.209 position:50% align:center
That's great. But I've
still got a ways to go.

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:36.588 position:50% align:center
After fighting everyone
today, I understand.

00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
I experienced first-hand
how amazing

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:40.008 position:50% align:center
the hero course is.

00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:43.887 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to be satisfied
by merely passing.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
I need to work harder
and aim higher.

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:48.892 position:50% align:center
And live up to my potential.

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
That's fine.

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Go at it with
a "Plus Ultra" mentality.

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:56.066 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Yes, sir!

00:23:30.243 --> 00:23:32.328 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:32.412 --> 00:23:35.415 position:50% align:center
A new power has awakened
inside of One For All.

00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:38.668 position:50% align:center
An ability that belonged
to a previous wielder.

00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:40.754 position:50% align:center
He said that six more
Quirks would manifest

00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:43.631 position:50% align:center
inside of me as I continue
to hone my abilities.

00:23:43.715 --> 00:23:45.925 position:50% align:center
But, I don't get it,
doesn't that make me

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:48.386 position:50% align:center
sound like All For One?

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.387 position:50% align:center
Next time:

00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:51.598 position:50% align:center
"The New Power
and All For One."

00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:55.268 position:50% align:center
I'll control my heart and
master using this Quirk!

00:23:55.352 --> 00:23:57.479 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
