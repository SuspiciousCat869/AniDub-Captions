[KAMINARI] Jeez, Endeavor
was amazing yesterday,

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50% align:center
don't ya think?

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:25.191 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Gotta admit,
I was scared stiff

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.444 position:50% align:center
when that Nomu knocked
'im down, though.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
[HIGH-END] Aren't there any
stronger heroes around?

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center

Too slow.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center
So you regenerate, too, hero.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.726 position:50% align:center
You are the same as me.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.436 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
I'm nothing like you.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.689 position:50% align:center
I can barely even move
my body at this point.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.862 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] I'm just
propelling myself forward

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.239 position:50% align:center
with the heat of my Quirk!

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:20.830 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
My feathers can't do much

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.083 position:50% align:center
against this thing's
destructive power.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
But I can match it in speed.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:33.259 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I sent a few of my
feathers your way earlier.

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:37.764 position:50% align:center

Let me help you.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:41.810 position:50% align:center
I can add my speed
to your firepower!

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.813 position:50% align:center
With that, you'll
have one final push.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.439 position:50% align:center
This is it!

00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:00.161 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Villain, I see it.

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center
You are me from the past.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.002 position:50% align:center
Or another future.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.047 position:50% align:center

Talk about guts.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
And the way he stood
proud when he won?

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.216 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA whimpers]
It was so manly!

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.218 position:50% align:center
That's why he's the
number one hero now.

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.220 position:50% align:center
Don't forget, Hawks was amazing!

Not to mention dreamy.

[SERO] There's a reason
people say he's too fast

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
for his own good.

Hey, Todoroki.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.438 position:50% align:center
Is Endeavor doing okay?

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.608 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sounds like his
condition isn't serious.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.610 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. So glad!

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
Guess you can be pretty
proud of your pops, huh?

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.451 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's true.

[AIZAWA]
Okay...

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
It's time to stop playing around
and be more serious.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
Things gets harder from here.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
Even though you only
have provisional licenses,

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
you've been given the
certification to act as heroes

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
in an official capacity.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
Or at least, most of you have.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
Two of you remain in
supplemental courses.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.109 position:50% align:center
Tch.

all of our objectives.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.409 position:50% align:center
Yes. It would seem.

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
Fight me!

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:24.539 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] You went easy
on me earlier, didn't you?

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
No. I was terrified
of your face--

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Don't you underestimate me!

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:32.005 position:50% align:center
Besides, I don't care
if you were acting.

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
Or that you're an upperclassman.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.634 position:50% align:center
Villains have to
be taught a lesson.

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:40.805 position:50% align:center
You're done for. Loser!

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
I should've gone home.

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Die!

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
Escort Bakugo to the
faculty lounge.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
[TRANSPO-BOT 89A]
Roger that, sir.

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
In the Hero course at UA High,

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
we take our training
very seriously.

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:09.959 position:50% align:center
So that, one day,

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center
we'll be the greatest heroes!

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:10.121 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:22:13.124 --> 00:22:16.836 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] You do know that's the
victory pose All Might used.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.340 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
No. Mine's different.

00:22:20.423 --> 00:22:22.842 position:50% align:center
He used his left arm. Fool.

00:22:22.926 --> 00:22:24.886 position:50% align:center
Yeah? I didn't realize that.

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:27.013 position:50% align:center
Anyway!

00:22:27.097 --> 00:22:30.725 position:50% align:center
Nice job up there.
You took care of things.

00:22:30.809 --> 00:22:33.520 position:50% align:center
[panting] Is that a joke?

00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:37.399 position:50% align:center
He almost beat me
before I got started.

00:22:37.482 --> 00:22:38.900 position:50% align:center
It was rough.

00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:41.611 position:50% align:center
Still, you did pull off a win.

00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:44.239 position:50% align:center
Nobody will forget that.

00:22:44.322 --> 00:22:46.741 position:50% align:center
[DABI]
Isn't this precious.

00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:51.371 position:50% align:center
[DABI] I wasn't sure what
to expect from that fight.

00:22:56.751 --> 00:22:59.421 position:50% align:center
[DABI]
Let me introduce myself.

00:22:59.504 --> 00:23:01.715 position:50% align:center
This is our first meeting?

00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:03.466 position:50% align:center
Right, Endeavor?

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:20.233 position:50% align:center
[DABI] Hey. You're late
for our meeting.

00:23:30.535 --> 00:23:32.620 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:32.704 --> 00:23:35.081 position:50% align:center
Endeavor, the number-one
hero barely scraped by

00:23:35.165 --> 00:23:38.335 position:50% align:center
in his brawl against the
mysterious engineered Nomu.

00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:40.211 position:50% align:center
And while he was fighting,
the League of Villains

00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:42.505 position:50% align:center
and Hawks were operating
in the shadows.

00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:44.799 position:50% align:center
To what end?

00:23:44.883 --> 00:23:46.551 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, something, uh,

00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:50.513 position:50% align:center
kind of strange is starting
to happen to my body.

00:23:50.597 --> 00:23:52.682 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Vestiges."

00:23:52.766 --> 00:23:53.975 position:50% align:center
I get a glimpse at the secret

00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:56.603 position:50% align:center
connecting One For All
and All For One.

00:23:56.686 --> 00:23:58.313 position:50% align:center
But what does that mean for me?
