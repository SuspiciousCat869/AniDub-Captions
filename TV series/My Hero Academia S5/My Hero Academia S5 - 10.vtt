00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.390 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] At UA High School,
hero Classes 1-A and 1-B

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:18.018 position:50% align:center
are competing against each
other in combat training.

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.025 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] My class managed
to pull off an overwhelming win

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
in the fourth round
thanks to clever teamwork

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center
that focused on
Kacchan's raw power.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.995 position:50% align:center
It's now time for the fifth
and final training match!

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
This one's for all the glory.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
Do your best until the
last student's down!

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
Begin!

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.437 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.147 position:50% align:center
[WARDEN 98A]
It's number 1541.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50% align:center
He's fidgeting.

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.316 position:50% align:center
[WARDEN 98B]
That started yesterday.

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:32.694 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF WARDEN] I wish they'd
hurry up and sentence him.

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:34.279 position:50% align:center
We can't keep
this up much longer.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.740 position:50% align:center
He's exhausting our resources.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.491 position:50% align:center
[WARDEN 98B]
You know that Chaplin quote.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
"One murder makes you a villain.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:41.161 position:50% align:center
Millions, a hero."

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:43.329 position:50% align:center
[WARDEN 98A] Wasn't he
the bad guy in that movie?

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.790 position:50% align:center
[WARDEN 98B] We've seen how
people can flock to evil.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.043 position:50% align:center
Take Gigantomachia.

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
He's our prisoner's
direct subordinate, right?

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.214 position:50% align:center
It's not just Shigaraki
and the League of Villains

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.133 position:50% align:center
who serve All For One.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50% align:center
We don't know
how many sympathizers

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.553 position:50% align:center
he may have hiding in the world.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.388 position:50% align:center
So, right now,
we need to make sure

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.100 position:50% align:center
we don't accidentally
provoke any of them.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE] I do apologize
for any undue trouble.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.438 position:50% align:center
[WARDENS gasp]

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE]
It's just that the memories

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
are causing my body
to throb with pain.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
I can hear my little
brother's voice.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
A phone call is here!

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center
--A phone call is here!
--[ALL MIGHT] Oh, excuse me.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
When're you getting rid
of that ringtone? Jeez.

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Sorry. I'll be right back.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.388 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] I appreciate
you returning my call

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
so quickly, sir.
However, I'm in the middle

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
of a class right now.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:48.019 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO] So, about that
dream Izuku Midoriya had--

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
Oh. I guess we're just
gonna talk about that.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
You asked me about the visages
of One For All earlier.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
If Shimura had ever mentioned
anything about them.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
I did remember something
that might end up being useful.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
Don't hold your breath, though.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50% align:center
This old man's memory
isn't what it used to be.

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.248 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure this
happened shortly after

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
your master first
inherited the power.

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Hey, listen to this.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
I had the weirdest
dream last night.

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
Really?

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Yeah.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
A shadowy figure stood
in front of me.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
He stared me straight in
the eyes before saying this:

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.893 position:50% align:center
"The time has not yet come."

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.106 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO] Far as I can
think, that's the only time

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
she ever mentioned it.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Thank you for telling me, sir.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.281 position:50% align:center
I should get back
to my students now.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.247 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
"The time has not yet come."

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.959 position:50% align:center
Which implies it will
come eventually.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
Something that affects
One For All

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.755 position:50% align:center
and its wielder.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Class B has
Shinso on their side.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
Once he's in play, my team
won't be able to talk much.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm still
feeling kind of uneasy

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
about One For All acting up.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
Whatever happens,
I need to make sure

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
I don't end up Brainwashed!

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:14.939 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Ever since I was a kid,

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
I've heard the same
thing on repeat.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
"There's no way you
can be a superhero

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
with a Quirk like that."

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:27.702 position:50% align:center
The two of us are both very
aware of our weaknesses.

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, we have to embrace
our darker sides to survive.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center
I really like you, Shinso.
Honestly. We're so similar.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
--[SHINSO] Disagree.
--[MONOMA laughs]

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.591 position:50% align:center
You can say that, but it's true.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
When you brainwashed Midoriya
at the sports festival,

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
how did you get him
to talk to you?

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] I didn't know
what would provoke him,

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
so I insulted his classmate.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
In order for us to
become heroes one day,

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
we must sometimes act
in less-than-heroic ways.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
If we don't, we can't stand
alongside those with more power.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.698 position:50% align:center
It's not enough to try
to copy our idols.

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:07.158 position:50% align:center
Don't you feel that way?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
Like you had all of these
grand hopes and dreams

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
when you were a kid.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
But now those goals
are just burdens.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
It's almost as if
the two of us are cursed.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] When you consider
Midoriya's team,

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.468 position:50% align:center
the distribution of
power is comparable

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.594 position:50% align:center
to that of the last round.

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
Yeah, our team did
have a similar spread.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
But they don't have a Jiro.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
Yup! They're missing
a solid scouter.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.561 position:50% align:center
Which means they'll have
to move way more carefully

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
than we did, or they could
get trapped from the get go.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
If they wanna pinpoint
enemy locations and then

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
lure them out like we did,
then Midoriya is gonna have to

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.821 position:50% align:center
work harder than Bakugo had to.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:49.492 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] First, I'll get out
in the open so they target me.

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
Since I'm the fastest
one on our team,

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.080 position:50% align:center
our opponents will want
to focus on taking me out.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I'll get Class B to attack me.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
Then once we figure out
where they are,

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center
we'll work together
to capture them!

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
Here goes!

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yanagi's Poltergeist.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:11.973 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO screams]

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]
Monoma!

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Did ya find me? What a shocker.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
After seeing the insufferable
win Bakugo pulled off,

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
we obviously have our sights
set on you this round.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.073 position:50% align:center
Anyone with an ounce
of cleverness would want

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
to be careful of someone
who's not only strong,

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
but incredibly agile.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
But isn't that too obvious?

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
Someone even wiser might
choose a different route.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
After all, Bakugo was
only successful because

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.922 position:50% align:center
he was backed up by his
other three teammates.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
So why not crush your
other three first?

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
Thanks for bein' so flashy
and tellin' us where you were.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
Sounds like my teammates have
found the rest of Class A's

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.642 position:50% align:center
hopeless combatants already.

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.977 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] He's egging me on,
trying to get me to talk.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
It's possible he copied
Shinso's Brianwashing.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
It's three against four.

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
Will your friends
hold their own?

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
Shinso's lurking around,

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
so they won't be able
to communicate freely.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:10.407 position:50% align:center
I'd hurry and go
to them if I were you.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
They likely need help.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.493 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold on.

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:14.786 position:50% align:center
What if the scream just now

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
was Shinso's voice
modulator at work?

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.249 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
you'd be leading us straight

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
to the rest of your classmates
who aren't actually in trouble.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
Ha! What a predicament!

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
Talk about being heartless;
you didn't even

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
glance in the direction
of your friends in need.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] It's not a bad trick,
but I'm not gonna fall for it!

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
My. What's this?

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Class B, Neito Monoma.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
Hero name: Phantom Thief.
Quirk: Copy.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
Whenever he touches someone,

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.318 position:50% align:center
he can use their Quirk
for five minutes.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.654 position:50% align:center
He can't use two at
the same time, however!

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That's Yanagi's power!

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50% align:center
Release.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
That scream earlier.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
It wasn't either of us.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
Musta been Shinso then.
And it sounded close by.

Funny to think of grumpy boy

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
screaming in a girl's voice.

look at us when you talk.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
Hey, I caught something!

[ASHIDO]
Acid Veil!

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
[SHODA]
Lost some.

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
Was it a hit or are they
luring us into a trap?

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center

This must be Yanagi at work!

Class B, Reiko Yanagi.

Hero name: Emily.
Quirk: Poltergeist.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
She can manipulate
objects around her,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.460 position:50% align:center
but the total weight
can't be more than

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
roughly that of an
average person! Spooky!

[PRESENT MIC]
Class B, Yui Kodai.

Hero name: Rule.
Quirk: Size.

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
She can change the size
of the stuff she touches.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
It doesn't work on
living things, though!

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
Now release.

[PRESENT MIC]
After he hits a target,

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:38.430 position:50% align:center
he can cause a second
impact remotely!

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.890 position:50% align:center
This follow-up strike is
many times more powerful

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:42.434 position:50% align:center
than the first one!

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
[SHODA] Let's hide ourselves and
prepare for another assault.

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center
We've got this.

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center

That was scary.

[MINETA]
Guys! I thought the enemy

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:53.862 position:50% align:center
was supposed to be chasing
after Midoriya, not us!

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] They might've
figured out our location

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:58.616 position:50% align:center
with that attack.
So where's Deku?

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
I had a lengthy conversation
with Shinso earlier.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:07.542 position:50% align:center
About how those blessed
with power destroy society.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
You're frienemies
with Bakugo, right?

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
Then maybe you can explain.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
How can he smile like he doesn't
have a thing to worry about

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
when let himself get abducted?

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
And because he wasn't able
to take care of himself,

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
the Symbol of Peace is gone.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU growls]

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:42.327 position:50% align:center
[NANA] He stared me straight in
the eyes before saying this:

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.871 position:50% align:center
"The time has not yet come."

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center

Is this the moment he foretold?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center

What?

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:55.674 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunting]

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
Seriously, a brand-new power?

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.303 position:50% align:center
So not fair.

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I don't understand.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
What's going on?
I was fine until just now!

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
Run!

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
Shinso, you're up!

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Get out of here.

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
It's too much! I can't
hold back this power!

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center

exploding outta me!

Why?

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.710 position:50% align:center
When did Midoriya
score another new move?

[ALL MIGHT]
Vlad! Aizawa!

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
You have to stop this match.
Something's wrong.

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
What is this?

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:28.433 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] After All Might
transferred One For All to me,

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
I kept getting hurt because
I didn't know how to use it.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
Stop it! No more!

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
But with training,

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:39.069 position:50% align:center
I was finally getting
it under control!

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
I was just getting started!

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:46.493 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
One For All! Get it together!

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:50.538 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna make anyone else
worry about me ever again!

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center
Deku! Please, calm down!

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:11.476 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
When I was growing up,

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:14.354 position:50% align:center
my mom and dad
always looked tired.

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
It hurt me to see them
so wiped out.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:21.903 position:50% align:center
That's why, the first time
I saw a hero on the street...

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:25.407 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.826 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] ...I was more excited
about the way bystanders

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
and my parents reacted
than anything else.

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:37.794 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] I just loved to see
how happy everybody looked!

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] That's why I wanted
to start helping people

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
who were in trouble.

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
But a simple dream

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
can be hard to achieve.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] I've watched
Deku fight desperately

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center
to help those in need.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.901 position:50% align:center
And it's made me wonder...

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
You've gotta calm down!

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Who protects the heroes

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
whenever they're the ones
who are hurting the most?

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
Run. Can't stop it.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.045 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
His Quirk's out of control.

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Shinso, quick!

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
Your power! Use it to help Deku!

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] Brainwash Midoriya?
What should I say?

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] I lost to you
at the sports festival.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
But I got another chance.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
I was excited to show you
how much I've improved.

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:57.540 position:50% align:center
Fighting you again was
something I looked forward to.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
I want to become
an upstanding hero

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50% align:center
and use my Quirk to help others.

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
Midoriya!

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
Stop playing around
and fight me!

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:20.188 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Again?

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
[5TH WIELDER]
Crap, kid.

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:47.924 position:50% align:center
[5TH WIELDER]
You got it wrong. Dang it!

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center
Didn't we tell you?

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.678 position:50% align:center
You're not alone
out there. Ya got that?

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.889 position:50% align:center
It's manifesting.
Now's the time!

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.017 position:50% align:center
So shape up.

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
You gotta start thinkin' more.

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
From now on, you can't
use your power casually.

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
It's somethin' bigger.

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] He's one of the past
users of One For All?

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.279 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have
to work harder!

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
Do your best!

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
If you train like a madman, most
things should work out fine.

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
Whoa, where's your mouth,
kid? That's freaky!

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center
Whatever, don't sweat it.

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I can see him so clearly.

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:24.711 position:50% align:center
He's not a vestige or shadow
or some kind of ghost.

00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:26.755 position:50% align:center
This isn't a dream, either.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
This man...

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
These predecessors...

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] ...are somehow living
inside of One For All!

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.893 position:50% align:center
Feels like my
time's runnin' out.

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
That was fast.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
One more thing, kid.

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:45.899 position:50% align:center
The power you just shot outta ya
was originally my Quirk.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should explain a bit.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.404 position:50% align:center
Our individual Quirk
factors mixed in

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
with the core of One For All.

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
They've been inside
a' you this whole time.

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
Now, imagine this core
rests in the middle

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
of raging flames or a whirlpool
of waves or somethin'.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
Those flames and waves
are the cultivated power

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center
we users added to the original.

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
But now, after so many years,

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
the core is starting
to expand and move.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
What you saw
between fluctuations...

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.181 position:50% align:center
The reason for that
is because One For All

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
itself is growing inside you.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.729 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Why? What's going to happen?

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
[5TH WIELDER]
Think back.

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:29.234 position:50% align:center
Earlier, you were dead set
on capturing that guy.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
It's all you could think about.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
Ya know you could
nod or somethin', kid.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Right. I was
trying to catch Monoma.

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
It just so happens
the best Quirk for that

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
is Blackwhip. Which
belonged to me.

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
So lucky you, you get
to meet yours truly first.

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
Not to brag, my power's great.

00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
But be careful.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
This Quirk has evolved.

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:55.927 position:50% align:center
Blackwhip's got the might of
One For All swirling within it.

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
Which means it's much stronger
now than when it was mine.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. I'm gonna disappear.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:05.895 position:50% align:center
I feel myself drifting away.

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
Because all that's left
of me is my spirit.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
Listen well.

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
If you use One For All in anger,

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
the power will react
to that feeling.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
What's important is keeping
tabs on your heart.

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50% align:center
It's fine to get mad.

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
Rage can be the source
of incredible strength.

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:26.249 position:50% align:center
But you need control.

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
And not just over your body,
but over your emotions as well.

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
After being passed down
through eight people,

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
One For All has become
an awesome force.

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:38.470 position:50% align:center
Prepare yourself.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
You'll have six more Quirks
manifest as you improve.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
Control your heart
and master using those

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
who live in this power.

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
Good luck! We're with ya, kid!

00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
You're the one who will
complete One For All!

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Deku! Hello?

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Wake up!

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Did the slap hurt?

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
Uraraka.

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Get away!

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
It's too dangerous!

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Don't worry!

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.380 position:50% align:center
Shinso's Brainwashing
took care of you.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
He... did?

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]
Oh, my gosh!

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
You're hurt.

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Don't tell me...

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
It's my fault, huh?

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:29.604 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA grunts]

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Gunhead Martial Arts!

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
This battle isn't over, Class A!

00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU, OCHACO gasp]
--[KODAI] Release.

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
Now fire!

00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:46.871 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA laughs]

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
The dark stuff
that came out of him

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:51.001 position:50% align:center
went crazy and
ruined our strategy!

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
Nice timing, you guys!

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Are the two of you okay?

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center
What was that just now?

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
There they are!
Try and dodge this!

00:20:58.717 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO yells]

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
Midoriya! Uraraka! You okay?

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.806 position:50% align:center
The whole team's here now.

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
It's a brawl!

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
[5TH WIELDER] If you use
One For All in anger,

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
the power will react
to that feeling.

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
What's important is keeping
tabs on your heart.

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I refuse to accidentally
hurt anyone again!

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO gasps]

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.749 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
We need a plan,

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
but there's too much
to think about.

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
What do you think, Eraser?

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT pants]

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
All Might.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
Let's wait. We'll
see what happens.

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
What? But, Aizawa...

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
This is far from over.
The match continues.

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:32.037 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:32.078 --> 00:23:34.706 position:50% align:center
One For All suddenly
went out of control.

00:23:34.748 --> 00:23:37.125 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous to keep
using my Quirk.

00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:40.295 position:50% align:center
But I don't wanna
give up on this match.

00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:43.214 position:50% align:center
Shinso, Monoma, and the
others feel the same way.

00:23:43.256 --> 00:23:45.884 position:50% align:center
So we'll keep fighting
with all of our strength.

00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:47.344 position:50% align:center
For our teammates,

00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:49.054 position:50% align:center
and for victory!

00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:51.348 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Our Brawl."

00:23:51.389 --> 00:23:55.185 position:50% align:center
The important thing is to always
remember where you came from!

00:23:55.226 --> 00:23:57.562 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
