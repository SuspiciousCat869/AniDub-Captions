00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:16.516 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Classes 1-A and 1-B
from the hero course at UA high

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.101 position:50% align:center
are battling it out
against one another

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
in team combat training.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.277 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] In the first match,
special guest Shinso succeeded

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:31.865 position:50% align:center
in disrupting his opponent's
ability to communicate.

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.367 position:50% align:center
It ended with a win
for my classmates.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
Explain what you learned
or would do differently.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.303 position:50% align:center
Well, if I'm not brawling
with my enemies,

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:20.181 position:50% align:center
then my Quirk ends up
kinda of useless.

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.516 position:50% align:center
If that'd been real,

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:25.603 position:50% align:center
Shiozaki would've just murdered
me before I ever hit the ground.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.772 position:50% align:center
[KODA] I need to be able to give
more detailed instructions

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.482 position:50% align:center
to the bugs I call.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.067 position:50% align:center
And I pretty much killed it!

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.529 position:50% align:center
Thinkin' I probably
made some new fans.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:35.780 position:50% align:center
It's cool. Those warm feelings

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.115 position:50% align:center
aren't something
you can control!

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.324 position:50% align:center
Now, let's hear some praise.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:39.325 position:50% align:center
I'm not shy!

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.411 position:50% align:center
We lost Koda and
Kirishima quick.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
It was a blow to
our team's morale.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.207 position:50% align:center
I wish we could've won
without losing anybody but...

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.792 position:50% align:center
We were sloppy out there.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
The binding cloth.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:53.089 position:50% align:center
I couldn't even use a tenth
of what I'd learned from you.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.175 position:50% align:center
It's so frustrating.

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.677 position:50% align:center
There's a reason that
they call it training.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.220 position:50% align:center
The scarf is hard to use.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.348 position:50% align:center
Took me six years to master.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
Move on, but don't
forget this feeling.

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:06.561 position:50% align:center
Right...

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.104 position:50% align:center
The two who went
through work studies

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.939 position:50% align:center
dug deep in their reflections.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center
It's not surprising.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
They faced those
Shie Hassaikai villains.

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50% align:center
I heard it was a
pretty intense raid.

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
If you experience fighting
like that, it changes

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
the way you think and
how you approach a battle.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.289 position:50% align:center
Even a training battle
like this, I guess.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
[JIRO]
Compared to the others,

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50% align:center
that brain-dead shock jock
looks like a total moron.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
Listen up.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
Kirishima, you should focus
on forcing your opponent

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
into a head-on fight.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Koda, it's exactly as you said.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:44.015 position:50% align:center
Increase the accuracy with
which you control animals.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:44.974 position:50% align:center
Don't rush.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50% align:center
Think about your
enemy's weaknesses.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
Kaminari!

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
You weren't serious
at the start!

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
Are you only strong if
your team's in trouble?

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.027 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Asui, focus on how to recover

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.613 position:50% align:center
from a mistake instead of
the mistake itself.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:03:59.781 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:02.534 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Use what you learned
today to improve your future.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:03.493 position:50% align:center
Dismissed!

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
--[STUDENTS] Yes, sir!
--[KAMINARI] Yay...

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO gasps]

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center
[MIDNIGHT]
Even though he won,

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
he's still painfully aware
of his inexperience.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center
Yet, instead of
getting dismayed,

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.471 position:50% align:center
he's replaying the match
in his head to find ways

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
to improve his performance,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.767 position:50% align:center
so that he dominates
the next match.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
[squeals] It's so invigorating.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
Contain yourself.

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
Do you know why you lost?

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
Or shall I explain it to you?

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Shishida was your focal point.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
Or, wait. Was Shiozaki your ace?

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
If you'd only come
together as a team,

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
you could've taken them all.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.625 position:50% align:center
[TSUBURABA] Mr. Vlad's eyes
get so scary when he's mad.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:55.211 position:50% align:center
It's not in Shiozaki's
nature to deceive.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
Forgot to consider that fact,
Beast man, didn't you?

00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
You're correct.

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
And as a result,
we allowed our opponents

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
time to come up with a plan.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.097 position:50% align:center
You have my sincerest apologies.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
Hellfire spares no one.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
What a shame.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
But I learned something
swell. He's good.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to
having him on my side.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
Shinso, buddy!
Let's come up with a plan

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
to make Class A
cry like toddlers!

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.904 position:50% align:center
Something that'll really
ruin their lives.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
If you brainwash one of 'em...

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.407 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
He's just talking to himself.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
We should start coming up
with a plan, too.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Let's brainstorm
some ideas about

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center
how we can best
approach our match.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Smart, Deku!

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Let's do combos!

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.959 position:50% align:center
Like a super move in a game!

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
We should strategize as well.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.838 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI] Todoroki is
a strong focal point.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
I am?

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
[SERO]
What about us?

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
[JIRO] Bakugo! Let's get
on the same page.

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:47.055 position:50% align:center
The page is stay outta my way!

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.973 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
We'll be up against Shinso
in the fifth match.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Mm! Mm-hm!

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
His voice modifier
is a big threat.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
Sticky Acid Floating Kick
for the win!

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
What the heck is that?

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] There are plenty
of places to hide.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
It'll be a pain
to find the enemy.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
I'm on it.

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
Their team's dead!

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
I'll blow 'em straight
to hell. I don't need you!

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.036 position:50% align:center
We can save Iida for our
trump card if we're in a bind.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.872 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] Uh... Before you rely
on me, there's something

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center
I wanted to tell you
about my Recipro.

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Instant-Kill Floating Ball!

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center
None of these terms make sense!

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
[ROBOT 93A] Injured students
should see the nurse.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center
Humans are inferior beings whose
parts can't be replaced.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center
Feel that? Such passion.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
Such vigor! Like a
spring awakening!

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
It's winter, though.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.770 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] The end of the
year is almost upon us.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
Everyone's been working
to develop their Quirks

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
and perfect their
ultimate moves.

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center
Young Midoriya, too,

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.655 position:50% align:center
has become better
at using One For All.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
He learned Shoot Style
and Air Force.

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
Most got provisional licenses.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
A few even fought against
the Shie Hassaikai.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
And bounced back.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.508 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] In the midst of all
these events and troubles,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
they pushed on earnestly,
reaching toward their goals.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.223 position:50% align:center
And now they have the
chance to compare themselves

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
to other students
chasing the same dream.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
They'll gain a better
understanding of where they are.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
In a way, this is a rehearsal
for the rest of their lives.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
So, All Might.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
What did you think of Shinso?

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
He's great! And he has guts.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center
It's telling that the
first emotion he felt

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
after the match
was "frustration."

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.792 position:50% align:center
This is a test for him.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.628 position:50% align:center
A good showing, and he
could end up transferred.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.548 position:50% align:center
I'd wager he's eager to
show off in his next match.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
Well, Vlad. A lot left to go.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Second round teams,

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50% align:center
to the field!

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yaoyorozu.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
Yes? What is it, Kendo?

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
Why weren't you in the pageant?

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
I though I'd see you there.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you would have
stood a good chance.

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
For some reason,
Mr. Aizawa failed to tell us

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.582 position:50% align:center
that something like that
would be taking place.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
I also had band practice,

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
so I wouldn't have had
time to prepare for it.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
I suppose he must have
decided that a pageant

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.133 position:50% align:center
wasn't necessary
for my hero progress.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.594 position:50% align:center
[KENDO] Hm. After we were
in that commercial

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.805 position:50% align:center
during our intern days,

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
I think some people
have started to put us

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.434 position:50% align:center
in the same category.

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
Our fans have
pushed us into a box.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.938 position:50% align:center
Into a box?

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] You know!
It's like when people think

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
idols in the same group
are all alike!

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
At the school festival,

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
the same people shouted
"Yaoyorozu" and "Kendo"

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
cause they've
lumped ya together!

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
Oh, now that you mention it...

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
Idolatry. A troubling ritual.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
Look, if I'm being honest.

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
Your grades and Quirk are both
better than mine, Yaoyorozu.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
It's easy to see.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
I wanna be my own hero.

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'm dying to try
my hand against you today.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
I accept. Gladly.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
With all of my heart.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO] Hey, Tokoyami.
If you think about it,

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
we're basically
the same type, too.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
If you say so.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Shihai Kuroiro.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.526 position:50% align:center
Your Quirk lets you
merge with darkness

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.528 position:50% align:center
and move freely within it.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO chuckles]
You and I share a destiny.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
We are brothers in the shadows.

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
Oh? You have also
stared into the abyss?

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.042 position:50% align:center
Long live eternal
darkness, friend.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:44.876 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE growls]

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
Huh! Those two aren't
twinkling at all.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.383 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Both teams are at their bases.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
And now, it's time.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.138 position:50% align:center
Team Kendo, tear them to pieces!

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
Start the second match!

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.850 position:50% align:center
Stop with the biased commentary!

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
For real!

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
'Kay, team! Let's go!

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
[CLASS 1-B]
Right!

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
Kendo seems like
a really important

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
part of your class dynamic.

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
Yeah! She gets the job
done, no matter what!

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.988 position:50% align:center
Why're you yelling?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
That's our brilliant
class representative for ya!

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:18.576 position:50% align:center
She's smart and decisive,
even under pressure!

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
It's so awesome!

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
She's also brave,
risking herself

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50% align:center
on the front lines when
others are counting on her!

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
Not to mention
her attitude rocks!

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
Without her, we would've
killed Monoma

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
or become a buncha fools
like him by now!

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Uncalled for.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU] Think of her
as our class's big sister!

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
Itsuka Kendo inspires
all of us to do our best!

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.766 position:50% align:center
I wonder if Yaoyorozu's
plan will work.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
Why, what's she up to?

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] We'll start
reconnaissance immediately.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
If you please!

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Roger. Now, Dark Shadow!

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW]
Got it!

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] Report back
when you find the enemy.

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW]
Leave it to me!

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
[KENDO] They pretty much know
what our Quirks are by now,

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:06.791 position:50% align:center
but we've been improving on
them and developing new moves.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.544 position:50% align:center
So they have to be
ready for anything.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
That's why, first,
they'll try for some recon.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] Dark Shadow's
found our opponents.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.014 position:50% align:center
They're located
near the chimneys.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
Quickly then.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW] Why are you
just standing around?

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW] I'll take care
of whoever I can catch first.

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
I'll leave it to you, Kuroiro!

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:37.655 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW yells]

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.532 position:50% align:center
Into the abyss.

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:42.952 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
Magnifique.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
You're able to let Dark
Shadow go pretty far now.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
Did you level up during
your work study, as well?

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Somewhat, yes.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
But the farther he is,
the less time he lasts.

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.507 position:50% align:center
Oh. Speaking of.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Hm?

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.718 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW yelping]

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
Stand back!

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
Tokoyami!

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:01.763 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Huh?

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
What's going on?
This isn't right!

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
[grunting] Fumikage.
He... He got me!

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
What's wrong with Dark Shadow?

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
He lost control!

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] No. There's
plenty of light out here,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center
so Tokoyami should
be in full command.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.951 position:50% align:center
So maybe someone possessed him?

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
Is there another
power like Shinso's?

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.958 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
Um. Please don't.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.587 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
Quick, Hagakure. Light!

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Okie doke!

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
Warp Refraction. Say Cheese!

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW groans]

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:47.600 position:50% align:center
Come. Quick. Back to me!

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:52.147 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] Look! Kuroiro
was inside Dark Shadow!

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO laughs]

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
He vanished!

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
Escaped into the shadows.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
So that's his power in action.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.326 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO laughs]

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Class B's Shihai Kuroiro.

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
Quirk: Dark.

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
He can melt into
shadows immediately.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
And by developing his Quirk,

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
he's become able to move
through the darkness!

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
But it has to be
something stationary

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:19.382 position:50% align:center
in order for him to zip around!

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO] Fumikage Tokoyami.
I swear, I will vanquish you.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You and I share
a hallowed destiny of darkness.

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
I see. Fated rivals.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.692 position:50% align:center
I'll use your challenge
to reveal something.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
A move I discovered
working with Hawks.

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
A new move.

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:44.699 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
Dark Fallen Angel.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] He always ends up
taking care of things himself.

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:07.055 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 93A laughs]
Natural diamonds!

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
Not that synthetic stuff!

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
I could easily get 300 mil for--

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:15.021 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 93A yelps]

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I'll take these.

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 93A]
Aw, crap. Hawks?

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Come on, team,
why're you so slow?

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.614 position:50% align:center
There's a fight
at a bar in Kantina,

00:14:24.656 --> 00:14:25.532 position:50% align:center
so I'm flying there next.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
You head back.

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
Deal with all the
paperwork, yeah?

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 93A] Tsukuyomi.
Let's take this guy in.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.711 position:50% align:center
It's our job as sidekicks.

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 93B]
Only because Hawks is too fast.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.256 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 93A]
You gotta admit, though,

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.758 position:50% align:center
it is an efficient system.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.634 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
I'll help him.

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.553 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 93A]
Hold on, what?

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 93B]
That kid's an eager one.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] Apparently,
I was the first student

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:54.728 position:50% align:center
Hawks ever made an offer to
after the sports festival.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
During the internship,

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:59.399 position:50% align:center
I chased after him constantly.

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
But I mostly did clean-up
for incidents he resolved.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Questions arose in me.

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
I can't let things get worse

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
while I wait for you guys
just so you get practice.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:16.249 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] Then why'd you
ask me to intern with you

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
in the first place?

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.252 position:50% align:center
We're birds of a feather.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
Is that a joke?

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
Nope. I'm 20 percent serious.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center
Half a' the reason was because

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
I wanted to talk to
someone from Class 1-A.

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
I'm interested in those thugs

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
from the League of Villains
who attacked you.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center
To make things easier on me,

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
I figured I might as well
find a solid recruit

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
who could keep up with me.

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
So from the top finishers
at the UA sports festival,

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.027 position:50% align:center
I chose the fellow faux-avian

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
who seemed like
he'd be worthwhile.

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:48.990 position:50% align:center
Now then. Why don't we start

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
with how the first
attack went down.

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
At the USJ.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] As I told him about
the details of our encounter,

00:15:57.207 --> 00:16:00.001 position:50% align:center
my frustration
started to simmer.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
I'm not a messenger pigeon.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:08.134 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
My weeklong internship ended

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
without me learning a thing.

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Hey! How was Kyushu, huh?

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
It was... nothing special.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
And then, for my work study,

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:24.150 position:50% align:center
the pro who moves too fast
took me under his wing again.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
Since the internship,
my class at UA

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
had experienced many trials.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.741 position:50% align:center
You probably want
to hear about those,

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
don't you, Hawks?

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
Don't look down
on me, number three.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
No, now the number-two hero!

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
That Tsukuyomi's going all out!

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 93B]
He's definitely got potential.

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:48.049 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 93A]
Good work today.

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:50.802 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 93B]
We'll see you tomorrow!

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
Tokoyami. You got a sec?

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:57.100 position:50% align:center
What intel do you want now?

00:16:57.142 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
Let's take this to the sky.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Wha-- Hawks!

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] It's like
we're one with the wind.

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Is this your
first time flying?

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
I asked you back
20 percent for your Quirk.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.495 position:50% align:center
Birds of a feather and all that.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
And 50 percent was for
info on the League.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
But that last 30...

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
Well, to be frank,

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
it's because I thought you were
wasting your true potential.

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
Look around.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
It's amazing.

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:33.595 position:50% align:center
Nothing beats a birds-eye view.

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
I'm wasting my potential?

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] It's good to put
effort into beefing up

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
your short-range
combat weaknesses,

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
but you shouldn't forget
about what you're good at.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center
Use your Quirk
to move more freely.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
I'm not interested in training
the next generation or anything.

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
But... I couldn't pass this up.

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Those of us
who can fly, should fly.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] There's no need
to be stuck on the ground

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
with everyone else.

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
I'll use your challenge
to reveal something.

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
A move I discovered
working with Hawks.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Dark Fallen Angel?

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center
Sounds dramatic.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
Show me what you've got.

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.193 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] He's moving
through the shadows again.

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA] Still only
one of them attacking?

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
This is unexpected!

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] Isn't this the same plan
that failed the first match?

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
It's a pretty smart move.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
In an area like this,

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
I'd say he definitely
has the upper hand.

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:46.626 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Tokoyami, are you okay?

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Yes.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO]
Fumikage Tokoyami.

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
I swear, I will vanquish you.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
His eyes are fixed on me.

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO] Class A is
completely in the dark.

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
You and I share a destiny.
Brothers in the shadows.

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO]
I set an emotional trap

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
before the match even started!

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
You probably think
the one I'm after

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:11.317 position:50% align:center
is my supposed rival,
Fumikage Tokoyami.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
But that's not true!

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
I'm the Scheming
Hero, Vantadark.

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center
And misdirection is
the key to my designs.

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
Aoyama?

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
--[KUROIRO laughs]
--[AOYAMA screams]

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:31.171 position:50% align:center
[SHIOZAKI]
Trickery. How despicable he is.

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
Wretched soul. Repent at once!

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO]
This cramped, intricate stage

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.845 position:50% align:center
gives me plenty of pathways!

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.597 position:50% align:center
I've got speed on my side.

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
And poor Dark Shadow's tethered
to his host on the ground.

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
Which means, he can't
possibly catch up to me--

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
there's no way!

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Did you think I was slow?

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:56.237 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Dark Shadow: Dark Fallen Angel!

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Wait, he can fly?

00:19:57.864 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
Look at Tokoyami go!

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
It's a new move!

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
But how's that possible?!

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
The principle behind it
is so simple!

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
Dark Shadow is always floating,
so he can hold onto Tokoyami

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
and carry him through the air!

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
And by covering
himself with a cape,

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
Tokoyami can block the light
that weakens his Quirk

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
in order to achieve a
continuously high output!

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
Plus with that hold,
Tokoyami's hands remain free

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center
to do whatever he needs!

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
It's such a brilliant
move, you guys!

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:23.181 position:50% align:center
So obvious that it
didn't cross our minds,

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
but he figured it out and look
how's perfect it's working!

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
It's kind of like
he's cut through

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
his own personal Gordian Knot!

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
So cool! Whoa. I'm impressed!

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] You shouldn't forget
about what you're good at.

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Hawks. I thank you.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
I will fly even higher!

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
An unexpected rendezvous!

00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO]
Plan A was a failure.

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.377 position:50% align:center
Aoyama, your Navel Buffet!

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
Tokoyami, cover the area!

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
Dark Shadow,
get under the cloak!

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW]
Got it!

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
I shall give light
to these shadows!

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
Navel Buffet!

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
There he is, Hagakure!

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
I see him!

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
Let's nab him! Hurry!

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
That's as far as you go!

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
We won't let you escape!

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] Launching
a surprise attack alone.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
Bold move. And
certainly unexpected.

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50% align:center
No matter. Because I
expect the unexpected.

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
Oh, I don't know about that.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
Stand down!

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.790 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
You don't know when you're beat!

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE yelps]
Mushrooms? What the heck?

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:40.842 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO laughs] So it's true.
Kendo is better than you.

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
[KOMORI]
It's just like our brilliant

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center
class rep said, shroom!

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center
If we see too much light,
then plan A failed.

00:21:50.894 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
So we start plan B.

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
Cute little mushrooms
for everybody.

00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:32.412 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:35.498 position:50% align:center
Class A tries to fight back, but
with the wide range of attacks

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.168 position:50% align:center
employed by Class B's
Komori and Fukidashi,

00:23:38.209 --> 00:23:39.210 position:50% align:center
they lose their advantage

00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:41.463 position:50% align:center
and have to break
formation once again.

00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:44.591 position:50% align:center
On top of that,
Yaoyorozu gets separated.

00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:47.427 position:50% align:center
Come on, you guys.
Think of something!

00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:49.763 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Foresight."

00:23:49.804 --> 00:23:52.057 position:50% align:center
Yaoyorozu predicts the
progress of their fight

00:23:52.098 --> 00:23:54.517 position:50% align:center
and tries to create
a path to victory!

00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:56.936 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
