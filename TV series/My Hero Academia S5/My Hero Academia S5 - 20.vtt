You're coming along nicely.

Tomura Shigaraki.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
We've been weakened
considerably.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
Ever since we lost All For One.

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:30.739 position:50% align:center
To do what must be done,

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.616 position:50% align:center
we'll have to advance
to the next stage.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.911 position:50% align:center
He left formidable
power behind for us.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
You only have to say the word

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
and I will retrieve
that power for you.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.857 position:50% align:center
I've searched so long.
Now I've found you at last.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.487 position:50% align:center
So, are you really the leader
who will succeed All For One?

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:46.624 position:50% align:center
Kurogiri, is this
the "formidable power"

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:50.086 position:50% align:center

I'm not impressed.

you do this, All For One?

I can't believe it!

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center

He's too weak to deserve this!

I don't want to question you,

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] I take it you've
met Gigantomachia.

He's All For One's biggest fan.

This giant even used to
work as his bodyguard.

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
He's got incredible
stamina and resilience,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
and with that body, he can
handle multiple Quirks

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
without having to undergo
any modification.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.970 position:50% align:center

and after All Might
weakened him,

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.974 position:50% align:center
All For One knew
defeat was inevitable.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.310 position:50% align:center
So, he hid Gigantomachia
from view.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
He thought many steps ahead
and planned meticulously.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50% align:center
He did this so that, no matter
what might become of him,

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
he would be certain
that his hopes

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center

[DOCTOR] You've got quite
a discerning eye, Dabi.

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
Gigantomachia is loyal.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
That's what's led him down the
path of despair you see now.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.083 position:50% align:center
It pains him that Shigaraki

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
doesn't quite measure
up to All For One.

Now, then, to business.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
I brought you here today
because of an agreement I made

out of my deference
to our former boss.

It's not that I dislike you.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.375 position:50% align:center
I just have to be cautious.
I need to make quite sure

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
that you're worthy of receiving
the fruits of my labor.

A rare, variant quirk
manifested in you--

a mutation no one's seen before,

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
and you murdered
your loved ones,

simply by putting
your hands on them.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center

back to me in fragments

with a frustration so intense,
I felt sick to my stomach.

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
Will we modify him?

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE] No. Even if
your mind has forgotten,

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center

teach you. As your master,

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center
I will help you give
purpose to that frustration.

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] When I put
them on, it's so strange.

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
Though it still makes me
feel sick to my stomach,

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.793 position:50% align:center
wearing them washes
calmness over me.

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
Don't you think that's bizarre?

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:50.173 position:50% align:center
My mind's empty, beyond
those flashes and fragments,

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
and yet, there's a
heaviness in my heart,

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center
like a lump of lead.

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
Never moving, fueling the rage

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
that propels me, but never
brings relief. Mm...

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
Even if we bring
down hero society...

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50% align:center
Even if I rule the ruins
from the shadows...

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
That lead will be
with me all my life.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.239 position:50% align:center
That's why I despise
all in existence.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center
All that lives and breathes

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.619 position:50% align:center
presses on the
weight in my soul.

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50% align:center
So, then, why
shouldn't I destroy it?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
Why must I suffer it?

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
When this world falls,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
we'll see the glorious
new horizon that awaits.

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
So why not lend me a hand?

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center
I'll show you the
halls of heaven

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
and the depths of hell.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:40.515 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR laughs] You sound like
a kid playing a bad guy!

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
I'm amazed you got through
it with a straight face!

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
Ah, why not? I'll help
you achieve your vision,

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
but only if you can back up
that speech with action.

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
A villain's philosophy
is worthless

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
if he can't bring
his dreams to life!

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
Tomura, those ideas of yours
seem a little bit deranged,

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
if you ask me.

00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
Like, do you even wanna
destroy everything I love?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] There's always room
for my comrades' wishes.

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:05.540 position:50% align:center
Live how you want to.

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR laughing] You passed
the test with flying colors.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.005 position:50% align:center
You're appalling.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You were testing me?

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50% align:center
I planned to work with
you from the start,

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
but I had to see some growth.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
I can't bestow these powers
to just anyone, you know.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.894 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] That said, I still
can't hand them over yet.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
You're all far too weak.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
But there is something
you can do

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
to prove to me
that you're ready.

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
That big guy may be dense,
but he's valuable to us both.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
Though, unlike me, he hasn't
accepted you as his own.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
Do you catch my drift?

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
If you can make Gigantomachia
submit to you,

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
then everything I have will be
yours to use as you see fit.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
If you want what I offer, you'll
have to seize it for yourself.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:55.674 position:50% align:center
Fine, but was that self-
indulgent tutorial necessary?

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:57.592 position:50% align:center
Just so you know,
I'm not helping.

00:11:57.676 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't be a brat just 'cause
your flames didn't work on him.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
That's not it, you maniac.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center
I have a good
potential ally in mind,

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
I'm going to focus my energies
there. Do you object?

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
No. I look forward
to meeting them.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] In that case, Dabi, I'd
very much appreciate your help

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:15.318 position:50% align:center
testing out a High-End Nomu.

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.612 position:50% align:center
I have just the one--
it will pair elegantly

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
with your aesthetic.
A perfect match!

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
Did you even hear what I said?

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
Send us back now,
so we can get started.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
I feel like I could
take on the world.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
From this point forward,

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
contact me using this
device exclusively.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.129 position:50% align:center
Time to work, Johnny!

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
Back to Gigantomachia
these little soldiers go.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50% align:center
[GIGANTOMACHIA]
Ohhh, Master.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
Now, are you ready to
submit to your future king?

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
[GIGANTOMACHIA grunts]

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
You're weak!

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.836 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] He's only open
when he's in the air!

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:18.048 position:50% align:center
[GIGANTOMACHIA]
Pathetic!

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.052 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] Looks like the
future king is in trouble!

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
[SPINNER]
Yeah, well, that's nothing new.

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
Doctor Ujiko promised that
he'd give us his full support,

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
but only under one,
massive condition:

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
that we reign in Gigantomachia.

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
And in the month and
a half since then,

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
Shigaraki has come no closer
to proving his strength

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
to the giant and
winning him over.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
The big guy wages
a full-out assault

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.159 position:50% align:center
for 48 hours and
44 minutes straight,

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
only taking breaks to sleep.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
That brief respite lasts
for about three hours,

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.417 position:50% align:center
then he starts the
whole cycle over again.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:03.093 position:50% align:center
[SPINNER] His body gets
bigger during combat,

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:06.179 position:50% align:center
and somehow, he's always
able to find Shigaraki,

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
no matter where he hides.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
[GIGANTOMACHIA grunts]

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center
[SPINNER]
So, for a month and a half now,

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center
Shigaraki's barely slept a wink.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
But even as he is pushed
to the brink of death,

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
Shigaraki's still smiling.

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
As far as the rest of us go,
he doesn't seem to notice

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.533 position:50% align:center
when we withdraw
from the action.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.076 position:50% align:center
It's like he's blind
to everything

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center
except his primary
target: Shigaraki.

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
We rest in shifts,
keeping ourselves fresh

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
so we can devote our energy

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:38.294 position:50% align:center
to helping our leader
conquer the giant.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, the Doctor is giving
us bare-bones financial support.

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center
Toga decided to spend

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:46.720 position:50% align:center
what little money she got
on a new duffel coat.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
Toasty and warm!

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
I don't move as quickly
if I get too cold!

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
Plus, A-line cuts
look super cute on me!

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
You only joined the League

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
because you were
obsessed with Stain.

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:01.818 position:50% align:center
His influence has
all but disappeared

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
at this point, though.
So why are you still here?

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:10.201 position:50% align:center
I love Mr. Stainy, and I love
Izuku... and I love Ochaco, too!

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center
It's so amazing that I can be
all these wonderful people!

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center
You're a real free spirit.

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
[MR COMPRESS]
The monster's asleep.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center
As massive as he is, you'd
think he'd stop to eat more.

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
Hey, Tomura, you still
alive over there?

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50% align:center
Yeah. The big, dumb bastard's
slowing down a lot.

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:34.059 position:50% align:center
I'm way closer now than when
this whole saga started.

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
I'll bring that overgrown
gorilla to his knees.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.646 position:50% align:center
Sooner or later.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
[SPINNER]
That look in his eyes.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
It's like a kid chasing
after a dream.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] It's Giran.
Wonder where he's been.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
[MR COMPRESS]
I've been calling Giran

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
and gotten nothing
but radio silence!

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:51.368 position:50% align:center
Ask him if we have
damage insurance!

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] That guy cares about me
more than anyone ever has,

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center
he got me into the
League, you know.

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
A real mensch, that one.

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
Why the hell haven't
you been answering

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
Mr. Compress' calls?
You're the absolute worst, man!

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
[VOICE] Oops, that would
be our fault, sorry!

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:06.383 position:50% align:center
Don't be mad at him!

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.926 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me.

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
You're Jin Bubaigawara, the
villain known as Twice right?

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.554 position:50% align:center
[MR COMPRESS]
A voice changer?

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Who're you? Where's Giran?

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:14.557 position:50% align:center
[VOICE]
Never mind that.

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
Turn on the news--if you can.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.771 position:50% align:center
Our top story, following
yesterday's events,

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
another finger has been found.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:22.691 position:50% align:center
[SPINNER]
A finger?

00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:23.858 position:50% align:center
[NEWSCASTER 108A] Earlier,
a severed finger was found

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
near the home of the
Shie Hassaikai boss.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
Then at Hosu City Terminal,

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.406 position:50% align:center
on the Metropolitan Expressway,

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.199 position:50% align:center
and at Ground Zero
in Camino Ward,

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
all within the last three days.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
And now, a pinky finger
turns up in central Fukuoka,

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
at the site of Endeavor's
recent battle...

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
[MR COMPRESS] All places where
we've been active lately.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.250 position:50% align:center
That's no accident.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Who the hell are you, huh?

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
I'm the grand commander of
the Meta Liberation Army.

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
The name's Re-Destro.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:51.177 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] First the Yakuza,
and now the Liberation Army?

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
All you has-been trying
to make a comeback.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
Hear you've been selling
lots of books lately.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
You want to get in on the trend
while the getting's good.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
Think again.

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
We're the ones who
started the trend.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
Congratulations! What do
you want with Giran?

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
You better not hurt him
anymore, or you're toast!

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
Ah. I've got your
broker right here,

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
and he's still alive, of course.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
Our objective is to
liberate all meta humans.

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
To demolish the existing
framework and rebuild a world

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
where people can be themselves,

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
where they can
use their abilities

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
to their fullest capacity.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
[MR COMPRESS]
Interesting.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
I don't see any reason
why we should oppose that.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
Is he trying to exploit
our name, like the yakuza?

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
Give us the broker and
we'll get back to you soon.

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
We're busy now.

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
I'll hear about your
little revolution club

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
once our task here's complete.

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.476 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
While you're taking a breather,

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
why not just hear me out?

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna release
my hostage now,

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:45.899 position:50% align:center
because you're not
calling the shots.

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
And your friend has told me
what a tight-knit group you are.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
Your broker is an admirable man.
Takes great pride in his work.

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
I imagine he's determined to
remain hidden in the shadows,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
ever careful to avoid the prying
eyes of heroes and police.

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
Sadly, he never thought
someone might be lurking

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:05.794 position:50% align:center
in those same shadows,
waiting to pounce.

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
Still, I commend him.
He had the foresight to delete

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
his client list
before we struck.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
Not only that, but he
didn't so much as wince

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:14.886 position:50% align:center
when we started
taking his fingers,

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
nor did he give you up.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
But as for that client list?
We were able to recover it.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
I must praise his resistance,
futile though it was!

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
We liberation warriors
have worked hard.

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
Preparing for years to
enact the coming events!

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:31.444 position:50% align:center
We've endured for generations,
biding our time,

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
spreading our roots
far and wide!

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:38.576 position:50% align:center
"Revolution club"? I don't
like jokes made in poor taste.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
I have 116,516 hidden warriors.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:47.669 position:50% align:center
And we are lying in wait,
ever ready to take action.

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:49.087 position:50% align:center
This guy must be bluffing!

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
Niigata, huh?

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center
How's the weather there,
deep in those mountains?

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
--Eh?
--[TWICE grunts]

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
Too late, I'm afraid.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
We're watching you right now
thanks to our satellite

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:01.766 position:50% align:center
Go where you will,
but we'll always find you.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
We're always watching
the League of Villains.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
Endeavor, Hawks, Edge Shot,
Meerko, and Crust.

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
One quick call,

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.570 position:50% align:center
and they'll drop everything
and have you surrounded.

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.905 position:50% align:center
I do appreciate
the advance warning.

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
Now, what do you want from us?

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] I insist that
the leader of this revolution

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
bear the name Destro.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
Your organization has
become too well-known.

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we shall crush you.

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
Thus, signaling the revival
of the Liberation Army.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
The fingers prove our resolve.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center
Let's not draw
this little talk out

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:36.968 position:50% align:center
with pointless bargaining.

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
The war's begun, to liberate
meta humans from all tyranny!

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
Next, you will make
your way to Deika City,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
in Aichi, within the hour.

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
That's your only hope of
freeing your friend, Giran!

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.689 position:50% align:center
Then, you must make your choice!

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
Will you stand against
us and be destroyed

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
or do nothing and be
captured by the heroes?

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:58.698 position:50% align:center
You must decide, Shigaraki!

00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
[MR COMPRESS] He wants us
in Aichi within the hour?

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
And he's tracking our
every move from space?

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
If that's all true,
it feels like checkmate.

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Uh, do we even
have to discuss this?

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:11.586 position:50% align:center
No way! That guy
described Giran to a T!

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
This Re-Destro guy's
got him for sure!

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
Giran saved me--gave me
somewhere to belong.

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
So, we have to go save
him! Like, right now!

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
Giran might already
be dead, though.

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:23.264 position:50% align:center
Everything that guy
said could be a lie.

00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:24.933 position:50% align:center
All that we have is his word.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] But if there's even
a slim chance Giran's alive,

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
we have to help him!

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
[MR COMPRESS] You want us to
barrel in there without a plan?

00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
Calm yourself!

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
You've gotten way too
attached to people lately,

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:34.484 position:50% align:center
it's become a bad habit!

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
It's because I'm an outcast!

[gasping]

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
I think I've got an idea.
Doctor, did you catch all that?

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Yes. I've been
tuned in to "Villain Radio,"

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
and I'm shocked that the
Meta Liberation Army's back.

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:50.000 position:50% align:center
The waves you've been
making in the underworld

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
have dredged up
some real darkness!

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
How long do we have until
the big baby wakes up?

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center
[MR COMPRESS] If left
undisturbed, he should wake up

in two hours and 35
minutes, give or take.

just outside the border

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:06.599 position:50% align:center
between Mie and Shiga.

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:08.601 position:50% align:center
That's a great place to be.

Okay, we'll need a
transport. Let's go.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
You're taking the bait?

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:15.525 position:50% align:center
What if they really have a
hundred ten thousand people?

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
We'll be dead!

[SHIGARAKI]
The giant's not invincible.

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
After a month and a half of
fighting him, it's clear to me.

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:24.951 position:50% align:center
But he does have
an excess of HP.

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
And no matter where I am,

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
he'll sniff me out
and hunt me down.

[gasps]

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:33.084 position:50% align:center
We're going to send
Gigantomachia

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
right into the fray and let
him face all those fighters.

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center
Battling all those
revolutionaries

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:40.050 position:50% align:center
will wear that meathead down!

How sneaky!

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
And what'll you do if it turns
out that Re-Destro is bluffing?

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:47.349 position:50% align:center
Then he'll die, simple as that.

00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center

Oh, covered. Now I'll recover.

destroy the League of Villains

and construct a new society
from the ground up.

Now, with more than 110,000
warriors behind him,
