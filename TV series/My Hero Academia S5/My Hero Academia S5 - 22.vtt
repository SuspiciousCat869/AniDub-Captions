[BUBAIGAWARA grunts]
No, no! Your hands are so cold!

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.807 position:50% align:center
I don't get it! You're
freezing my mind out!

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.143 position:50% align:center
Damn it, who are you?!
Are you me?

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
You have my face,
but I don't know you.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.022 position:50% align:center
Do I?

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU]
Bubaigawara and Toga.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
C! Make sure she can't move.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
E, focus on him.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.863 position:50% align:center
Stop it. Leave those two alone.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.365 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] Sorry, he can't
talk to you right now.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
He's taking care of a
couple worthless villains.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.786 position:50% align:center
His meta power
allows him to create

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.663 position:50% align:center
life-like puppets.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.875 position:50% align:center
That's why he controls
a slew of Bubaigawaras.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.002 position:50% align:center
Thanks to my company's
micro-transceivers

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
and the comm system he created,

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:49.299 position:50% align:center
he can control them
with exquisite precision.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.177 position:50% align:center
We know all about
Bubaigawara's mental trauma.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
Your client information
is worth its weight in gold.

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.057 position:50% align:center
Is that frustrating for you?

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.475 position:50% align:center
It must be, Broker.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center
Thanks to you, we'll kill
Toga and take Twice.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center
[GIRAN]
Kill Toga?

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:06.232 position:50% align:center
I doubt Bubaigawara will
bounce back from that.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.694 position:50% align:center
It's bad if I'm not wrapped up.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
Please, stop it!

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center
No! Dammit! Put her down! Toga!

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.244 position:50% align:center
That's me. I'm
trying to kill her.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
Why would I hurt the girl

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.289 position:50% align:center
who wrapped me
in her handkerchief!

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:22.791 position:50% align:center
That's me! No, it's not!

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.376 position:50% align:center
Right? I'd never do that!

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.294 position:50% align:center
So who is it?
Where is the real me?

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:27.504 position:50% align:center
Am I a copy?

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.339 position:50% align:center
Have I been lying to
myself this whole time?

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.758 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna tear myself in two!

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.511 position:50% align:center
Am I the original?
Is this really me?

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.096 position:50% align:center
Who am I?

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:08.688 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
People are always afraid of me

00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:11.483 position:50% align:center
because they think
my eyes look scary.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.194 position:50% align:center
No family. I live on my own.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.279 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 110A]
I see. That must be hard.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.573 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA] One of the most
critical moments in my life

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center
was when I was 16.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 110A]
Bad news.

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center
The man you hit with your
motorcycle has a broken arm.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.373 position:50% align:center
Not my fault he jumped
in front of me.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
I was driving at the speed
limit and everything.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, this
will be the start

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
of your criminal record.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. You may
stumble in life,

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:38.426 position:50% align:center
but you can always pick
yourself back up again.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.261 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
Nice idea in theory.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
Some people trip and just
keep on falling, though.

[groans]

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
Fool! Do you have any idea
who you ran over?

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
An executive with one
of our most valued clients!

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
I just got off the
phone and guess what?

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:54.859 position:50% align:center
They said they're
going to rethink

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
working with us in the future.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.114 position:50% align:center
Is this how you repay me
for giving you a job

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
and a roof to sleep under?

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:01.991 position:50% align:center
You're a curse.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
Never show your face
in this office again.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA] My parents died
when I was in middle school.

Got caught up
in a villain attack.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.130 position:50% align:center
I wasn't close to any
of my other relatives.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
I was alone. All by myself.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
But I wanted someone to talk to.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA] Hey. Did I
make a mistake with you?

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
If you did, well... So what?

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
Not your fault you were born
with the crappiest luck.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
I wanted somebody around.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.109 position:50% align:center
Someone I trusted.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.529 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
It was fun.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
You know what a person who's
circling the drain really wants?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
An easy life.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.663 position:50% align:center
Least that's how I was.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
Which is why I ended up
making so many mistakes.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.337 position:50% align:center
And I didn't realize
how many wrong turns

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
I'd made until
I hit rock bottom.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA] When I stopped
being able to trust myself.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
[GIRAN]
What a mess.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
Watching a bunch of
yous kill other yous

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
made you go a little nuts.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
So, what's with the bag?
Panic attack?

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA] If I'm not
wrapped up, I'll split.

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:19.652 position:50% align:center
I won't! I'm fine!

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:21.946 position:50% align:center
Ah. Interesting.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.448 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
The doubles I make disappear

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.117 position:50% align:center
after receiving a certain
amount of damage.

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
Basically, when they get the
equivalent of a broken bone.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
You can see why
I'm kind of concerned.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
No worries here.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the flashy
robberies you committed

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center
with all those clones,
you made it

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
onto the nation's
most-wanted list.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
You know, if you
used your Quirk right,

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
you could take on
the entire country.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda surprised you're so
down and out, given that power.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA] Any advice
for someone like me?

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
Find some people
who will trust you.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.270 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
Who?

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
Like-minded folk.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center
There's been a group
on the move lately.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.861 position:50% align:center
And I'm positive they'd
want a guy like you

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
to join their ranks.
Trust me on this.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
There are plenty
of people in this world

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50% align:center
who think the same way as you.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
[groaning] Toga, no!

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50% align:center
F and G. Punch him.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
Ouch! So weak! Ow!

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU]
Grab his arms.

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU]
Break them.

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
Do what I say and
this stops, got it?

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
Resistance is pointless.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.691 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
It hurts. Damn it.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAZOKU] Great. Toga's
regaining consciousness.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.987 position:50% align:center
I need to increase
their strength.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA] The pain. My arms.
It hurts. It's bad.

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
But even though it hurts,
I'm not disappearing!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.458 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:56.541 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA] I've been careful
to avoid any real injuries.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
Because I was afraid
I would disappear!

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
It's been like this for so long.

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
No matter what. I keep
making the wrong choices!

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.930 position:50% align:center
I could've figured
this out right away

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
if I'd just tried
to hurt myself,

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
but I kept falling and failing.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
Until I met them.
Until I met her.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
Toga! I swear I'll save you!

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
Outta the way, you fakes.

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
I would never kill a comrade.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
You will fear me.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
Liberation Army!

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.798 position:50% align:center
I'll show you the
extent of my Quirk!

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:50.762 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
My Quirk is Double.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:53.014 position:50% align:center
It lets me make two
things out of one thing.

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50% align:center
I can make up to
two copies at a time.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
And what I make with
my ability is more fragile

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.812 position:50% align:center
than the real thing.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
The second one made
is more fragile

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
than the first, and I
can't make anything new

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:05.902 position:50% align:center
until the first one disappears.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:08.446 position:50% align:center
It's no good. Sorry, Shigaraki.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
I can do it. Not a problem!

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:11.741 position:50% align:center
I need data and something

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
to visualize for Double.
I don't have data for this.

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.830 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I'm not
gonna be helpful

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.749 position:50% align:center
reproducing the yakuza bullet.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.585 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA] I'm sorry
I was never of much use.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.170 position:50% align:center
I've been holding you back.

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
You accepted me,
and I want to repay you.

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.883 position:50% align:center
From the bottom of my heart.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:32.637 position:50% align:center
And now I can... I can do this!

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
Let's go, Twice!

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:37.100 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARAS]
It's time for a massacre!

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
Hurry! We'll help
Mister Skeptic!

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
Don't kill the Doubler.

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
Aw, damn it!

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.240 position:50% align:center
[BUBAIGAWARA]
A march of grief!

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
Sad Man's Parade!

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
Do your worst.
I'll protect my comrades!

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.126 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
What a surprise.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
He's overcome his
psychological trauma.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
It's not what you
expected from him,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.632 position:50% align:center
huh, Mister Skeptic?

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
A rare miscalculation
and failure.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
Failure?

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
What are you talking
about, Re-Destro?

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
I can say without hesitation

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
I've only failed
once in the past.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.605 position:50% align:center
Understand? Just one time
in my entire life!

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
So you take it back.
This is all to plan!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.026 position:50% align:center
I'm just prepping
for my next move.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.194 position:50% align:center
[elevator dings]

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:32.739 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
Ah. Yes. Of course, Skeptic.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
[GIRAN coughs] So, the kid's
right in the head now?

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
He must have one
hell of a doctor.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:41.623 position:50% align:center
If his shackles are really off,
he can do anything. You'll see.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.458 position:50% align:center
At the very least,
he can even out

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
the numbers on the battlefield.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
Quality over quantity.
Right, Geten?

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
Your power may be useful
in the right situation, sure.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.394 position:50% align:center
But you've almost blown through
all the ice in the area.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:05.605 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
If you've got a free hand,

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
then help me!

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
Why should I bother
lending you a hand?

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
Are you so unfeeling?

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.363 position:50% align:center
Plenty of other guys over
there who can help you out.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Dabi! Mr. Compress!

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
Backup Twices are here
to the rescue!

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:22.330 position:50% align:center
[TWICES chattering]

00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
What the hell? But your trauma!

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Love and courage evened me out!

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS] I don't
get it, but it sounds like

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:34.300 position:50% align:center
you're on a hero's journey,
even though you're a villain!

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] What? Is it weird for
a villain to save his friends?

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
[TWICES]
Not at all.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Of course I won't let you die.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
I'm so cool.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
I don't have many friends,

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
so you're all important to me!

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
--[TWICE] Wait, am I an idiot?
--[TWICE] You said it.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
Not a bad fighter, though.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
Yep, check me out,
I'm a natural.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.984 position:50% align:center
Let's give 'em a good one!
Or a good 20,000!

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
I'll make more of you guys, too!
We'll be more than a "league"--

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
we'll have the
population of a city!

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
Let's go, City of Villains!

00:10:58.241 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
Wait, Twice!

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
If you annihilate the enemy,
we won't have any extra players

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
to throw against
Gigantomachia later.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.291 position:50% align:center
--[TWICE] Go easy on them?
--[TWICE] Then Dabi should stop.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
He burns lots of stuff.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
But the massacre!

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
 How long until
the big guy wakes up?

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
An hour and five minutes.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Then I'll stall them!

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
More importantly,
Toga's in trouble.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
Get the location from
me and hurry over!

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.095 position:50% align:center
[TWICES groan]

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
[TWICES]
Oh, no, mes!

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center
What, is there some kind of
ice factory around here?

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
Where's all this coming from?

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:30.315 position:50% align:center
[GETEN]
There's more to my ability

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
than simple manipulation.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
[DABI]
Is that so?

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
[GETEN]
I can control the temperature

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
of the molecules, too.

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:42.327 position:50% align:center
So, if I call out to the water
in the pipes and lower the temp,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
it freezes and
becomes my weapon.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
You could have told me
that from the beginning.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
Now I'm angry.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
[GETEN]
In the future we're aiming for,

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
the strength of someone's
power will be directly linked

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
to their place in society.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
increasing your meta
ability will be essential.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
[TWICES]
Mes!

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.432 position:50% align:center
[GETEN] There's no value
to life other than

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
the amount of
strength you wield.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty
depressing worldview.

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
Now, die.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
[GETEN] You're the one who
will perish, blue flame user.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:17.237 position:50% align:center
Your body already smells burnt.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.155 position:50% align:center
Determining your
opponent's meta power

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
is the most basic of tactics.

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:24.244 position:50% align:center
Your scorched skin looks like
it's about to fall off.

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
You won't be able to fight
for long, will you?

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
Because your flames are
consuming your own body.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
A frightening attack.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center
And he willingly
sacrificed his own allies.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
The ice user is trouble.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
He's the only one who
stands out from the rest.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
He's exactly who we want
to throw at Machia.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR chuckles]
This hardly seems fair.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
But if you die here,
All For One will be so sad.

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE]
Machia.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] The master's
successor is doing his best,

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
but he's awfully tired.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
[GIGANTOMACHIA]
The master's successor.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.222 position:50% align:center
Shigaraki, how you
holding up over there?

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] Concerned?
Should we not have come?

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
Well, if we hadn't
come to this city,

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
then we would've been
reported and chased

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
by a bunch of heroes, right?

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
We would have been
in trouble either way.

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
Yes, I suppose that's true.
They had me trapped.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
Look over there, Spinner.
The tower's close.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.327 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
And it's well guarded.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.872 position:50% align:center
Where'd all these
people come from?

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center
Whoa, there are so many Twices!

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Yo, Spinner!

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:57.587 position:50% align:center
A buncha me died in the ice.

00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
I twisted my knee!

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
Shigaraki!

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:03.051 position:50% align:center
Well, this is unexpected.
You're an army now.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:04.636 position:50% align:center
[TWICES]
Yeah!

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:05.970 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
And since I can do this...

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
[LIBERATION ARMY yelling]

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:10.350 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] I can help the
team out, right, Boss?

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
[TWICES groan]

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.812 position:50% align:center
You're incredible, Twice.

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
Think you have enough
clones to clear a path

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:17.440 position:50% align:center
to the tower for me?

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
Someone said their
boss and Giran

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
are holed up inside there.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
I thought that it
might be a bluff, but...

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
The closer we get,
the more enemies there are.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
They're protecting something.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
We need to leave enough
pawns to take on Machia,

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
but I wanna make sure
their big boss is dead.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Yeah! You got it!

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
Why don't you go take a nap
while I trim the fat for ya.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
We'll take down
the Liberation Army

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
with a single multiple person!

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
Hey, me! I'll leave
that tower to you!

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Giran! I'm coming!

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:49.264 position:50% align:center
So, Twice is gonna be able
to handle this by himself.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] He does have
a real soft spot for Giran.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
The Liberation Army is
playing with people's hearts.

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure they suffer
until their last breaths.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.154 position:50% align:center
[HANABATA] You, leader
of the League of Villains!

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
Up to now, we have allowed
you to pursue your agenda!

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
The politician!
Forgot about him.

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:12.662 position:50% align:center
[HANABATA] We believe humans
are not frail beings,

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
that we all have some
sort of power.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.459 position:50% align:center
Our revival party
will show how people

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:20.420 position:50% align:center
use their meta abilities
to defeat evil!

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
Witness the strength
of flesh and blood!

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.301 position:50% align:center
It's time. Dismantle
our guests of honor.

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
Crush the League of Villains!
Liberate yourselves, my friends!

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
Use your righteous power
to bring forth a new era!

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
Show the world that
everyone is a hero,

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:38.355 position:50% align:center
and that at the
same time, nobody is!

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
[TWICES groan]

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
I'll leave the rest to you, me.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.361 position:50% align:center
[SPINNER]
Hanabata. Damn it!

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
Every time he talks,

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:48.365 position:50% align:center
the soldiers out here
get more fired up.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
What should I do?
Shigaraki is already exhausted.

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
We can't let him
get more worn out.

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
There you are!

00:15:57.916 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
You're the jerk who crashed our
big fight and made us come here.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
What a crappy move!

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
Oh. So you made it to the tower?

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] What's with
the weird hair, Baldy?

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center
No, wait, I'll call
you Forehead.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
Sorry, that was rude.

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
Bubaigawara.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
I can double lots of things,

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
but it's much faster
to make more of me.

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
Because I know myself
better than anybody!

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
Beg for forgiveness

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:21.356 position:50% align:center
while you pee your
pants, Forehead!

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
That was quite a large
number of warriors

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:25.026 position:50% align:center
waiting for you downstairs.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.446 position:50% align:center
Your meta ability is wonderful,
just like Skeptic said.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
Listen up, you guys!

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.282 position:50% align:center
You're just copies
of my real comrades!

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
So even if you die,
you won't be gone forever!

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:34.911 position:50% align:center
No worries,

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
I'll dig beautiful graves
for each of you.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] Don't make a copy
of your leader just to kill him.

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Repeat after me!

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
"We're doubles, so even if
we die, we are not dead!"

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.546 position:50% align:center
That should make you feel
better about this fight.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:47.048 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you?
And who are these guys?

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] The weirdo there
is the Liberation Army boss.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
Uh-- Hey, are you able

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
to clone yourself now?

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Oh, right, I guess
I didn't catch you up

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.974 position:50% align:center
on the situation with my psyche.

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
I got over my trauma.

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
Wait, are you a clone, too?

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] What're you saying?
I'm the realist of the real.

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.023 position:50% align:center
No, I'm the original.

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
Shut your face!

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter,
I'll put my soul on the line

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
for everyone's sake!
Do you feel the same or what?

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Holy-- 

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
See? He was totally
a fake the whole time.

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
Pretty fragile clone.

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
Also, I'm fairly certain
you don't understand

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:20.957 position:50% align:center
what the term "hostage" means.

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
Did you see what he did?

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Don't ask me.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
Bubaigawara.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
If you make any more
copies, Giran is dead.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
He's not a formal member
of your group,

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
so I don't really want
to kill him, but I will.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.097 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
You did good, Twice.

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center
You made sure we outnumber him.
He's just one man.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
We've got the advantage!

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.397 position:50% align:center
Get Giran back and we can leave.

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
[TWICES]
Wait!

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
[VILLAINS gasp]

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:51.613 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI grunts]

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:58.161 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
Useless fodder.

00:17:58.244 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
It's ridiculous to think
that we're even

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
fighting in the same ring.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Giran.

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:07.170 position:50% align:center
--[TWICE] Giran!
--[GIRAN] Ow.

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
[TWICE gasps]
Your fingers.

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
They really took
them, didn't they?

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.218 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:17.013 position:50% align:center
And it's your right hand!
That's your smoking hand!

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. How could
they do such a thing?

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:21.226 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who
should apologize.

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
He got the info about
you guys from my files.

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
I'm a failure as a broker.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Don't you say that!

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
People who haven't
done anything wrong

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
should never have to apologize!

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
You're taking this so seriously.

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:38.243 position:50% align:center
As long as you have a goal
as an organization,

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
such excessive emotion
is unnecessary.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
Your little League
just can't compete.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] Sounds like
you have a noble dream.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center
Oh, still alive are you?

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
A noble dream, I like that.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
Heh. Perfect timing.
Let's test your might.

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
Once there was a young
woman who gave birth

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:07.063 position:50% align:center
to a child with a meta ability.

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
This was back when
people still had

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
strong prejudices against them,
when the world was in chaos,

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
a place of unending abuse
and unfettered discrimination.

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
She pleaded with society

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
on behalf of her
beloved offspring.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
After all, he couldn't be
blamed for how he was born.

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:27.792 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] "Please,"
she said, "make this a world

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:29.544 position:50% align:center
where my child
can live freely!"

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.714 position:50% align:center
But society looked
at her and laughed.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
She never spoke
out for him again,

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.343 position:50% align:center
and do you know why
that is, friend?

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:37.594 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
She was killed by those
who opposed meta powers.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.140 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you think I'm stupid?

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
She came up with
the term "Quirks."

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I heard you didn't
have any formal education.

00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:49.647 position:50% align:center
Anyway, as heroes and vigilantes

00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
became more popular,
the government

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
started trying to
reestablish order.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
They dug up her appeal while
working on the political reform.

00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
They adopted the term Quirks,
said they were natural.

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
It changed how people thought!

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:05.163 position:50% align:center
However! In actuality,

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
the political measures
that were implemented

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:09.959 position:50% align:center
suppressed meta abilities
more than ever!

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center
There's no point just changing
what they're called.

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:16.508 position:50% align:center
What they wanted to squash
was the use of powers.

00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
Some couldn't use their
powers as they wanted,

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.096 position:50% align:center
so it was freedom in name alone.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
But you know what
Destro thought?

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
"This isn't the future
my mother wanted.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
Meta abilities or Quirks--
we must use them freely." 

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
His mother?

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] It was an
inconvenient truth for society.

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center
Do you understand why Destro
was wanted for so many crimes?

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.991 position:50% align:center
He sought true freedom
through revolution!

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
And now... I will
accomplish Destro's dream!

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
His blood is in my veins.
I am his descendant.

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
This world will change at
the hands of Re-Destro!

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
You're just some thugs
with the urge to destroy.

00:20:56.506 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
How can you possibly stand
against our glorious dream?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.513 position:50% align:center
Heads up, Twice.

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna protect Giran,
you'll need a cushion.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
A cushion?

00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] I was caught on the
window with that first blast.

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
A good vantage point.
My eyes met his down below.

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
He's here. The tower's in reach.
I'd touch it if I were him.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
The thing about humans.

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
They're supposed to die
when they fall from up high.

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
So you must be
the liberation boss.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
I didn't get an answer
to my question.

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
Such a pity.

00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:31.119 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:34.456 position:50% align:center
The League of Villains has
shifted to counterattacking.

00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:36.207 position:50% align:center
In the middle of
fighting Re-Destro,

00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:38.084 position:50% align:center
leader of the
Meta Liberation Army,

00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:42.005 position:50% align:center
Shigaraki recalls a past
that he'd long forgotten.

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.174 position:50% align:center
What in Tenko Shimura's
tragic upbringing

00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:47.177 position:50% align:center
made him run toward destruction?

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.929 position:50% align:center
Next time, "Tenko
Shimura: Origin."

00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:52.682 position:50% align:center
Remember the feelings
that grew within you.

00:23:52.766 --> 00:23:55.894 position:50% align:center
Where did they come from?
What did they teach you?

00:23:55.977 --> 00:23:58.063 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
