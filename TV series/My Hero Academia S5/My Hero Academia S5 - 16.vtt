Hey, hey!

00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:47.399 position:50% align:center
Is there a reason you
wanted a new costume made?

Aw, well that's no fun.

Well, good job

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center

[NEWSCASTER 104A]
Now on to our next story.

00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:58.906 position:50% align:center
After a week of intense flames,

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.700 position:50% align:center
the large-scale wildfire
in the country of Kaflin

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
has finally started
showing signs of slowing.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:05.913 position:50% align:center
The fire is thought to be caused

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:07.873 position:50% align:center
by an explosion
at an illicit site

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
manufacturing the illegal
drug called "Trigger"...

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
"Trigger"?

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.879 position:50% align:center
I know what that is! Wanna hear?

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
A banned substance!

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:17.216 position:50% align:center
It's illegal because
bad people use it

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.301 position:50% align:center
to send their Quirks
into overdrive.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
She's right.

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:24.348 position:50% align:center
Apparently, it enhances your
power and makes you stronger.

00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:27.559 position:50% align:center
Just like previous boosters.

00:04:27.643 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
And trigger is circulating
throughout Japan.

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
So we've been looking for a way
to lower its distribution rates.

00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:34.274 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 104A]
We've heard rumors

00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
about the factory explosion.

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.362 position:50% align:center
There should have been
chemicals there that are used

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.531 position:50% align:center
to manufacture Trigger,
but no remnants

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:42.491 position:50% align:center
were found after the blast.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
It seems likely
that they were taken

00:04:44.076 --> 00:04:46.495 position:50% align:center
from the warehouse before
the fire started.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.497 position:50% align:center
That would have
big implications.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
Was the explosion used
to destroy evidence

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
and distract us?

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.627 position:50% align:center
[SIDEKICK 104A]
I'm not sure.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.213 position:50% align:center
Either way, none of this
has been confirmed.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.969 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE]
Hey, unidentified ship!

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
Stop immediately!

00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:06.098 position:50% align:center
These are Japan's
territorial seas!

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.559 position:50% align:center
You can't just sail through
someone else's waters!

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:09.977 position:50% align:center
I'll send you flying!

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
Captain.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.729 position:50% align:center
I believe you're just
provoking the ship.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:15.274 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, well, in that case.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:18.277 position:50% align:center
Um... Unidentified vessel.
Listen closely.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.904 position:50% align:center
If you don't stop...

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:22.281 position:50% align:center
...I'll be in trouble!

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:23.907 position:50% align:center
That is not a cute look.

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:26.285 position:50% align:center
And also, you know they
can't see you, right?

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.954 position:50% align:center
Captain. I've got eyes
on someone over there.

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.289 position:50% align:center

00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:47.973 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 32A]

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE]
There're decoys in the smoke.

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center

00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:53.937 position:50% align:center

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:55.439 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 32B]
Aye aye, sir!

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50% align:center
That injection he
gave himself before.

00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
Probably Trigger, wasn't it?

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
Yes. Based on their route,

00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
we think we're pretty sure
where they came from.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.866 position:50% align:center
There's a high probability

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.868 position:50% align:center
this ship originally
departed from Kaflin.

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:09.912 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE] So maybe the rumors
regarding the explosion

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:11.622 position:50% align:center
were true. They think chemicals

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.749 position:50% align:center
used to make the drug
were stolen, right?

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
[SIRIUS] And they could be
on that unidentified ship.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
Makes sense, huh?

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.170 position:50% align:center
'Fraid so.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.714 position:50% align:center
Somethin' smells fishy here.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.217 position:50% align:center
Captain, sir. We're approaching
open air shortly.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.766 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 32C] It's no good.
We've lost the ship.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.518 position:50% align:center
Not seeing anything
on radar, either.

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
Damn. So they know
how to escape a pro?

00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:38.315 position:50% align:center
Considering the path
the ship was taking earlier,

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
they might be hiding somewhere
in the Verize Islands.

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:43.237 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE]
That's a pain.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.073 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE]
That island chain is complex.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.033 position:50% align:center
If they're hopped up on Trigger,

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
we're gonna need reinforcements.

00:06:50.494 --> 00:06:52.496 position:50% align:center
We can't just
search from the sea.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.332 position:50% align:center
Things'd be much better
with eyes in the sky.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:59.503 position:50% align:center
Sirius. Time to
request a team-up.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:02.256 position:50% align:center
But who should we
try contacting?

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.883 position:50% align:center
Number ten on the
billboard chart.

00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:07.594 position:50% align:center

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.685 position:50% align:center

Selkie's in trouble?

00:07:16.562 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right!

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.482 position:50% align:center

Thanks for coming out here.

00:07:40.586 --> 00:07:42.963 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU] If the ship in question
is involved with Trigger,

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
we can't just let it slip away.

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center

help to you and your crew.

Ah! How are ya, Froppy?

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:01.899 position:50% align:center

Yep. Thanks again
for taking care of me

during my internship.

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:14.369 position:50% align:center
[SIRIUS] The captain is relying
on us to follow his orders.

00:08:14.453 --> 00:08:19.166 position:50% align:center
If we believe in him, then we
trust in his course of action.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
Do you have faith, Froppy?
In the captain and in us?

00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:26.215 position:50% align:center
I haven't forgotten
your lessons.

00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
You and Sirius taught me
important concepts

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:30.260 position:50% align:center
every hero should know.

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:32.554 position:50% align:center
You've certainly grown up.

00:08:32.638 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
Seeing you... I feel...

00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
...so moved!

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:38.769 position:50% align:center

[TSUYU]
Ribbit!

00:08:52.616 --> 00:08:55.327 position:50% align:center
Enough. Fun as
this reunion's been,

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
I need you ladies
down on the beach.

[ALL laughing]

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.218 position:50% align:center
This is the best way
to recharge your batteries.

--[TSUYU] Over here!
--[OCHACO] Coming!

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.263 position:50% align:center
What are you planning?

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.014 position:50% align:center
Let them have fun.

00:09:16.098 --> 00:09:18.392 position:50% align:center
The Trigger ship won't
move until nightfall.

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.227 position:50% align:center
They're a stealthy bunch.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE] No point in putting
these girls on edge

00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
until they need to be.

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:27.401 position:50% align:center
Here!

00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:55.888 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE] I'm glad they seem
to be enjoying themselves.

00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:57.848 position:50% align:center
It's so peaceful out here.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.393 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU] I see.
So that's what this is.

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:03.187 position:50% align:center
Our jobs can be trying.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.105 position:50% align:center
Constantly forced
to confront evil.

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:07.316 position:50% align:center
Seeing the very worst in people.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.734 position:50% align:center
And today,

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:11.278 position:50% align:center
you wanted my team
to experience peace.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:14.156 position:50% align:center
So they'd be driven
to protect it.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.283 position:50% align:center
I should have guessed as much.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.911 position:50% align:center
This should put them
in the right mind.

00:10:18.994 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
That way they can
show the villains

00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:22.206 position:50% align:center
what they're really made of.

00:10:28.587 --> 00:10:29.755 position:50% align:center
[MAN 104A]
Dammit.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:32.466 position:50% align:center
The heroes and coast guard
are on high alert.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:33.675 position:50% align:center
Whaddaya think?

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:35.636 position:50% align:center
Do we give the client
a heads up yet?

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.596 position:50% align:center
[MAN 104A]
No. We should assume all

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:40.516 position:50% align:center
our communications are somehow
being monitored at this point.

00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:42.309 position:50% align:center
Possibly even by satellite tech.

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:43.477 position:50% align:center
[MAN 104B]
You're saying our only choice

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.604 position:50% align:center
is to keep following the plan?

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
Yeah, exactly.

00:10:46.939 --> 00:10:48.774 position:50% align:center
We'll make our move
after it gets dark.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:51.902 position:50% align:center
Just make sure you
have some Trigger ready.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
If we end up cornered,

00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
this is how we
take down the pros.

00:11:09.962 --> 00:11:12.673 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU] Nejire- <i>Chan</i> and I
will search from the sky.

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:16.552 position:50% align:center
Selkie, Uravity and Froppy
will stick with you.

00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:19.680 position:50% align:center
Prepare to set sail!

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
[CREW]
Aye-aye, sir!

[SUBORDINATE 32A]

00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:37.531 position:50% align:center
Right, then. <i>Oki Mariner</i> ,
let's head out!

00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:51.295 position:50% align:center
Time for us to get going.
Are you ready?

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
[HADO]
Yep!

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.428 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Dragoon Hero: Ryukyu!

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:00.971 position:50% align:center
Quirk: Dragon.

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.557 position:50% align:center
Honestly, the name pretty
much speaks for itself.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
Those massive wings allow her
to fly in her Dragon form.

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:08.979 position:50% align:center
Is that metal or what?

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.526 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Hero: Nejire-Chan.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center
Quirk: Surge.

00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
She converts her life force
into powerful shock-waves.

00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:23.452 position:50% align:center
By controlling that spiraling
energy, she can fly, too!

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
You've got this, Number Ten!

Quirk: Spotted Seal.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
He can do pretty much
anything a spotted seal can.

00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
That includes diving up to
1,500 meters underwater.

00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
He can also make sonar-like
sounds and use the echoes

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:57.361 position:50% align:center
to determine the location
of his opponent.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:09.373 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 32C] Reef up ahead.
Everything looks normal to me!

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.375 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 32A] No change
in the temperature sensor!

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
Then let's set our course
to the next point.

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:23.262 position:50% align:center
Please direct me
to the next location.

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:26.515 position:50% align:center
[SIRIUS] Got it. In that case,
head to Point 4-3.

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:40.070 position:50% align:center

get this done fast.

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.637 position:50% align:center
Uh... uh-oh.

00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
Not good. Can I fly this?

00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
Here goes!

00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:25.606 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:18:27.983 --> 00:18:30.944 position:50% align:center
No, what's happening?
I'm falling!

00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:39.161 position:50% align:center
Uravity! Pull back on the yoke!

00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
The plane! The engines
must be stalling on her!

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.253 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU] Ochaco, get out!
You're gonna crash!

00:18:48.337 --> 00:18:49.630 position:50% align:center
No, I can't.

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.882 position:50% align:center
If this seaplane
goes down out here,

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
then its cargo will
leak into the ocean.

00:18:54.343 --> 00:18:55.886 position:50% align:center
With these chemicals on board,

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:59.056 position:50% align:center
the whole ecosystem will
be ruined for decades!

00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:03.810 position:50% align:center
Concentrate. Uravity, make
the seaplane weightless.

00:19:03.894 --> 00:19:05.896 position:50% align:center
--Quick!
--[OCHACO] What? But I can't!

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
You want me to float
an entire plane?

00:19:07.898 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
Something this huge would
be basically impossible!

00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:11.693 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU]
Are you giving up?

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
No. Of course not.

00:19:20.244 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
Help steer her!

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.246 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:19:28.794 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
Full charge output.
Release at 90!

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
Nejire Wave!

00:19:45.227 --> 00:19:47.271 position:50% align:center
This is your chance! Do it now!

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:51.692 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
I'm not...

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:53.902 position:50% align:center
...giving up!

00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:13.255 position:50% align:center
Hey, hey! We did it!

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:17.134 position:50% align:center
The plane's fine!
Ryukyu's on it!

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.887 position:50% align:center
Uravity's a little
green in the gills.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ryukyu said
she got the cargo.

00:20:22.181 --> 00:20:25.851 position:50% align:center
We were right about it being
chemicals used to make Trigger.

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.312 position:50% align:center
Doesn't this mean
the mission's complete?

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.439 position:50% align:center
Yeah, look at us go!

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE] Based on lengthy
police questioning,

00:20:42.201 --> 00:20:45.329 position:50% align:center
it seems the smugglers
were just couriers.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:48.332 position:50% align:center
They hadn't heard anything about
where the drugs would end up.

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.626 position:50% align:center
The person who ordered
their transport also gave them

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:53.754 position:50% align:center
a fake name, so we don't
have much to go on.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.756 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU]
I see.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.383 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE] There was one thing
that we managed to nail down.

00:20:58.467 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
The smugglers that
we intercepted.

00:21:00.511 --> 00:21:02.179 position:50% align:center
They were heading for Otheon.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:06.058 position:50% align:center
Did you say Otheon?
You mean the country in Europe?

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:07.935 position:50% align:center
I don't know what they
were planning on doing

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:09.144 position:50% align:center
once they got there.

00:21:09.228 --> 00:21:11.355 position:50% align:center
But, that's no longer
an issue, is it?

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
I guess all's whale...

00:21:13.524 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
...that end's whale.

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:17.986 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU]
It's not a cute bit.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.490 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE] Yeah, I've come
to realize that recently.

00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:23.617 position:50% align:center
Well, no matter.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.333 position:50% align:center
[SELKIE] Peaceful days
pass all too quickly.

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:33.460 position:50% align:center
Let's enjoy this while we can.

00:23:06.637 --> 00:23:07.679 position:50% align:center
[FLECT]
Ah.

00:23:07.763 --> 00:23:10.682 position:50% align:center
So heroes interfered
with our shipment.

00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:13.143 position:50% align:center
[MEMBER 104A] Yes, sir.
What would you have us do?

00:23:13.227 --> 00:23:14.561 position:50% align:center
[FLECT]
Forget about it.

00:23:14.645 --> 00:23:18.065 position:50% align:center
We already have the amount
we need to enact the plan.

00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:22.528 position:50% align:center
Now then. It's time
for us to begin.

00:23:22.611 --> 00:23:25.489 position:50% align:center
Humanity will soon
know salvation.

00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:31.954 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:34.581 position:50% align:center
Those of us doing our work
studies at Endeavor's agency

00:23:34.665 --> 00:23:38.001 position:50% align:center
have each been tackling
our own weaknesses.

00:23:38.085 --> 00:23:40.003 position:50% align:center
And every time we see
Endeavor at work,

00:23:40.087 --> 00:23:43.006 position:50% align:center
we find new ways
we should be improving.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.258 position:50% align:center
In the midst of all that,

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:47.678 position:50% align:center
Endeavor actually
invites us to his home.

00:23:47.761 --> 00:23:50.848 position:50% align:center
Next time: "The Hellish
Todoroki Family."

00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:54.434 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! Todoroki has an
older sister and brother?

00:23:54.518 --> 00:23:56.812 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
