[ALL FOR ONE]
Dear, foolish little brother.

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:35.618 position:50% align:center
Why do you resist me?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That voice!

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.788 position:50% align:center
I'll never forget it.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
All For One!

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE] I will give
you everything you want

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
if you agree to join me.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.592 position:50% align:center
You have my word.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center
Choice to those without power.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.889 position:50% align:center
Mercy to those who have sinned.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE]
You've stopped eating again.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.728 position:50% align:center
You're disintegrating
into nothing.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.856 position:50% align:center
[ONE FOR ALL coughs]
Brother.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
I refuse to become the man
you want me to be.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.404 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.326 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE] Reality doesn't
follow stock plots.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:19.496 position:50% align:center
I believe it's time you
finally bend to my cause.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.290 position:50% align:center
I'll rewrite your story as well.

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.542 position:50% align:center
Because you are dear
to me, brother.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center
Let me go!

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.213 position:50% align:center
I've found a meta power for you.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
Even your pathetic body
can utilize it.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.926 position:50% align:center
You will join me.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:35.053 position:50% align:center
Please, brother!

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.435 position:50% align:center
[ONE FOR ALL]
You're the ninth wielder, right?

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:44.521 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I wanted
to show you more,

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:48.274 position:50% align:center
but you're barely using
20 percent of the power yet.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:49.859 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.404 position:50% align:center
We're long past
the singularity point.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.452 position:50% align:center
[ONE FOR ALL]
Don't be afraid.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.121 position:50% align:center
You are not alone.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:16.511 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU panting]

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] After that dream,
I couldn't go back to sleep.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
Midoriya. What was that sound?

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.623 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Oh, yeah, nothing to see here!

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
Everything is, uh,
fine! I promise!

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
<i>Mon Dieu</i>, why such a ruckus?

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:16.965 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you haven't
had enough cheese.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That's probably it.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
Sorry for waking you up.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Even though it was a dream,

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
I remember it vividly.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center
The moment our hands touched,

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
it was over.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
In that last instant,

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:40.113 position:50% align:center
I saw the predecessors
reaching out to me.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU panting]

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
You witnessed the
memories of the original?

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
I did. It was scary.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50% align:center
Mostly because All For One
was a part of the dream, too.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] You've seen them, right?
When you were younger?

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
You saw the spirits of those
who wielded our Quirk?

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Yeah. I saw them.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
I learned from my master--
my predecessor, that is--

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
about the existence of vestiges.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
That's why I even know
how the power functions.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
I witnessed its history.

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
The memory stopped
after the first wielder

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
was given the Quirk.
Then he spoke to me.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
About how I'm only
using 20 percent.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50% align:center
And something he called
the singularity.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.802 position:50% align:center
He was looking right at me.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Hm?

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
When I first saw them
during the sports festival,

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
you said they were like ghosts
that didn't have intentions.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
But I think they wanted
something from me.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
He spoke with the first wielder.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
I didn't experience it
like you did.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
And you know everything
my master told me.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
Based on what I know,

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
this phenomenon has
only happened to you.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Nah, what you
saw wasn't a dream.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
It was the vestiges.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.504 position:50% align:center
But, Master,
what does that mean?

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
Do you know?

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
One For All has had many users.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:26.553 position:50% align:center
And now they're
stored within it.

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
They each had their
own goals in life.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
Heroes that they
wanted to become.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50% align:center
Feelings are what
fuel power, Toshinori.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
That's just the way
the world works.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
The emotions of those
who cultivated One For All

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50% align:center
are woven into
the ability itself.

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:47.323 position:50% align:center
At least, that's what I think.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Sounds like
something out of the occult.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.579 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
More like hopeful thinking.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
If the battle for justice
leads to my death,

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center
maybe we'll meet each other
again inside of One For All.

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Like I said, hopeful.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
All Might. You still with me?

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU yelps]

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT coughs]
So, you accidentally

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
powered up and that
woke you. Were you hurt?

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
No, I'm good.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.772 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
I'm happy to hear that.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
I wish I had more answers,
but right now, the only thing

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50% align:center
I can say is that I don't know
what happened to you last night.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
And what about
this "singularity"?

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.283 position:50% align:center
There's a rumor about
something like that.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center
The Quirk singularity
doomsday theory or whatever?

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
Quirks mix and evolve
as they're passed down

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.457 position:50% align:center
through generations.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
Kids end up a combination
of their parents.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
The theory goes that this
will lead to stronger,

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
more complex powers someday.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
Extraordinary abilities that
nobody will be able to control.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
Which makes some sense.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.972 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] It's still unclear
if you were the cause

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
of this event or if something
external was at play.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.603 position:50% align:center
Do you remember anything else?

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
The smallest detail
could be helpful.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
Uh, let me think.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.944 position:50% align:center
There were two figures
I couldn't make out.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:09.698 position:50% align:center
Oh, and you were kind
of a glow-y blur.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's 'cause you're
still relatively new?

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
And alive? You think
that's how it works?

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Sorry, kid.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
But your guess is as
good as mine in this.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
What's important is
that you remember

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
One For All is your ally.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
We'll keep investigating
this together.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
Right, so we just do our best.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
Oh! One more thing;
it's about your old master.

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:32.554 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
You know,

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.764 position:50% align:center
she reminds me
of my predecessor.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
She does? Wait, how so?

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
It's the hairstyle.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.770 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
O-Oh, sure.

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.397 position:50% align:center
She was so beautiful!

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
You've got practical
training this afternoon.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
Better go or you'll be late.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Good call!

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
I'll be watching today, too.

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
It sounds like a riot.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
In a good way, or...?

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.537 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Of course. You two.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
You look like you're thick
as thieves, per usual.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT gasps]
Aizawa! It's nothing.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.336 position:50% align:center
No special treatment
or funny business.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
It's not like I caught you
doing something inappropriate.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
Calm down.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
You didn't have to
put it that way.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.054 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Hey! Shinso!

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.764 position:50% align:center
Were you hanging out
with Mr. Aizawa?

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
I hope you're learning
a lot from him!

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
Oh, I am.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Midoriya, you
should start warming up.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
It's going to be a busy day.

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yes, sir!

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] I can't believe
we're already back at it!

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50% align:center
Aren't you excited?

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
Don't you get cold
like that, Hagakure?

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE laughs]
Yeah, I'm freezing.

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
But ya got guts.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
Clock my winter outfit.
Isn't it, like, super cute?

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
It's lovely!

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:46.378 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize
that the temperature

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
had dropped so much.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.089 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Everyone's costumes have changed

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.548 position:50% align:center
since we started school,
haven't they?

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.258 position:50% align:center
They've adapted just as we have!

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
You're a champ.

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you lasted through
the summer in all that gear.

00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Kacchan's is different, too!

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
If you've got something to say,
then say it to my face, nerd!

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
While I'm blasting yours!

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
How does it work?

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
Do the gauntlets come equipped
with a heat generator?

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
Since your sweat glands
are used as weapons,

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
it's a really smart modification
to combat the cold,

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.194 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed!

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
Stop praising my suit!

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
Yours may have changed the most
out of everyone's, Midoirya.

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50% align:center
How much new stuff
do you have on?

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50% align:center
I had to upgrade because
I learned some new moves.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
The gloves are definitely
gonna come in handy.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
Actually, these are
the 2.0 versions.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
Hatsume made adjustments
to the original design

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
that made them even stronger.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
She's incredibly talented!

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:32.173 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO gasps]

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Bad thoughts!

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Look who we have here.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
Relaxed and full of
yourselves, as always.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
Obviously you underestimate us.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
There you are!

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:49.441 position:50% align:center
We've been lookin'
forward to this.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] Ha! Is that so?
I'm not sure why.

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
There's no way
you stand a chance

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.698 position:50% align:center
against us in this exercise.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.367 position:50% align:center
Come on, Class A!

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
Let's see who's best
once and for all!

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] Hero course,
Class 1-B: Yosetsu Awase.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
Itsuka Kendo. Yui Kodai.

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
Kinoko Komori. Ibara Shiozaki.

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:23.892 position:50% align:center
Jurota Shishida.

Kojiro Bondo. Neito Monoma.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
Reiko Yanagi. Hiryu Rin.

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
You might wanna take
a closer look at this survey.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
I took it at the festival
and it's enlightening!

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
I asked what was better:

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
Class A's pathetic attempt
at being rock stars,

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
or Class B's obviously
superior play!

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
Aw, what's this?
We won by two votes?

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:57.842 position:50% align:center
You guys have been
hogging the spotlight

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.094 position:50% align:center
ever since we started school,

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
but your standing around
campus is trash!

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
Did we somehow blow it
at the festival, you think?

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
Now, finally! It's Class A
versus Class B!

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
Our first joint combat
training! You're finish--!

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
That's enough.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
Strangle hold!

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:16.736 position:50% align:center
Today, there will be
a special participant.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
Please try not to
embarrass yourselves

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center
if at all possible.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
Who's going to be joining us?

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.200 position:50% align:center
I'll murder 'em!

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
Is it a babe?

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] We'll do our best,
whoever it is!

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
This person is interested

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center
in switching to the Hero track.

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
From General Studies Class C,

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
Hitoshi Shinso.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU, OJIRO]
Oh, ho-ho!

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Shinso will be
joining in on your training.

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
He's hoping to be one
of you, so treat him

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.606 position:50% align:center
as you would any classmate.

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
He mentioned that before
the sports festival!

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.279 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI] Uh. Is that one of
Mr. Aizawa's capture scarves?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
[KOMORI]
The mask looks special, too.

00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:02.657 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
Welcome to the fight!

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
You'll be brainwashed if
you talk to him, <i>mes amis</i>.

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center
A powerful quirk.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
Wait, one sec.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
Midoriya got brainwashed once,
but he snapped out of it.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:18.381 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that was honestly
kind of an accident, though.

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:22.719 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Come to think of it, the
first time I saw the vestiges

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50% align:center
of One For All was when
I was under Shinso's control.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Was the timing coincidental,

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
or was there a reason?

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
Well, Shinso, why don't
you say a few words?

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
[BOY STUDENT 20A]
Oh! Your Quirk is brainwashing?

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
That's so cool!

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
Imagine all the cool stuff

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.159 position:50% align:center
you could do
controlling people.

00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you can do any
bad thing you want.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
And no one would ever
know it was you.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
Just promise you won't
make us your slaves, okay?

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Heh. Everyone says that.

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
I'm Hitoshi Shinso.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center
I already faced some
of you as opponents

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.804 position:50% align:center
during the sports festival.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
But we're not friends just
because we've fought before.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.643 position:50% align:center
I don't subscribe to that
sort of sportsmanship.

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:14.020 position:50% align:center
We're still competing
to be the best.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.815 position:50% align:center
And I'm already
countless steps behind.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.359 position:50% align:center
I need to prove myself.

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO] But someone as blessed
as you wouldn't understand that.

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:24.364 position:50% align:center
You're lucky enough
to have a heroic Quirk!

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
It'll be so easy for you
to reach your goal!

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
One day, I will become
a proper hero.

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
Then I can use my powers
to help citizens in need.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:37.585 position:50% align:center
All of you are hurdles
I must overcome.

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
I'm not here in
search of friends.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.091 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Thanks for having me.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.596 position:50% align:center
Whoa. He's so serious.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
Be on guard.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
[SERO] He's taken intensity
lessons from you, 'Roki.

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
Wait, you think so?

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:55.353 position:50% align:center
--[SERO] Oh, yeah.
--I like this guy.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't we be getting
on with this, Vlad?

00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:59.774 position:50% align:center
Time for combat training!

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.109 position:50% align:center
This will be a battle between

00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
Class A and Class B, here,
in one corner of Field Gamma!

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:08.116 position:50% align:center
You will be grouped
in teams of four.

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:10.201 position:50% align:center
Each competing one at a time.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
That sounds like fun.
Hope it's a good mix.

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.205 position:50% align:center
Me, too!

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
With Shinso, that makes
41 competitors.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:20.086 position:50% align:center
So won't it be impossible
to divide the teams equally?

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
Which is why he'll be
participating in two matches.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
One time with us,
and one time with Class A.

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
In other words,
two of the five matches

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
will be five-against-four.
Prepare yourselves.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] That's super unfair
for the smaller team!

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] It's probably
more of a disadvantage

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.854 position:50% align:center
to have the inexperienced
Shinso on your side.

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
The larger teams will have
the advantage in numbers,

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
but also a handicap.

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.277 position:50% align:center
Listen closely to the scenario.

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
You're all hero agencies
trying to capture

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:48.031 position:50% align:center
a villainous organization.

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:51.117 position:50% align:center
You should consider your
opponents to be evil criminals!

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
You'll win if you
capture four competitors.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.539 position:50% align:center
They do say villains are
organizing more these days.

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
Keepin' it nice and simple.

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] Aw! We're heroes,
but we're villains

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
to the opposing team?

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
I've lost this sort
of roleplay before!

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
This does go against
your nature.

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:08.093 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] In your team's
base camp you'll find

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
an adorably decorated prison.

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:12.180 position:50% align:center
Once you put your
enemies behind bars,

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
that will count as a capture.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Who designed that thing?

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
It would be most efficient
to try and disarm

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
our opponents and capture
them near their own bases.

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:23.858 position:50% align:center
But I doubt it will be that easy
when we get down to it.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
So we gotta capture four losers.

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
Is that what you meant when
you said "disadvantage"?

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.072 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:31.241 position:50% align:center
Well, your team
might not be used

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
to fighting together,
and if four people

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
on one of the five-person
teams are captured,

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.996 position:50% align:center
that will be considered a loss.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
You're making us haul
around excess baggage?

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
That's some bullcrap.

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:43.128 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, don't
be mean about it!

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
It's fine. He makes
a fair point.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.256 position:50% align:center
Aw, your understanding

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
just makes us look
like a bunch of jerks!

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Now.

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.344 position:50% align:center
Draw your lots.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Your turn, Shinso.

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
You'll join one team
from each class.

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center
Let's have some fun
out there, man!

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
This is gonna be awesome!

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
Get pumped!

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.752 position:50% align:center
Tell us more details
about your Quirk.

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:25.754 position:50% align:center
I bet girls kinda
dig that smirk.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center
You rake 'em in, huh?

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Let's win.

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
You're a perfect addition!

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.760 position:50% align:center
Let's destroy the
always-in-danger Class A

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
and humiliate them!

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
Take a lesson from us
and tune him out

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
as much as you can.

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Lookin' forward to it.

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Yeah!

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
Let's annihilate
these egomaniacs!

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Class B, team five.

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
It'll be you and
Shinso's first rematch

00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
since the sports festival, huh?

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Mm-hm.

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I still have questions
about the vestiges

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
of One For All. But right now...

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see
how he fights!

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
I wonder what new
abilities he learned.

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
Where were you keeping that?

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
I finally reached it.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.085 position:50% align:center
My starting line.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] Teams will
begin at your base camp.

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
You'll have 20 minutes.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] If there's no decisive
victory within the time limit,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
then whoever has the most people
left will be the winners.

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
Oh! All Might and Midnight
are here together.

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:20.100 position:50% align:center
Z'it a date?

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
Stop that. Older men
aren't my thing.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center
Which class would you
put the odds on?

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.856 position:50% align:center
I couldn't really say.

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
Class A has definitely
gotten stronger

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
after overcoming so
many different crises.

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
But the thing is...

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:33.905 position:50% align:center
...if you look at their grades,

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.700 position:50% align:center
Class B has actually improved
more than they have.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
It's probably because they were
able to cover the curriculum

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
since they didn't run
into outside trouble.

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
They've been getting
better at a steady rate.

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
Class A has turned
disasters into strength,

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
while Class B has taken
a more traditional approach

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
to their studies.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
This'll be good.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.592 position:50% align:center
Fighters take your marks!

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
You're really into this.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
And... start!

00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
We have a pretty good idea

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.398 position:50% align:center
of the other team's
different abilities,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.275 position:50% align:center
but let's try to
stick close together.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
There's safety in
numbers, after all.

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Asui's Camouflage.

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
If you know where to look,
you can still see her.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] Heard, but don't you
think I could just separate

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:22.662 position:50% align:center
from you guys and let off
a million volts or something?

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
Yeah but what if they
knock you out

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
with a sneak attack? No backup.

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center
That is true. And Shiozaki'll
be tough to nab.

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.176 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Her Quirk's amazing.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:39.304 position:50% align:center
She kicked my butt.
I'll stick with you.

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
I'd like to take out

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
the most troublesome
Quirk first.

00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
My dude, Shinso, you get it.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
It's the obvious plan.

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:50.857 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU] If we're hoping to do
something about Ibara first,

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
then they're probably
thinking the same thing

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
about Kaminari and
his dangerous attacks.

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:58.782 position:50% align:center
Also, even though he
has less experience,

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:01.701 position:50% align:center
they'll want to avoid
Shinso's Quirk.

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you guys
to keep me safe!

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
Maybe we can set things up
so Kaminari and Shinso

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:07.957 position:50% align:center
get to do their things.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center
[PIGEON 91A coos]

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
[KODA]
Thank you, friends.

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
So... Did they find her?

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
[KODA]
Shiozaki is to our left!

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:19.969 position:50% align:center
Alone! She's using
her vines to feel out

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:22.180 position:50% align:center
her surroundings
as she heads this way.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
I hate to go after
the girl all alone,

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.183 position:50% align:center
but we gotta stop her, right?

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Uh--

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.313 position:50% align:center
Meet my Roaring Rage!

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Ribbit!

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
Both of them? That's not good!

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
We knew you guys
would send Koda

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:38.613 position:50% align:center
to search for us.

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center
And we planned accordingly.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:41.991 position:50% align:center
Also that you would likely

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
be most wary of
Shiozaki's Quirk!

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
Using her as a decoy, I crawled
through the shadows to find you.

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:49.874 position:50% align:center
If we let your team prepare,

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
then you might have
been able to unleash

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
a devastating shock attack,

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center
so we opted for
a direct approach.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.800 position:50% align:center
I sniffed you out with
my acute sense of smell!

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:03.888 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Jurota Shishida. Quirk: Beast.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.641 position:50% align:center
This feral mode drastically
increases his strength,

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
hearing, sight, and ability
to sniff things out!

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:12.063 position:50% align:center
It also causes him to go
a little berserk, though.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
[TSUBARABA]
You can't use much electricity

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
with your friends
around, can you?

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
You don't wanna shock 'em.

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center
[TSUBARABA] I've trained
my Quirk and got a new move.

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
Air Prison!

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:29.039 position:50% align:center
A solitary cell that
won't allow any sound in!

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.790 position:50% align:center
[TSUBARABA]
Take them down, Shishida!

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIDA]
Consider this our win already.

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
The monster's gonna murder me!

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
Wait, did you get brainwashed?

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
It sounded like Shinso somehow
talked with my voice.

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:50.060 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait,
what is that mask?

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:51.853 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Vocal Modulator.

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:53.688 position:50% align:center
Persona Cords!

00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:31.494 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.536 --> 00:23:34.456 position:50% align:center
The first match of the battle
between Class A and Class B

00:23:34.497 --> 00:23:37.334 position:50% align:center
continues to rage!

00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:39.669 position:50% align:center
Despite everything we've
been through, it looks like

00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:42.088 position:50% align:center
the powerhouses from B have
improved their Quirks a ton

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.467 position:50% align:center
since we last fought and
have my classmates cornered!

00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:48.178 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Make It
Happen, Shinso!"

00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:50.305 position:50% align:center
Shinso's new device,
Persona Cords,

00:23:50.347 --> 00:23:53.933 position:50% align:center
will control the direction
and outcome of this fight!

00:23:53.975 --> 00:23:56.478 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
