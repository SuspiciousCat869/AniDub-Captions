00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:13.054 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI] From this moment,
the Liberation Army

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center
recognizes Tomura Shigaraki
as grand commander.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.520 position:50% align:center
Now, we'll do what we want.

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:22.731 position:50% align:center
[LIBERATION ARMY]
Yeah!

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I'm too late!
No wonder he let me come in.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] What happened in Deika?
It was you guys, right?

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
[DABI] If only someone had
been strong enough to stop

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
the League sooner, those poor
citizens might not've died.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
[DABI] I'm not sold
that this is actually him.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.795 position:50% align:center
But you did kill somebody.
How heroic.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] They've got an army of
soldiers united under one cause.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.682 position:50% align:center
Feel Good Inc. has
near ubiquitous control

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
over communication networks.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.855 position:50% align:center
Detnerat is a big player
in the hero industry.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.399 position:50% align:center
And there are likely other
High End Nomus around

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
waiting to be unleashed.
There's little they couldn't do.

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:17.410 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] This superhuman society
may be overflowing with heroes,

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.746 position:50% align:center
but Shigaraki has
gathered so much power

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.332 position:50% align:center
that it might be
impossible to stop him.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:27.837 position:50% align:center
Long live the liberation!

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
Wow! It's really you!

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.384 position:50% align:center
[DABI]
Hey. You look happy, Number Two.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:33.593 position:50% align:center
Up to somethin'?

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:36.721 position:50% align:center
Naw, man. I was just
waitin' for you.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.014 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Can't move yet.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.558 position:50% align:center
There's still a backer
behind the scenes.

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:42.811 position:50% align:center
I need to get the full
picture and alert Endeavor

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:45.980 position:50% align:center
and the others before
things are too far gone.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.857 position:50% align:center
Come on, Hawks.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.361 position:50% align:center
If you're too slow,
it'll be the end of Japan.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:59.786 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Your Quirk blossomed
in the Deika City fight.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.914 position:50% align:center
Now, you can obliterate
not only something you touch,

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.792 position:50% align:center
but also whatever
is connected to it.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.462 position:50% align:center
You have become the
embodiment of destruction.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:14.175 position:50% align:center
So I must ask: why do you
still seek more power?

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.927 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
If more strength is available,

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.929 position:50% align:center
why wouldn't I take it?

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:19.431 position:50% align:center
It's true that I'm no longer

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:24.561 position:50% align:center
forced to use cheap tricks.
But look, my arm is ravaged.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center
This is from using
my ability once.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.150 position:50% align:center
And there's a whole war coming.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.194 position:50% align:center
I won't underestimate
heroes anymore.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.739 position:50% align:center
I'll use all the power
I can get to destroy

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:39.951 position:50% align:center
All Might and his legacy.
Our next fight's his last.

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:43.747 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Hah. Using your talents
to make your enemy miserable.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.125 position:50% align:center
Like master like
student I suppose.

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
I was originally
conducting this research

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50% align:center
for All For One, but you'll
benefit from it quite nicely.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.467 position:50% align:center
Over the generations,
Quirks have merged

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.803 position:50% align:center
and formed more complex
and ambiguous abilities.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:01.973 position:50% align:center
Many manifestations
are unwieldly.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.768 position:50% align:center
Though our minds are
adaptable and expansive,

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.603 position:50% align:center
our hardware can't
evolve fast enough

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.105 position:50% align:center
to keep up with such power.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.733 position:50% align:center
I have observed this
progression and I call it

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:14.319 position:50% align:center
"The Quirk singularity."

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
No one took my
research seriously,

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50% align:center
except All For One, of course.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.952 position:50% align:center
If our bodies can't
harness memory and power,

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.914 position:50% align:center
humanity will become unstable.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
Signs of this began
showing up as early

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
as the fourth Quirk generation.

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:33.421 position:50% align:center
All For One recognized that
the problem with capacity

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
was a serious one which
needed to be remedied.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
How long will this take, Doc?

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Aww. You're like a kid
waiting for Christmas morning!

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Can you blame me?

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.894 position:50% align:center
I'm overflowing with
beautiful dreams.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR chuckles]
For the next four months,

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:55.193 position:50% align:center
your life will be one
of hellish agony.

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
When you come out on the
other side, if you survive,

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
the world will be in
the palm of your hand.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
Even One For All.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
One For All?

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR] Of the many designs
your master had for this world,

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
that power was the only one that
didn't end up going to plan.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.130 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
[ROBOT 113A]
We are the Skynet of this world.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.649 position:50% align:center
Humans, you are terminated.

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
Navel Saber!

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
A new move!
Lucky! I want a sword!

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Woohoo! Let's do this, Aoyama!

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
[SERO]
The beam curved!

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.043 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Aw, yeah, that's the stuff.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] I learned to take
light and bend it to my will!

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
[ROBOT 113B]
Tremble before us!

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
This shall be known
as Judgment Day!

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Max viscosity! Acidman!

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
[ROBOT 113B]
Humans are scary.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.020 position:50% align:center
And that's a wrap!

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.646 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
We killed it!

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
Wonderful job!
Your work studies paid off.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
It's obvious you learned a lot
from Equipped Hero: Yoroi Musha.

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] He had lots
of advice for supercharging

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center
our offense and defense,
so we figured out

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
new attacks and
combos to keep up.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.289 position:50% align:center
Wanna know a secret
about "Acidman"?

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
I got the idea from
your Unbreakable!

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
Nice!

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.465 position:50% align:center
They have obviously improved.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
Now show me what the
rest of you have learned!

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Got it!

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center

You don't look back at me

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
I used condensed shots.
Winter's crap!

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Wow, Todoroki.

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
You're hotter,
cooler, and faster.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
I'm still not able to catch up
to Endeavor, though.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
Looks like you can use
that dark energy stuff now.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm sorry
it was a pain earlier.

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
It's all good.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
For real, man.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
Get any better and you're
gonna make my Quirk obsolete.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
Uraraka!

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Hm?

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
I was able to gain
control of Blackwhip.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
You helped me so much.
Thank you!

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:56.698 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Oh, please,
that's ancient history. 'Kay?

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
Plus, look.
Seeing you inspired me

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
to have these wires
put in my costume.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:02.954 position:50% align:center
They're nothing compared
to something like

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.998 position:50% align:center
Sero and his tape.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
Still, I made that experience
something useful.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.587 position:50% align:center
And I think both of us are
better because of it!

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] True, I didn't think
twice about butting in.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:18.303 position:50% align:center
Maybe that means I need
to be calmer when fighting?

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I agree.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
What are you thinking?

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] I could go for
something easy to digest.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:29.689 position:50% align:center
Udon?

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
Given the work studies,

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
the safety commission
must know something.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Yup.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
If we find out who's
manufacturing Nomu...

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
Then what?

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50% align:center
I'll have a surprise
karaoke contest with them.

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
Then boil their guts
while their eardrums bleed.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
And you?

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
--[AIZAWA] Well...
--[TOGATA] Mr. Aizawa!

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
Sorry to bother ya
during your break.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center
Eraserhead, it's about Eri.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center
[door clicks]

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
[HADO]
Thank goodness!

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
It's my horn. Why's it itch?

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:16.444 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Don't worry.
You're in excellent hands at UA.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Congrats on Blackwhip.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.703 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] And excellent work
from you, too, Young Bakugo.

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
There seems to be no
limit to your potential.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
Obviously.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
I couldn't figure
everything out.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50% align:center
But you have to
keep moving forward.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
The next step is yours.

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Read closely.
I collected as many details

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
about One For All's
successors as possible.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I couldn't
find so much as a whisper

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
about the second or third users.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:12:59.946 position:50% align:center
Given the times that
they lived through

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
and the nature of the ability,

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:04.868 position:50% align:center
the official records aren't
going to be helpful to us.

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
I'm also not sure what
they knew about the power.

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
If they realized how it worked,

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
I assumed they'd want
to help out future wielders?

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
Who cares about a bunch
of dead old heroes?

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
I'm tired of wasting my time

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
waiting for you guys
to figure stuff out.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
When it comes to Blackwhip,

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50% align:center
I can only maintain the power
for about one second so far.

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
I haven't mastered
any capture moves

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
like Sero or Mr. Aizawa.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
But as a support ability,

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.516 position:50% align:center
I think it's already a useful
addition to my move set.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
And you haven't had any contact

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.145 position:50% align:center
with the past users
since last time?

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
No.

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:35.607 position:50% align:center
The fifth user
was called Lariat.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.233 position:50% align:center
Guess that makes sense.

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
Real name: Daigoro Banjo.
Quirk: Blackwhip.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.783 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the threads of energy
he shot from his body,

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
he excelled at capture
and midair maneuvers.

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.287 position:50% align:center
One thing is obvious.

00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
None of these people
started with Quirks

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:53.083 position:50% align:center
that were even worth mentioning.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.460 position:50% align:center
So it's no wonder I haven't
heard of these nobodies.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are you talking about?
Their powers are amazing!

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
Yeah 'cause from the
perspective of a loser like you,

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.550 position:50% align:center
any Quirk is amazing.

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:03.635 position:50% align:center
That's mean.

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
You know how to hit me
where it hurts.

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] What Young Bakugo
said isn't technically wrong.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
From what we know,

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
All For One was obsessed
with this Quirk.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
During a time when
evil had more power

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
than you could possibly
comprehend now.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
All For One crushed anybody
who could be considered strong.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
That was made possible
by his perseverance

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
and wide-ranging influence.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] As they died,
struggling, in terrible pain,

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:36.626 position:50% align:center
the past users entrusted
this power to the future,

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.796 position:50% align:center
adding to its legacy.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
They weren't "chosen ones."

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
They were just "the people
who received the power"

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.345 position:50% align:center
and "the people who
passed it on" in a fight

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
that kept repeating itself.

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that tracks. No wonder
they all died young.

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:58.273 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
Yes. True.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.819 position:50% align:center
So? What Quirk
are you gonna make

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center
the damn nerd learn to use next?

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:09.826 position:50% align:center
The next power you should
manifest is Float.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
My master's ability.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] A new ability?
And from Nana Shimura.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
All Might's master!

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:21.838 position:50% align:center

You're gonna waste time
learning something

I've basically been
able to do forever!

While you're crashing

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
I'll hone my skills even
more at the work study!

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center

I'll rocket ahead of you!

Um. Nuh-uh.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
I'll learn it fast and
catch back up to you.

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] You'll probably panic,
go out of control, and die!

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.155 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] No, I got the
hang of Blackwhip quickly,

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
--so I should able to--

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
Calm down!

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
We still have about
three months to go!

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
And don't forget that finals
are just over the horizon.

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.418 position:50% align:center
Stop talking, Iida!
You're ruining the food!

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
Words can't change the taste.

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
You! How is someone so dense
so popular with the ladies?

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, Mineta.

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:32.052 position:50% align:center
Sounds to me like you're
concerned you won't pass.

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
Ugh, shut up!

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] Don't sweat it,
I'm kinda worried, too, Mineta.

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Sometimes, I'm suddenly
overwhelmed with reality.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
And I can't believe
how my life has changed.

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
I never imagined All Might
would one day be my teacher.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
Or that I'd be able to talk, um,

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:55.241 position:50% align:center
I guess sorta normally
with Kacchan?

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Wow.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
Midoriya. Pass
the <i>ponzu</i> , please.

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:05.710 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I'm so lucky.

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:08.713 position:50% align:center
Midoriya? The <i>ponzu</i> .

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:11.257 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Oh, sorry! Here!

00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
My thanks.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
There you are.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?
It's freezing out here.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
Oh, not much.
You need me? What's up?

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:25.105 position:50% align:center
Yes. I have a message
from Tsukauchi.

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
He wants to postpone your
meeting with Stain for now.

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
Got it. By the way...

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
How's Young Eri?

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
Sleeping like a baby.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
My plan is to start her
formal training this week.

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
I'll help you.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
That'd be nice.

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:52.841 position:50% align:center
I decided to keep on living.

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Hm?

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.928 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Thing is... How do I put this?

00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:59.931 position:50% align:center
I feel so powerless.

00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
Like nothing I try
really matters.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.479 position:50% align:center
Every time I see
our students improve,

00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center
I'm tortured by the fact
that I can't do more

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
to prepare them for the future.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] It would seem that
you're still a workaholic.

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:15.864 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
You defended us almost
on your own for decades.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
So, yeah.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's hard to
come down from that high.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
That's a little harsh.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
But you are still
able to help them.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:30.628 position:50% align:center
By being at their side.

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
Your presence is enough
to inspire greatness.

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
That's the truth.

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:48.021 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] You should sit back
and put your feet up.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.732 position:50% align:center
Don't apologize for being alive.

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Thanks.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
The Paranormal Liberation Front.

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center
And Shigaraki still has
a backer behind the scenes.

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
Something to do with...
a hospital.

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
[NURSE]
My, this is unusual.

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
A pleasure to see
you here, doctor.

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Heh. Good morning.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
I hope your research
is proving fruitful.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
Yes. All that's left

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
is to wait for the
finishing touches.

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I must be sure
of when they'll attack.

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
Hopefully the young heroes
will have time to mature.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
Until then, I'll gather intel.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
And learn everything
about the Liberation War.

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
X-Day will be here soon!

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:18.004 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Ugh. It's spring break,

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:20.298 position:50% align:center
but we can't even enjoy it
because our work studies

00:22:20.382 --> 00:22:21.758 position:50% align:center
are still going. Boo!

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:24.678 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] So much for
having time to relax.

00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:27.430 position:50% align:center
It says we have an
expeditionary operation.

00:22:27.514 --> 00:22:28.932 position:50% align:center
So like a work field trip?

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:32.644 position:50% align:center
Hold on, for real?
That's weird. Same for us.

00:22:32.727 --> 00:22:34.938 position:50% align:center
Our agency, too. I wonder why.

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:37.190 position:50% align:center
Huh. What could that mean?

00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:38.566 position:50% align:center
Whoa, ditto here.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:39.943 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
Same.

00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:49.828 position:50% align:center
[DAI'S MOTHER] Dai, you ready
to do your best in first grade?

00:22:59.004 --> 00:23:01.881 position:50% align:center
[BURNIN] There are heroes
at the foot of the mountain!

00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:03.717 position:50% align:center
But we'll be
evacuating residents

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.636 position:50% align:center
from our position in the back.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.680 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
The League of Villains--

00:23:08.763 --> 00:23:14.602 position:50% align:center
No. The Paranormal Liberation
Front was plotting.

00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:15.854 position:50% align:center
And the harrowing incident

00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:18.940 position:50% align:center
that would shake
superhuman society

00:23:19.024 --> 00:23:20.650 position:50% align:center
was about to begin.
