00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:16.975 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Classes 1-A and 1-B
from the hero course at UA high

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
are battling it out
against one another

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
in team combat training.

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:24.941 position:50% align:center
So far, each Class has
managed to score a win.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.651 position:50% align:center
Class A started the
third round strong

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
with Todoroki's ice attack.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
But the tables were turned
thanks to Honenuki's Quirk.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.034 position:50% align:center
Now, the match is
starting to look like

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
it's going in the
Class B's favor. Maybe.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.499 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
You are evil incarnate!

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
Sorry 'bout it.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
Recipro has a time limit, right?

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:48.089 position:50% align:center
Not so smart to use it
right at the beginning.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.633 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm gonna
go help Tetsutetsu.

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
A time limit?

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
That was a while ago, Mudman.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50% align:center
Ingenium will rush
anywhere at anytime.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:05.565 position:50% align:center
That's what these legs are for!
They won't be constrained!

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:09.152 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
You see?

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:12.113 position:50% align:center
I've been at full throttle
this entire time!

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
New Style. Recipro Turbo!

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.099 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Ten minutes!

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
For ten minutes,

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:06.853 position:50% align:center
nobody can stop me!

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:10.607 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
Is he going to beat me

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
with some new move
I've never seen?

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.154 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
I can't control it completely.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
So fast!

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] But at this speed,
the trade-off is power.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
Well. Fair enough.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.251 position:50% align:center
I'm no match for this attack.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
[TENYA pants]

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
You're under arrest, villain!

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
Sorry, I'm not one of those

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
stubborn heroes in training.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
I won't keep fighting
when I'm at a disadvantage.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
It's not the best idea
to leave Iida in the wind,

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
but I don't think
I can stop him.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50% align:center
Smarter to hurry and find
Tetsutetsu and the others

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
so I can help them.

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
The ice has gone back to normal.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.868 position:50% align:center
Is he planning a
surprise counterattack?

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] No, he should understand
now that that wouldn't work.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.875 position:50% align:center
He probably left to
support his teammates.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:19.259 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Wow! That's our speedster!

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
Recipro Turbo, huh?

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
Using that, he's faster
than even Gran Torino.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's 'cause you
starting going "Shoot Style"

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
and using your kicks,
so Iida worked hard

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:28.893 position:50% align:center
to make sure he stood out.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
I should ask if he has
any new pointers for me.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
Um, you guys! Eyes on Ojiro!

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50% align:center
He's trying for
an ordinary fist fight.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
[SERO] It looks like
he's losing ground,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
but Ojiro's gotten better
like the rest of us!

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
You got this!

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.254 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Oh, man, I can't keep this up.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
Don't you know you can't win
if you're just parrying?

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.469 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] I don't even
have time to attack.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
But I can't just keep blocking.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
Those support items of his
would rip me to shreds.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
Kaibara's gotten brutal.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
Gotcha now!

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
Iida!

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
I'll throw Spiral in jail!

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.533 position:50% align:center
Forgive my brief
absence as I do.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
Help the others, Ojiro!

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
Mudman is probably
heading toward them!

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:29.496 position:50% align:center
I'll be back!

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you got it!

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] His talking
gets faster, too. Wow.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
[KAIBARA]
Let go of me!

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
I haven't gotten
to show off yet!

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Silence, fiend!

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50% align:center
I won't let one
of your ilk boast!

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
[KAIBARA]
You let Honenuki go, didn't you?

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
Even though you saw
how much a pain he can be.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't you go
after him first?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
it's smart to butt in

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
on a one-on-one fight
instead, Ingenium?!

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] This is what
my brother would've done,

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
so I'll act accordingly.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
--[bars rattling]
--[thud]

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] If I compromised
my ideals in training,

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
I'd likely do so in
a real fight, as well.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
You're a real stick in the mud.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Yeah. I hear that often.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center

[TODOROKI grunts]

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Thanks to how resilient he is,

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
Testutetsu can move even
though he must be freezing.

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not like his skin
is gonna rip off or anything.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50% align:center
So manly. I'll learn
from your example!

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.602 position:50% align:center
Blasting ice even
though it's useless

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.855 position:50% align:center
is something only an
idiot would keep doing.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:39.274 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU grunting]
I'll smash your defenses.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
Nothin's gonna stop
my steel fist of justice!

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
Fine, then.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
I'll use a wall of fire instead!

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
Right!

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Push him back!

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.834 position:50% align:center
Gain some distance!

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:02.672 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU] You still don't get
why I'm your opponent, do you?

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
I thought it would be obvious!

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:08.219 position:50% align:center
Your Quirk has
zero effect on me.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
He's glowing from the heat?

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
Those flames a' yours
got my body burnin' red hot!

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
Do your best, Hot-Tetsu!

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
I've been trainin' for
somethin' just like this!

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
You ever spent time
inside an oven?

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.278 position:50% align:center
'Cause guess what!

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] Tetsutetsu has
Todoroki on the ropes

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
and won't let him escape!

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center
Given their close proximity,

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
Todoroki is unable to use
any of his area attacks!

Half-Cold Half-Hot.

You get it yet?

I've forged my steel into
something even you can't dent.

you can from inside your body!

And then take it
beyond that limit!

I know you can do this.
You're just not trying!

[TETSUTETSU]
Only thing to do now

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
is keep punchin'

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.387 position:50% align:center
It's gotta be hard
on you, too, right?

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
I don't think you'll be able
to keep it up for long.

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
In which case,
I won't back down!

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU] Endurance
contests are my specialty!

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.654 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
I'm gonna go beyond!

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
You're wrong.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
Give up before I have
to show you what I can do.

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
If you're not willing
to risk everything

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.037 position:50% align:center
during training,
then you'll never do it

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50% align:center
in a real fight either.

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:27.669 position:50% align:center
Our powers and limits
are there to be surpassed!

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
It's time for you to shut up.

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI] I'm pretty far away
but I can still feel that!

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI] I gotta hurry up
and get back to our steely boy.

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI]
Sorry, Tentacole!

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
I never look at the
octopuses at the aquarium.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
They are not cute.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI] I'm used to people
being scared of me.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
Then don't take it
personal, kay?

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
I'm tryna help us win!

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
Bring it on!

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
Thunder Horn!

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
Octoblow!

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:11.296 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI yells]

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
You're--

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
--done!

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.263 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
You saved me. Ojiro!

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
Twirling Tail Dance!

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.186 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI yelps]

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
You may be good
with those horns,

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.606 position:50% align:center
but they're no help to you
if you can't shoot them!

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
This is how you catch me?
It's so darn ordinary!

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.653 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
I'll take her to the jail.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
You go support Todor--

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
Him again!

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI] I'll be taking
my teammate back now.

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
If you didn't know,
our class is pretty tight.

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
Keep struggling. Your hold
on her will only get looser.

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
[grunts] You bastard!

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
Fist of the Tail,

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
Swamp Smack Spin!

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
Thanks for that.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Likewise.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
How'd he use so much force?

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI]
You gotta tell me

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
before you do something
like that, Honenuki!

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI growls]

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
I won't let you go!

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
It's cool, I'm not
worried about that.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:24.703 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
Ojiro!

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI] With the power
of these four horns,

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
I'll send you straight
to the slammer!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter how
she got him inside.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:38.717 position:50% align:center
If he's behind bars,
then he's out.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.136 position:50% align:center
Right now, it's one-to-one.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
What's wrong?

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
Todoroki? Huh?

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
You're getting slow!

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.441 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
I could say the same about you.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:59.112 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] I'm getting dizzy.
My movements are imprecise.

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
Sloppy. If I wanna
cool myself down,

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.827 position:50% align:center
I'll have to get him
to back off first.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Go beyond that limit!

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
Can't let you melt my classmate.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. What's up?

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Crap, I'm gonna pass out.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI]
Now harden.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
I didn't miss this time,

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center
Mudman!

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
So hot!

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
Bastard.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.750 position:50% align:center
I won't let you get away.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center
[STAIN] Shouldn't you be
worried about saving that guy?

00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
[TENSEI]
The coolest person you can be

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
is someone who helps others.

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
If you see a lost kid,
help them find their way home.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
I'll return for you, villain!

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
My priority is rescue.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:18.817 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI] I'm losing
consciousness after one hit.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:23.029 position:50% align:center
Even though he said he didn't
have control at that speed.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
It was a mistake
leaving Iida for later.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:29.911 position:50% align:center
Man, does this mean we lost?

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
If I black out,
the things I softened

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
will go back to normal.

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
I couldn't even leave behind

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:39.295 position:50% align:center
something to help
like Yaoyorozu did.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
I don't feel
frustrated or anything.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
We'll lose fair and square.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI] But I don't
want my friends to fail

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
just because I messed up!

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50% align:center
One more chance.

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
Tetsutetsu! Quickly! Push this!

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:58.898 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU growls, yells]

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:06.906 position:50% align:center
[TENYA gasps]

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
This is a fight.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
The four of them are down!

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.190 position:50% align:center
But they aren't out
until they're in jail!

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
What'll happen in
the final moments?

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] My left arm
and leg are trapped.

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center
It's too much.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
I don't have enough
strength to break out!

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
Todoroki. Apologies.

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
If only I'd been
a little better.

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:05.298 position:50% align:center
Just one step faster
getting us out of here.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.008 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] Iida can't
escape a little building

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.968 position:50% align:center
that fell on top of him?

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
It looks to me like
the struggle with Kaibara

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center
had a big impact on him! Ha!

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:17.018 position:50% align:center
He fought back the entire time,
and boy, did it pay off!

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
Good job, Kaibara!

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
You're definitely the
MVP of this round!

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
The one-sided commentary

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
is somehow getting worse.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.196 position:50% align:center
Both Class A and Class B
have one person in their jails.

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
And almost everyone
is down for the count.

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:32.575 position:50% align:center
Only two more left.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI gasps]

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Todoroki!

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.961 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI] I can't let
Shoji nab my pals!

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:44.838 position:50% align:center
We'd be done for sure!

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.256 position:50% align:center
So, what should I do?

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
I couldn't beat Shoji even with
all four a' my horns free.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
I definitely wouldn't
be able to fight him

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
and protect my teammates.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
If I put Todoroki in prison,
then we'll take the lead.

00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
But carrying all three of
'em is weighing me down.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
At this rate, I'll be caught
before I make it to the jail.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
If I blow this, we lose.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.112 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
Give him back!

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI]
That's it!

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
No!

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI]
I'll go higher than he can reach

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:19.080 position:50% align:center
and wait this sucker out.

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
That way, even if we don't win,
we technically won't lose!

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
[TSUNOTORI]
Sorry, Tentacole!

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
I won't be the reason

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
we have to go crawlin'
back home as failures.

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
[SATO] Wait. She took
everyone into the sky?

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. Shoji can't
fly with his Quirk.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
Huh! She's just running away.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
So, Deku.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:42.979 position:50% align:center
What do you think
her plan is now?

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
It may seem strange,
but she's taking the safe route.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
If she left her teammates
behind to escape,

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
then Shoji could
put them in jail.

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
But why take Todoroki?

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] If he comes to, he could
attack with flames or ice

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
even in the sky.

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.284 position:50% align:center
This way, she can
keep him knocked out.

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center
Or at least send him flying
if he does wake up.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center
It's like an insurance policy.

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:01.581 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't make any sense!

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
The whole point is to throw
the other team in training jail!

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] They won't win,
but they won't lose.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Oh, no! The timer!

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
[buzzer blares]

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Twenty minutes have passed!

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
The third match is over!

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:29.984 position:50% align:center
Each team put one person away,
so we've got ourselves a draw!

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, that's
ridiculously unsatisfying!

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
In an actual encounter,
running away and awaiting rescue

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
can often be
a reasonable option.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:39.661 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Poor Iida. He must be so upset.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yeah, but...

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
He was so awesome.

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] Since there are
a number of round three students

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
unconscious, we can review
their performances later!

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
Get ready for the fourth match!

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.937 position:50% align:center
[RECOVERY GIRL]
Smooch.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.105 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI gasps]

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
Great, you're awake!

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
That's a good patient.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.570 position:50% align:center
Here, you should eat
this protein bar.

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
Ojiro ate his and went back out.

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
Damn, Todoroki!
The match was a draw,

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.952 position:50% align:center
but I feel like I lost
the head-to-head fight!

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
That heat was insanity!
Let's do it again!

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.916 position:50% align:center
[RECOVERY GIRL]
Ah! So loud.

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.543 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
A draw.

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] If only I'd been faster,
we'd have claimed victory.

00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Iida.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
It's obvious that
I'm still too slow.

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
Honenuki's style
was so flexible.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
And I just failed to react.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
You saved me,
though, didn't you?

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
I seem to remember that.

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
And anyway,

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
when it comes to mistakes,
I made the biggest one.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI] If you'd been
coldhearted and used fire,

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:56.696 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't have been
able to trap you.

00:19:56.738 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] It's become a habit
to use ice as my opening move.

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
Like it's just
ingrained in my body.

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
You are fast enough.
I'm the one who's slow.

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center
And because of that weakness,

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
I caused you and
the team to worry.

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:21.930 position:50% align:center
I wanna be a hero who brings
people peace of mind.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:22.806 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
No!

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:25.975 position:50% align:center
I would never consider
you unrelia-- Ah!

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center
I will run anywhere, to anyone
who needs my assistance.

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:35.110 position:50% align:center
That's my conviction
as Ingenium's successor.

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
[HONENUKI] Since we're talkin'
about how we need to upgrade,

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center
I'll point out I also
still have work to do.

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
So I hope you'll fight me again.

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Of course.

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:50.041 position:50% align:center
[RECOVERY GIRL]
If you boys are better,

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center
then why are you still here?!

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
This is no place for chitchat!

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Right! Please excuse us!

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.926 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] Poor babies, your backs
are up against the wall!

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
Class A and B both have one win!

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
Lose this round,

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
and there's no way you can
say you're better than us.

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:10.937 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Comes and goes in waves, huh?

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
Oh, you've no idea how much
I've been looking forward

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
to this fantastic match up.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
Why, you ask?

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
Because our beloved
Tokage's in it.

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
If I were Bakugo, I'd be
pretty worried about now.

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE]
All right, let's go.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.286 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Yes! Setsuna Tokage!

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
The other student in Class B who
got in through recommendations!

00:21:29.664 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
She can be a real
nasty piece of work.

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Kacchan!

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
Wait. Bad idea.
Let's talk about this, okay?

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
[SATO] Yeah. You're
not serious, right?

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Shut up.

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Just watch me, Deku!

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.685 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] We'll start when
everyone is in position!

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:54.022 position:50% align:center
Fourth match.
Prepare for battle!

00:23:30.326 --> 00:23:31.953 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:34.581 position:50% align:center
Class A heads into the
fourth match with one win,

00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:36.207 position:50% align:center
one loss, and one draw.

00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:39.169 position:50% align:center
Luckily we've got
a solid team of Jiro, Sero,

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.171 position:50% align:center
Sato, and Kacchan.

00:23:41.212 --> 00:23:44.132 position:50% align:center
Class B has Tokage,
a wild card, though.

00:23:44.174 --> 00:23:45.300 position:50% align:center
Be careful, guys.

00:23:45.342 --> 00:23:47.886 position:50% align:center
There's probably
some kind of trap.

00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:49.929 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Early Bird!"

00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:53.224 position:50% align:center
Wait, is something different
about Kacchan's fighting style?

00:23:53.266 --> 00:23:55.018 position:50% align:center
Did he change? No way!

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.312 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
