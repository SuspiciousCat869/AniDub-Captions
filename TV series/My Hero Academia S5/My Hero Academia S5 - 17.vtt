It's the start of a new year.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.432 position:50% align:center
Kacchan and I weren't sure where

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.851 position:50% align:center
we were going to do our
work studies until Todoroki

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
invited us to join him
at Endeavor's agency.

[IZUKU]
He didn't go easy on us.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.947 position:50% align:center
As soon as we arrived, we
witnessed the overwhelming

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.534 position:50% align:center
strength and commitment the
new number-one hero possesses.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] You learn
to work hard at school.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.916 position:50% align:center
And here, you'll
gain experience.

latter as you can here.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center

on can be conquered in this way.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.883 position:50% align:center
This winter, I want
you to show me

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:54.512 position:50% align:center
that you can capture a villain
faster than me just once!

[IZUKU] If I chase after
Endeavor and shorten

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
the distance between us,

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.269 position:50% align:center
even if it's by
the smallest amount,

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:03.688 position:50% align:center
then one day,
I'll reach my goal.

To become the greatest
hero in the world!

Before I knew it,

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.328 position:50% align:center

[IZUKU] In the world of pros,
the slightest actions

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.733 position:50% align:center

With that in mind,

he beat us again?

You should be more careful

So I ran toward that
goal at full speed.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
I wanted to be a light
that was a beacon of hope

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
as well as a warning.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:13.071 position:50% align:center
I swore that that's what I would
become and I never looked back.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.823 position:50% align:center
Listen, Endeavor.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
I understand the situation
you've been placed in

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
and what's being said about you.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:25.166 position:50% align:center
There are many who can't help
but dwell on our differences.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
But you and I are
not the same person.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.671 position:50% align:center
It was my decision
to become a symbol,

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
but you don't have
to do that. Instead,

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
take your time and think about
the kind of hero you want to be.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
Why is it so important
to be the strongest?

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Endeavor.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you have a reason.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center

Oh, hi, Burnin.
It's fine, thanks!

It's way too early for you
to be yelling, idiot!

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:34.277 position:50% align:center
[BURNIN] How's it been,
trying to nab a villain

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
before Endeavor? Sorry, I know,
my bad for bringing up

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
such a delicate subject!

Yesterday we almost beat him.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
We need to remember what that
felt like and use it to fuel us.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center

obviously above you!

I'm still trying to get
used to pinpointed attacks.

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center
Sure, but it does look like

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
you're slowly getting
the hang of them.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
--[TODOROKI] Yeah, I guess so.
--[KATSUKI] I'm talking!

The accumulation
before you release

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
is a problem, too, huh?

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Yes. It takes me a while

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:17.570 position:50% align:center
to get to my max output,
so I can't attack quickly.

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center

for a while now.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center

[FUYUMI]
You used to cook, too, Natsu.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
We took turns.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
Wait. So did I eat
your food growing up?

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
[NATSUO]
It's possible.

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
I can go overboard
on seasoning, though.

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
Endeavor might've kept
you from having it.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
He always did keep
a close eye on your diet.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.946 position:50% align:center
I suppose there
is truth to that.

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
So! Shoto, what kind of food
do they serve at UA?

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Cafeteria-style.

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
Natsuo, I'd like to try
your cooking next time.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.252 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the meal, Sis.

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:26.838 position:50% align:center

But now I'm done.

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI]
Wait!

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
[NATSUO] Sorry but...
I just can't do this.

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:54.282 position:50% align:center
Um. Excuse me.

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:55.617 position:50% align:center
Our dishes?

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Right.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.667 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] So, uh. Did you
know Todoroki's family

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.502 position:50% align:center
had a lot of issues
going on before this?

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
Of course, but only because
you guys talked about it

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
so loud that I
couldn't not know it.

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
You were listening?

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI] I feel bad making
Midoriya and Bakugo

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
help with the clean up.

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Midoriya would be upset

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:24.187 position:50% align:center
if you didn't let him pitch in.

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:28.400 position:50% align:center
Listen. I... It's not
that I don't sometimes

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:30.193 position:50% align:center
feel the way Natsuo does.

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:31.444 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI gasps]

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI] But... Now is
our chance to fix this.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.035 position:50% align:center
So, tell me. How do you
feel about our dad?

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
Honestly.

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
He may not've been there,

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
but he's responsible
for the scar I have.

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.337 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Oh, baby, no!

00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, Shoto!
What have I done?

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.135 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry! Shoto,
please, I'm sorry!

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:57.637 position:50% align:center
Mom put up with a monster

00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
until he pushed her past
the breaking point.

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
He ruined her.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
I can't forgive him so easily.

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
You know... Mom's trying to get
over this herself right now.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
Working through things.

00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Dear Shoto.

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
Are you doing well?

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center
It's been cold, so I'm worried
about you getting sick.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.124 position:50% align:center
Make sure you wear a coat.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center
I've been able to go
out more recently.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.296 position:50% align:center
Getting outside of this room.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
The doctor says that

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
if things keep
progressing smoothly,

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
I can be discharged soon.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
I want to live with you and
your brother and sister again.

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:43.683 position:50% align:center
As a family.

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best to make sure
what happened before

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
doesn't happen again.
I swear it.

00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:53.985 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
To be honest,

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
I have no idea
what I want from him.

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to
feel about the old man.

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
But... I'll figure it out.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.955 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
You people.

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna
invite guests over,

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.292 position:50% align:center
don't talk about
sensitive subjects!

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
There are dishes
that need washing!

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI] Oh, no! I'm sorry,
you're totally right.

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:15.173 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so, we've, uh,
heard about the situation

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
from Todoroki, so we're
sorta in the know!

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
Normally, you'd think
getting asked over for dinner

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
is a good thing!
But you went and ruined

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
some good food with
your family drama.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I'm sorry, we kind of overheard.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Todoroki. I know
it's not my business.

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
But I think deep down,
you're ready

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
to move forward with your dad.

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong though.

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:43.451 position:50% align:center
If you don't forgive him,
that's up to you.

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
No one can force you
to accept him.

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:47.497 position:50% align:center
The thing is...

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.874 position:50% align:center
...you're a really
caring person.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Seems like you're
just waiting for something.

00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
If so...

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:02.137 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll know how
to feel when the time comes.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] What can I do for
my family after all this time?

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
Where do I begin?

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:19.320 position:50% align:center
I've been having that dream.

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
My wife and children look
like they're having fun

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:25.577 position:50% align:center
around the dinner table.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.039 position:50% align:center
But you're not there.

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:33.835 position:50% align:center
I wish that you could
join them, Toya.

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:31.703 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:34.748 position:50% align:center
Kacchan and I discovered that
Endeavor has an intense desire

00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:38.335 position:50% align:center
to fix his complicated
relationship with his family.

00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:40.045 position:50% align:center
As if emotions weren't
running hot enough

00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:42.172 position:50% align:center
for the number-one hero,
a villain with a grudge

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:44.049 position:50% align:center
against him shows
up to pick a fight.

00:23:44.132 --> 00:23:46.634 position:50% align:center
Todoroki, Kacchan. Let's go!

00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:48.803 position:50% align:center
We won't let this
villain prevail!

00:23:48.887 --> 00:23:50.972 position:50% align:center
Next time: "The Unforgiven."

00:23:51.056 --> 00:23:52.682 position:50% align:center
You can't change the past,

00:23:52.766 --> 00:23:55.602 position:50% align:center
but maybe you can right
the wrongs you've committed.

00:23:55.685 --> 00:23:57.771 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
