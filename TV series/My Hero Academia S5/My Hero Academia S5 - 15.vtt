You want a status report?

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure, let's see.

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:34.451 position:50% align:center
I'm spreading the
good Liberation word.

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:35.494 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
We noticed that you've been

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.205 position:50% align:center
passing this book out to heroes.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.920 position:50% align:center
It's obvious that you
not only read it;

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.506 position:50% align:center
you truly understand Destro.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
You're someone who gets us.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.926 position:50% align:center
Gee, thanks.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.135 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
If I'm being honest,

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center
I still don't really
get what we're doing.

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
Teach me sometime!

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.183 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Happy to.
Bet you'll catch on fast.

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:00.269 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
You're like a walking billboard.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
With your help, Liberation
ideology will spread.

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.858 position:50% align:center
Your core fanbase of teens
and 20-somethings

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:08.235 position:50% align:center
would be great boon for us.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:09.570 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I'll double down
my efforts, then.

00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:11.530 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] You're working
super hard, huh, Hawks?

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:12.823 position:50% align:center
You're a pretty good guy!

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.784 position:50% align:center
Pure evil! Happy
you're on our side!

00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:18.370 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Happy to be here.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:19.955 position:50% align:center
As far as I can tell,
we're not even

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.249 position:50% align:center
on the commission's radar yet.

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:23.959 position:50% align:center
They're investigating
the League's involvement

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:25.961 position:50% align:center
in the Deika City incident,
but our troops

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.255 position:50% align:center
are staying off their radars.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:29.965 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile we're
starting to influence

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
the next generation of heroes.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.888 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Really? That's a coincidence!

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.557 position:50% align:center
Heh. From what I see,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.310 position:50% align:center
UA's students haven't
grown all that much.

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:44.605 position:50% align:center
Heh. Well yeah,
you are talking about

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.523 position:50% align:center
a buncha high schoolers.

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.483 position:50% align:center
[YOTSUBASHI]
Excellent work!

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.444 position:50% align:center
You may go, Hawks.

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:55.741 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
I've trained to intercept

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.660 position:50% align:center
the smallest pieces
of intelligence.

00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:01.705 position:50% align:center
Fierce Wings can detect
sound vibrations in the air,

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.208 position:50% align:center
allowing me to interpret it.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:05.959 position:50% align:center
I can hear you.

[HANABATA] Spinner.
Are things going to plan?

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.131 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we just gotta keep
the troop morale up.

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:13.300 position:50% align:center
The fun is gonna
start pretty soon.

Boom!

00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:21.558 position:50% align:center
Everything is destroyed.
And Tomura will ruin this world.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.026 position:50% align:center

"The enemy..."

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.963 position:50% align:center

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.786 position:50% align:center

access to speak of.

All right, all right. I get it.

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:20.946 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] If we just
surrounded this place,

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
we could probably take them.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.368 position:50% align:center
No. That wouldn't help much.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
I need solid numbers of how many
serve the Liberation Army,

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.417 position:50% align:center
locations of their secret
bunkers across the country,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.586 position:50% align:center
and the names of the heroes
helping them, so they can

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.172 position:50% align:center
all be rounded up at once.

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:41.175 position:50% align:center
If we don't do it that way,
then we'll lose the enemies

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
we can't see, and the

[CHAIRWOMAN]
Yes.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
This will provide the students
with some real-world experience.

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center
And I believe it's going to
be beneficial to you as well.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:20.756 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] The Commission
and Hawks have deduced

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
that our enemy is strategizing.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.886 position:50% align:center
They're obviously working
behind closed doors.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.888 position:50% align:center
Which must mean...

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:31.225 position:50% align:center
...the work studies are
to prepare for an attack!

00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:35.229 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I wasn't so sure
about the work study thing.

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
If we fail, the safety of the
country falls to our students.

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.778 position:50% align:center
So, thing is.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.489 position:50% align:center
Shoto's the only one Endeavor
wanted to train on his own.

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
But don't worry--

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
us sidekicks will take
good care of you other two.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.577 position:50% align:center
I'm here because
I was told I could watch

00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center

You'll still see him!
Please calm down, Kacchan!

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:58.377 position:50% align:center
This isn't how I expected
things to play out.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.087 position:50% align:center
I'll try talking to him.

00:07:02.506 --> 00:07:05.551 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] This work study
program is insurance.

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center

I don't agree with it.

00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center
But for now...

00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:16.103 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Shoto. Deku. Bakugo.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.480 position:50% align:center
I'll look after
you three myself.

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:23.068 position:50% align:center
From what I see,

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:26.113 position:50% align:center
UA's students haven't
grown all that much.

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.409 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I'm glad you're
underestimating them.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.828 position:50% align:center
It was worth stealing
their glory, then.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.329 position:50% align:center
I'm positive they
coulda handled things

00:07:34.413 --> 00:07:36.748 position:50% align:center
if I hadn't shown up, no sweat.

00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:41.587 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] It's good to put effort
into beefing up

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.672 position:50% align:center
your short-range
combat weaknesses.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.175 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Seeing you try
so hard to improve

00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:49.595 position:50% align:center
changed how I view
students, Tsukuyomi.

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:53.307 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're the one
who came to my agency.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.642 position:50% align:center
You're a strong kid.

00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:58.520 position:50% align:center
And your friends
are strong, too.

00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
Every day you improve.

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Maybe even faster than me.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.050 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
This definitely won't go down

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
the way the villains want it to.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:38.977 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] The next time
the cherry blossoms fall,

00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:41.313 position:50% align:center
I hope we'll all be smiling.

00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
You boys are now
under my tutelage.

00:08:57.246 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
Deku. Bakugo.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
Before we begin,
tell me about yourselves.

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.086 position:50% align:center
What are you
currently capable of?

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.798 position:50% align:center
What weaknesses do you
need to improve upon?

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
I want to perform at my fullest.

00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:10.884 position:50% align:center
But to do that,
I'll need to gain

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
better control over my power.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.555 position:50% align:center
How interesting.

00:09:14.638 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
Your Quirk is so strong
that it hurts you.

00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:18.016 position:50% align:center
S'that right?

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.519 position:50% align:center
Yes. I've learned
to control it enough

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:23.355 position:50% align:center
that I don't usually
injure myself.

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
However... uh...

00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:29.528 position:50% align:center
Recently, there's, uh...
this other thing.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:30.821 position:50% align:center
It's kinda like um...

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.407 position:50% align:center
So, it's my power, but
it's manifesting in a way

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
I've never experienced before.

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:36.869 position:50% align:center
Show me.

00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.539 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
If I concentrate, I can release

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
the small amount I can handle.

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:45.127 position:50% align:center
This is the most that I
can manage for right now.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
If I'm not careful,
then untamed energy

00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:49.089 position:50% align:center
explodes out of me.

00:09:49.173 --> 00:09:51.884 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by
performing to your fullest?

00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:53.719 position:50% align:center
Explain your power.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:56.597 position:50% align:center
It seems flexible like a whip
and could be super versatile.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.308 position:50% align:center
I want to turn this risky
thing into a useful weapon.

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.560 position:50% align:center
I guess the truth is, I'm trying
to see if I can figure out

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
how to control it at will

00:10:02.895 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
the same way I learned
to do with Air Force.

00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:07.024 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, Air Force
is a whole other thing.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.568 position:50% align:center
That's a long-distance attack
that uses wind pressure,

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
but I'm still working
on that, too,

00:10:11.153 --> 00:10:13.071 position:50% align:center
because for it to be most
effective, it needs more output

00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center
than my body is prepared for.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
In my current state, I can
only tolerate maintaining

00:10:16.909 --> 00:10:18.285 position:50% align:center
a certain amount of power.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.204 position:50% align:center
My baseline is about
ten-to-fifteen percent,

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
but Air Force needs
around 20 percent,

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.123 position:50% align:center
so I go a little over.

00:10:23.207 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
Does that all make sense to you?

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.460 position:50% align:center
At that point, even if
I don't injure myself,

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:27.961 position:50% align:center
there's a painful
tingling and it affects

00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
my mobility and speed.

00:10:29.505 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
That's why I've practiced

00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:31.924 position:50% align:center
so I can release
Air Force in an instant

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:34.051 position:50% align:center
and go back to a safe level
of output right away.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.886 position:50% align:center
If I could just do this with the
Blackwhip, then theoretically,

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
I should be able to use that
power whenever I want.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
But I'm not even close
to being that in control

00:10:39.515 --> 00:10:40.933 position:50% align:center
of the ability yet.

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
See, when I'm fighting, I adjust
my power output as I move.

00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
So I'd be adding another
element to that,

00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:45.312 position:50% align:center
which is hard to juggle.

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
I've been training so I can
perform without thinking,

00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:47.814 position:50% align:center
but so far, haven't had
much luck, which is why

00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:49.066 position:50% align:center
I'm excited to be here!

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.235 position:50% align:center
He talked so much,
I totally lost the thread.

00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:52.861 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Quite the self-analysis.

00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI growls]
Shut up!

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.323 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:57.950 position:50% align:center
At heart, you're saying that you
want to be able to constantly

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
adjust power levels
when you're fighting?

00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:00.536 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yes!

00:11:00.619 --> 00:11:01.620 position:50% align:center
You understood him?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:05.082 position:50% align:center
No wonder you're
number one, sir!

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.626 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] I watched your fight
against the brainwashing guy.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.837 position:50% align:center
Your power is pretty impressive.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.465 position:50% align:center
To create so much wind pressure
by flicking your fingers.

00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:15.634 position:50% align:center
It reminds me
of another Quirk.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
You seem to have a lot
in common with All Might.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] You've had
trouble with your Quirk.

00:11:28.397 --> 00:11:31.233 position:50% align:center
Trust me when I tell you
you're not alone.

00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:34.945 position:50% align:center
You. Your turn.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
I'm only here to figure out
what I can't do.

00:11:37.406 --> 00:11:38.657 position:50% align:center
That's the real question.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Heck of an
ego on that one!

00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:42.286 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Shut your mouth!

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
Why are you even
hanging around, anyway?

00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:46.206 position:50% align:center
Who, me? I'm on standby, honey.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.500 position:50% align:center
I meant what I just said.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.296 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] I've been able to do
everything I ever wanted

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.090 position:50% align:center
thanks to my Explosion power.

00:11:55.174 --> 00:11:57.134 position:50% align:center
I may only have one Quirk,

00:11:57.217 --> 00:12:00.721 position:50% align:center
but I can still become
the best there is.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
Over the last year,
I've learned a few things.

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
Like having raw power
doesn't make you truly strong.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:14.985 position:50% align:center
I showed up to figure out
what will make me even better.

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
To surpass you.

00:12:20.616 --> 00:12:22.284 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
This kid.

00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:24.870 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Very well.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.747 position:50% align:center
Then let's not waste time.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.207 position:50% align:center
And what about me?

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
You're just here to learn
Flashfire, aren't you?

00:12:31.502 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
I poured all the training
you beat into me

00:12:33.462 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
as a kid toward
strengthening my right side.

00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:39.051 position:50% align:center
I focused on perfecting my ice.

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Now that I look back on it,

00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:47.226 position:50% align:center
I see that my hatred of you was
holding me back in some ways.

00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:49.186 position:50% align:center
After entering UA,

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
and spending time with these
guys, competing and fighting,

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
my eyes were opened.

00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:58.362 position:50% align:center
Endeavor. I now realize.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna do exactly
what you wanted me to.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.909 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Even if that works
for you in this tournament,

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:07.496 position:50% align:center
you'll soon find the
limits of that power.

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center
Graduate and you'll
work by my side.

00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
I'll lead you down the path
of the mighty, Shoto.

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.754 position:50% align:center
But I want you to know this.

00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:17.840 position:50% align:center
The pro I've always admired

00:13:17.923 --> 00:13:22.970 position:50% align:center
is the person I watched on TV
while sitting beside Mom.

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
I came here wanting to learn.

00:13:25.514 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
So that I'm someone worthy
of being called a hero.

00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:31.687 position:50% align:center
This is my choice, not yours.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
The only reason
I came to this place

00:13:33.564 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
is to use you.

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:38.569 position:50% align:center
I came because it's beneficial
for me, Number One.

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:42.114 position:50% align:center
Don't pretend to be a caring
parent in front of my friends.

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:47.661 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] Endeavor,
the top hero, was amazing.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:49.705 position:50% align:center
But...

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
...I still can't forgive you
for what you did to Mom.

00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
And that's my choice to make.

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:57.963 position:50% align:center
As for being my "father."

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:01.300 position:50% align:center
I'll have to watch your actions
to see if you earn that.

00:14:07.598 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Since he chose to do
his work study here himself,

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:13.020 position:50% align:center
I thought he was warming
up to me a little,

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:17.065 position:50% align:center
but it looks like I was
foolishly mistaken.

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:19.610 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Right, very well.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:20.736 position:50% align:center
From now on,

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:23.155 position:50% align:center
you'll learn by joining
me in the field.

00:14:26.742 --> 00:14:29.828 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Rescue. Evacuation. Combat.

00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
Most of our jobs fall into
those three categories.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
Normally, heroes focus
on either rescue

00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:38.295 position:50% align:center
or fighting as specializations
in their agencies.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:41.590 position:50% align:center
But my policy is to
tackle all three.

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:43.509 position:50% align:center
I know every corner
of my jurisdiction

00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:45.677 position:50% align:center
and stop the
smallest disturbances.

00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
If there's an
incident or accident,

00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:49.932 position:50% align:center
I rush to the scene
faster than anyone.

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
In order to keep
casualties down,

00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
I hold bystanders at bay
using my flames.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.355 position:50% align:center
Those are the basics.

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:59.233 position:50% align:center
Parallel processing
and swift response.

00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:01.276 position:50% align:center
Make that the norm.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
"Parallel processing."

00:15:04.196 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Remember what your goal is.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:12.204 position:50% align:center
At UA, it's hard work.
And here, it's experience.

00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:14.790 position:50% align:center
Bank as much of the latter
as you can here.

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:18.544 position:50% align:center
The things you each need to work
on can be conquered in this way.

00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:20.128 position:50% align:center
This winter, I want
you to show me

00:15:20.212 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
that you can capture a villain
faster than me just once!

00:15:24.258 --> 00:15:26.260 position:50% align:center
[beep]

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
Wait up!

00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:29.972 position:50% align:center
He responds so fast.

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.140 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I can't afford to learn slowly.

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:37.521 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I was given
my Quirk at age 15.

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
When everyone else
was thinking about

00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
what they wanted to run toward,

00:15:40.566 --> 00:15:42.276 position:50% align:center
I was still figuring
out how to walk.

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:45.195 position:50% align:center
No. To crawl.

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:48.240 position:50% align:center
Learning Full Cowling allowed me
to control One For All.

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:51.243 position:50% align:center
But I had to practice so that my
body would use it automatically.

00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:55.247 position:50% align:center
Keep training.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
As you improve, six more
Quirks will manifest in you.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.005 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I need to hurry
and master everything!

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.591 position:50% align:center
[KIDO] The suspect has turned
the corner and is heading east.

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Got it.

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.846 position:50% align:center
Whoa, he never
stopped accelerating.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:12.139 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
That turn.

00:16:23.317 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
[SUSPECT 103A yelps]

00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:29.823 position:50% align:center
[KIDO]
Hit-and-run suspect caught!

00:16:29.907 --> 00:16:31.992 position:50% align:center
You were far too slow, kids.

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
It takes me longer
to get warmed up

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
when it's cold out.

00:16:35.204 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
Bakugo, did you notice that?

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
There's nothing you could
have possibly noticed

00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:41.877 position:50% align:center
that I didn't catch before you!

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
But let's go ahead and hear it.

00:16:43.879 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
[ONIMA]
Wow. Petty.

00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:46.924 position:50% align:center
That turn.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
He used those flames to propel
himself and up his speed.

00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:52.471 position:50% align:center
Like he did with
Jetburn in Kyushu.

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:57.184 position:50% align:center
He probably compressed the move
to drive himself forward.

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:58.352 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
I can only see it because

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:01.355 position:50% align:center
I have the same Quirk as him.

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
The speed he can gain
from those temperatures.

00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:06.902 position:50% align:center
It's about controlling
the flames.

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:09.154 position:50% align:center
The old man's just
copying my Explosion.

00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:11.615 position:50% align:center
How are you just now
noticing that, Icy Hot?

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:15.244 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Guess it took me
a while to figure it out.

00:17:15.327 --> 00:17:17.287 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Let me point
out one more thing.

00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:19.331 position:50% align:center
A busy street's nearby.

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:20.582 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I see!

00:17:20.666 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center
By emitting flames to
intimidate the suspect,

00:17:22.835 --> 00:17:26.421 position:50% align:center
he kept him from fleeing
toward the highway!

00:17:26.505 --> 00:17:27.422 position:50% align:center
[ONIMA]
Go on.

00:17:27.506 --> 00:17:28.966 position:50% align:center
[KIDO]
Leave this to us!

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
It's rare for the big guy to
teach anyone other than Shoto,

00:17:31.552 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
so you should take
advantage while you can.

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:38.392 position:50% align:center
[KIDO]
We'll catch up later!

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Using flames as propulsion.

00:17:42.855 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Too fast!

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.860 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] You're not going
to work with your sidekicks?

00:17:47.943 --> 00:17:49.236 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Hawks and I fought together

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
in order to take down
the Nomu in Kyushu.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.657 position:50% align:center
But that was an exception.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
Top heroes need to be able to
handle everything by themselves.

00:17:57.578 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
By the way,

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
I was aware of the glass
villain's underlings before.

00:18:02.124 --> 00:18:03.375 position:50% align:center
You didn't help me.

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Wow. Petty.

00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:06.003 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Kacchan!

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:07.254 position:50% align:center
Bakugo.

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center
You said you wanted to know

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
what more there was
to learn, correct?

00:18:10.716 --> 00:18:13.177 position:50% align:center
It's true that your
movements are fast.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
You're pretty good.

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
For a rookie, anyway.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
But what should
be plainly obvious

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:20.267 position:50% align:center
is that you can't beat me
at your current level.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.894 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] In the winter,
I need prep time--

00:18:21.977 --> 00:18:23.312 position:50% align:center
Are you going to make
that same excuse

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:25.022 position:50% align:center
when you fail someone?

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
This isn't a classroom.

00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:34.198 position:50% align:center
If you don't make it in time,
you don't get a bad grade.

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:36.325 position:50% align:center
People don't come home.

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:39.912 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Ma'am, are you okay?

00:18:39.995 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 103A]
I... I think so!

00:18:41.747 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
Shoto. Bakugo.

00:18:43.749 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
I've giving the two of you the
same homework assignment today.

00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:49.296 position:50% align:center
Why am I always getting
lumped together with this idiot?

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
I'm betting it's
somehow connected

00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:52.883 position:50% align:center
to learning Flashfire isn't it?

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
Store up your power.
Condense it, then fire.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.305 position:50% align:center
Be able to release
your maximum output

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:02.226 position:50% align:center
in one flash. Or with
focused precision.

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
First, keep practicing
until you can do

00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:07.105 position:50% align:center
one of those things
without thinking about it.

00:19:07.189 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
Oh! Kacchan, like your
Armor-Piercing Shot!

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
Why do you know
that, you bastard?

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.987 position:50% align:center
Stay outta my business!

00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
Shoto, you're nearly there.

00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
I want you to improve
your precision.

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
You're able to control
the shape of your ice

00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
to a certain extent already.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.499 position:50% align:center
Try doing the same
with your flames.

00:19:28.794 --> 00:19:31.255 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Deku, is it fair
to say you can max out

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:33.215 position:50% align:center
your power in an instant?

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yes.

00:19:34.508 --> 00:19:36.260 position:50% align:center
And you're able to do
so without thinking.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.388 position:50% align:center
Yes. Or... I can
with Full Cowling.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:42.266 position:50% align:center
Air Force still requires
concentration, though.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Then keep
practicing until Air Force

00:19:44.393 --> 00:19:46.562 position:50% align:center
is second nature to you.

00:19:46.645 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
Forget about the
new power for now.

00:19:49.523 --> 00:19:53.318 position:50% align:center
But, sir. You mentioned
parallel processing.

00:19:53.402 --> 00:19:55.529 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] People learn
using parallel processing

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.948 position:50% align:center
every day without realizing it.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
Your subconscious does the work.

00:20:01.118 --> 00:20:03.537 position:50% align:center
Take the man behind
the wheel of that car.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.415 position:50% align:center
He wasn't born
knowing how to drive.

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
Turning the wheel.

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
Pressing the gas
and brake pedals.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.837 position:50% align:center
Noting his surroundings.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.548 position:50% align:center
He learned to do
those things individually,

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
and then eventually learned
to do them reflexively.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] First, you need to be
able to do two things at once

00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:24.016 position:50% align:center
without concentration.

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.894 position:50% align:center
When you master that,
add something else.

00:20:26.977 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
No matter how strong
a power you may have,

00:20:29.438 --> 00:20:33.442 position:50% align:center
its foundation is built on a
steady accumulation of skills.

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
There are exceptions.

00:20:38.447 --> 00:20:39.740 position:50% align:center
But the majority of heroes

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
build their abilities
brick by brick.

00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
At least, that's the only
way I know how to do it.

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
Even if you're using
some of the same concepts

00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:51.460 position:50% align:center
you learned at school,
real world experience

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.295 position:50% align:center
is completely different.

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
Don't forget what you've
picked up in class.

00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.758 position:50% align:center
But get used to being out here.

00:20:57.841 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
'Cause this is real life.

00:21:01.762 --> 00:21:03.305 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I will.

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
All Might gave me so much.

00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
Not just a Quirk.

00:21:08.894 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] And UA has exposed me
to countless lessons.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Sometimes I feel like
I'm being pulled along

00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
at dizzying speeds.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.784 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
But I won't give up.

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:26.954 position:50% align:center
What? Don't worry
if you're up to it yet.

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:30.582 position:50% align:center
Whether the three of you fail
or succeed is absolutely

00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
no reflection on the work
of the number-one hero!

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] That's right.
I'm chasing my dream.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.511 position:50% align:center
Increasing my power
as quickly as I can.

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:47.266 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I'll learn everything there is.

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
One thing at a time.

00:21:50.394 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
I'll go beyond.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.496 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:35.374 position:50% align:center
Ryukyu's agency, where
Uraraka and Asui are doing

00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:38.210 position:50% align:center
their work study, received
a request to team up.

00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:41.672 position:50% align:center
And it came from none other than
the Sea Rescue Hero: Selkie!

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:45.175 position:50% align:center
The mission? Find an
escaped smuggler's ship.

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:48.387 position:50% align:center
I just hope my
classmates are safe!

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.515 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Long Time
No See, Selkie."

00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:54.434 position:50% align:center
A hero doesn't give
up until the end!

00:23:54.518 --> 00:23:56.812 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
