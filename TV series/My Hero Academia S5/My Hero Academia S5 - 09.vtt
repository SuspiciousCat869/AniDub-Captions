[IZUKU] At UA High School,
hero Classes 1-A and 1-B

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:18.810 position:50% align:center
are competing against each
other in combat training.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.895 position:50% align:center
Three matches have passed,
leaving each class

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:23.273 position:50% align:center
with one win,
one loss, and one draw

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
at the beginning of
the fourth round.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center
[JIRO] Wait, bad idea.
Let's talk about this, okay?

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.489 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Yeah, you're not serious, right?

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Shut up.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Just watch me, Deku!

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.388 position:50% align:center
[BONDO]
The stage works for them.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.016 position:50% align:center
With Sero setting traps
and Jiro on recon,

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:24.561 position:50% align:center
this could be way bad.
Like a total pain.

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50% align:center
Plus, there's Sato's strength
and Bakugo's absurd explosions.

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.233 position:50% align:center
It's a super-balanced team.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:33.653 position:50% align:center
We should assume we're dead
if we mess up at all.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.488 position:50% align:center
None of that crap matters.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
Let's just slash 'em
all to pieces.

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.869 position:50% align:center
We'll take 'em by surprise;
the early bird gets the worm.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:50.086 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] Currently, Class A
and Class B are neck and neck

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50% align:center
when you look at the stats.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
But while they may
seem evenly matched,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.592 position:50% align:center
the truth is,
Class A's win was mostly

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.511 position:50% align:center
thanks to Shinso,
so it barely counts!

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:01.806 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I think we all know
what that says about them.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:05.060 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] You've gotta stop rooting
for your class, Mr. Vlad!

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:06.603 position:50% align:center
[MIDNIGHT]
Vlad sure is hot blooded

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.188 position:50% align:center
for someone with blood control.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.482 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
He obviously loves his students.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
A lot.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.777 position:50% align:center
Stop complaining.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.488 position:50% align:center
What?! Sir, this is
a legitimate protest!

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Is this how you'll react

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.532 position:50% align:center
if you mess up in a real fight?

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, Class B
is coming up with plans

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
and countermeasures to win.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Vlad speaks the truth.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
Which means he's
technically beating me.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center
[cackles] Not surprised these
troublemakers can't hack it.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
Wanna know why?

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
The reason you get caught up

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
in so many disasters is
because you're immature.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Class B has been training hard

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
every day to become stronger.

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.438 position:50% align:center
Class A still has
plenty to offer.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.191 position:50% align:center
[MIDNIGHT] You certainly
are sweet on Class A.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
I'm fond of every student!

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
I'm looking forward to seeing

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.532 position:50% align:center
what you do and
what you've learned,

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.033 position:50% align:center
Young Bakugo.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
Why can't you keep up?

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
[JIRO] I'm trying to listen
for sounds while I run.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
You better not fall behind.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
He's expecting people
to follow as usual.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
Hasn't changed much
since the sports festival.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
From a certain point
of view, he is cooperating.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.259 position:50% align:center
Sort of.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Listen up, you underlings!

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
Just follow me when this starts.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.305 position:50% align:center
[SERO] That isn't what
I'd call teamwork.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:25.890 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Did you call us underlings?

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.518 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] I'll take the lead
and head toward the fight.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
Look alive.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
You three better be
ready to support me.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
'Specially you!

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
Make sure you keep track
of the enemy, Ears!

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.610 position:50% align:center
Hey! My name is Jiro.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
[SERO]
Are you gonna charge them?

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
'Cause... the other team looks
really good at counterattacks.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
Jiro's a recon pro.
We should just hold back.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
Play it safe and wait
for an opening.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
Idiot.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
That's exactly what
they're expecting us to do.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
We're not waiting
for the right moment.

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:56.629 position:50% align:center
We're making our own opening.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
If we get eyes
on them, we've won.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Got it?

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
[ALL yelp]

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
[JIRO]
What the heck, man?

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Take those just in case.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
They don't pack much of a punch,

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
but they can be useful.
One more thing.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
[JIRO] Not much of a plan.
Is this gonna work?

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
Got you!

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
Ears!

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
Jiro!

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
They should be around
here somewhere. Find them!

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:43.051 position:50% align:center
[metal clinking]

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center
What's taking so long?

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
Hang on!

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
[JIRO gasps]
This is a trap!

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE]
Hi. And bye!

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI grunts]

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE laughs] I used Jiro's
search ability against her.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
Smart, huh?

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Class B, Setsuna Tokage.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
Hero name: Lizardy.
Quirk: Lizard Tail Splitter.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
She can divide her
entire body into pieces

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
that move at her will!

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE laughs]

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE gasps]

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Since improving her Quirk,

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
she can break into 50
fragments at a time!

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Cheap move.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
[SERO]
Bakugo, down here!

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
Nice, that's checkmate.

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
Glue Squall!

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
Ew, gross!

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
Aw, shoot. This backfired.
We basically built a spiderweb

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
that they've gone
and trapped us in.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.538 position:50% align:center
[BONDO]
Got 'em!

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
I knew Setsuna's plan
would defeat them.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Class B, Kojiro Bondo.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
Hero name: Plamo.
Quirk: Cemedine.

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
He shoots out glue and controls
exactly how fast it dries!

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
Too slow, villains!

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Class B, Togaru Kamakiri.

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
Hero name: Jack Mantis.
Quirk: Razor Sharp.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
He can produce blades
on any part of his body!

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.398 position:50% align:center
[KAMAKIRI yelling]

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE]
I threw off Jiro's abilities

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
by forming a cacophony
of noise around her.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
Then Bondo covered the
pipes and tape with glue.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:30.033 position:50% align:center
One touch and they're
stuck for good.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
[SATO] I'll at least
protect my teammates!

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
[SERO]
Bakugo!

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
[KAMAKIRI]
Just what I hoped for!

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
I'll start with Jiro!

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Save people to win.

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Win to save people.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:08.947 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Are you watching?

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
I've gotten even stronger!

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
[KAMAKIRI yells]

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
One more thing.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
Whenever you guys are
in danger, I'll protect you.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
Managed to block the blast.
Guess bugs have fast reflexes.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:31.928 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Shut it! They got away!

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:37.767 position:50% align:center
Look for them!

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter
if this is just training.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.938 position:50% align:center
I've made a decision.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.318 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] No one will
question our victory.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center
Because our match
is gonna be flawless.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
Four to zero and no injuries!

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
Understand?

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.665 position:50% align:center
That's how somebody with
actual strength competes!

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Sorry, what?

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.838 position:50% align:center
There must be
something in my eyes.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.632 position:50% align:center
Looked like he
protected Jiro just now

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.177 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah he did.
By kicking her.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center
You're getting to see what
our Bakugo is really like.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.599 position:50% align:center
Cool, huh? Don't worry.
Your eyes are fine.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA yells] Are you telling
me he his personality changed?

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
[shrieking]

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
Uh, well.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
I guess what he just
did is kinda new.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
Never seen him put
so much on the line.

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:34.032 position:50% align:center
[KAMAKIRI grunting]

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
[KAMAKIRI] Not smart
to face Bakugo head on.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
Better stay back.

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE] If we fight him
like we expected to,

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50% align:center
we'll definitely
lose this match.

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:49.047 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE]
So, if we can't capture them,

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
we'll retreat and
ambush them repeatedly.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
It's the only way to have
an advantage over them!

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
So loud! But...
there aren't as many.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
And they're moving
further away from us.

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
Then they must be
tryin' to regroup.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50% align:center
Those morons are
underestimating us.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE] Bakugo is the
powerhouse of their team.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
The others are simply following
his lead and trying to keep up.

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
If we focus on Bakugo and
force him to make a mistake,

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
the rest of them won't
stand a chance.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
There are so many
sounds in the way.

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
But... if I concentrate,
I can tell them apart.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.173 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
[BONDO yells]

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.436 position:50% align:center
He was hiding without
making a sound!

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
They turned the tables again!

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
And Construction-Done-Kwik.
My Weldcraft is...

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
...complete!

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Class B, Yosetsu Awase.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
Hero name: Welder. Quirk: Weld.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.410 position:50% align:center
He can fuse things together
at the molecular level!

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
However, in order for
his Quirk to work,

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
he has to touch the
things he wants to weld.

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.208 position:50% align:center
[SERO]
They know us too well.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.295 position:50% align:center
Yeah, like you can
catch me with Tape

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
when there are so many
pipes in the way.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
Was this part of Tokage's plan?
She has everything figured out.

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
Here comes Sugar Rush!

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
You're good.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:32.150 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
You won't stop me, damn it!

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.402 position:50% align:center
You don't have to get so mad.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Handle this guy.

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center
[SERO]
On it.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
You're mine.

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Whenever you guys are in danger,

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
I'll protect you.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
And when I'm in danger...

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
Hope you like my
Heartbeat Surround!

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.421 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
...you guys had better save me!

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.516 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE]
Awase!

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
No! He's headed after Bondo!

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
[BONDO]
Not good!

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
Took me a little
while to get used

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
to fighting in this cold.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.869 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
But I'm finally warmed up!

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.705 position:50% align:center
[BONDO yelping]

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
I got this guy!

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] What unexpected
teamwork from Class A!

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
They managed to take two of
my dear students in an instant!

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
I thought he was a tyrant

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
who couldn't work with others!

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me he's starting
to mellow out now!

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
[JIRO]
Bakugo!

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.310 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE]
He acts on his own accord.

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
While the rest of
them support him.

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.857 position:50% align:center
I thought if we found
a small opening

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
we could widen it slowly
until they break down.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
But look at them!

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
X-Catapult!

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE]
How is this team so in sync?

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.755 position:50% align:center
Bakugo trusts his teammates

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
so he doesn't have
to do it all alone!

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.592 position:50% align:center
Being in the band
loosened him up.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.719 position:50% align:center
But he's still
driving the beat.

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
[SERO] Tokage's Quirk lets her
split her body into 50 pieces,

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
which she controls from afar.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
The parts that leave
her stop moving

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center
after a set amount of time.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
And then she regenerates
them onto her main body.

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing about
a couple of things here.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.284 position:50% align:center
But I'm betting that she can't
regrow those pieces forever.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
I think she's like Yaoyorozu.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
When she's tired,
she probably loses focus.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
If she split herself as much
as she could to make noise,

00:13:56.211 --> 00:14:00.131 position:50% align:center
then I figure it'll be harder
for her to fight at full power.

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
In that case, wouldn't
she bring some back

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
to her body to reset the timer?

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
And save her stamina so she
can keep using her Quirk!

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center
Jiro said it sounded like there
were fewer noises around.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
Which just proves my theory!

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
That was close!

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:25.532 position:50% align:center
No. You're kidding!

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.867 position:50% align:center
How have you changed this much?

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] I haven't changed.
My goal's always been the same.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] To surpass All Might
and become the number-one hero.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
The horror. The shame.

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
[door clangs]

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:53.059 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] The match didn't
even last five minutes!

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
Thanks to unexpected teamwork,

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
Class A wins with the day's
first perfect score

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.025 position:50% align:center
of four to zero!

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.996 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
You didn't do unnecessary damage

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
and you neutralized your
opponents efficiently.

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
Bakugo may have taken the lead,
but you three supported him.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
Solid win. Great job today.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING] Given what you
knew about the other team,

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
you came up with a strategy that
should have given you an edge.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.430 position:50% align:center
[growls] But you were stuck
on it and needed to be

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center
more flexible, like Honenuki!

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry that I made
our team look lame.

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
I failed.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:38.104 position:50% align:center
No, let's carve this
loss into our hearts

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.189 position:50% align:center
and learn from it!

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.442 position:50% align:center
If a monster like Bakugo
turns into a team player,

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:44.361 position:50% align:center
there's no weakness
for us to exploit.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:45.695 position:50% align:center
[KAMAKIRI]
Afraid that's true.

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
[BONDO]
I agree.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.074 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE sighs]

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
Kacchan, you can play with
others when you want to!

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:54.704 position:50% align:center
And Jiro, you were a
total heroine out there!

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.373 position:50% align:center
Nope. I'm a hero.

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
[SERO] Our resident delinquent,
taking in the strays.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.877 position:50% align:center
Nope. Not a stray, dude.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
You gave me chills.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:13.181 position:50% align:center
What, you catch
a cold or somethin'?

00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
Kacchan!

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
Outta my way!

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:19.229 position:50% align:center
Uh... I'm not in front of you,
so what does that even mean?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI sighs]
I'm pushing ahead.

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You were amazing!

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
Huh. I'm moving so fast,
you won't be able to catch up.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
Yes I will.

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
Shut it, nerd!

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center
Dumb words don't mean anything!
I won't let you beat me.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
You're trash! A fricken' extra.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.127 position:50% align:center
Just watch me.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
You have a good
childhood friend in him.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Damn it!

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:53.430 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] If only he
were a tad more polite.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
I can't believe that hysterical
rage monster was a team player.

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center
Since when does he strategize?

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
[TOKAGE]
Monoma. Apologies.

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
With one win,
two losses, and one draw,

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
Class B can only
hope to tie now.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.203 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] What are you
apologizing for, my dear Tokage?

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:18.413 position:50% align:center
Our immature compatriot

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
reflected on his
actions and evolved.

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
It's a marvelous thing.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
While it's true that Class B
can't win anymore,

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
we still haven't lost yet!

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
The people will see!

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
Win or lose,
we'll prove our point.

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
We're hardworking students who
never cause an ounce of trouble.

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.639 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, Class A gets
undeserved attention

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
because they're disasters!

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:41.811 position:50% align:center
Who is on the better path?

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
Everyone is a side character
in other people's stories.

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:49.611 position:50% align:center
But we are each the
protagonist of our own lives!

00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
So what's the plan?

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
You're killing my vibe!

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
I think we should
do something similar

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:57.660 position:50% align:center
to Tokage's team, even though
it didn't work out for them.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
Our team's a lot like theirs
was in terms of balance

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:01.915 position:50% align:center
compared to our opponents.

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
We've got a group that
excels at technical Quirks,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.252 position:50% align:center
so it would be better for us
to hide ourselves and attack

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center
when we can surprise them.

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
We have five people.
So that gives us the upper hand.

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for us
to choose close combat.

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI] There's a difficult
fight ahead of us.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
Don't you think
Midoriya's spooky?

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
He's "spooky"?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.269 position:50% align:center
Oh. She loves spooky stuff.
It's kind of her thing.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Midoriya, huh?

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI] Considering his
mobility and combat skills,

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
he's the same if not
better than Bakugo.

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:37.158 position:50% align:center
And apparently, he's learned
a long-distance attack,

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
so he doesn't even
need to get close.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
We stumble even a little,

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
and it'll end up
like the last match.

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
He'll destroy us.

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
True. So we'll make
Midoriya our top priority.

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
No matter what the others do,
we'll take him down first.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
At the Sports Festival,

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
he was able to break
free of my Quirk.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
But... if we use Brainwashing

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
in conjunction with Monoma's
power, I think we can take him.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] Lotta pressure when
you single me out like that.

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
It's possible it'll
be a blank on my end.

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:09.816 position:50% align:center
A "blank"?

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
Meaning he won't be able
to copy Midoriya's Quirk.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] Well, we won't
be able to do anything

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
unless we stop him somehow.

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
We're counting on you, Shinso.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
Match Five. It's down to this.

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
The new guy. How's he doing?

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
This battle will determine
if he'll be able

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
to transfer into
the hero course.

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
He already showed that
he could hold his own

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.550 position:50% align:center
in the first match.

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
But I doubt he can use
the same trick.

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
They know it now.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Agreed.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
[MIDNIGHT] The Class A team
is fairly stacked.

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
I hope the boy fairs well.

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
Yeah, so, we should just start

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
by going after Shinso, right?

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda freaking out
about that weirdo.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:54.235 position:50% align:center
I don't want him snooping
around in my head!

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:57.155 position:50% align:center
Don't get too hung up on
one member of their team.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
The've got a bunch of people
who can attack from anywhere

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:02.744 position:50% align:center
and catch us by surprise without
giving away their location.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
And we make things... float!

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:06.498 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Melt!

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
Stick!

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:13.254 position:50% align:center
Not great.

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
Now I'm bummed.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:18.635 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] We can't lie
in wait and can't attack.

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
Then we should go
with my special

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
Pop Off Vineyard Operation
and kick their butts!

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
No one's going to fall for that.

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
We should find them first
and make them fall into a trap!

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
No sweat.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
I can act as the bait.

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Deku!

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec.

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
Didn't you say your Quirk was
acting weird or something?

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:44.661 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But I think it's fine now.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] After watching
that fourth match,

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.708 position:50% align:center
I think the other team will
be on guard around me.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
They don't want a repeat Bakugo.

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
I need to move even
more than usual!

00:20:54.421 --> 00:21:00.260 position:50% align:center
You sure you'll be okay?
We're all counting on you!

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:04.806 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.
We can definitely win!

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo!

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
Weren't you girls just saying
we're not suited for this?

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Everything feels normal.

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
I'm pushing ahead.

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] I'm moving so fast,
you won't be able to catch up.

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
After hearing Kacchan talk,

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.874 position:50% align:center
I can't embarrass myself!

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:39.591 position:50% align:center
It's now time for the fifth
and final training match!

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.515 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
This one's for all the glory.

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
Do your best until
the last student's down!

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.400 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Begin!

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:31.369 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:34.539 position:50% align:center
We're finally starting the last
match of team combat training.

00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:38.084 position:50% align:center
Class A will technically come
out on top if we tie or win.

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:39.669 position:50% align:center
Though we can't let
our guards down.

00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:41.588 position:50% align:center
The Class B team has Shinso.

00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:45.216 position:50% align:center
And Monoma, who has the
ability to copy Quirks.

00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:49.012 position:50% align:center
I'm the key to our victory.
And I will not fail!

00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:51.681 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"That Which Is Inherited."

00:23:51.723 --> 00:23:52.891 position:50% align:center
In the middle of the fight,

00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:55.393 position:50% align:center
something strange
wells up inside me.

00:23:55.435 --> 00:23:57.604 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
