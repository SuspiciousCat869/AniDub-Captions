Well, I wasn't expecting
to find you here.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.242 position:50% align:center
The League of Villains.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50% align:center
Dabi!

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
You killed Snatch.
He was a good hero.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50% align:center
Snatch, huh?
That doesn't ring a bell.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.839 position:50% align:center
Why don't we forget about him
and have a friendly chat.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
Who knows when we'll
get another chance.

--[ENDEAVOR grunts]
--You can't fight like this.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:54.554 position:50% align:center
Just recover your
strength for now.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:57.265 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of this guy.

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center
I only have
small feathers left,

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.311 position:50% align:center
but I should be able
to buy us some time.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
Aw, no need for heroics.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.441 position:50% align:center
The only reason I'm here
is to retrieve my fallen Nomu.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.943 position:50% align:center
I mean, no way I could
win this fight, right?

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.278 position:50% align:center
Unless the top two heroes

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.238 position:50% align:center
were bloodied and
beaten already.

[MIRKO]
Saw the news and hopped over!

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.669 position:50% align:center
Patchwork, you're part
of the League, huh?

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:26.795 position:50% align:center
I'll kick your butt!

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:29.839 position:50% align:center
Man. And things were
just gettin' good.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.466 position:50% align:center
Do it, Ujiko.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.303 position:50% align:center
[DABI]
See ya later, Number One.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:38.306 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we'll have time to
have a heart-to-heart someday.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
I look forward to it.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
Until then.
Try not to disappoint.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:46.648 position:50% align:center
And don't you dare
get killed, Enji Todoroki!

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
Tell us where your friends are!

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.406 position:50% align:center
[MIRKO]
Vanished.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.866 position:50% align:center
It's the same way they bounced
out of Camino that day.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.410 position:50% align:center
Whatever the case,

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.870 position:50% align:center
we managed to stop
that juiced up Nomu.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:06.209 position:50% align:center
Idiot. This is
just the beginning.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] That wasn't how you
said things would play out.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.646 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that a fact?

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer it if you and I
got along better, Dabi.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
[DABI] Thought you only
had small feathers left

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.277 position:50% align:center
after that battle.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
If I'm going to meet a liar
in a secret location,

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.532 position:50% align:center
I'm not coming unarmed.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:04.786 position:50% align:center
The fight was supposed to go
down at a warehouse tomorrow.

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:08.248 position:50% align:center
Instead you unleashed a Nomu
in the middle of the city.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
One on a totally different level
than the others we've faced.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
If we're going to
trust each other,

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
you have to keep me up to date.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
I guess I had a sudden
change of heart.

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
But I did give you
advance warning

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
I wanted to test the
new Nomu in the field.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
Besides, you're not
without blame yourself.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
You said you'd bring
a random pro along.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect
the number-one hero.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
Now that's not very fair.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
Your beast gave Endeavor
severe injuries.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd be thrilled
to give him such a work out.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
I did what you asked of me.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
You're the only one who
broke a promise here.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.241 position:50% align:center
Think of it as me
testing our pet pro

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
to see if I can
actually trust his word.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but notice you
saved a couple of bystanders.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
You came to us saying you
sympathize with our cause,

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
yet you fought so hard today.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
I'm no good to you
if the hero community

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
loses its faith in my work.

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
The more they trust me,

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
the more intel I'll be
able to collect on them.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
You know that.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50% align:center
Unless you're incapable
of thinking long-term.

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
Everything I do is in the name
of advancing the League. Got it?

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
Sure. Say that all you want,

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
but I can't let you
see the boss yet.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50% align:center
I'll be in touch, partner.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
[COMMISSION LEADER]
We need you to infiltrate

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
the League of Villains.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
Uh, you're gonna
have to explain.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
'Cause that sounds crazy.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
Aren't you forming a
search team to find them?

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
Like with Gran Torino
and the others?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.209 position:50% align:center
Where did you hear about that?

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
We need your assistance.
It's vital, Hawks.

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center
You've just proven how sharp
your eyes and ears are.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
At the Camino battle,

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
we had to consider the safety
of the kidnapping victim,

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:46.471 position:50% align:center
so we rushed the operation
and didn't gather enough intel.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
We misread their strength.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
To truly stamp out these
dark organizations,

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50% align:center
we need more information.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.730 position:50% align:center
Especially about that
bioengineered human.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
Was that thing made using
just All For One's power?

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
If we don't learn
everything we can

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
about the League,
then we'll just keep

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.864 position:50% align:center
making the same mistakes.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
So you want me to get close
to them, but expect me

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
to sit back and ignore
all the harm they cause?

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center
We're asking you
because we think

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
you're someone
who can ignore it.

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
You're indifferent
to prestige and fame,

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
and you have your eyes fixed
on your long-term goal.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
We think there's no one
more suitable than you.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.265 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
I'm sorry, Endeavor.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
Really. I am.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
Oh, that was Snatch.
The sand guy, right?

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.402 position:50% align:center
Have you ever thought
about the families

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
of those you murdered
in cold blood?

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
[DABI laughs] I've thought
about is so much,

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
it's driven me insane.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Isn't this great?

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
You only had to stay
in there for two days.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
Bonus, your left
eye's still working,

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.634 position:50% align:center
which is honestly surprising.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. This was
all my fault.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50% align:center
Don't flatter yourself.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
My injuries are
my own responsibility.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. Can I borrow that line

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
the next time I get
the crap beat outta me?

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
Focus on what's important.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:22.901 position:50% align:center
That Nomu came straight for us.
As if it knew where we were.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
The exact moment we
were talking about it.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
An odd coincidence,
wouldn't you say?

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
Meh. The two new top heroes

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.244 position:50% align:center
walking around together
in broad daylight?

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
We just drew too much attention

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
and they decided
to take a swipe at us.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.961 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Drop it. I made a scene
while we were on the streets

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
just so I could make
this flimsy excuse.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I was thinking, it's
possible that the Nomu rumors

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
themselves are being used
as bait to catch heroes.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.972 position:50% align:center
I think we should contact the
team searching for the League

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.516 position:50% align:center
and get more info.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
You should be more careful.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.644 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Hm?

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] If you plan
to keep investigating this,

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
you're going to need
someone to back you up.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
A hero who can stop
a Nomu like that.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
Aw! And you care about me
so much, you'll be my bodyguard!

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
That's so nice!

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
I'll incinerate you.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Once my feathers grow back,

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50% align:center
I can start patrolling again.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.539 position:50% align:center
It'll probably take
another day or so.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
Can't wait.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR grumbles]

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
And what about you, huh?
Takin' some R n' R, big guy?

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Possibly.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
'Kay! Catch you later, then!

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Is this absolutely necessary?

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:36.433 position:50% align:center
This is a proposition.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
By going after the League of
Villains from both the inside

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:41.813 position:50% align:center
and the outside, we can cut off
their retreat and box them in.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
Really? Heh.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
You're calling it a proposition

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.569 position:50% align:center
even though you know I
can't possibly refuse you.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.487 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a laugh.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.282 position:50% align:center
I won't try to deny that.
You're not wrong there.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
We got lucky you weren't able to
make it to the fight in Camino.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
[SAFETY COMMISSION MEMBER 90A]
A kid?

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
You mean a child saved everyone?

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
[SAFETY COMMISSION MEMBER 90B]
That accident was terrible.

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.464 position:50% align:center
[CHAIRWOMAN] Find the child
who saved all those people.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
Immediately.

My name is Hawks. A man

I want to live in
a world where heroes

Sorry, Sis, but I'm out.

Ignore them, Shoto.

training you for.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
For some reason,
Mom and Sis are both

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.168 position:50% align:center
ready to forgive you
for how you treated us.

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
But to me, you're still
the maniac bastard

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
who ruined our family.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:14.716 position:50% align:center
You look like you're different,
but you don't act that way.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
You neglected us.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
Even if you're the
number-one hero,

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
that doesn't erase the past.

Shoto's crying.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
What happened to our

You may have had
a change of heart,

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
but you can't waltz in here
and think we'll accept you.

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
How disgusting can you be?

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center
I plan to be your father now
and atone for what I did.

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
Well, that went terribly.

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50% align:center
Shoto started visiting Mom
on a regular basis,

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
and Dad is compromising
and making an effort.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
Mom's even started
acting more cheerful.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
I thought... maybe
we could act like

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
a real family
for once, you know.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
I was just looking
forward to it so much,

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
weren't you? Weren't you, Shoto?

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
You know, I think that
was the first time

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
I've ever seen Natsu
show that much emotion.

continue to evolve rapidly.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
You're sure that he's okay?

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
He was covered
in blood by the end.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.872 position:50% align:center
I can't believe he
didn't arrest anyone

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50% align:center
from the League.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:29.958 position:50% align:center
[MAN 90B]
I thought we already caught

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
a ton of those Nomu things.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
Why was he having such
a hard time with one?

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50% align:center
[NEWSCASTER 90A]
Despite his win...

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:36.756 position:50% align:center
Turn that thing off!

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.174 position:50% align:center
No.

Do you know what
he's doing right now?

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
Endeavor's risking his
life for our sakes.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
Look at him!

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
I used to be a huge
fan of Edge Shot.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
But Endeavor's totally
my top hero after that.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.729 position:50% align:center
I was actually
super excited to see

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
representation for fire-types.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.274 position:50% align:center

"Look Boy's" passion!

Who's "Look Boy?"
Some new hero?

[NEWSCASTER 90A] The child now
known by the nickname "Look Boy"

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
struck a chord with many
during the fight.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.742 position:50% align:center
However, we must not
forget that Endeavor...

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:05.744 position:50% align:center
That's the boy
I met on the street.

below the top hero, assisted.

[ENDEAVOR] A change
is coming. I can feel it.

Some unseen thing you
built up in your prime

[MAN 90C] It's the dawn
of the Age of Endeavor.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.718 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] Endeavor,

[TODOROKI] But, that's
not who's standing here.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
I have to agree
with what Natsu said.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
I still can't forgive you
for what you did to Mom.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
And that's my choice to make.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:40.153 position:50% align:center
As for being my "father?"

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
I'll have to watch your actions
to see if you earn that.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.285 position:50% align:center
Because I know something
small can change a person.

If they want it to.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] I didn't become
Number One the way I wanted to.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
So my hero work is
tainted with shame.

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
What is my power even for?

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:05.011 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Why is it so
important to be the strongest?

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Endeavor.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:11.935 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you have a reason.
If you look inside yourself.

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] When he said that,
what suddenly came to mind

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.316 position:50% align:center
was one resounding thought.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.027 position:50% align:center
"I must guarantee their future."

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] If that's the job
of the pro at the top...

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] ...then I've
failed with my own family.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:35.667 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] How can I demand
forgiveness after so long?

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI]
Dad? You haven't eaten yet.

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:41.172 position:50% align:center
I want you to know.
I'm sorry for everything.

[gasps]

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
And I should have
handled that conversation

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
with Natsuo differently.

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Even if it is too late,

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
I'll try to make amends.
It's my only path forward.

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.696 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] That same night,
after basic physical training,

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
I worked on One For All
until I was exhausted.

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
And passed out
on top of my sheets.

[IZUKU gasps]

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I had a dream.

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.300 position:50% align:center
There was a beautiful woman

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:27.927 position:50% align:center
with a fierce expression
on her face next to me.

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:31.848 position:50% align:center
Beyond her were other people
I didn't recognize at first.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Wait, they're...

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.938 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I'd had a vision
like this before.

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:43.151 position:50% align:center
But this dream was much
clearer than that one.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
They were the vestiges
of One For All.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center
I can't talk, but I can
move my right arm.

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
What's up with my feet?

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
There are two more
I can't make out.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
One person improves the power.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
Then hands it off
to another person.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
It continues to grow
as it's passed along.

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
It is this cultivated
power that allows me

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
to save those who are
in need of a hero.

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
The truth behind my strength.

[IZUKU] All For One called
him "little brother."

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:50.635 position:50% align:center
Is he the first?

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:53.179 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE]
What a callous thing to say.

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to
compromise with you.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
But let me guess:

00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
tolerance is not part of your
rigid sense of "justice."

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
The world is falling
apart right now;

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
it's in utter chaos,
but Meta powers

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
shouldn't be used to
further self-interest.

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
You're only thinking
about how you can

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
fulfill your own desires!

[IZUKU] Neither of them

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.887 position:50% align:center
But he was persecuted.
Called "sick" and "a monster."

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
Even his parents
have abandoned him.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
This man has no abilities.

On his way home
from work one evening,

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
he was attacked
by a gang of Metas.

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:47.192 position:50% align:center
His stun gun was
rendered useless,

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
and the tentacle-like hair
of an assailant held him down

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.155 position:50% align:center
as he was beaten.

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center

Just do it.

[ALL FOR ONE] If I'm ever in
need, will you lend me your aid?

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course I will.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
I can go home. Thank you.

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center
I'll help, too.

I'm forever in your debt

Is this the world
you call chaotic?

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
It doesn't seem so
to me, brother.

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
I saw two people in need

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
and helped both of them
using my ability.

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
I'm no fool. You don't
care about them;

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center
you're just adding lackeys
to your collection.

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
I do need people I can
trust and depend on.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.210 position:50% align:center
For someone so concerned
with righteousness, though,

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center
why do you ignore the joy
my power brings them?

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
The concept of humanity
is broken in this world.

I can use my power to
restore a sense of order.

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
So which one of us
is actually indulging

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
in self-interest, would you say?

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
What kind of order is it

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
if you're taking
advantage of people?

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
Do you even remember how many
innocents you've toyed with

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center

But it wasn't by my hand
that they lost their lives.
