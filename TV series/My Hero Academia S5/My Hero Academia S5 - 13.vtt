00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:17.017 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] A tragedy
occurred in Deika City.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.604 position:50% align:center
And unbeknownst to us,
it was merely the prologue

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.273 position:50% align:center
of a greater cataclysm to come.

00:00:47.631 --> 00:01:02.479 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.076 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] Now what was it you
were saying about getting away?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.037 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A] That's it.
I'm through playin' around!

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.251 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Flashfreeze Heatwave!

00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:50.170 position:50% align:center
[MC 101A]
Wow. Pro-level work

00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:53.173 position:50% align:center
mere minutes after earning
provisional licenses!

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:55.676 position:50% align:center
This morning we welcome
two students from UA.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center
Young heroes who recently took
down some rampaging villains.

00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:01.640 position:50% align:center
Shoto Todoroki
and Katsuki Bakugo.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.809 position:50% align:center
What a pleasure it is
to have you join us.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50% align:center
Tch.

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:07.354 position:50% align:center
Uh... You must have bonded
during your training,

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.439 position:50% align:center
given how well you
worked together, huh?

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:10.941 position:50% align:center
Does it look that way to you?

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
Ya better get your eyes and
head checked out soon then.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
That's right, we're friends.

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Where the hell
do you get off

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.366 position:50% align:center
making up random crap like
that, you icy-hot idiot?

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.701 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] We've spent
a lot of time together

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
in our supplementary classes.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.996 position:50% align:center
Because the school
forced us to!

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.415 position:50% align:center
Training beside each other
doesn't mean we're friends!

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:27.708 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
How do you define friendship?

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:28.876 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
I don't know!

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.170 position:50% align:center
You should get your
brain checked, too!

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.510 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] It was the end of
December, with a few short days

00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:41.263 position:50% align:center
left until the second
term came to a close.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.265 position:50% align:center
[MC 101A] You must have bonded
during your training,

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
given how well you
worked together, huh?

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
That's right, we're friends.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.188 position:50% align:center
[MC 101A]
It must've been frightening.

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:51.023 position:50% align:center
No. Not frightening.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:53.150 position:50% align:center
I've been taught to focus
on the task at hand.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.862 position:50% align:center
[MC 101A] This next
question's for Todoroki.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.739 position:50% align:center
They were interviewed
for an entire hour,

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
but all Bakugo's
answers were trashed!

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:04.286 position:50% align:center
He's just an angry
blip in the corner.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.205 position:50% align:center
Why'd they cut me out?

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50% align:center
Honestly, they kind of
did him a big favor.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
And he'd already done two
interviews before this one.

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
So much for racking up any
good press over that throw down.

00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:16.882 position:50% align:center
[NEWSCASTER 101A]
They're newly-minted,

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.176 position:50% align:center
but those students
were reliable.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
It's my sincere hope
that they're able to work

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
as actual pros
in the near future.

00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:26.767 position:50% align:center
We must not have a repeat of
what happened in Deika City.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.645 position:50% align:center
It's been nine days since
that fateful incident,

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:33.106 position:50% align:center
when a riot of only 20
people destroyed the city

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
in scarcely less than an hour.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
I heard that the damage
in Deika City was worse

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.613 position:50% align:center
than in Camino, but since
it was less populated,

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
there were fewer casualties.

00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:42.658 position:50% align:center
And to blame?

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.202 position:50% align:center
Villains hoping to lower the
public's estimation of heroes

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
through destruction and
the loss of innocent life.

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:51.250 position:50% align:center
It's foolish to blame the heroes
of Deika for this event.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
In my opinion, the whole system
needs to be reformed.

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:56.380 position:50% align:center
Don't hate on the heroes
for doing their best.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.382 position:50% align:center
It's not like they
have office gigs.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.384 position:50% align:center
I hope this makes them
wanna work even harder!

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.929 position:50% align:center
We keep doing our best as
long as the pros do, too.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.806 position:50% align:center
[NEWSCASTER 101A] Let's ask
our commentator, Kuraishisu,

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
what he has to say.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
In the past, if there
was an incident

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.645 position:50% align:center
with this many casualties,
everyone would be blaming

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.147 position:50% align:center
the heroes for their
ineptitude in the field.

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.275 position:50% align:center
But right now,
I suppose you could say

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.527 position:50% align:center
we're at a critical
juncture in time.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.820 position:50% align:center
For the most part,

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.823 position:50% align:center
I've seen more encouragement
than disapproval.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
Ever since that
"Look! Boy" was on TV,

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
people have been
seeing things differently!

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:28.871 position:50% align:center
Look at him!

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:30.956 position:50% align:center
Do you know what
he's doing right now?

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
Endeavor's risking
his life for our sakes.

00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:37.171 position:50% align:center
He made everyone root
for the new number one!

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY]
Not so fast, kids.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.177 position:50% align:center
It may look like there's
a renewed love of heroes.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
But think about why.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
The world's on fire
and everyone's scared.

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
Are people cheering for pros
they've got ample faith in?

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:54.146 position:50% align:center
Or are they praying desperately
we don't get our butts kicked?

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.732 position:50% align:center
Our job's been more about
celebrity in past years.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.735 position:50% align:center
Now the world wants
to see real heroes again.

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:01.278 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Whoa, Mt. Lady?

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.863 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.699 position:50% align:center
Mt. Lady has dropped in
as a guest instructor.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
She'll teach you how
to deal with publicity,

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:10.454 position:50% align:center
and Midnight's
here to assist her.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.456 position:50% align:center
What publicity?
I keep getting cut!

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.291 position:50% align:center
Maybe you'll do
better after training!

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
I'm psyched to see her,
but isn't she

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:18.170 position:50% align:center
the most celebrity-obsessed
pro there is?

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
Quiet, shrimp.

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:22.466 position:50% align:center
Today's lesson is Media 101,

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.635 position:50% align:center
taught by an active pro
and obscenely gorgeous

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.220 position:50% align:center
hot commodity named "me,"

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:29.515 position:50% align:center
the perfect person to show you
how to behave like savvy heroes.

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:31.850 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what
we're gonna be doing,

00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
but let's do our best
and go Plus Ultra, you guys!

00:06:35.187 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:39.733 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY]
In today's class,

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
you'll all be practicing
hero interviews!

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.779 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.281 position:50% align:center
Shoto, my dear. You first.

00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:47.533 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:53.830 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY] My goodness!
You were amazing out there!

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
Wait, what are
you talking about?

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:58.335 position:50% align:center
Pretend you just finished
up a big mission! Go!

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.628 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.796 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY]
Tell us, Shoto.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
What kind of hero
would you like to be?

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess...

00:07:04.675 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
A hero who makes
people feel safer?

00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:09.513 position:50% align:center
Lovely. Problem is,
if a handsome boy like you

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.557 position:50% align:center
showed up to save me,
I'm afraid my heart

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.975 position:50% align:center
would go into overdrive.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.227 position:50% align:center
Oh, do you have heart problems?

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY]
So dense. But cute.

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:19.231 position:50% align:center
He's just my type.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
And what kind of ultimate
moves are you working with?

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.285 position:50% align:center
Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:34.454 position:50% align:center
I can use it to cover a wide
area and to stop villains.

00:07:34.538 --> 00:07:36.415 position:50% align:center
Plus, it can be used
as a platform.

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.959 position:50% align:center
Additionally, I'm working
to refine a move

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.128 position:50% align:center
called Flashfreeze Heatwave.

00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:44.798 position:50% align:center
And hey, what about
the other fire one

00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:47.134 position:50% align:center
he used in the fight
against Class B?

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
That's not originally his.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.096 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Flashfire Fist!

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.974 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Flashfire Fist
is my old man's move.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:54.975 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Oh.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:58.729 position:50% align:center
Flashfire Fist. Jetburn!

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
The problem is,
I'm nowhere near his level.

00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:08.030 position:50% align:center
Which is why I have to
start aiming even higher.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:11.200 position:50% align:center
I'm not really here to
discuss your family issues.

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:12.701 position:50% align:center
And if you want
people to feel safe,

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.578 position:50% align:center
I'd recommend smiling
at least once.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.996 position:50% align:center
You flash those pearly whites

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.999 position:50% align:center
and the ladies will
drop dead, ya feel me?

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:20.876 position:50% align:center
If I smile, then they'll die?

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.503 position:50% align:center
Moving on!

00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:25.631 position:50% align:center
So when we do an interview
we show off our moves?

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.424 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY]
Sweet baby first years.

00:08:27.508 --> 00:08:28.926 position:50% align:center
Remember, you're
just starting out.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
It's not like everyone
knows who you are!

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:34.640 position:50% align:center
Your ultimate moves are like
your personal calling cards.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:38.018 position:50% align:center
People won't forget you
if you show off your assets.

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:40.354 position:50% align:center
They're also handy when
teaming up with others.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.648 position:50% align:center
And as ways to frighten
off villains, too.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:46.068 position:50% align:center
Those moves help people learn
to trust you with their lives.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.903 position:50% align:center
We don't yell out the
names of our attacks

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50% align:center
just because it sounds cool.

00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure that,
until recently,

00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:55.285 position:50% align:center
she didn't think about anything
except how she looked on camera.

00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:57.496 position:50% align:center
It's not just Mt. Lady.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
Hm?

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Right now, all the
pros are being challenged

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
to do better. Endeavor's
ascent is motivating them.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:10.050 position:50% align:center
Now then, let's keep the
interviews comin,' shall we!

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] I chose my hero name
because it was my brother's,

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:14.096 position:50% align:center
and I want to live up
to the honor and passion

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:15.556 position:50% align:center
he embodied as Ingenium.

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:17.266 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY]
You're oozing with sincerity!

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
My name is Creati, and
your safety is guaranteed

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:22.104 position:50% align:center
thanks to my
encyclopedic knowledge.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY] Confidence makes
people rely on you!

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:27.317 position:50% align:center
Hi there, I'm Uravity!
My Quirk is Zero Gravity!

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:28.402 position:50% align:center
And when I'm around,

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
your problems and fears
are weightless.

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY] Aw, everyone
loves a gentle hero.

00:09:32.531 --> 00:09:34.491 position:50% align:center
Jet-Black Hero: Tsukuyomi.

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
Glory is reserved for those
who have touched darkness.

00:09:37.536 --> 00:09:39.663 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY]
Whoo boy! Talk about a mood!

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.999 position:50% align:center
I'm Red Riot, the Sturdy Hero.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.543 position:50% align:center
I'm an impenetrable
wall of protection!

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.420 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY]
If you say so, boss!

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
I'm the acid master! Pinky!

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.758 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] And I'm shocking!
I'm Stun Gun Hero: Chargebolt!

00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:54.720 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY] Get it, guys!
I was afraid you'd be hopeless.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.847 position:50% align:center
But you're killing this lesson!

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna say
stupid stuff like that!

00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:01.185 position:50% align:center
Shut your trap and trust me.

00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:03.729 position:50% align:center
You're just as bad in an
interview by yourself, huh?

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.272 position:50% align:center
I think I understand now,

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
you just have a
problem with humanity.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.359 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Bakugo.

00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
You were completely cut
because I was there.

00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:14.281 position:50% align:center
You're not so great! I don't
give a damn what you think

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.992 position:50% align:center
and I definitely don't
want your apologies!

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.327 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Okay.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.871 position:50% align:center
Aizawa, maybe it would
be prudent to teach Bakugo

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:24.249 position:50% align:center
to follow your lead and
avoid the media entirely.

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:26.627 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] No. I think
there's someone else

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.505 position:50% align:center
he should be learning
from right now.

00:10:29.588 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY]
Deku, yes?

00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:34.218 position:50% align:center
What a treat.
I saw you in action.

00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
I'm glad. Really glad.

00:10:36.762 --> 00:10:38.222 position:50% align:center
Just super glad.

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:39.640 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we'd all love to know

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.350 position:50% align:center
what was going
through your head.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:44.144 position:50% align:center
Just that I'm still glad.

00:10:44.228 --> 00:10:46.605 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] Holy crap, when'd he
learn how to use my Quirk?

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
He's just so nervous.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.358 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
he probably hasn't done
anything like this before.

00:10:51.944 --> 00:10:53.654 position:50% align:center
Many viewers have noted
that your moves

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:56.365 position:50% align:center
seem to be based on
All Might's patented combat.

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:57.616 position:50% align:center
Do you admire him?

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.619 position:50% align:center
[MT. LADY]
And now you're yelling.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:02.454 position:50% align:center
But I didn't want to
just copy All Might,

00:11:02.538 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
so I tried to customize my moves
so they feel unique to me

00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:07.376 position:50% align:center
while also being
true homages to him.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.503 position:50% align:center
For example, with Delaware
Smash, I chose a state

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.213 position:50% align:center
that All Might didn't
name an ultimate after

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
so it feels like
I made it my own.

00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
And recently, I've
incorporated part of that move

00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
into some other things
I'm working on...

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
So chatty.

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center
I meant to you ask about his
power that went out of control.

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
You said he's made progress.
But is he okay?

00:11:33.402 --> 00:11:36.238 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] That Quirk
isn't just about strength.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Right. One For All's new power.

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:49.626 position:50% align:center
Like I did before
the training match.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.004 position:50% align:center
I don't sense
Blackwhip anymore.

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:56.133 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] In the two weeks since
the new power appeared,

00:11:56.216 --> 00:12:00.304 position:50% align:center
I've been visualizing
it every day.

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
It's inside me somewhere.

00:12:02.598 --> 00:12:04.850 position:50% align:center
That man said to
master the ability.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
That it's waiting for me.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
Along with others.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
I put a lock on it,
but it's still there.

00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:14.693 position:50% align:center
And if I'm the one
who imprisoned it,

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:18.906 position:50% align:center
I can choose when to
use it and when not to.

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
I just have to open the lock.

00:12:22.034 --> 00:12:24.286 position:50% align:center
Now. The same way
I trained to control

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:27.039 position:50% align:center
a percentage of One For All.

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
I'll concentrate and only use
the amount of Blackwhip

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.919 position:50% align:center
that I can manage
safely at this time.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:39.176 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.181 position:50% align:center
I did it! Yeah!

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:51.605 position:50% align:center
Sure it was just a tiny whisp,
but that's the first step

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.524 position:50% align:center
to one day controlling
this power!

00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:55.734 position:50% align:center
[MIDNIGHT, MT. LADY]
Seriously?

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] Don't be happy
about something so weak.

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:05.244 position:50% align:center
[NEZU]
Were you up all night again?

00:13:05.327 --> 00:13:07.621 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, Principal!

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.957 position:50% align:center
It's bad for your coat
if you don't get rest.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
No, no, I'm sleeping fine!
No need to be concerned!

00:13:13.377 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
It looks like you've chosen
"Gaunt" as your new hero name.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.049 position:50% align:center
People will worry.

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:24.429 position:50% align:center
Uh. There's not much recorded
from the early days, so...

00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:26.515 position:50% align:center
Did you need something, sir?

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
I have an announcement to share.

00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:31.979 position:50% align:center
Very soon, we'll restart
the work studies program.

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hero work
studies? Really?

00:13:47.828 --> 00:13:49.705 position:50% align:center
I have several questions.

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:53.292 position:50% align:center
 We're resuming the work studies
program this quickly?

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.960 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Don't you have
a chair somewhere?

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.045 position:50% align:center
But it's so much warmer
to be snuggled inside

00:13:57.129 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
your binding cloths.

00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:00.591 position:50% align:center
We originally decided
to pause the program

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center
after talking with the agencies.

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:05.137 position:50% align:center
We wanted to
reassess everything.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
But the public safety commission

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.600 position:50% align:center
is now requesting that all
hero course students get

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
in-the-field training again.

00:14:11.435 --> 00:14:12.603 position:50% align:center
Requesting?

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:14.897 position:50% align:center
Are they ordering us
to send these kids out?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.731 position:50% align:center
[NEZU]
Yes.

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:17.232 position:50% align:center
Does this say...

00:14:17.316 --> 00:14:19.902 position:50% align:center
We're somehow short-handed
when it comes to pros?

00:14:19.985 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
I thought there was
an oversaturation of us.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.531 position:50% align:center
[ECTOPLASM] "Future heroes
must learn to deal

00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:27.868 position:50% align:center
with the recent increase in
villainous organizations."

00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:31.038 position:50% align:center
This is a reaction to what
happened at Deika City.

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
[SNIPE]
The League must be involved.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
It's obvious.

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
They're beatin' around
the bush here.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
The commission must have
intelligence that another crisis

00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:41.298 position:50% align:center
might be in the pipeline.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
If they're being vague and
not making the information

00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
they have public, then
they're either hiding what

00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:49.598 position:50% align:center
they're doing or protecting
sources of information.

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:52.726 position:50% align:center
As Kayama said, them telling us
to restart the work studies

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
feels like a mandate
instead of a suggestion

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
from the commission.

00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.151 position:50% align:center
They can't publicly admit that
they want to mobilize students.

00:15:01.235 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center
Bad publicity.

00:15:02.653 --> 00:15:05.489 position:50% align:center
I don't like it.
This is unethical.

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
Whatever the case,

00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:09.618 position:50% align:center
any hero will find themselves
in danger regularly.

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.245 position:50% align:center
Let's try our best
to place the kids

00:15:11.328 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
in agencies with
good track records.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.083 position:50% align:center
Consider that your
winter vacation homework.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
Please tell your students
after this meeting.

00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:20.921 position:50% align:center
[HEROES]
We understand, sir.

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:22.506 position:50% align:center
[NEZU]
And, Aizawa.

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.259 position:50% align:center
Concerning the commission's
other program...

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
[NEZU]
It's been four months since UA

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.974 position:50% align:center
moved the kids into the dorms.

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:34.184 position:50% align:center
No one seems suspicious.

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
You're saying you don't
think there's a spy

00:15:36.687 --> 00:15:38.814 position:50% align:center
for the League of Villains
among the students?

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:41.400 position:50% align:center
If the League acts in the future
and we spot no connection,

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
then I'd say it's
a fair assumption to make.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
I agree. Every one of
our hero course students

00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:51.118 position:50% align:center
has a heart that
beats for justice.

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:53.036 position:50% align:center
You've got that right.

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.999 position:50% align:center
[NEZU] By the way,
are you coming back today?

00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:59.126 position:50% align:center
We're pretty busy here,
so I'm not certain.

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.503 position:50% align:center
Why, did something happen
with Young Midoriya?

00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
Is it actually possible that
you've forgotten what day it is?

00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:08.886 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
One, two, three.

Merry Christmas, everyone!

00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:32.034 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] Work studies
are back in action.

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.911 position:50% align:center
I'm pumped, but we must be

00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:36.914 position:50% align:center
the busiest first years
in UA history.

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:39.166 position:50% align:center
Are the two of you going
back to join Ryukyu?

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:40.459 position:50% align:center
Yup. We are.

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.212 position:50% align:center
[camera shutter clicks]

00:16:43.295 --> 00:16:45.506 position:50% align:center
Christmas Eve is the best! Heh.

00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:47.216 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] Midoriya, what
do you have planned?

00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:50.052 position:50% align:center
Tell us. Going back
to the Nighteye Agency?

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:52.930 position:50% align:center
Yeah, isn't Centipeder the one
running that operation now?

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:55.516 position:50% align:center
Be cool to work
with that guy again.

00:16:55.599 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
I thought so, too,
but it turns out...

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDER]
Apologies, Midoriya.

00:17:00.646 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
I'm ashamed to say this,
but right now,

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
we don't really have time
to take anyone on.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.777 position:50% align:center
Deku, it's been a long time!

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.779 position:50% align:center
Sir always did the
paperwork by himself,

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:12.616 position:50% align:center
so it's been crazy hard
to keep up on our own.

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
I did my internship
with Gran Torino,

00:17:14.493 --> 00:17:18.247 position:50% align:center
but he's also busy, so...
right now I'm stuck in limbo.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:19.456 position:50% align:center
That sucks.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
But unlike last time
when they were optional,

00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:24.086 position:50% align:center
this round is mandatory,
so there's no need to worry.

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:26.004 position:50% align:center
The school will find
a place for me.

00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Still. S'gotta feel weird.

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:29.675 position:50% align:center
What? I'm just chilling here!

00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:31.635 position:50% align:center
You goin' back
to Jeanist, Bakugo?

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:32.845 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
I haven't decided yet.

00:17:41.854 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
[BEST JEANIST]
"Bakugo"?

00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:45.941 position:50% align:center
You're not choosing a hero name?

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.401 position:50% align:center
They were all rejected!

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
And I'd been saving
them up, too!

00:17:49.528 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
[BEST JEANIST]
Oh? Let's hear them.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
King Explosion. Lord Explosion.
Explosion Murder!

00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:58.120 position:50% align:center
[BEST JEANIST]
You're such a child.

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
Your hero name is a wish.

00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:04.084 position:50% align:center
How you want to be, or how
you think you should be.

00:18:04.168 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
You haven't started looking
beyond yourself yet.

00:18:07.713 --> 00:18:09.798 position:50% align:center
I want to show
you the outside.

00:18:09.882 --> 00:18:12.342 position:50% align:center
The world that needs you.

00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:13.594 position:50% align:center
When you become a second year

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:16.889 position:50% align:center
and get your provisional
license, come back here.

00:18:16.972 --> 00:18:19.975 position:50% align:center
I'll ask you for your
chosen name again.

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
But you had a ton
of people scouting you

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.021 position:50% align:center
after the sports fest.
You came in first.

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center
You could go
wherever you want to!

00:18:26.023 --> 00:18:27.733 position:50% align:center
I'm not interested
in learning anything

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.194 position:50% align:center
from some second-tier wannabe.

00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:31.904 position:50% align:center
You touch me and you die!

00:18:31.987 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO] Come on,
give in to peer pressure!

00:18:33.906 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
It's Christmas!

00:18:34.865 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
Where's your festive spirit?

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.869 position:50% align:center
Hard time to do work studies.

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
This is supposed to be
a party, you guys!

00:18:41.163 --> 00:18:42.873 position:50% align:center
So how about less
with the school stuff

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.374 position:50% align:center
and more with the holly jolly.

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:46.502 position:50% align:center
Dude what are you,
the Yule Police?

00:18:46.585 --> 00:18:47.920 position:50% align:center
Come on, you guys.

00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
Might sound weird,
but Mineta has a point.

00:18:50.047 --> 00:18:52.174 position:50% align:center
It's time for us to dig in!

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Sugarman can cook regular food!

00:18:55.761 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Sorry we're late.

00:18:57.638 --> 00:18:59.848 position:50% align:center
Have you started
the party already?

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:02.893 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS gasp, laugh]

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to say...

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.399 position:50% align:center
Trick or treat?

00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:11.485 position:50% align:center
Not quite. Wrong holiday.

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:13.654 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO, KIRISHIMA, TSUYU]
Eri Claus!

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
Oh! She's adorable!

00:19:15.489 --> 00:19:17.157 position:50% align:center
That looks great on you!

00:19:17.241 --> 00:19:19.660 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
In sickness, and in health.

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] No, you're even
further away now.

00:19:22.246 --> 00:19:24.623 position:50% align:center
Is Togata coming?
That guy's a riot.

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:27.626 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid he'll be celebrating
with his own class tonight.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.795 position:50% align:center
Enjoy yourself. Go on.

00:19:31.547 --> 00:19:34.258 position:50% align:center
Ohmigosh. So cute!

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
Here, take these eggs I painted.

00:19:36.218 --> 00:19:37.761 position:50% align:center
That's Easter, but thanks!

[ASHIDO]
Eri! Are you thirsty?

00:19:40.097 --> 00:19:41.390 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Please.

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:45.936 position:50% align:center
Her horn. Looks like
it's gotten bigger.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Her attitude
has remained positive.

00:19:50.983 --> 00:19:53.402 position:50% align:center
She's taking what
you said to heart.

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] At the time, not knowing
what the future held,

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.030 position:50% align:center
all I could think was,
"I hope we can have

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
a fun Christmas party
next year, too"

00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center
I wished that from the
bottom of my heart.

00:23:01.423 --> 00:23:04.551 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] The Christmas party
couldn't last forever.

00:23:04.635 --> 00:23:06.720 position:50% align:center
Eventually, our thoughts
turned back to the issue

00:23:06.803 --> 00:23:09.014 position:50% align:center
of where to go for work studies.

00:23:12.518 --> 00:23:15.187 position:50% align:center
Midoriya. Bakugo.

00:23:16.897 --> 00:23:19.775 position:50% align:center
If you don't have choices
you like, I was thinking...

00:23:19.858 --> 00:23:24.905 position:50% align:center
Come with me. Do a work
study with Endeavor.

00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:26.823 position:50% align:center
The number-one hero.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.287 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:32.371 --> 00:23:34.957 position:50% align:center
Kacchan and I accept Todoroki's
invitation and head out

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.335 position:50% align:center
to do our work studies
at Endeavor's agency.

00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:40.963 position:50% align:center
This is my chance to
jump to the next level.

00:23:41.046 --> 00:23:43.715 position:50% align:center
What kind of hero work does
the number-one pro do?

00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:45.592 position:50% align:center
I have to burn every
lesson into my memory

00:23:45.676 --> 00:23:48.679 position:50% align:center
and use the experience
to grow stronger.

00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:51.682 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Off to
Endeavor's Agency!"

00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:55.185 position:50% align:center
Endeavor's flames incinerate
all hints of villainy.

00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:57.521 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
