[MONOMA]
Look who we have here.

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:17.267 position:50% align:center
Relaxed and full
of yourselves as always.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
Obviously you underestimate us.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.313 position:50% align:center
Come on, Class A!

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
Let's see who's best
once and for all!

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Classes 1-A and 1-B
from the hero course at UA high

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
are battling it out against one
another in team combat training.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
In the first match, special
guest Shinso succeeded

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center
in disrupting his opponent's
ability to communicate.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] It ended with a win
for my classmates.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
'Kay team! Let's go!

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Right!

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.850 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] We'll start
reconnaissance immediately.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.143 position:50% align:center
If you please!

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.312 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Roger. Now, Dark Shadow!

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.563 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW]
Got it!

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.440 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] Report back
when you find the enemy.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:07.067 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW]
Leave it to me!

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] With that,
the second match started.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.118 position:50% align:center
Into the abyss.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
Stand back!

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.542 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Class B's Kuroiro
caught Class A by surprise

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.920 position:50% align:center
with an attack from the shadows.

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.507 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.135 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] But Tokoyami caught up
to him thanks to his new move,

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.929 position:50% align:center
Dark Fallen Angel.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.391 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] It's unclear who
has the upper hand now.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:42.268 position:50% align:center
This is still anyone's match.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.145 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
Navel Buffet!

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
There he is, Hagakure!

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.746 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
I see him! Let's nab him!

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
That's as far as you go!

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
We won't let you escape!

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] Launching
a surprise attack alone.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
Bold move. And
certainly unexpected.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:38.635 position:50% align:center
No matter. Because I
expect the unexpected.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
Oh, I don't know about that.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:42.430 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
Stand down!

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.057 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] You don't know
when you're beat!

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE yelps]
Mushrooms? What the heck?

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
[laughs] So it's true.
Kendo <i>is</i> better than you.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
[KOMORI]
It's just like our brilliant

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.655 position:50% align:center
class rep said, shroom.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
If we see too much light,
then plan A failed.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.621 position:50% align:center
[KOMORI]
So we start plan B.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
Cute little mushrooms
for everybody.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center
There's more?

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE yelps]
Not cool! Not cool!

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
You can see my body!

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:27.475 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE screams]

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
These must be her Quirk.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
These Fungus fields
are cropping up

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
on every surface.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.151 position:50% align:center
This mess of
<i>champignons</i> . Is it...?

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
Yes. A planned attack.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
[KOMORI]
Mr. Ionomidotis frondosa.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
Little Tricholoma equestre.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
Flammulina velutipes!
Coprinopsis atramentaria!

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.168 position:50% align:center
That's it! Grow up strong!

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
Let's make the world a
shroomier, fungier place to be!

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] Kinoko Komori.
Hero name: Shemage.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
Quirk: Mushroom.

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
She can release
spores from her body

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center
and instantly grow mushrooms
anywhere she wants!

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
The more humidity in the air,
the stronger she is!

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] Uh, they've got shrooms
growing on their bodies?

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.147 position:50% align:center
This is like a
serious horror movie!

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, the fungus
up and disappears

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
in two or three hours tops.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
Your teammates'll be fine.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
Which is why she doesn't
hold anything back.

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
Look, they're growing
over the camera!

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50% align:center
Gag.

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO chuckles]

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
Here's Plan A.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
Up first is Kuroiro.
He's gonna hijack Dark Shadow!

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
The other team will
send Tokoyami's Quirk

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
to look for us as part of
their initial reconnaissance.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center
It's a smart, low-risk
move on their part.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
They probably don't realize
Kuroiro has leveled-up

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
his power and can manipulate
all sorts of darkness.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.770 position:50% align:center
We'll turn that bird
against them!

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
[yelping]

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
That's easy for you to suggest.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center
Spooky!

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
But what if I
fail at this task?

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center
I'll be left out in the open.

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
They'd have to attack
you using lotsa light,

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
so it'll be obvious to us
if you're in trouble.

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
The lights will be
a beacon pointing us

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
straight to you and them.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.958 position:50% align:center
Plus, it can't be too bright or
Dark Shadow would be powerless.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.918 position:50% align:center
Even if Kuroiro fails,

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
we can spring another
attack on them!

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO]
Plan A was a bust.

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
My only choice is to
fall back for now.

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
[KENDO] Plan B it is.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
Kinoko, we're counting on you.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:36.479 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] They won't stop
growing! I hate this!

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on?!

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] They planned
a two-pronged operation

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
that anticipated how
we'd respond to Kuroiro.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
A wise strategy, Kendo.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
Calm down and stay focused!
We just need to regroup, okay?

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI]
Whack! Thud!

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center
Boom-Boom!

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.539 position:50% align:center
Ahh! Bam! Crash!

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE screams]

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Another assault?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] Why are there words
comin' outta the ground?

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI]
I am killin' it today!

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
The "bam" effects
were extra "Whabam!"

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
when they went off.

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:12.140 position:50% align:center
It's making my heart
go bu-dum, bu-dum.

He can also add an extra
zing to certain words

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
as they "Splat! Bang! Zow!"
across the battlefield!

[VLAD KING] Komori and Fukidashi
came to Kuroiro's rescue.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.493 position:50% align:center
Now, attacking in waves,
they're giving Class A's team

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
a hard time from a distance.

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:18.248 position:50% align:center

Yeah, stop!

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.796 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be hard to break
those wide-range attacks.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.007 position:50% align:center
Also, if we go overseas,

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.300 position:50% align:center
do you think Fukidashi

[YAOYOROZU]
I have no idea where anyone is.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
We can make this an endurance
test if you want to.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.486 position:50% align:center
But you have to use materials

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.155 position:50% align:center
from your own body
to create things.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:35.700 position:50% align:center
So there's no way you're gonna
outmatch me, Yaoyorozu!

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
Gotta stay on the offensive.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
I learned that from watching
her at the sports festival.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.878 position:50% align:center
I'm finished if she
has time to think.

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.798 position:50% align:center
Brute strength is the key!

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:52.342 position:50% align:center
[KENDO yells]

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
She designed a situation

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
where she's got
a total advantage.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
Her plan was right on the money!

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
What did I say?

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
Our girl is smart and decisive
even when she's under pressure!

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
That's our brilliant
rep Kendo for ya!

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
I'm not convinced this was
the smartest move on her part.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.483 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
If Yaoyorozu was separated

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
because they feared
her planning,

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
then they might've
misjudged her.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
Yaoyorozu. You've got
a plan, don't you?

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
Your plan didn't work,

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
so there's no way
mine will be any good.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
We're both going to fail.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.499 position:50% align:center
Spit it out already!

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.667 position:50% align:center
I'm saying that you're the one

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.378 position:50% align:center
who's better at this
kinda stuff, not me!

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
When we were voting
for class rep,

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
you had two votes, remember?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
One of those votes was mine!

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
Because I thought you would be
best at leading our class!

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:43.935 position:50% align:center
You're right. I have an idea.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:45.687 position:50% align:center
A plan for us to win!

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
We can still beat Mr. Aizawa!

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking about it
from the beginning.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.071 position:50% align:center
His weakness.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.407 position:50% align:center
If they were so worried
about Yaoyorozu,

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.784 position:50% align:center
then their team should've
tried to disrupt her strategy

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center
from the very start.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
This predicament
is still well within

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.998 position:50% align:center
what she could have anticipated.

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
Your grades and Quirk

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
are both better
than mine, Yaoyorozu.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
I wanna be my own hero.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
Kendo. You've got it wrong.

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center
The truth is that I'm actually
still the inexperienced fool.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
Not you.

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
Even so, you humbled yourself
and deemed to call me better,

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:34.611 position:50% align:center
so I can't let you
see me looking pathetic!

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
And since it's within
her expectations,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
she should be able
to create a path

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.408 position:50% align:center
that will lead her to victory.

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:43.370 position:50% align:center
This is what Momo
Yaoyorozu excels at!

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:47.999 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
You can do this!

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
Think of everything you've
cultivated to this point.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
And prove to yourself
how much you've grown.

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
No way. A frickin' cannon?

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
I held you at bay
so I could buy time.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
It takes a while to make
something this large.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
There's still no
sign of Class B.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
And I've lost Hagakure's
location as well.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:30.041 position:50% align:center
Shall we regroup with Yaoyorozu
on the other side of the wall?

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.501 position:50% align:center
If we can.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Can't Stop Twinkling!

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO laughs]

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA screams]

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
The fungus among us
is how we will win!

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Cursed, mushrooms.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
Slowing me down.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI]
Zoom!

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI coughs]
Ah! My throat's

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.947 position:50% align:center
getting a little hoarse.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE whimpers]

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
What nightmare is this?

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Yaoyorozu is missing.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
Aoyama is gone.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.547 position:50% align:center
On top of that, the enemy
has hidden themselves

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
and are attacking indirectly.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
Quite the predicament.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
They'll be difficult to best.

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
Komori. Fukidashi. Kuroiro.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.437 position:50% align:center
If we cannot determine
the location

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
of these three opponents,
this will be the end.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
We need a plan to
pull ourselves together.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50% align:center
No way. A frickin' cannon?

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
I held you at bay
so I could buy time.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
It takes a while to make
something this large.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
Is she insane?

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50% align:center
Who's she trying
to kill with that?

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.837 position:50% align:center
Again, huh?

00:13:57.921 --> 00:13:59.839 position:50% align:center
That girl really
likes her cannons.

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
That looks like it
packs a big punch.

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
This has to be a bluff.

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
Is she planning on
breaking through the wall?

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.689 position:50% align:center
[KENDO gasps]

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
I apologize for threatening you.

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.239 position:50% align:center
Gotta stop her.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
[KENDO] I'll enlarge my fists
at the moment of impact.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
That might work!

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
Double Jumbo... Fist!

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
She wasn't aiming at the wall?

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
Then what was she shooting?

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] When this turned
into the kind of fight

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
that you're good at,

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
I could tell my
defeat was likely.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:50.181 position:50% align:center
So, in order for us to win...!

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
That explosion just now

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
didn't sound like
Fukidashi's work.

00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
It came from the
other side of the wall.

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Is that... from Yaoyorozu?

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Dark Shadow!

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.449 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW]
Got it!

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:13.705 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
What's this?

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO]
Hey, Komori.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.628 position:50% align:center
Speak up, silly,
I can't hear you!

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
Um. I managed to catch the guy.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
Twinkles. He's in jail.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.637 position:50% align:center
Really? Nice, Kuroiro!

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you for
the other two toadstools.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO] I can't believe
I impressed her!

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
[KOMORI] Our not-so-fungus
opponents don't know

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
where we are, so we
can keep attacking them

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
with mushrooms like this!

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO]
Yeah, of course.

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:50.617 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey. Komori?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
Yes, shroom?

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.081 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO]
You don't think, um,

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:59.000 position:50% align:center
Class A knows about
this place, do you?

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Thermal goggles!

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
Much easier to locate our
enemies when I have these.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:19.229 position:50% align:center
Now when I stare into the abyss,
the abyss stares back at me!

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
Lucky bag? What is this?
Some kind of loot drop?

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
I'll hold onto it.

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
We've got... some goggles?

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
And ethanol? This is
a disinfectant spray!

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Looking at those fancy specs,

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
I'd say they were designed
with you in mind!

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] Even without words,
she conveyed her intent.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:47.924 position:50% align:center
Calm down and stay focused!
We just need to regroup, okay?

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Yaoyorozu.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
Did you have this backup plan
in your head the entire time?

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.142 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI]
What the what?

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.811 position:50% align:center
Tokoyami is heading straight
towards where Komori is!

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
What's he up to?

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
And I'm the one after you.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI]
Gulp!

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] I thought it
was strange the mushrooms

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.360 position:50% align:center
didn't grow on you guys.

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:10.196 position:50% align:center
But that's 'cause you
disinfected yourselves, huh?

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI]
Uh... Where'd you get that?

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Nuh-uh-uh. I'm not telling!

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:21.416 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE grunts, yells]

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] Now we can strike
at our discretion.

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:31.176 position:50% align:center
It definitely looks like
he's heading straight for us.

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.470 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] I will not
allow you to escape or hide

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
from the storm you have wrought.

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
According to Hawks...

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
...speed can easily win
against strength.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Black Abyss.

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
Sabbath!

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
Shroom-y!

00:17:57.994 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
Komori, no!

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO]
He's too fast. Can't stay.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:04.084 position:50% align:center
Have to sink into the shadows.

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50% align:center
Is it darkness that
you're searching for?

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.596 position:50% align:center
Then you can borrow my cloak.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
[KUROIRO]
No fair.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:19.724 position:50% align:center
If there's nowhere
for you to move,

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.685 position:50% align:center
then there is no need
to fear your abilities.

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:24.104 position:50% align:center
Fumikage, I caught
the spore girl!

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] Whoa, dang,
he caught two enemies!

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
He's turned the tables!

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.698 position:50% align:center
They couldn't have done it
without Yao-momo's items!

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
Hagakure's doing awesome, too.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
If they keep going like this,
they can win it four-to-one.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
Quick, Dark Shadow.
Take these two prisoners to--

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.627 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you all right?

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
It's not a cutie.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
So I made sure to keep it
hidden away until now.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
I'd be such a bad 'shroom
if I didn't use it

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
when we were about
to lose, though.

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.348 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
My windpipe.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.476 position:50% align:center
Lungs feel bad?

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
That's little
Schizophyllum commune.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] Komori doesn't have
a Quirk that screams combat

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
and yet, she's scary.

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
Did you think we'd hold back
because this is just training,

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
you stupid bird?

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
You should've knocked
her unconscious.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Take this!

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI]
It's like I'm fighting a ghost

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
that punches really hard.

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] I need to hurry up
and finish this dude off.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
Then I can help the others!

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about how Tokoyami
and Yao-momo are holding up.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
Invisible Girl
is also invincible!

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
Sorry it took me a while.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI]
Kendo! Boom. I'm saved!

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's happening here?

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
[KENDO] Well, I knocked her out,
but not before she got me.

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.200 position:50% align:center
 We're kinda stuck together.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:05.246 position:50% align:center
She could have done me solid
and let the cannon fall off.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
It's hard to drag all
of this stuff around.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
Everything she created showed

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center
that she was looking ahead.

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
Covering her bases.
I don't really feel like I won.

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:24.099 position:50% align:center
Hey. Thanks for
getting me out of this.

00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
It's only natural to save
your teammates, shroom.

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
Kendo, Fukidashi.
You two are okay?

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
[FUKIDASHI]
I think so. Somehow.

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
Hey. Please don't die.

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
You really pulled out
the big guns, Komori.

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't, we would've
lost the round.

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.
Class A's tough.

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
They easily could
have beaten us.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.752 position:50% align:center
We sure lucked out today.

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
Luck has nothin' to do with it!
It was all Kendo's plan!

00:20:57.632 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.177 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Yaoyorozu, I hope you don't

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.888 position:50% align:center
get discouraged by this result.

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:07.600 position:50% align:center
Our Creati will grow into
a top-class leader one day.

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
All these "Plus Ultra" moments
are oh-so stimulating.

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] They might've lost,
but Tokoyami got to use

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:17.902 position:50% align:center
his new move, and
Yaoyorozu never stopped

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
looking ahead
throughout the match.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.407 position:50% align:center
It's obvious that
everyone has improved.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
There's no doubt about it!

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] With every step,
these kids get closer

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
to embodying what they
want to be in the future.

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] We're striving to
live up to those we admire.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Heroes!

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
Second match!

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
Class B nabs a crushing victory
with a score of four-nothing!

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center
Words can't describe how
impressive this showing was!

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
This is getting
seriously ridiculous!

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Seriously!

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
I'm so proud of you!

00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:32.328 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:32.412 --> 00:23:34.289 position:50% align:center
As we head into the
third training match,

00:23:34.372 --> 00:23:37.834 position:50% align:center
Class A and Class B each have
one win under their belts.

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:40.670 position:50% align:center
With Iida's speed and
Todoroki's Half-Cold Half-Hot,

00:23:40.754 --> 00:23:42.881 position:50% align:center
they should have an
advantage in the round.

00:23:42.964 --> 00:23:45.508 position:50% align:center
Unless something totally
unexpected happens.

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:48.219 position:50% align:center
Come on, guys! Do your best!

00:23:48.303 --> 00:23:50.430 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Match 3."

00:23:50.513 --> 00:23:54.100 position:50% align:center
Honenuki from Class B shows off
his Quirk's flexibility.

00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:56.895 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
