00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.929 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] After a ferocious
series of training matches

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.390 position:50% align:center
that pitted the first-year
classes of UA's hero course

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
against each other,
my class ended up victorious

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.730 position:50% align:center
with one loss, one draw,
and three wins.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
I've still got a ways to go.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
I experienced first-hand
how amazing the hero course is.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to be
satisfied by merely passing.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.880 position:50% align:center
I need to work harder
and aim higher.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:49.966 position:50% align:center
And live up to my potential.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
That's fine.

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Go at it with
a "Plus Ultra" mentality.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.098 position:50% align:center
[SHINSO]
Yes, sir!

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Shinso! At the very end there,

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.239 position:50% align:center
you were trying to get
me to brawl head on

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.909 position:50% align:center
so you could whip out your
special combat moves, right?

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.369 position:50% align:center
It was crazy how fast you acted

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.747 position:50% align:center
to try to stop me with
those falling pipes.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50% align:center
And you used the binding cloth
just like Mr. Aizawa does.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.419 position:50% align:center
Honestly, in the first match,
I thought your team

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:53.006 position:50% align:center
did a great job of putting
your Quirk front and center.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.842 position:50% align:center
But you're definitely
more than that power.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
Your judgment and moves
were on par with ours.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.097 position:50% align:center
Watching you hold your own with
our classes was so inspiring.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50% align:center
I'm blown away!

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.934 position:50% align:center
But my Quirk didn't help
anyone in the match.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
In fact, I put people in danger!

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
That's a good point.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
We still have much to
analyze from these fights.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
But I'd say, in all probability,

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.201 position:50% align:center
Shinso will join the hero course
in your second year.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
Just make sure you don't
let him outshine you!

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Got it!

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
Which class will he join?

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
A?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
B?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
The particulars will come later.

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50% align:center
The training critiques
are far from over.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Speaking of which, question!

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
Can you unleash on Mineta
for being the absolute worst?

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
Ugh! That whole "smashing
into your chest" thing

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50% align:center
was a lucky accident.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
Don't forget I put my body
on the line to keep Shoda

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
and those girls
from strategizing.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
It's true that, in a
tragic twist of fate,

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.148 position:50% align:center
Class B was defeated today.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.650 position:50% align:center
But!

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
We didn't necessarily lose
if you look at what we planned!

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
If I had known that
Midoriya's Quirk was a blank,

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
then we could've come up
with tactics in response.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
In other words, if we were
to fight again right now,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
there's no telling
who would win!

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
[VLAD KING]
That's enough outta you!

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
Today's class is already over!

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That's right.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
He activated Shoda's
Quirk remotely.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center
Which means, he had
to have touched me.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe, but
Monoma copied One For All

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
in the middle of our battle.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
My Quirk, One For All,
is a whole lot to handle.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
The combined physical abilities
of everyone who's ever used it

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
creates a hurricane
of pure force.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
An unprepared body
can't fully inherit it.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center
Your arms and legs would
shoot off if you tried to.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I panicked thinking
that he'd end up hurt.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
If I had known that
Midoriya's Quirk was a blank,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
then who knows.

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
--[laughing]
--[IZUKU] "A blank"?

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.081 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] While we're on the
subject of your Quirk, Monoma,

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:53.585 position:50% align:center
I have a task for you.
Come visit Eri tomorrow.

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Eri? Why?

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
Oh, wowzer, you learned
how to write super fast!

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.309 position:50% align:center
I've been writing letters!

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
Huh! Awesome.
So, who're they for?

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
For Deku and
for you, Lemillion.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
Saying things out loud is hard.
So I'm trying this instead.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
I wanna thank
you both so much.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? Use it!

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.166 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
What, are you
scared or something?

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.252 position:50% align:center
Wait, wait, wait!

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50% align:center
I'm trying, but
it won't activate!

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
Stop! That's not how
you should approach this!

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
Cut it out!

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
That new power's useless

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
if it doesn't work
when he's in trouble.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
Uh, we're supposed
to be making sure

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
it <i>doesn't</i> come out.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center
Well, Young Midoriya.
How do you feel?

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.855 position:50% align:center
Like I did before
the training match.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50% align:center
I don't sense Blackwhip anymore.

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] So it's a
previous wielder's Quirk,

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
and One For All
itself is evolving?

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
You guys always have
secret meetings in here?

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
I was surprised to see
you joining us today!

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
I asked Young Bakugo
to come because he knows

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:23.049 position:50% align:center
the truth behind your power.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
So, did you know
about this, All Might?

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
About the dark energy and
the person Deku spoke to?

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] I'd never
heard of either before.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
A predecessor with
a shaved head?

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
The person who had
the Quirk before my master

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
was a young man with black hair.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center
I don't think she knew
about the other Quirks

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
living in One For All either.

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
I'd say this is uncharted
territory for everyone.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.282 position:50% align:center
Great, this idiot scum
is the first one

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
to go out of control.

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's enough.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
Think harder.

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.163 position:50% align:center
You must've noticed something
that triggered the new power.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I don't think so.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
But the man I talked to said
"Now's the time," so...

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
Maybe there's something
going on in the world

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
that's making this happen?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.631 position:50% align:center
If that's true, could it have

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.634 position:50% align:center
something to do
with All For One?

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
This passed-on ability
originally came from him, right?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
And think about it.

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
He has control over
multiple Quirks.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.769 position:50% align:center
I see it now.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:19.606 position:50% align:center
You're basically
the same as him.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
That's something I've thought
but didn't wanna say.

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
At any rate, this
cannot keep happening.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
We have to learn more
about this power.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] You're just not
feeling the danger.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
If I really beat you down,
it'll come back.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
The only thing to do is
kick the crap outta you

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
and force the energy
to go wild again.

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
Do not try to murder
your classmate.

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:46.633 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] If it's true that One
For All responds to my feelings,

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
then when it disappeared...

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.389 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
This ability is one I won't

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
be able to use for a while.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.061 position:50% align:center
I judged that it wasn't a power
I could use at the moment.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.896 position:50% align:center
It's possible that's why
I feel as though the Quirk

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
has been locked away
for the time being.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.234 position:50% align:center
If it's anything like imagining
the egg in the microwave,

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
then I may be able to
envision a lock opening

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
to get Blackwhip activate again.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Dammit! This is boring.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.991 position:50% align:center
If you can't use it,
then I'm over this.

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
And stop thinking out loud.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50% align:center
Stupid muttering
gives me the creeps.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
Maybe it'd be best
if we call it a day.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
Right. Sure.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
It's like All For One's power.

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU]
You're a moron!

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
Baby! Stop whining
like you're a weakling!

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
I can't.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
You completely showed me up with
your manliness in that match.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
Since I'm made of metal,
I can withstand intense heat.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
But on the other hand, there's
a limit to how durable I can be.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50% align:center
You think I'm not aware
of how dented up

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.867 position:50% align:center
I'll get if I take a beating?

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
But you're opposite!

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.871 position:50% align:center
The more you're hit,

We're both manly, Tetsutetsu!

Hi! Beef stew is on
the dinner menu tonight!

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay!

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.049 position:50% align:center
And it looks like Class B's
joining us, too?

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Yes!

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
They've come to mingle
and talk about the training!

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] Midoriya.
I've been looking for you.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.561 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Hey, what's up?

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you had two Quirks
this whole time as well.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
Given what you said that day...

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:32.781 position:50% align:center
So come at me
with all you've got!

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.032 position:50% align:center
You were adamant that I not

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
hold back against
you in our fight.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
But I guess you were
hiding something yourself.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
No, it's not that!

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
I think this dark energy
is derived from my Quirk.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center
Which would mean
it's just another part

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
of my original power.

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
Today was the first time
something like that happened,

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
so I was surprised myself.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
How interesting.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
That must've been
difficult for you.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:56.429 position:50% align:center
I bet it was pretty shocking.
I apologize for doubting you.

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] How can you be sharp
and dull at the same time?

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.143 position:50% align:center
You were amazing, Todoroki!

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you'd gotten
so good at using your flames.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
Not nearly good enough.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
Seems the two of us are
almost in the same predicament.

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
And that's why...

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
...I have to start
aiming even higher.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
I can't believe it.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
To think that you'd be the one
approaching me about training.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Then... we're all in agreement?

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50% align:center
Allow me to take care of
the paperwork and clearances.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:46.062 position:50% align:center
The rest of you can continue
focusing on teaching.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
I appreciate it.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
Shinso sure reminds me
of the emo kid you used to be.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
You found yourself a
miniature Aizawa, huh?

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
Or is this really
about Shirakumo?

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] If you have something
to say, make it brief.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
I have somewhere to be.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
It's nothin'.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center
Just reminiscing
about the old days.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50% align:center
It's the bad guy. Oh, no!

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center
[laughs] What's this
foolish child saying?

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.597 position:50% align:center
Oh, I told her that
UA has it's bad parts

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
and that you represented
one of its downsides.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, I'm a man
who follows the path

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
of peace and justice.
How dare you malign, sir.

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Um. Do you have any idea

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.273 position:50% align:center
why he was asked to come here?

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Ah, Midoriya, Togata.
Sorry to borrow your time.

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:37.197 position:50% align:center
There was something I wanted
to ask Monoma to do,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
but after thinking about
their personalities,

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure they'd mesh well.

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center
Well, I love to hear

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
you've been thinking
about me, teach. [laughs]

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
How 'bout it? Any luck?

00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Hm... This one is a blank.

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I'm not gonna be
able to help you out, it seems.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center
Sorry, sir.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
Disappointing, but it's
not your fault.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
You wanted him
to copy Eri's Quirk?

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
Why would that be a good thing?

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
Also, what does "blank" mean?

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
It must mean her power
works like yours.

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
Both of your Quirks
function as stockpilers.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.534 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] I copy the core
nature of the Quirk itself.

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
But if it's an ability that
accumulates something

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:27.038 position:50% align:center
and changes it into
a form of energy,

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
I don't copy the stored-up fuel
that would make it function.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.085 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
For example...

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
Fatgum's Quirk works only if
he's stockpiled a bunch of fat.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
Monoma could copy the base
power, but he'd still be skinny.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
I draw these "blanks"
every once in a while.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:45.098 position:50% align:center
The same logic goes for
when I copied your Quirk

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
but couldn't release
any of its energy.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.935 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
If it hadn't been for that,

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:52.230 position:50% align:center
Monoma's limbs probably
woulda shot off into space!

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
So... Why try this on Eri?

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
She's not able to activate
her Quirk right now,

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
but one day,
it may return in full.

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
If she doesn't know
how to use it,

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
she might endanger
herself or others.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
That's why I thought
it'd be easier if Monoma

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
borrowed her power,
trained with it,

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
and taught her how
to use it safely.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
But I suppose that
was a longshot.

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
You're having a lotta
trouble because of me.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:23.970 position:50% align:center
It's always like that.
I cause everyone problems.

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
I just wish that I didn't
have this power.

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.268 position:50% align:center
Don't get sad.

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
It doesn't always
cause trouble, though.

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:34.356 position:50% align:center
You can't forget.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
You saved my life with
your rewind Quirk.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.906 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Powers aren't good or bad.

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
I know! Think of them like
they're knives in the kitchen.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
They may be dangerous,
but if they're sharp

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:50.747 position:50% align:center
and you use them right,
they make yummy food, huh?

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.832 position:50% align:center
That's why when you use
your power for good,

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
it's wonderful.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:56.961 position:50% align:center

If that's true, could it have

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
something to do
with All For One?

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center

originally came from him, right?

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center

where my power originated.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center

and I have to trust it.

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center

better at my Quirk!

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center

One For All, too.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
You worry about evacuations.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] You can't fight
these villains, but we can.

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:30.865 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
I don't know about this.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
[MASKED VILLAIN 100A] Boss!
This weekend haul is a goldmine.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A]
It's a steady stream of wallets!

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
You two have only been
licensed for a half an hour!

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
That a problem?

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
[MASKED VILLAINS yell]

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] Jeez, how many
minutes have to pass

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:09.904 position:50% align:center
before we can be heroes?

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A]
What's the deal with you kids?

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.412 position:50% align:center
You pretending
to be grown-up pros?

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
You all need to get
away from the scene!

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, it's All Might!

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Hand over the
things you've stolen.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.421 position:50% align:center
You can't just take other
people's belongings.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A]
You think you're cool?

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.637 position:50% align:center
You got another thing comin'.

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
A coupla ice cubes
aren't gonna stop me!

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.354 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A] In order
to pull this operation off

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:43.980 position:50% align:center
without a hitch, we mapped out

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
every last patrol pattern
in this area!

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
We spent an entire
month prepping

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
to make sure we nabbed a ton
of end-of-the-year loot!

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
There should be no heroes.
Just helpless bystanders.

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
I won't let you ruin this.

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
Get a real job.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
Too bad for you we happened
to cross your path.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A]
Oh, I'm scared.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
Why don't you get back to class.

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
I'm not above hurting
a couple of brats.

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
See this?

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
I can manipulate carbonation.

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
Makes me feel all tingly inside!

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
I'm way more determined
than some punk kids

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:17.389 position:50% align:center
who should be doing
their homework.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A]
More determined to get away

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.268 position:50% align:center
scot-free, that is. Later!

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
[MASKED VILLAINS groan]

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A gasps]

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] What, those little
blasts knocked you out?

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
I thought I held back enough
to keep you conscious.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
Now what was it you were
saying about getting away?

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
You seem more "determined"
to get trashed!

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A]
That's it.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
I'm through playin' around!

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A] Oh, whoa.
These items are strong!

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A screams]

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
Pretty! It's like we're inside
a beautiful snow globe!

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
Young lady! Get back here!

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
Try not to get yourself killed!

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
[VILLAIN 100A laughs] That's the
stuff! This is so awesome!

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
I was hoping we could
avoid any violence.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Flashfreeze Heatwave!

[VILLAIN 100A groans]

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
Maybe you didn't know.

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
Carbonated water goes
flat when heated.

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
You pulled that crap
at the sports fest.

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:02.494 position:50% align:center
Well. I held back this time.
Are you hurt at all?

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
'Course not, damn it!

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
You making fun of me?

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:06.873 position:50% align:center
And what about the bystander?

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
I saved her life.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:12.087 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Hey! Are you two kids okay?

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.006 position:50% align:center
[SLIDIN' GO] Oh? You're that
famous delinquent from UA High!

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
You wanna rethink that word?

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:21.471 position:50% align:center
[SLIDIN' GO] Did you two manage
to do this by yourselves?

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
Just small-time criminals
robbing bystanders, I think.

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
We were able to
capture all of them

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.228 position:50% align:center
before anyone in
the gang escaped.

00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
And the stuff they nabbed?

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:34.901 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] I stashed it
before it got incinerated.

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
Perfect! You're incredible!

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.530 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
you're only students!

00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
Thank you! Thank you!

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be top heroes,
I'm positive about that fact!

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
And you can just leave
the rest of this mess

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
to Slidin' Go! That's me!

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
His gauntlets just blew up.

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
[SLIDIN' GO] That's what he gets
for using inferior goods

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
from the black market!

00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:00.510 position:50% align:center
The two of you were
amazing tonight.

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center

Now, let's go home.

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
You must be hungry.

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
I need to melt the ice.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
I'm not helping.

00:22:51.413 --> 00:22:53.081 position:50% align:center
Did we have a blackout
or something?

00:22:53.164 --> 00:22:55.792 position:50% align:center
Maybe everyone else
left the dorms?

00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:58.128 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
You got your licenses!

00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:01.965 position:50% align:center

Wow, Todoroki!

00:23:07.804 --> 00:23:09.097 position:50% align:center
We're proud of you.

Thank you.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.558 position:50% align:center
Bakugo, you did it!

00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:14.102 position:50% align:center
Congrats. Now we can
do hero work together!

00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:15.770 position:50% align:center
It'll be great, Kacchan!

00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:20.734 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] What, you think
you're better than me

00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:22.110 position:50% align:center
'cause you got
your license first?

00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:23.653 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That's not what I meant--

00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:26.823 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] You better shut your
face if you wanna live!

00:23:30.326 --> 00:23:32.370 position:50% align:center

Here's the preview!

00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:34.164 position:50% align:center
Kacchan and Todoroki
finally have

00:23:34.247 --> 00:23:36.291 position:50% align:center
their provisional hero licenses.

00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:39.544 position:50% align:center
Now, everyone in Class A
can start doing hero work.

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:42.922 position:50% align:center
The second semester's over,
and today's December 25th.

00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:45.550 position:50% align:center
So, we're having
a Christmas party!

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:48.303 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Have a
Merry Christmas!"

00:23:48.386 --> 00:23:51.473 position:50% align:center
What we didn't know is that,
while we were celebrating,

00:23:51.556 --> 00:23:55.560 position:50% align:center
unfathomable disaster was
lurking just beyond the horizon.

00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:57.979 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
