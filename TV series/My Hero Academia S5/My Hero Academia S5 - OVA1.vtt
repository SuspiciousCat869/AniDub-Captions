set up by a bunch of pro heroes

on the diamond

You knew you couldn't beat us,
so you called in outside help?

As if you've got room
to judge me, fish breath!

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see you padded
your roster, too!

[GANG ORCA]
I pity you, Shishido.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.757 position:50% align:center line:84%
You think yourself a ruler,
but your kingdom is a joke.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shut it, blow hole.

A sardine outta water like you

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
isn't even fit to
be called my prey.

[GANG ORCA]
I am an apex predator!

Lion pride!

[FATGUM] It's like this every
time they see each other.

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:10.690 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kamui. How'd you get roped
into joining Orca's team?

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KAMUI]
Ask Edge Shot about it.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm not so sure it's smart
to be slacking off

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.029 position:50% align:center line:84%
during our work studies.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fair point.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50% align:center line:84%
And this will be my
first baseball game.

[FATGUM]
Look alive, team.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50% align:center line:84%
Beat 'em and we get
all-you-can-eat <i>takoyaki</i> !

Don't lemme down!

Right on! Might as well
play to win!

[GROUP]
We got this!

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AMAJIKI sighs] Why am I here?
This is sure to end badly.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
The Orcas versus the Lionels!

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which team is gonna
rise to the occasion

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.891 position:50% align:center line:84%
and win the game of the century?

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center line:84%
Present Mic here
with color commentary.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.772 position:50% align:center line:84%
Backing me up is my
cranky cohost, Eraserhead.

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
Who signed me up for this?

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:55.860 position:50% align:center line:84%
First off, let's lay out the
special rules for HLB games.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AIZAWA]
Calm down.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.739 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] Each team's
made up of nine players.

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center line:84%
No substitutes are
allowed during a game.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center line:84%
Swapping positions
and using pinch runners

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.914 position:50% align:center line:84%
is totally allowed!

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center line:84%
If players can't play, oh well--
the game won't skip a beat!

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
If a batter is injured
and can't swing,

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
they're automatically
considered out!

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center line:84%
Will we be seeing
a neck-and-neck battle

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the ninth inning?

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or will one team forfeit
for having no members left?

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anything can happen
during this epic fight

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
to see who racks
up the most runs.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
These rules are absurd.

--Let's rock this diamond!
--[AMAJIKI] Why am I cursed?

All I want is to go home.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] The Orcas
will start us out at bat.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
First up, their aquatic
captain, Gang Orca!

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.785 position:50% align:center line:84%
Pitching for the
Lionels is Sugarman!

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hold back and you're dead meat.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.206 position:50% align:center line:84%
Throw like your life
depends on it!

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Whoa!

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.967 position:50% align:center line:84%

[yells]

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.096 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] It's a
Quirk-enhanced first pitch!

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
Look at that spin! Incredible!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
He knocked it out of the park!

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center line:84%
Textbook homer!

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AIZAWA]
We're gonna run out of balls.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can feel it.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
You moron!

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.946 position:50% align:center line:84%
Didn't I tell you that
your life was at stake?

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.117 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah. You're right.
I can see that now.

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.119 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
I need a new pitcher!

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:29.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
After just one batter,

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center line:84%
the mound belongs to Mindz!

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center line:84%
What kinda throws is he
hiding up his sleeve?

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHODA]
Twin Impact.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Underhand?

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
Weak. What a letdown.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.344 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hah! Too easy.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
And fire!

Penalty.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
But... there's no way
I could've hit those throws.

the box, it's Tentacole!

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AIZAWA]
What is this?

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] Rules don't limit
the number of bats you can use!

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHOJI] I'll cover
the entire strike zone!

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center line:84%
The ball might suddenly
change speeds,

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
so my timing must be perfect.

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's my chance!

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
And fire!

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] Now that's
what I call a curve ball!

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's impossible to hit!

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROBOT UMPIRE]
Strike one!

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.026 position:50% align:center line:84%

and the Lionels are at bat.
Tailman steps to the plate.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
Pitching for the Orcas
is Kamui Woods.

He winds up for the throw,

Quirk: Lion.

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50% align:center line:84%
He has the same power
and speed as a lion,

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
the king of the beasts!

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
He's tough on his players.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.848 position:50% align:center line:84%
Rumor has it he
throws them off cliffs

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center line:84%
then makes them climb back up.

the reigning king
of marine life!

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, that's putting it lightly.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
Bring it.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KAMUI]
Lacquered Chain Prison!

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your power's useless!
See how it's done, rookie!

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.539 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Shishido smashes Kamui's woods!

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KAMUI]
I've got more!

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:21.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Oh, the humanity!

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shishido's not stopping and
Kamui's not backing down!

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
This has become
a battle of wills!

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO growls]

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KAMUI grunts]

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:39.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
Guide me.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.274 position:50% align:center line:84%
Center! Get big and catch it!

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
Titan Cliff!

[MT. LADY gasps]

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:54.868 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] Woo-hoo! Mt. Lady
has been knocked out cold!

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's Cellophane for the save!

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
That means Shishido's out.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC hollers]
Cellophane is crushed

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center line:84%
by his giganticized teammate!

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
A good death.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:12.344 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Kamui Woods has been chopped.

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shishido might not have made a
base, but that was a fine play!

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center line:84%
He took out three Orca
players with a single hit!

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nice batting!

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nothing "nice" about it.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:23.605 line:10%
[PRESENT MIC]
Top of the second.

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:25.315 line:10%
The Orcas have lost
four-through-six

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.775 line:10%
in their batting order,
so they're leading

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:29.277 line:10%
with number seven. Vine!

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIOZAKI gasps]

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROBOT UMPIRE]
Strike three! You're out!

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
Strike three! You're out!

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.327 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] Two down
in the blink of an eye!

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
Penalty! Penalty!

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:44.459 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] Captain Gang
Orca's blowing a spout of fury!

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Now up to bat is Earphone Jack.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JIRO]
My best chance is...

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.385 position:50% align:center line:84%
And fire.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
High frequency batting!

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] Whoa! Sound
waves are carrying the ball

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center line:84%
through the air!

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center line:84%
I did it!

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
It looks like a base hit!

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center line:84%
You wanna back me up on that?

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center line:84%
Pretend I'm not here.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Shishido catches the fly!

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our walking speaker
doesn't take the base.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
That was close.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
A good effort.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
We'll win this game.

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] Gang Orca's
indomitable fighting spirit

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center line:84%
has his team members
all fired up!

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:36.136 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
It's the bottom of the second

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center line:84%
and Grape Juice is pitching
for our maritime team.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center line:84%
[cackles] Start swinging.

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is my special pitch!

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center line:84%
Homer! Easy!

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
It's outta he--

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not so fast!

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] The ball came
back and nailed Sugarman

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center line:84%
right in the sugarcubes!

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:02.120 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's probably the last
we'll see of him this game.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MINETA laughs]
Like that?

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's my Quirk disguised with
powder from the rosin bag.

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nobody's gonna score
with my special balls.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.590 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Number five, Shoda, is out, too!

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
Damn. How do we stop him?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.094 position:50% align:center line:84%
Times like this,
you gotta be smart.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's that mean?

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.933 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TETSUTETSU] If the ball's
gonna come back...

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.060 position:50% align:center line:84%
'Kay, Tin Man.

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50% align:center line:84%
Eat this!

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
...then I might as well
get rid of the bat!

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center line:84%
[groans]

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aw, yeah! Nailed it.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROBOT UMPIRE] You're out!
Real Steel is ejected!

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? What for?

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Talk about a foul play!

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
We may have few rules,

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
but you can't attack
a pitcher like that!

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
What the hell were you
thinking, you idiot?

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
[yelps] Steel!

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.838 position:50% align:center line:84%

Whoa. So scary.

I wanna go home!

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] It's the final
game of the HLB season

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center line:84%
and at the end of the second
inning, the Orcas have the lead

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center line:84%
with a score of one to zero!

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.995 position:50% align:center line:84%
That said, they are
down to five players.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let's see if they're able
to eke out any more runs!

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh? It looks like the Lionels
are changing pitchers.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fatgum takes the
mound from Mindz.

[SHISHIDO yells]

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
What have we here?

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center line:84%
Captain Shishido is going
to town on his own player!

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center line:84%
What kind of pep talk is that?

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is Fat Adsorption.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:48.226 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fat's Quirk allows him
to harness the power of

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shishido's impacts and
store them in his body.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.774 position:50% align:center line:84%
The last thing they want
is another home run.

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA] Hm. You think
you're so clever.

00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center line:84%
Bring down that whale.
No matter what it takes.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just don't forget our reward.

All-you-can-eat <i>takoyaki</i> !

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's yours.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's about time this
game got serious.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:18.673 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AMAJIKI] Please, Fat.
Don't let him hit the ball.

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:23.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
And if he does, please, please
don't let it come my way!

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:24.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FATGUM]
Right!

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Naniwa Fat Throwing Style!

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.187 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
The perfect pitch.

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] This is
my worst nightmare.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Suneater's snuffed out!

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
He couldn't hold the ball,
so it's live.

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kirishima picks up the slack!

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHODA yelps]

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Mindz surfs into the sky

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
on Orca's ultrasonic waves!

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tailman throws the
dropped ball to third!

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.667 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO growls]

[BOTH yelling]

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
He's tagged out!

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Lionels rally after
a series of errors!

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
But it did cost them
Suneater and Mindz!

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, man. Not good.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.940 position:50% align:center line:84%
Used too much power.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.942 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] Fatgum burned
through too much energy

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center line:84%
and has deflated!

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
[sighs]

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shiozaki?

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
The drama is too much for Vine.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center line:84%
Bad timing for a nap.

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Lionels now have
five players left,

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center line:84%
one more than the Orcas.

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:36.084 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] In a changeup
we were waiting for,

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center line:84%
Captain Shishido
has taken the mound!

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.171 position:50% align:center line:84%
Chargebolt is at bat!

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
This kid shouldn't be an issue.

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center line:84%
But you can't be too careful.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:49.472 position:50% align:center line:84%
I give the hunt my all,
no matter how small the prey.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
Lion-like force!

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hot dang! That's what
I call a fastball!

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
Gevaudan is out cold,
along with our trusty umpire!

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:13.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
And the shock wave took out
Chargebolt as well!

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh. This is so not cool.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHOJI]
You should take a dive.

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:19.878 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's no reason
for you to keep playing.

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[SHOJI] Oh, no!
--[PRESENT MIC] Cut the music!

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center line:84%
Earphone Jack must
fear for her life,

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
because she's passed
out just like Vine!

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Orcas are down
to only two players!

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, Sugarman.
You're my catcher!

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center line:84%
Me? Really?

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:43.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHOJI]
This isn't sport. It's torture.

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:44.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
We'll hold them back for now,

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center line:84%
then turn it around in
the bottom of the third!

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
The championship is ours.

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
Lion-like force!

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] Oh! Deja vu!
It's just like before!

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sugarman is toast!
Along with Tentacole!

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.716 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] When the batter
gets fried, it's an instant out!

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, time to change
sides once again.

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let's get those Lionels
off 'a the field.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center line:84%
If this game gets
any more out of hand,

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm erasing Quirks.

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Please do!

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center line:84%
We move into the
bottom of the third

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center line:84%
but the score stays one-zero
favoring the Orcas.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center line:84%
Unfortunately for them, they've
been reduced to a team of one!

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center line:84%
The captain's the
only player remaining!

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KIRISHIMA]
This is for Fat, Amajiki,

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center line:84%
and the rest who've fallen!

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KIRISHIMA] I have one opponent.
I just have to get past him.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm unbreakable!

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KIRISHIMA]
Such power!

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.271 position:50% align:center line:84%
Can't back down!

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I do, it's over for me.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
After all that jazz,
it was a bunt!

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
Gang Orca fields the ball!

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
But there's nobody
to throw it to!

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
Runner takes first!

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah!

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:21.583 position:50% align:center line:84%
With no basemen in sight,

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
he could steal his way
around the entire infield!

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
All right. Way to go, Kirishima.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center line:84%
You earned that.

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.010 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tailman. Go.

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
Relieve Red Riot and step in
as his pinch runner.

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh. But, sir.

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center line:84%
The poor little guy's
done everything he can.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:40.727 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll handle this now.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
Orca's going down.

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
The Lionels swap runners.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll be taking over from here.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center line:84%
You did a great job.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center line:84%
Stand proud.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center line:84%
And go rest up.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
[sighs] Thank you.

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:58.370 position:50% align:center line:84%
[OJIRO] You should
tell that to Shishido.

00:17:58.453 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
Play resumes!

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
With no outs and
a runner on first,

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
the feral captain of
the Lionels is up to bat!

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
So, what now?

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:10.215 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
First, we even up the score.

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
Let's make this interesting.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:16.596 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC]
It's a strike!

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center line:84%
Probably!

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
Orca's slow to move

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center line:84%
as Tailman darts around second
and reaches third!

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center line:84%
He crosses the plate!
The score is now tied!

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
At last.

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO] We don't have
to hold back anymore.

[ANNOUNCEMENT A]
Warning! Be on high alert!

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center line:84%
A bank-robbing villain
is currently driving

00:18:57.345 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center line:84%
a large truck north on
a nearby prefectural road.

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please avoid the area. I repeat.

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:06.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
North on a prefectural road.

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:09.441 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, if that's the case,
then we can head them off!

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's our prey.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[GANG ORCA] After you.
--[SHISHIDO] Thanks!

Your turn!

Oh, come on!

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:54.527 position:50% align:center line:84%

Enough.

[groans]

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, Orca!

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:04.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shishido, sir!

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:05.830 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
About time.

00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center line:84%
You three keep an eye on the
villain until the police arrive.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA] Handle traffic
while you're at it.

'Cause you'll be...?

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
Need you ask?

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA, SHISHIDO]
The game must go on!

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:22.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA] I'll finish this
with a single pitch.

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
One hit's all I need.

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
Victory... is mine!

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:38.613 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
This game...

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
...belongs to me!

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center line:84%
[groans]

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHISHIDO]
It's true.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:01.177 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GANG ORCA]
Baseball...

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH] ...is the greatest
sport in the world.

[airhorn blares]

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:09.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRESENT MIC] The game is over!
Both of our captains are KOed!

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:11.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
Since Tailman isn't around,

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center line:84%
HLB rules state that both
teams must withdraw!

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:17.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
The outcome of today's
championship game

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
is an unexpected tie between
the Orcas and the Lionels!

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center line:84%
I swear I am never
playing baseball again.

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:40.508 position:50% align:center line:84%
What a truly horrible
experience that was.

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
[sighs] Tell me about it.

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
I never should have
agreed to this.

Hello? Somebody there?

Get me outta here! Please!
