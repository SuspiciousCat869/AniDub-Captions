00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.481
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Masquerade Unmasked!\"

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.156
MASQUERADE: Goodbye, Dan.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.327
Goodbye?

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.835
Where am I?

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.636
I don't know how I got here.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.572
Alice!

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:46.706
Oh no!

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:48.208
I don't understand!

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.609
What was I doing?

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.010
I can't remember anything!

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.412
[gasps]

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.813
Now it all makes sense!

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.548
Alice was Masquerade all along.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.916
Come on!

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.284
Our Alice?

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.519
No way!

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.558
Hal-G!

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.160
He's ugly!

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:09.496
Is that...? It's HAL-G!

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.597
Grandfather...

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.066
It is time to go Alice.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.234
Come with me!

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.770
My dear...

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.906
Don't you realize that Masquerade's personality

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.909
will always be a part of you.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.211
Masquerade's personality?

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:28.148
Is a part of me?

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.449
Hey ugly!

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.417
You leave her alone!

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:35.054
[screaming]

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.123
You okay Dan!

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:41.728
Do you remember that day Alice, so long ago?

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.563
I was in my laboratory

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.932
and I had just returned from Vestroia,

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.500
and I wanted to leave a record

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.003
of what I had seen in that dimension...

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.070
[beep]

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:53.439
What I'm about to reveal here today, is true...

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.308
My research into the development of a Dimension

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.077
Transporter System is a complete success!

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.947
The tests, achieved more than I hoped for,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.715
or even dreamed of...

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.386
I can now transport anything I want from a place far away

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.321
to anywhere in the universe.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.523
Hey we heard all about this

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.625
at Alice's grandpappy's mansion!

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.827
Don't you guys remember?

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.602
I see...

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:25.271
So you saw my testimonial.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.207
But there's more you need to know.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.676
And so...

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.278
I believe that these Bakugan creatures can only appear

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.514
in our world in the form of a ball.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:35.615
Also...

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:37.450
Only on the battlefield, which has the same

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.586
dimensional structure as Vestroia,

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.254
can they go back to their original form.

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:42.589
[buzzing]

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.059
I wasn't able to finish my research statement

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:48.561
because during the time that I recorded my testimonial,

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:51.497
a Mega Dimensional Nova was occurring on Vestroia.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.601
Mega Dimensional Nova?

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:55.668
That's right!

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:58.004
Obviously you've heard of that before haven't you?

00:03:58.037 --> 00:03:59.939
It's the phenomenon that occurred when Naga tried

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.874
to take control of the Infinity Core

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.509
as well as the Silent Core.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.745
[evil laugh]

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.780
Yes, it's good...

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:10.783
Now if I absorb the power of the \"Infinity Core\",

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:12.385
I'll have total...

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.354
[scream]

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:15.722
No!

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.057
I didn't expect the negative power of the \"Silent Core\"

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.560
to be this great!

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.363
I won't be able to control it for much longer!

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:28.568
[screaming]

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.571
It's... absorbing... me!

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:42.181
That was a very dark day that I will never forget.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.250
What?

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.519
What's happening?

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:58.131
Why is a Darkus Bakugan in Pyrus space?

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.969
DRAGO: That was the day, Dan and I first met...

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.507
What is this place?

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.079
Yes I remember that day...

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.281
That was when I saw the Infinity Core cross

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:18.685
into the human world...

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:20.520
WAVERN: And it changed me forever...

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:21.654
ALL: Huh?

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.991
Things were never the same after I was drawn

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.492
into the Infinity Core.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.961
[screaming]

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:33.766
Massive negative power from the Mega Dimensional Nova

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.234
was released...

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:37.470
It passed through the Dimension Transporter System

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.706
and contaminated my laboratory.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.140
Then Alice arrived.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.542
Yes... [buzzer]

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:47.480
How are you Grandfather?

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.382
Alice was completely unaware that her life

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.884
was never going to be the same after that day.

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.460
A flood of negative energy filled the lab

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:01.728
and surrounded us.

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.331
It changed my body and that is how I became Hal-G!

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:08.000
And I changed too.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.969
That's right... Alice...

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.270
You changed.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:12.772
You took on the separate personality

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.407
known as Masquerade.

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.479
Hold on... I remember!

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.714
You never finished that story

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:23.616
you recorded in your lab.

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:27.320
Hey! Come back!

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:28.421
So what happened next?

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:29.522
Oh well...

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.057
At least we know Alice's grandfather

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.192
went to Vestroia right?

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.560
That's something.

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:36.062
I'm sorry.

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:37.263
Alice...

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.599
It's okay, there's no need for you to apologize.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:43.069
Hello there!

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:45.004
Grandfather?

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:46.839
My name is HAL-G...

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:49.008
Bow down before me!

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.476
HAL-G?

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.145
Together with the great Naga...

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.780
The human world...

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:56.282
And Vestroia will be destroyed!

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:59.418
[evil laughter]

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.988
MARUCHO: Everyone, quick!

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:03.823
Come here and take a look at this!

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:06.359
I found something!

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:08.594
I'll zoom in so you can see it better.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.732
Look there!

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.534
-That's... -Masquerade!

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:16.803
When Naga triggered the Mega Dimensional Nova

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.771
he started the destruction of Vestroia

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:22.341
and created a second identity of Alice known as Masquerade.

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:26.179
I remember now...

00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:27.580
I do...

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:28.815
I remember everything.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.153
I can grant you any wish with these cards here.

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.222
All you have to do is use them!

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:59.345
Hey Alice!

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:02.782
[laugh]

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.984
Runo? Marucho?

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.752
Where are you guys?

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:07.887
Calm down, Dan.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.256
Runo and Marucho have disappeared.

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:12.625
How do you expect me to stay calm?

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.727
Dan! Where are you going?

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.262
I'm going to find them!

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:18.197
Oh no Dan, wait for us!

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.365
We'll come and help you!

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:28.174
Any luck? No!

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:36.282
Anyone there?

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:37.817
Guess it was a mouse.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.952
MASQUERADE: Ha! Those two look lost.

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:58.304
I'm coming in Alice, I've made you some oatmeal.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.475
Alice?

00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:04.310
That's funny I didn't see her go out?

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.948
So this whole time I've been Masquerade.

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:13.619
[crying]

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:14.754
Alice...

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:19.792
I know why she didn't remember before.

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:22.161
Alice?

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:25.197
What is it? Alice?

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.532
It's okay...

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:27.533
I'm fine.

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:30.603
I guess I'm just a little tired today.

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:32.838
I lied... I'm sorry.

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:34.106
It wasn't you...

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.541
It was Masquerade.

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:37.743
It's all my fault!

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:41.247
Remember when I ... was in...

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.883
I just don't feel like myself.

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.384
It's so strange.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.385
Huh?

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.287
Help me...

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:51.023
I don't know who I am anymore.

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:52.692
Well... Don't worry...

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:55.661
You don't have to listen to Masquerade ever again.

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.364
WAVERN: Your friends will take care of you now Alice.

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.666
But how can all of you ever forgive me...

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.834
Oh no...

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:03.569
I did so many bad things!

00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:07.106
Well... You proved one thing...

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.175
Masquerade knew where to find us...

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.544
Because you were him!

00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:15.247
[crying]

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.415
HAL-G: Alice.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.652
It's time to go home!

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:23.422
Let's go back to the mansion in the forest.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.224
Grandfather?

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.592
[laughing]

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.060
Come along my dear.

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:30.663
No Alice! Don't go!

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:33.532
[evil laugh]

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:35.401
[scream]

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.403
Don't be afraid!

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:39.005
Now that everyone knows who you are...

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:41.607
The only place for you to be is with me

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.642
where you rightfully belong!

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:44.810
So...Alice...

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:46.812
Be a good girl and come along now.

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:48.347
No! She stays here!

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.082
Alice is still Alice!

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.917
And she's gonna stay here with us!

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:54.253
Dan?

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:56.022
Don't you go Alice!

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:57.323
You're a Brawler!

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:58.391
Stay here!

00:10:58.424 --> 00:10:59.725
You're part of the team now!

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:00.926
Don't go!

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.561
Yeah we need you Alice!

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:06.065
Thank you I want to stay.

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.266
No...

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:10.302
How can any of you ever trust me again?

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.470
No! Wait!

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.706
Goodbye, everyone...

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:17.943
All right Grandfather, I'm ready!

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.845
Alice! Don't go!

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.915
No!

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:27.553
Goodbye Brawlers!

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:29.121
[evil laugh]

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.524
No!

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.560
Alice!

00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:36.896
Come back!

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:39.632
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be back

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:41.033
after these messages!

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:45.137
Now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:50.509
RUNO: Alice has only been gone for a few days now

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.311
but it seems a lot longer...

00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:55.047
We thought we might find her back at her grandfather's lab

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:56.816
but she wasn't there.

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:01.720
I really miss her and I can't stop thinking about her.

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:08.461
Where are you Alice?

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:10.429
... Where are you?

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:11.864
Please come back to us.

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:16.335
We forgive you for everything.

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:18.671
If only there was some way we could let you know.

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:22.208
MARUCHO: The summer vacation is over.

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:26.212
Julie's gone back home and Shun's back at his place again.

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:27.546
Thank you.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.982
Our families sure are glad to see us again though...

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:32.351
She's... Home!

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:34.753
[laughter]

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.856
[chirping]

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.757
But strange weather patterns have been happening

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.292
all over the world...

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:42.328
Scientists have been trying to figure them out,

00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:45.131
so far no one's come up with any explanation

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:46.499
for it all...

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:49.135
It's like the whole world has been turned upside down.

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:51.504
The new school year should have started but it's so hot

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:53.239
all the schools are still closed.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.875
Grownups are starting to worry because they realize

00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:58.377
something is seriously wrong...

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.246
The world has changed.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.949
DRAGO: I know the real reason behind this bizarre weather.

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:05.951
Vestroia is collapsing

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:09.989
and its decay is causing the erosion of the human world.

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:20.299
DAN: This problem is affecting everyone on the planet.

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:22.535
And that's when my Mom and Dad decided they had to get

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:24.436
the word out about Bakugan.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.638
That's right...

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:27.306
I have something important to tell you all!

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:29.074
Marucho's parents were all ears...

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.309
As were Runo's folks,

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:31.810
and so was Joe's Mom.

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:33.312
And Julie's parents were in,

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:34.814
and even though it took a while,

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:36.582
eventually Shun's grandfather was willing to listen.

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:39.285
They were shocked but in the end they all understood

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.520
that the Bakugan were real.

00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:43.189
And even tried to help them.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.191
Then one day...

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:46.492
While our parents were meeting,

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:49.128
something horrible began to happen on Vestroia.

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.997
NAGA: I can feel it. I feel the power.

00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:53.699
The power of the Silent Core's energy

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:55.234
is flowing through me!

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:57.303
But I need the Infinity Core's power

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.938
to complete my plan.

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:00.673
I must have both of them.

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.274
Can you hear me my sister.

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:03.876
Listen to me Wavern!

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:06.145
I want the power of the Infinity Core!

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:08.881
Give it to me!

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:10.950
I've waited long enough.

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:12.751
If you won't bring the Infinity Core to me

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:16.322
then I'll come take it from you!

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:33.872
[scream]

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:39.845
WAVERN: No Naga!

00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:42.381
You can't have it!

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:45.150
[grunting]

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:49.488
Wavern!

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:53.225
My body, it's burning up!

00:14:57.997 --> 00:15:00.199
It's okay! I'm right here now!

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:02.234
The Infinity Core within me...

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:04.236
it's resonating with the Silent Core

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.205
connected to my brother...

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:08.173
We must hurry or Naga...

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:10.376
Naga will cross over to this world!

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:11.443
Don't worry...

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:12.878
Just relax now.

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:14.980
[loud crash]

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:21.620
REPORTER: Right now we're flying above the Pacific Ocean

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:24.056
and what I'm seeing is truly amazing!

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:26.025
I just learned that late last night,

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:28.694
a gigantic \"hole\" opened up in the middle of the ocean

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:31.063
and swallowed an entire cargo ship!

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:33.732
Rescuers are currently searching for survivors!

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:36.268
Let's get a closer look.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.270
We're in the center of the hole but I still can't see

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:39.638
the bottom of it!

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.807
No one we've spoken to seems to know where this hole

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.076
came from or why it's even here!

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.678
The wind is blowing hard out here

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:47.212
so we're going to head back!

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:50.482
My report will continue stay tuned!

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:52.751
I have some breaking news coming in...

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.087
All right go ahead Miss Beverly.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.323
I'm coming to you from the hospital where the surviving

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:59.892
crew members of the cargo ship have been taken.

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:02.361
Luckily all crew members have been rescued...

00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:04.663
It's a real miracle folks!

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:07.633
Let's get a word from the Navigation Officer!

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.335
[scream]

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:11.603
A monster! A monster!

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.038
Arghh!

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:15.474
And now over to you in the studio.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:18.077
We'll be back after these messages.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.245
We should really tell them everything Wavern.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:21.947
DAN: That's right Marucho!

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.315
MARUCHO: I don't believe it.

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:25.050
You're alleging that, that giant hole in the middle of

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:27.019
the ocean leads to Vestroia?

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:29.188
WAVERN: Why yes, I'm afraid so.

00:16:29.221 --> 00:16:31.190
DRAGO:So that means Vestroia and the human world

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:32.925
are now connected...

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.426
Then that means...

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.362
Naga can come through.

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:37.463
Yes...

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:40.065
He'll probably try and cross over very soon...

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:42.668
And he'll be looking for the Infinity Core.

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:45.537
And he won't stop until he finds it!

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.306
I don't like the sound of that!

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:48.574
That's not good!

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:50.642
Yeah that's bad!

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.711
So what should we do Dan?

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:53.979
Any ideas?

00:16:54.012 --> 00:16:55.714
We don't have much time!

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:58.550
Okay!

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.452
... If we all go into that hole...

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:02.688
That'll take us to Vestroia, right?

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:03.856
ALL: Uh huh.

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.724
Dan you're not thinking what I think you're thinking,

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:06.925
are you?

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:09.094
Face it Drago we can't just sit around here and wait

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:10.963
for Naga to come to us.

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:12.398
We strike first!

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:15.067
All of us are going in after him!

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.301
ALL: Yeah!

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:18.470
Right! Let's do it!

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.711
I'm sorry Dan,

00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:26.845
I really want to

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.114
but I won't be coming with you guys this time.

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:30.549
Aw that's okay...

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:33.385
Somebody's got to stay here and hold down the fort...

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.053
And we're all counting on you.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:36.455
No problem.

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:37.489
[laughs]

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:39.958
Joe look after Wavern too okay?

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:42.294
Sure... You bet!

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.929
You be careful, Drago.

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:45.464
I will.

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:47.199
So let's see...

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:48.767
We've got here...

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.102
Cough drops...

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:51.203
You'll need them...

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:54.373
Ah! Where's the first aid kit?

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:56.708
Don't worry Dad, we'll be fine.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.811
We'll be home in no time...

00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:00.712
Just wait and see.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:04.950
[crying] My baby!

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.685
There, there now.

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:08.954
See ya soon Mom and Dad.

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:11.557
Yes... We're so proud of you son.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.959
You certainly are becoming quite a fine young man.

00:18:13.992 --> 00:18:15.994
All right... Stay safe!

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:17.095
I will!

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:18.464
Be careful.

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:19.965
Of course.

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:20.966
Dan...

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:22.468
We'll both be thinking of you...

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.170
You do your best!

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:27.840
And don't let anything stand in your way!

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.808
We know you'll succeed...

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:32.277
And when you finally get back...

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:33.445
We'll be here.

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:34.513
Great!

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:35.948
There's nothing to worry about,

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:37.349
we'll keep them all safe.

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:38.750
Thank you...

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.085
Take care now.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.654
Okay see you soon.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.091
Bye!

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:54.766
P.A. VOICE: Warning! Warning!

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.435
Please clear the launch site!

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:58.203
Firing main engines!

00:18:58.237 --> 00:18:59.671
One and two!

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:01.306
Main gate open!

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:18.824
[various goodbyes]

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:19.858
Hey...

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:21.026
Come... Back!

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:22.694
Come back Runo!

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:24.029
You forgot this!

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:25.130
Come on!

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:27.399
Can't you see me holding this up?

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:30.669
KATO: I'll be picking up Master Shun at his dojo now sir.

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:46.218
DAN: Hey check it out!

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:47.853
Look at all the bright lights!

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:49.121
RUNO: Give it rest would ya Dan.

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:53.392
KATO: Sir I'll be setting the plane down here

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:55.627
to pick up Miss Julie.

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:56.828
Standby.

00:19:56.862 --> 00:20:02.568
[\u266a]

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:04.636
I'm ready for action!

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.706
KATO: Sir we're approaching our destination.

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:11.209
RUNO: So that's it?

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:13.478
TIGRERRA: The negative energy coming off it is very strong.

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:15.214
I can feel it all around me.

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:17.316
PREYAS: It's giving me the heebie jeebies!

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.685
ANGELO: I guess there's no turning back now.

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:21.086
DIABLO: You want to turn back!

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:23.088
Ha! Not me! This is gonna be fun!

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:24.423
Come on Kato!

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:25.724
Let's do this!

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:28.126
Yes... Yes... Right away sir.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:36.501
All right...

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.570
I expect everyone to be back for dinner...

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:41.573
I'll be making a batch of my world famous liver kabobs

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:42.908
so don't be late!

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:45.911
[laughter]

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:47.546
Go!

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:49.848
Okay! Are you ready?

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:51.450
ALL: Yeah!

00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:54.119
[laughing]

00:20:54.152 --> 00:20:58.090
Wooooo!

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:05.631
[\u266a]

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:09.334
ALICE: Coming up on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers...

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:12.304
I've decided to get as far away from my friends as possible.

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:14.239
I'm so ashamed of what I did when I was Masquerade

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.907
that I can hardly bare it.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:17.275
But where will I go?

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:18.644
I need to find some new friends

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.245
who don't know about my past.

00:21:20.278 --> 00:21:22.347
I don't want to give myself away but I'm still haunted

00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:24.016
by visions of Masquerade.

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:26.084
I don't know who I am anymore.

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.053
There's only one way to find out

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:29.855
and that's with a Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:31.790
If I can win this battle then maybe I can feel

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.492
like my old self again.

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:35.460
This is my last chance and I gotta go for it!
