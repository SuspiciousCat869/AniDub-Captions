WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.674
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.008
when all these random cards

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.211
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:13.413
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.647
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.983
invented this cool new game...

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.151
That's when we realized

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.754
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.322
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.124
from another world!

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.093
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.795
Runo...

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.231
Marucho...

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.936
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.005
And Alice, we are...

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.241
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.342
Bakugan!

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.512
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.515
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.885
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.887
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.155
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.023
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:58.324
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.494
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.663
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.467
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.570
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.373
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.707
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:22.015
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Show Me What You Got!\"

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.458
DANIEL'S MOTHER: Come on Dan!

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.659
It's time to get up now!

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:39.766
Ah, another perfect day in the city!

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.167
Yes the conditions are just right

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.336
for your battle with Skyress!

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.139
Yeah I can hardly wait for the action to start!

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.441
I'm glad you're up for it because this could be

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.410
your toughest challenge yet!

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.179
Don't worry... I won't lose!

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.180
I know...

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.015
It's part of the test remember!

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.384
Just make sure you're not late!

00:01:58.418 --> 00:01:59.719
I won't be!

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:00.954
Well...

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.455
I said we'd meet them at Runo's house

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.023
so we'd better get moving!

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.558
Runo's house?

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.328
Yeah I haven't seen her for a couple days now!

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.529
I suppose you're right...

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.197
And where has Alice been?

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:12.699
I have no idea.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.901
They haven't been online for a while either.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.035
So...

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.071
Let's go and check up on them!

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.206
You'll have to go without me Dan!

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.576
Uh, I've made some plans of my own!

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.879
I'll be back in time for the battle.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:28.314
Why don't I just meet you at the park!

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.949
You made plans of your own?

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.384
That's not like you?

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.052
You'll have to get used to it Dan!

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.788
I've figured out how to move around quite well in this form

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.525
and I just feel like going out on my own for change!

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:39.726
It's nothing personal,

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.528
I just want a little time to myself!

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:42.862
It's a big world out there!

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:43.963
I'm not a child!

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.032
Don't talk to strangers!

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.333
Stop speaking to me like that!

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.035
You know I can take care of myself!

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.637
I'll see you later!

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.139
Hey!

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:55.408
Make sure you look both ways when you cross the street!

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.410
Silence human!

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.746
DAN: What? Alice is missing!

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.047
Shhh!

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.048
Keep it down!

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.250
I don't want my Mom and Dad to hear us!

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:07.320
This isn't the first time that Alice has disappeared!

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:10.557
I guess I should have told you before but the truth is,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.358
sometimes she's gone for days at a time.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.461
-On her own? -Yeah...

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.330
But she always comes back and seems just fine

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.065
so I never thought anything of it...

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.467
She's been gone a long time.

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:22.602
I see...

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.971
So that's why you didn't make it to my last battle!

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.439
Oh Dan...

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:28.575
I hope Alice isn't in trouble.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.344
EXEDRA: And now you must prove yourself

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.379
by passing \"the test!\"

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.414
Ha!

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.583
And she is to be my opponent?

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:39.052
You are really underestimating me!

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:40.520
This girl is not real.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.422
She is a figment of your imagination.

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:45.058
However, she is the hurdle you must overcome.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.993
A hurdle I must overcome huh?

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:48.094
[laughs]

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:50.263
This is hardly worth my time at all.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.264
Ha!

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.199
Are you sure you know yourself so well?

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:56.769
If you underestimate her , you will be sorry!

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:57.870
Bakugan...

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.305
Brawl!

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.241
Centipoid stand!

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:05.612
Bakugan...

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.247
Brawl!

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.414
Siege Stand!

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:12.852
BAKUPOD: Bakugan recognized.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.887
Aren't you afraid of me?

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:15.955
No!

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.157
Of course not, I know everything about you!

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:19.292
Good...

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:20.827
Then there's no reason for us not to have a battle,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.828
right?

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.563
Gate Card, Set!

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.232
Bakugan...

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:27.533
Brawl!

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.769
Darkus Wormquake Stand!

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:33.006
Gate Card... Set!

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:36.643
Bakugan...

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:37.844
Brawl!

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:39.512
Mantris Stand!

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:43.850
Ability Card Activate!

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:45.018
Marionette!

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:49.355
Send Centipoid to Seige's area.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.594
BAKUPOD: Centipoid now challenges Siege

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.629
in his region of the battlefield!

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.197
No way...

00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.632
He can't!

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.067
That's not fair!

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.635
It's not an unusual move

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.037
for one who doesn't think twice

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.805
about sending Bakugan to the Doom Dimension!

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:08.374
Gate Card... Open!

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:09.842
Mine Ghost!

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:13.079
Hold it!

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.347
Ability activate...

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.548
Grand Down!

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:24.123
BAKUPOD: Gate Card cancelled!

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.459
You made my gate card useless!

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.807
I don't think Alice is around here.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.975
I'll stay down here a little bit longer...

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.911
But don't tell anyone where I am...

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:47.413
I don't want them to worry about me.

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:49.382
TIGRERRA: By the way Dan, where's Drago?

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.084
Are you two arguing?

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:52.085
Nah!

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:53.419
He made other plans

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:55.521
but he said he'd show up for our battle!

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:56.923
What battle?

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:58.825
Did Masquerade come looking for you again

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.893
and challenge you to a duel?

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.061
Uh no...

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.329
Kinda...

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.565
RUNO: You're kidding!

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:07.967
So you're test is to battle all the other Brawlers!

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.235
Yeah...

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:11.037
You could say Drago and I have our work cut out for us!

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.072
Who have you fought so far Dan?

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.208
Well we beat Julie and Marucho yesterday...

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:17.343
And today we're gonna battle Shun.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:19.746
Then I guess that means I'm next!

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.381
Yep! You're on my list!

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:23.483
Uh go easy on me okay?

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:24.784
Dan I'm curious...

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:27.587
Tell me, what would happen if Skyress defeats Drago?

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.388
Then you don't have to battle...

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:31.357
That would be your lucky break huh?

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.759
Hey hold on!

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.894
Are you trying to say that I'm going to lose to Shun?

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.729
Uh no... Of course not!

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.865
However there is something I want to ask you Dan...

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.900
It's about Drago and I...

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:43.870
And it's very important to me!

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.773
What was it that Wavern said?

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:50.276
You can meet me at Joe's condo if you like.

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.784
One small pizza for the customer...

00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:59.352
One giant tip for me!

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:01.687
[laughs]

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.556
This must be the place.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.425
WAVERN: There's someone I've haven't seen in a long time!

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:08.594
Wavern! Is that you?

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:11.130
CHILD: I know let's play hide-and-seek!

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:14.267
Okay I'll count to ten...

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.736
One, two, three...

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.506
It so good to see you Drago!

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.408
Do you remember the first time we met?

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:24.777
Yes I do!

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.679
It was during the time when I first slipped between

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.514
the dimensions of the two worlds...

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.082
There you were...

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.751
Looking quite elegant as I recall.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.252
-I found you! -Aww...

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.720
But you weren't alone...

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:36.155
Naga was there too!

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:38.424
I was surprised to find both of you

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:39.625
in such a desolate place.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.661
What are you doing here?

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:43.329
You don't belong here.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.031
You should return to your World.

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:46.999
What are your Attributes?

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.268
I can tell you're neither Haos nor Ventus...

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.403
Your skin is so white...

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:52.405
I've never seen that before.

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:54.106
NAGA: We are the \"White ones\"

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.709
and we do not belong to any attribute world...

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:58.711
We are the forgotten ones...

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:00.479
The White Ones?

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:03.216
After that, you came to see me time and time again...

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.984
That was so kind of you.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:07.386
I'd like to see the outside world someday...

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.855
I'd like to,

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.857
but I don't know if I'll ever get the chance.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.458
I'll take you there Wavern.

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:13.726
Really?

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.862
Yes. It would be my pleasure.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.065
DRAGO: But that's when Naga tried to take over

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:22.001
my fire attributed world known as Pyrus...

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:25.905
Wait Naga!

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.006
Get out of my way!

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.674
This world is mine!

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.743
Why do you crave so much power?

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:32.445
Even if you were to get it,

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:34.146
it would only lead to your destruction!

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.815
You know you can't control it!

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:38.451
Be quiet! You don't understand!

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:39.919
I am a \"white one\"

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:43.022
and I'm tired of being powerless!

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:45.157
WAVERN: The \"White ones\" are a mutated Bakugan

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.360
born during the process of evolving...

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.362
They are the forgotten ones who live powerless

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:50.997
in between dimensions.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.332
When their time comes they simply fade away...

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.268
It is a sad fate!

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:58.104
But my brother Naga wanted to change his destiny...

00:08:58.137 --> 00:09:00.940
He felt cheated that he was born without any real power

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:04.076
so he decided that he was going to get it at any cost...

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.811
No matter who got in his way!

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:08.114
So he set his sights on getting the Infinity Core

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:09.615
and the Silent Core,

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:12.919
in the hopes of becoming the most powerful Bakugan...

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:15.187
NAGA: Ah all this energy from the Silent Core feels so good!

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.790
And I'm sure The Infinity Core will be even better!

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.992
[screaming]

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.827
This wasn't supposed to happen!

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.963
I didn't expect the negative power of the Silent Core

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:26.098
to be this great!

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:29.101
I won't be able to control it for long!

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:30.536
[screaming]

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:32.672
No! It's too much for me!

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:36.742
[screaming]

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:39.111
WAVERN: And it's because of my brother's actions

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:42.114
that Vestroia is now on the verge of destruction...

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:47.720
And while I was drawn into the runaway Infinity Core

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:50.589
somehow I ended up in the human world...

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:53.492
And that's how we ended up meeting again Drago.

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:56.228
That's one good thing to come out of this terrible situation.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.797
Yes I suppose...

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.366
I'm so ashamed of my brother Naga...

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.335
What he's doing is wrong!

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:04.637
All wrong!

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.239
Using one's power to gain total control

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.241
is not the way of the Bakugan!

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.676
And it never should be!

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:14.046
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.348
after these messages!

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:19.952
Now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:27.326
Look it's almost time for the battle!

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:31.497
Oh? Hey!

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.598
There's Shun now!

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.538
WAVERN: At first I couldn't control

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:41.474
the Infinity Core inside of me

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:42.908
and couldn't move about,

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:45.444
but eventually I gained control of it.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.613
And that means that my brother will soon find a way

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.949
to free himself from the Silent Core

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.384
and then he'll make his move

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:53.219
and come after the Infinity Core.

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:57.390
Oh! Joe's here!

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:58.624
I have to go!

00:10:58.657 --> 00:10:59.792
Take care Drago!

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.193
It was good talking with you

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:02.962
and good luck with your battle!

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.631
Thank you Wavern.

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:09.301
[sinister laugh]

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.470
NAGA: I sense the Infinity Core is with my sister...

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.472
Now isn't that interesting.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.007
[laughs]

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.443
I think I'll contact her!

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:20.179
[scream]

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:22.281
Open your eyes, my sister.

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:24.884
The \"White ones\" are no longer powerless...

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:27.353
It is time for us to fulfill our destiny

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:30.022
by dominating Vestroia.

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:34.593
Come, join me, your brother, and we'll rule Vestroia -

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:36.862
no, the entire universe -

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:40.766
We will be reborn as the most powerful Bakugan ever!

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:44.103
Joe!

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:46.439
Wavern...

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:48.340
Where did you run off too on your own?

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.875
Just sightseeing.

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:51.644
[groaning]

00:11:51.677 --> 00:11:53.045
Hey are you okay?

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.680
It's the Infinity Core...

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.183
It feels like it's trying to break free from me.

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.284
I'm right here...

00:11:58.317 --> 00:12:00.086
Don't you worry now.

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:03.723
The Infinity Core must be resonating

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.324
with the Silent Core somehow.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:07.960
Thanks Joe.

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:09.161
I'm better now.

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:10.229
Good...

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.530
That's a relief!

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.865
It must be Naga...

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:16.001
He must be trying to absorb the Silent Core.

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.339
This isn't like Dan at all.

00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:21.774
He never misses a battle!

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:24.810
Maybe he stopped for something to eat on the way?

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:29.548
What?

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.816
It's starting to snow.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.618
[ringing]

00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:33.752
It's Dan.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.825
Can you believe this ladies and gentlemen,

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.528
it's the middle of summer and it's begun to snow.

00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:44.263
There has never been anything quite like this

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:46.165
on record before.

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:47.266
DRAGO: Oh no.

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:49.001
I hope I'm not late for the battle.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:51.470
I know Dan won't be too pleased with me if I am.

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:54.039
Huh? Who's this?

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:55.541
Tigrerra?

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:57.977
Drago, may I speak with you?

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.045
Yes of course.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.815
I have the utmost respect for your skills Drago

00:13:02.848 --> 00:13:04.783
but I have always wondered what it would be like

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:06.986
to face you in a real battle.

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:08.988
That's why I've come here today because I'd really

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:11.223
like to find out if you'll let me.

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:12.858
-What? -Please...

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.593
Before you battle Skyress,

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:17.029
would you do me the honor of battling with me first...

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:19.698
I'd greatly appreciate it!

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.867
DAN: Come on, go for it Drago!

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:22.868
Daniel?

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:25.571
Tigrerra really wants too!

00:13:25.604 --> 00:13:27.773
And I'm okay with it...

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:29.708
Shun?

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:32.044
Think about it, it makes a lot of sense.

00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:34.046
If I win against Dan,

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:36.415
then Runo won't have a chance to battle him.

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:37.783
Go ahead, Tigrerra.

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:38.784
Be our guest.

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.653
Thank you Skyress... I will.

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:42.488
That's very generous of you.

00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:43.522
Humph!

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:46.926
I'm the one who's got to pass the test here.

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.260
Okay, Tigrerra.

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.062
Let's brawl!

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:55.201
Field Open!

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:56.835
I'll throw this in!

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:02.908
So how do you want to do this Dan?

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:04.343
We'll battle one on one!

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:05.477
That okay?

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.545
That's cool!

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:08.380
Luck might decide who wins this!

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:10.616
So let's not have any ill will towards each other

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:12.084
no matter what happens.

00:14:12.117 --> 00:14:13.319
Agreed.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:14.587
Dan, listen!

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.655
This isn't just a battle between us...

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:19.792
It's a battle between both our Bakugan!

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:21.260
Yeah I know that Runo!

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:22.394
So...

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:25.097
Are you ready for your toughest battle ever?

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.165
Oh you bet I am!

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.634
And I'm gonna make you eat those words!

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:30.769
Gate Card Set!

00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:34.139
Ready when you are Runo!

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:36.508
Let do it Tigrerra!

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.644
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:40.279
Tigrerra Stand!

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.216
You can call me Blade Tigrerra!

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.218
Ability Card Activate!

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.686
Lightening Shield!

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:55.394
Tigrerra has evolved!

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:57.429
-Are you ready! -Ready.

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.664
Let's do it!

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.034
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:04.503
Drago Stand!

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:11.644
Ability Card Activate!

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:13.746
Dragonic Enforcement!

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:18.917
Finally we meet in battle Drago!

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.753
But this is no way to begin!

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:22.187
We'll have to start again!

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:25.357
Very well, I don't want to lose this opportunity!

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:30.296
Drago and Tigrerra both appeared

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:31.864
on each other's area of field

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:33.966
so they couldn't start the battle!

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:36.769
No Skyress they were placed there deliberately!

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:39.505
Runo guessed that Dan's gate card is a Pyrus Normal card

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.940
and so she activated an ability card that cancels out

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:45.411
all the judge points of any non-Haos attributed Bakugan.

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:46.979
Dan's next move will probably

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:49.381
up Drago's power level by 50 G's

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:51.050
using a defensive ability card

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:52.918
that only works for Dragonoid.

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:54.687
Let's try again Tigrerra!

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.655
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:58.357
Tigrerra stand!

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:05.030
Drago! Go get 'em!

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:07.266
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:09.034
Drago Stand!

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.372
BAKUPOD: Bakugan recognized!

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:14.740
Battle!

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:23.882
[groaning]

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:30.656
[screaming]

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:31.857
I've got you!

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.726
No!

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.096
Gate card... Open!

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:39.965
BAKUPOD: Tigrerra power level increase to 550 G's!

00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:41.767
Now Tigrerra has the advantage!

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:50.409
[roaring]

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.347
Drago!

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.116
Ability Card Activate!

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:59.218
Velocity Fang!

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:07.693
That did some damage!

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:10.629
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid's power level decreased by 100 G's

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.931
50 G's taken from its ability card!

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.234
Power level now at 350 G's!

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:18.871
I have you now Drago!

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:20.139
Hold on!

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:22.374
Ability Card Activate!

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:24.209
D-Strike Attack!

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:28.347
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid increase of 200 G's!

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:38.290
[screaming]

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:41.060
Their power levels are the same!

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:43.162
They're both equally matched now!

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:45.264
Yes but for how long?

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:47.065
Not bad Tigrerra...

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:49.535
I just hope you're ready for what's next!

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:51.437
Fusion Ability Card!

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.705
D-Strike Dragonoid!

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.107
Activate!

00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:02.014
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid increase to 750 G's!

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:08.120
[scream]

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:14.993
You defeated me Drago...

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.562
Yes this time maybe...

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.664
But next time who knows what will happen.

00:18:18.697 --> 00:18:20.099
I heard you say it yourself...

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.701
Sometimes it's luck that decides the winner!

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:24.636
I don't think luck had anything to do with it.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.072
You beat me because you're the better warrior.

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:28.774
It was an honor doing battle with you!

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:30.776
I'll never forget this experience.

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:32.144
Thank you Drago.

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.412
Stop it Tigrerra.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:35.147
You're embarrassing me.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.181
Hey...

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:37.683
Runo that was a good battle.

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:41.820
But... I knew all along

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:43.655
you didn't have a chance of beating me.

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:45.557
Well thanks for nothing!

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.627
Oh thanks for waiting, guys.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.296
Well I, for one, knew we would find you.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.297
Aw!

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:53.999
Marucho it's all your fault!

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:56.702
You're the one who wanted to stop and make snow angels.

00:18:56.735 --> 00:18:58.504
Thanks for waiting. Shun...

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.205
I guess I battle you next!

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:02.941
Yeah.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.510
That I gotta see!

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:08.814
Ha!

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:10.649
Surely you have something better in store for me...

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:12.784
Let's have a real battle!

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:13.919
As you wish...

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:16.221
Perhaps it's time that you see how a Darkus soldier

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:17.823
really battles.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.263
Bakugan... BRAWL!

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.399
Exedra stand!

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:37.176
BAKUPOD: Exedra recognized.

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:39.745
Let me guess that's your actual form?

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:40.812
Yes.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.614
This is who I really am!

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:45.551
Exedra, the Legendary Darkus Soldier!

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:47.619
Legendary Darkus Soldier or not,

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:50.155
you do realize that whoever dares to face me in battle

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:51.890
is as good as defeated!

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:54.026
Gate card... Open!

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.494
BAKUPOD: Character gate card engaged.

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.963
Mantris power levels doubled to 780 G's!

00:19:57.996 --> 00:20:00.299
Exedra your time has come and passed.

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:04.236
We'll see about that!

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:06.104
Ability card activate...

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:07.739
Demon Wizard!

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:13.345
Wormquake, give me your strength

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:16.515
so that I can prove who the true warrior is here!

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:22.054
BAKUPOD: Transfer of 400 G's to Exedra recognized.

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:23.155
Now...

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:25.357
Demon Wizard is going to destroy your gate card!

00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:34.700
BAKUPOD: Mantris power level decreased to 390 G's!

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:38.737
Now you'll see what true battling strength is!

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:43.108
Behold the power of Darkus!

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:50.482
[chuckles] That doesn't scare me!

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:52.484
Gate card... Set!

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:57.155
Bakugan brawl!

00:20:57.189 --> 00:20:59.324
Dual Hydranoid stand!

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.665
This battle isn't over yet!

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:08.433
Now we'll see who has the real power!

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:12.838
DAN: Coming up on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers...

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:15.140
My test continues battling Shun.

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:16.642
Drago's up for it

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:18.610
but we'll see how well he does against Skyress.

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:19.978
And even though Shun's my friend,

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:22.080
I don't plan on losing to him 'cause that means

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:24.149
Masquerade will get one step closer

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:25.751
to realizing his evil plan.

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:27.719
This battle is gonna be fierce!

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.521
And only the best Brawler can win it

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.256
so that gives me the edge.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.793
Don't miss the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:35.827
Battle!
