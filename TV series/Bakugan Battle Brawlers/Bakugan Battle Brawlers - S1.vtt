DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923

Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805

Are you still sleeping, Alice?

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.574
It's time to get up.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.177
Just another five minutes.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:53.913

Yeah, I had the best sleep...

Okay, let's see...

This stuff looks pretty easy to find, Uncle Ben.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.926
Just shopping and straight home, Alice.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.863
Would you two please stop worrying about me?

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:10.897
I'll be back...

You think she'll be alright, Ben?

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.241
She'll be fine, dear.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.609
Why just think of how much better she looks

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.711
since she first showed up at our house.

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:33.720
Remember how shocked we were?

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.355
Here was our only niece, all alone,

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.991

AUNT CLARA: But what bothers me most hon, is...

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.097
why won't she tell us what happened?

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.632
Why all the mystery?

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.400
BEN: And what's even stranger,

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.502
is what's happened to her Grandfather?

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:52.205
It's not like him to just disappear...

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.307
I just wish Michael would give us a call

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.975
and straighten this all out...

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.452
ALICE: I can't believe how peaceful it is out here...

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:10.590
If only it could stay like this forever...

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.592

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.360
never...

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:17.130
You ready to play Bakugan?

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:18.831
Here's my Pyrus Saurus...

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.667
and when I use my Fire Wall Ability,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.602
he's pretty much unbeatable!

Thanks for everything you guys, but...

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:47.093
but I...

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.995
could never hang out with you anymore.

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:04.611
for what I've done!

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:05.912
Ever!

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:07.313
And I guess I don't blame them...

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.022
I wish I...

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.558

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:32.672
And who's castle is that?

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.375

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.543

Don't you think so, Sirenoid?

Yes, Master Klaus. A beautiful day indeed.

Someone approaches...

It's been awhile, Klaus... hasn't it?

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.955
And you are?

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.492

KLAUS: Interesting.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.129
So you were Masquerade all along...

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.298
ALICE: I'm sorry for getting you involved

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:34.667
in my crazy world.

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.369
It wasn't fair to you.

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:37.670
And...

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:40.740
it's much too late for an apology, isn't it?

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:42.175
When you...

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.011
or should I say Masquerade defeated me,

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:46.446
I was ready to give up.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.081
You took my Sirenoid.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.449
And I realized without it,

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:52.452
I never wanted to play Bakugan ever again...

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:55.254
But then my precious Sirenoid returned

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:57.990
from the Doom Dimension.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.625
It was a miracle!

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.794
My life has become simple...

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.930
Now I all I yearn for

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:06.099
is surrounding myself with tranquility.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.236
It's starting...

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:12.705
What Sirenoid?

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:13.706
Our worlds...

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.142
They are beginning to vibrate!

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:18.044

early this morning in the Pacific Ocean...

With each passing minute, it appears to grow larger

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:33.559
in diameter and so far, there has been no official

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:37.130
explanation from the scientific community!

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:38.197
Is that...?

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.233
It is the portal to Vestroia...

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:41.868
That would mean...

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.570
That our World and Vestroia are connecting!

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:47.106
And soon, if they aren't stopped,

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.342
they will unite as one!

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.178
Our greatest fear!

[Alice screaming]

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.588
A-Alice?

No, it's all my fault!

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:05.925
It's all my fault!

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.828
It's because of all of the horrible things I did!

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:10.963
That Masquerade did!

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:13.166
Everything that's happening to the world right now

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.802
is all because of what I did to everyone!

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:19.839
I stole their Bakugan and now everyone has to suffer!

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:22.809
I want nothing to do with Bakugan ever again!

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.777
Alice! You can't be serious?

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:30.449
What do you mean, Klaus?

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:31.951
I think you're just...

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.319
over-reacting...

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:35.488
And to prove it...

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.924
I challenge you to a battle!

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.126
Huh? Serious?

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:53.706
As you can see, this is my extensive Bakugan collection.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:57.043
After you defeated me, I began collecting in hopes

00:07:57.076 --> 00:08:00.179
of one day getting my revenge against you...

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.882
That day has come and then you can retire

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.717

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.153
But, I can't, I-I won't!

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.423
I hope you don't mind that I've taken the liberty

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:12.658
of choosing your Bakugan.

Aren't they the most extraordinary treasures?

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:27.006

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.107
You will!

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.576
After what you did to me and others, Masquerade...

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.779
you don't have the right to refuse me!

Now it's my turn!

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.532

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:39.979
Gate Card... Open!

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:42.448
Peace Maker!

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:46.218
Interesting move...

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.921
Your Gate Card Peace Maker move

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.923
sent my Bakugan back to me.

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:51.991
So what?

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:53.693
Does this mean your surrendering already?

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:55.061
Hmmmm?

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:58.164
Well, what's your story?

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:00.066
I...

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:01.767
I don't want to do this...

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.135
no...

00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:06.539
[screams]

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:08.941
Well, well, well...

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:10.576
I guess...

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:13.312
I'll have to teach you how to battle again...

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:14.880
And this time...

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:18.651
you're going to lose, Masquerade!

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:21.520
More Bakugan Battle Brawlers after these messages!

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:26.592
Now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers...

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:29.261
Gate Card Open...

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:35.334
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:38.004
Ventus Bee Striker Stand!

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:41.674
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:44.043
Pyrus Seige Stand!

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:48.647
BAKUPOD: Pyrus Seige ahead by 30 G's.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:52.551
I thought Klaus' strength was his Aquos Attributes...

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:56.489
But for some reason he's just using Haos and Pyrus!

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:58.157
I can't figure it out...

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:02.361
Oh my gosh!

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.063
Gate Card Open!

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:05.798
Gate Card Close!

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.641
When a player calls out Gate Card Close,

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.544
all Bakugan leave the battlefield

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:20.012
and the battle immediately ceases.

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:21.947
But why is she stalling?

00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:24.083
Humans are so confusing...

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:26.619
Either you're in or out, Alice,

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:28.087
what's it going to be?

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.022
Well then?

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:32.191
There's no where to hide, now either you battle

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:34.193
or you forfeit! Understand?

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:35.728
Then count me in!

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:39.432
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.967
Sub Terra Mantris Stand!

00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:46.272
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:48.307
Pyrus Seige Stand!

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.909
BAKUPOD: New Battle detected.

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:51.410
Ability Activate!

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:54.814
Correlation between Pyrus and Sub Terra!

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:58.017
BAKUPOD: Power increase of 100 G's.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.586
Where did you get so much power from?

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.354
Hey... if you were good,

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.290
you'd realize you just need the right combination!

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.560
Gate Card...

00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:08.761
Open!

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:10.329
Androstasis!

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.674
Not again?

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:24.143
Instead of using cheap moves like your Androstasis,

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.545
why don't you just throw in the towel?

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.582
She is starting to drive me around the bend!

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:32.051
Time to teach her a lesson!

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:35.121
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:37.823
Ventus Bee Striker Stand!

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:39.758
Please Klaus, put me in!

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:40.960
I want this battle!

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:42.762
No Sirenoid... not yet!

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:43.896
I beg of you!

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:45.297
I will get your revenge.

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.233
You must have faith in me!

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:49.235
Oh, alright...

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.374
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:57.443
Sirenoid Stand!

00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:59.178
Aquos Sirenoid!

00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:02.915
Okay, now he's finally thrown down his Aquos card...

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.750
The battle begins...

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:06.786
Gate Card Open!

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:10.890
It is time to repay my master

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.925
for what you did to him, Masquerade!

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.727
Prepare to fight!

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.962
Is this all about revenge?

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:20.766
Ability Activate!

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.301
Reverse Blow!

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:26.672
Why you little brat!

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.576
You coward!

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.111
ALICE: Maybe she's right.

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:34.246
Maybe I am a coward...

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:37.516
No...

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.685
I never want to be Masquerade again!

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:40.886
I've had enough!

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.789
Are you going to battle or not, Alice?

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:49.562
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:52.131
Sub Terra Mantris Stand!

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.068
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:58.103
Pyrus Siege Stand!

00:13:58.137 --> 00:14:00.272
Let's kick it up a notch!

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:02.141
Card Card Open!

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:03.642
Quartet Battle!

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.244
Bee Striker, no!

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:13.586
BAKUPOD: Pyrus Siege maintains a 10 G lead over Bee Striker.

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:14.587
Finally!

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.121
Just don't chicken out again, alright?

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:25.731
This is weird!

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:27.967
The battlefield is shaking!

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.674
Bee Striker!

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.142
Mantris!

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:38.644
At last, a battle!

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:40.613
And I win!

00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:41.647
But alas...

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.617
Your Bakugan never put up a fight, did they?

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.218
But then again, it wouldn't matter.

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:52.391
I suppose fate is finally catching up with you!

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:54.260
That's not true!

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:01.934
Darkus Centipoid!

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:04.103
A Darkus attributed Bakugan!

00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:09.842
Centipoid Stand!

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:16.348
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:18.417
Haos El Condor Stand!

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.252
Gate Card Open Now!

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:22.688
Triple Battle Activate!

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.690
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:27.693
Pyrus Siege Stand!

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:28.961
BAKUPOD: With Pyrus Siege in play,

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:32.064
total power stands at 660 G's.

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.299
Okay boys...

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:35.000
Show our guest how to play!

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.341
ALICE: That's it.

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.176
This battle is over.

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:46.578
Even if I was strong enough to defend myself,

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:50.816
I still wouldn't feel right if I won...

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:53.652
You better do something!

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.154
If you decide to quit,

00:15:55.187 --> 00:15:59.925
then this battle is over and done with for good, Alice!

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.160
Now what?

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.535
What do I do?

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:10.869
What do I...

00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:15.007
I just can't go back to being Masquerade!

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.209
I could never live with myself if that happened!

00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:19.511
Alice...

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.814
I wish I had the answer...

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:24.383
I know if I changed into Masquerade

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:25.918
I could win this battle...

00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:28.754
But I promised myself I would never do it!

00:16:28.787 --> 00:16:31.023
Never again!

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:33.092
Ever!

00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:36.662
Now what's going on?

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:38.797
I can think of only one explanation!

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.699
The earth is trembling because Vestroia

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:43.902
and your world are on the verge of coming together!

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:49.675
No way!

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:50.676
D-Dan!

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:52.678
Okay! Are you ready?

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:54.713
Yeah!

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:57.149
They're all headed to Vestroia to save the world!

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:59.518
And I should be there with them!

00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:02.654
[screaming]

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.858
Waiitttt!

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:08.927
Everyone is trying to save the universe...

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.397
That's everyone except me...

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.998
How could I be so selfish?

00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:14.733
And what was I thinking?

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:19.505
Why? Why?

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:24.810
Noooo!

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:26.011
Ability Activate!

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:28.447
Spiced Assault!

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:32.951
How did Centipoid survive that attack?

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:35.320
BAKUPOD: Recalculating Battle scores.

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:37.022
Advantage, Centipoid.

00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:39.925
I wasn't really counting on her Spiced Assault Ability...

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.194
but to be honest, I wasn't expecting her

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:44.229
to even battle me this time around...

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:57.676
Darkus lets her take on two Bakugan...

00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:59.311
Something Masquerade would do...

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:00.612
But not...

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:03.215
something I'd expect from just a Brawler!

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:05.951
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:08.087
Centipoid Stand!

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.459
BAKUPOD: New battle detected.

00:18:13.492 --> 00:18:16.628
Sirenoid leads by 200 G's.

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:17.830
Silly child!

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:20.699
You think you can defeat me in the Aquos Realm?

00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:22.501
You watch! I will!

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:25.771
Ability Activate!

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:27.906
Grand Down!

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:31.910
That move nullifies your Gate Card, Klaus

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.246
and puts us at even strength!

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.614
I'm not done...

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:37.549
Ability Activate...

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.886
Forcing Wave!

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:44.022
SIRENOID: Your battling skills are obviously inferior to ours...

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:47.526
So I suggest you leave while you still can...

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:50.362
BAKUPOD: Sirenoid Power increase of 100 G's.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.431
But this wasn't supposed to happen...

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:59.638
Centipoid, no!

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:07.846
That was some battle...

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.414
There were times I thought for sure I was never going

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:11.350
to recover and lose.

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.951
You know...

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.120
I tried my best...

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:17.523
And even though I wasn't going to brawl against you...

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:20.492
why am I still disappointed that I lost?

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:24.496
Because you're a true Bakugan Battle Brawler, Alice!

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.932
Are you being serious?

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:28.934
Hey, I couldn't be more serious...

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:30.469
And think about it,

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:32.304
you didn't even bring your own Bakugan

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:34.473
yet you put up some fight back there.

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:36.708
I guess so...

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:38.844
And think about what this game means.

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:40.412
It's like my Bakugan.

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:43.549
Water, Wind, Fire, Earth, Light and Darkness.

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:46.185
All six attributes create one thing...

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.586
perfect harmony.

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:49.454
The way the world should be.

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:51.023
It all makes sense...

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:53.058
When you stand back and look at it...

00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:56.628
Everyone and everything has a purpose, Alice...

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:59.031
I think I understand, Klaus...

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:01.533
Now, I'm sure there's somebody out there

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:03.168
that's pretty worried about you.

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:06.772
I'm a little curious.

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:09.308
Was this battle all about teaching me a lesson?

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:10.509
That's it!

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:13.412
Bakugan represent everything about us here on earth!

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:15.581
But why was he using both Fire and Light Attributes

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:17.449
in our battle?

00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:19.585
It is time to repay my master

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:21.286
for what you did to him, Masquerade!

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.454
Thank you...

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:24.756
And good-bye, Klaus...

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:39.037
So pretty...

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.172
Yes...

00:20:40.205 --> 00:20:41.640
The world is a beautiful place

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:43.408
if you just look for it, Alice...

00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:49.181
And it's everyone's responsibility

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:50.616
to protect it.

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:52.517
You're right...

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:55.621
We all have to do our part, don't we?

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:59.157
And it's about time I start doing what I can to save it.

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:02.060
After all, I am a Battle Brawler!

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:10.102
Hey, this is Marucho and coming up on the next episode

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:11.903
of Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.640
we cross-over into Vestroia and I must say,

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:17.109
we get a big surprise!

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:18.977
The entire dimension had changed,

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.245
and not for the better!

00:21:20.278 --> 00:21:22.114
Vestroia's Attributed Dimensions had blended

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:24.016
together with other Attributes

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:27.219
creating a whole new breed of Bakugan...

00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:30.389
of the freaky variety!

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:31.757
Do something!

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.125
Or we're toast!

00:21:33.158 --> 00:21:34.660
That's all on the next exciting

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:36.395
Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
