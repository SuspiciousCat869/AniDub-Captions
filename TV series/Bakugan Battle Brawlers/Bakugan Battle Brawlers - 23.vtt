00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.374
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.775
when all these random cards

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.077
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.946
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.414
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.683
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:17.984
That's when we realized

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.653
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.721
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.224
from another world!

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.359
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.161
Runo...

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.530
Marucho...

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.800
Julie...

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.436
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.705
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.507
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.908
Bakugan!

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.078
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.381
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.451
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.453
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.621
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.656
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.791
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.893
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.027
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.129
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.336
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.872
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:13.907
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.212
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.480
\"Say It Ain't So, Joe!\"

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.255
Mommy, come here!

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.924
One of your flowers has died!

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.158
Mom-my!

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.505
What's the emergency?

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:46.673
Did one of your doll's break a nail again?

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:51.377
Honey...

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:52.846
Is everything okay?

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:55.849
Bye bye!

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.321
DAN: Well, here we are gang.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.556
Sunny Kir City.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.159
RUNO: And this is the hospital Chan told us about.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.727
Yeah, and according to her...

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.730
Webmaster Joe should be here.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.332
Do you guys really think Joe might be one of

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:14.534
Masquerade's minions?

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.003
That's what we want to find out.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.706
If he is, then he'll have to face the wrath of Preyas!

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.174
I'll give him an uppercut to the chin

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.109
and a right to the ribs!

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.345
You do that, Preyas.

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:27.213
Well, I think it's time to find out what the deal is

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.781
with this creep!

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.517
Yes, here he is...

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.253
He's in room 501...

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.688
That's over in the East Wing, to your left.

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:36.789
Yeah, thanks lady!

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.628
Hey, hold that elevator!

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:42.996
Aw, come on!

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:47.333
Room 501...

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.068
It's not even listed!

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.870
But... that's what she said...

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.006
Hey Drago, that lady said 501, right?

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.043
Hmm? Drago?

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.579
Why in the world would Daniel abandon me like that?

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.447
Please, wait for me!

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.190
It's no use!

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.425
I should have learned the art of mobility

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.961
when I first arrived in this realm...

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.229
PREYAS: Come on soldier, look alive!

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:17.664
Lift those knees!

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:18.798
Move it, move it, move it!

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:19.866
One, two, one, two, one two!

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.801
Count it out!

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:22.869
I can't hear you, boy!

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.203
[Drago screams]

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:25.738
That's gotta hurt...

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.807
C'mon soldier, get your butt back up here!

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.375
Double time!

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.710
You numbskull!

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:31.744
Come down here and help me!

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.215
Whoa!

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.720
Where is that Drago hiding?

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.422
PREYAS: I say we forget the little waxer

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.490
and continue our quest in finding Joe!

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.826
Maybe we're in the wrong wing of the hospital.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.628
Let's try the West Wing.

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.229
No Alice...

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:51.531
The receptionist said the East Wing.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.032
It's here.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.767
What if Dan led us to the wrong one?

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.235
Ooooh, you're right!

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.236
He's such an idiot!

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.805
I suggest...

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:00.340
We find Joe on our own...

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.374
[bell dings]

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:05.011
Bingo!

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:07.046
C'mon guys, it's down this way.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:10.783
Looks like this is it.

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:13.553
WOMAN'S VOICE: Come in!

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.324
Yes... can...

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.392
Yeah ah...

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:20.960
is...

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:22.261
is this Joe's room?

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:23.863
Are you friends of Joe?

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.165
Yeah, well, kinda...

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.267
Joe's out for a few minutes

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.735
with his doctor...

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.904
Oh, I see...

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.439
We'll come back later.

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:35.308
No, please stay...

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.743
He'll be back any minute now...

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.778
Make yourselves at home!

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.681
Anyone up for some fresh cookies?

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:44.183
I made them this morning.

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.685
Oh wow, I'd love some!

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.153
I haven't eaten all day!

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.255
Ah... no thanks, I'm fine.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.257
Oh please, don't be so shy...

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.694
Well, okay...

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:57.263
Yum, homemade chunky chocolate chip

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:58.798
and peanut butter!

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.566
And there's some kinda yummy nuts!

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.102
I believe those are macadamians.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.304
I hope they're calorie free 'cause they're delish!

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:07.140
I don't think so...

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.341
I think I'll try one of these!

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:09.709
They're so tiny!

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.110
Julie, please, your manners!

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:14.814
Wow, yummy!

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:15.982
It's like so heavenly!

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:19.652
It's so nice to see Joe has such

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:22.522
wonderful friends.

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:25.358
Joe should be getting out of the hospital any day now,

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.926
and all he does is stare out the window

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.461
and wish he were at back at home!

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.663
So, what's Joe's prognosis?

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:33.099
Oh... he's fine.

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:35.168
He's in here for some tests...

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:37.904
His doctor says he just needs a little rest...

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:40.907
I must say, my Joe is one tough little trooper...

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:46.112
Ah snap, I'm tired of this!

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:47.146
Where'd ya go, Drago?

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.850
Is this...

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:51.884
what you're looking for?

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:55.288
-Drago! -Daniel!

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:56.422
I can't believe it!

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.924
Where'd ya find him?

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.359
Hey, what's the big idea, Drago?

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:01.194
Never take off on me again!

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:02.895
Excuse me, mister,

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:04.864
but you're the one who dropped me!

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.966
Ignore him, he's a little cranky.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.402
I appreciate you findin' him.

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:11.404
But how'd ya know I was lookin' for him?

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:12.405
'Cause you were looking for me...

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:13.573
right Dan?

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.710
Then... you... must be Joe...

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:20.279
[laughing]

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:22.548
That's... me.

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:24.684
Ah, man, I got so many questions for you!

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:27.687
You wanna come up to the roof, Dan?

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.863
Ahhh, isn't this great?

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.731
I just love it up here!

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.433
And the view is awesome!

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.068
I'm not big into heights ...

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.737
Hate to change the subject, but let's...

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:46.272
I gotta know if you're in cahoots with that creep...

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:47.573
[chuckles]

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.976
I remember...

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.311
the day I found my Bakugan.

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:53.780
It was a day almost exactly like today.

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:58.951
It was right in the middle of summer...

00:06:58.985 --> 00:06:59.952
I was here for tests and sitting on that bench

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:01.187
over there...

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.162
I searched the web to find out what it was.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.263
That's when I saw kids blogging

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:11.931
about their battles.

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:14.600
Then, I created my homepage

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:16.102
so everyone would have a place to log on

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:18.771
and chat about their Bakugan brawls.

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:23.609
It's funny but, you were one of the first to log on.

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:25.511
Shun was next to visit my site, then Runo,

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:27.480
Marucho and Julie showed up...

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:29.415
You and Shun starting thinking up the rules...

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:31.284
You two were on fire

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:33.553
coming up with all regulations!

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:36.055
It was so simple, and completely brilliant to watch!

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:38.291
I didn't come all the way here to chit chat!

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:39.592
All I wanna know is if you're working

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.894
for Masquerade or not!

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:45.131
You think I'm somehow connected with Masquerade?

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:47.967
All I'm saying is, Masquerade seems to know

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.469
everything that the Brawlers are doing.

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:53.005
And because all of us only chat on your website,

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.007
it's the only way I figure he could get

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.709
that kinda information!

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:59.011
There's a snitch and we wanna find out who!

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:01.948
And I hate to be the one pointing a finger, but...

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.216
It looks like it's you, Joe...

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.250
are you the snitch?

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.454
Hey, better 'fess up now before I get mad!

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:12.091
Now I'm mad!

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:14.193
[chuckles]

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:16.462
[growls]

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.231
I could simply answer your question...

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.433
But that would be too easy.

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:21.934
Instead, I think I have a better idea.

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:23.002
How about...

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:24.670
We make it...

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:27.073
a little more interesting, Dan?

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:31.177
Are you sayin', you wanna brawl?

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:37.884
[\u266a]

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:45.458
[\u266a]

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:50.296
Stick around, there's more Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:51.330
right after these messages!

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.002
And now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.938
You wanna brawl, huh?

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.339
Well...

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.440
Yeah, let's do it!

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:02.608
You're on!

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:03.910
Field Open!

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.892
Oh wow...

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:21.761
this is so amazing!

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:22.762
Are you sayin' this is the first time

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.130
you've ever played Bakugan?

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.767
Hey!

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.101
Ya wanna battle or not?

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:30.870
It's better than I imagined!

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.071
It's like I'm inside a dream!

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:34.040
Huh?

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.374
This is really your first time then...

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.742
I'll start...

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:38.411
Gate Cart Set!

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:39.645
Huh?

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:40.713
Gate Card Set!

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.785
I don't care if this is your first time, Joe,

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:47.019
I'm gonna play to--

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:48.721
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:52.224
Haos Siege... Stand!

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:03.069
BAKUPOD: Haos Siege enters battle at 280 Gs.

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:04.737
Now my turn!

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.905
Here goes!

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:07.707
That's so cool!

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.476
I never imagined my Seige would be so big!

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:13.045
Why me?

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:15.047
I hate rookies!

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.883
Don't let his inexperience blind you, Daniel.

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:20.386
This is... amazing!

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:22.588
This kid is...

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.824
Totally messin' up my Bakugan rhythm...

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:26.792
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:28.127
Tuskor Stand!

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.300
Pyrus Tuskor!

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:36.202
BAKUPOD: Tuskor enters battle.

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:38.270
Ability Card Activate!

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.773
JOE: Nose Slap, right?

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:42.174
Nose Slap is an ability especially suited

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:43.843
for your Tuskor.

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:46.512
It allows a player to attack an adjacent zone.

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.514
You're going to throw it, right, Dan?

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.116
Well... yeah...

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.917
Haos Siege!

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.120
You better watch out for his Tuskor's trunk!

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.522
This dude is totally wearing on me...

00:10:58.257 --> 00:10:59.258
Nose Slap!

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:09.435
That's it, Tuskor!

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:10.469
You keep on him!

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:15.608
So this is a brawl!

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:17.276
The colors, the sound!

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:18.310
Intense!

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.453
Looks like I won that one, Joe!

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:29.188
But that was only round one, Dan!

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:32.224
Now things start to get interesting!

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:34.960
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:37.797
Robotallian Stand!

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.598
Ability Card Activate!

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.100
Robotallian Enforcement!

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:48.207
BAKUPOD: Robotallian Power Level at 390 Gs.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.775
JOE: Thanks for the update, Baku-Pod!

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.477
I like what you're puttin' down,

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.978
but watch and learn!

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:55.047
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:58.150
Griffon Stand!

00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:01.954
[loud roar]

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:06.625
BAKUPOD: Griffon enters battle at 350 Gs.

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:08.527
JOE: You purposely threw down a lower power level Bakugan

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.862
and now you're going to use

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:10.896
your Wing Burst Ability!

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:14.567
Wing Burst Ability increases your Bakugan

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.602
by 50 Gs...

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.938
while at the same time, decreases your opponent's...

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:21.006
by the exact same amount as your increase.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.908
Right again, Einstein!

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:24.543
But just how are you gonna counter it?

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:27.313
Ability Card Activate!

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:28.414
Wing Burst!

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:31.484
BAKUPOD: Wing Burst Activated.

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:38.557
Get 'em, Griffon!

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:41.327
It's my turn again...

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.895
Gate Card Open!

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:46.565
BAKUPOD: Robotallian Power increase.

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:58.210
Yes, I did it!

00:12:58.244 --> 00:13:00.546
I won my first battle!

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:02.381
Hey, Joe, when you're done celebrating,

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:03.782
can we get on with it?

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:05.951
Alright, here we go... Dan!

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:10.055
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:11.490
Robotallian Stand!

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:16.762
Okay...

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:18.097
Time to kick it into high gear...

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.199
Okay Drago, finish this!

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:21.700
I shall!

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:25.638
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:26.972
Drago Stand!

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:35.514
I-I can't believe it!

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:36.982
Is that the evolved version of the Pyrus Dragonoid

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:38.484
in the flesh?

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:39.752
Oh yeah!

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:41.554
This is so cool!

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:43.656
I've read about you Drago,

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:45.925
but I never thought I'd ever see you for real!

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.726
You ain't seen nothing yet, pal!

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.196
Okay Drago, time to show 'em what you got!

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:54.066
[growling]

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:55.234
Gate Card Open!

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:56.302
Level Down!

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:00.739
BAKUPOD: Drago Power Decrease detected.

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.808
What do you think, Dan?

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:05.211
My ability drops your Bakugan by 100 Gs...

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:06.845
Not bad for a rookie, huh?

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.214
Nice try, Joe!

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:09.882
Ability Card Activate!

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:11.083
Fire Tornado!

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.689
My ability lets me increase my power level

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:19.058
by 100 Gs

00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:21.327
and drops my opponent's by the same amount!

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.597
BAKUPOD: Fire Tornado detected.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.098
DRAGO: Now for the coup de gras!

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:35.040
Drago won was because he's evolved

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:36.108
to a higher power level, right?

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.413
Hey, you're smarter than you look!

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:43.749
Now listen up!

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:45.884
You lose the next battle and you have to spill it

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:48.320
about you and Masquerade, got it?

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:49.955
Yeah sure, but first you gotta win!

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:51.190
Bakugan...

00:14:51.223 --> 00:15:02.067
[\u266a]

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:10.075
[\u266a]

00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:11.443
Hang in there, Joe!

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:12.478
You're gonna be just fine!

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.048
You'll have to wait here!

00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:23.022
RUNO: Dan!

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.323
What's the deal?

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:30.095
How bad is it?

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:31.930
MARUCHO: Just a fainting spell.

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:34.566
Low blood sugar is what the doctor said.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.135
ALICE: His mother said he wasn't supposed to

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:38.504
do anything that might be too strenuous...

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:39.972
RUNO: You were there, Dan.

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:42.441
What exactly happened to him when he collapsed?

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:43.876
We were right in the middle of a battle

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:45.210
and the next thing I know he's down!

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.150
Ah man...

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:56.855
This is all my fault.

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:58.757
If I knew the guy was gonna keel over,

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.192
I never would have battled him!

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:01.927
I just hope he's...

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.962
okay...

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:05.531
Hey, this isn't your fault!

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:06.665
Don't blame yourself, Dan...

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.903
Guys, come here and check this out...

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.174
Joe here...

00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:17.176
and if you ever meet a player named Masquerade...

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:19.078
and he challenges you to a brawl,

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:21.380
please, just say no!

00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:22.548
All he wants to do is send your Bakugan

00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:24.350
to the Doom Dimension!

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:26.618
What is that?

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:29.288
It's a video I downloaded from Joe's site that he sent

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.090
to all the top players around the world.

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:33.158
As a warning!

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:36.428
Yes, then that must mean Joe isn't...

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:38.864
Isn't working together with Masquerade after all!

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:40.566
Joe is on our side!

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:42.134
Sheesh!

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.369
That's what I've been saying all along!

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.342
How is he?

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:52.111
They should know better in the morning...

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:54.079
I wanna know right now!

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:55.247
I'm gonna ask the doctors mys...

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.949
You're not going anywhere, mister!

00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:58.550
You're gonna wait right here like everyone else!

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.152
I can't wait!

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:02.454
I gotta know right now!

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:07.860
Man, I wish there was something I could do for Joe...

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:09.995
All this waiting is driving me nuts!

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:18.670
THINKING: I must say...

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.172
my Joe is one tough little trooper.

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.322
Hey mom... morning...

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:39.358
How's it going?

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.293
Joe, you're all better!

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:45.330
It's nice to see you up and around, Joe.

00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:47.966
We were worried about you.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.401
Ah, it's really no big deal...

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:51.970
I'm ready to brawl again!

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:55.874
I want to feel the way I felt when I battled you, Dan...

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.843
You see, way out here in Kir City we don't have

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:59.778
any top ranked players.

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.346
But then you came to see me,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.782
it was like the greatest feeling ever...

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.384
Hey, if you wanted to battle me,

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.753
you shoulda said so in the first place...

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:08.954
You sure didn't have to pretend you were working

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:10.556
for Masquerade...

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.658
Sorry about that.

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.393
Actually I should...

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.195
be the one apologizing

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:18.163
for even thinking something like that.

00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:19.898
Oh yeah, I found the Infinity Core!

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:24.102
Yeah, I saw it in one of my dreams...

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:30.542
Where am I?

00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:35.080
What are you?

00:18:35.113 --> 00:18:36.381
Some kind of...

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:37.382
Bakugan?

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:38.851
Yes...

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:40.119
My name is Wavern...

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:42.688
Wavern?

00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:45.757
You must never give the Infinity Core to Naga.

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.793
Huh?

00:18:47.826 --> 00:18:49.695
The Infinity Core and the Silent Core

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:51.563
are the two entities

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:54.600
that preserve the balance of Vestroia.

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:57.569
The Silent Core has taken over Naga

00:18:57.603 --> 00:18:59.605
and in order to restore balance,

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.407
the Infinity Core has taken over me.

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:04.243
So that means the Infinity Core is...

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:06.812
is within me...

00:19:06.845 --> 00:19:08.247
Remember!

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.983
Never give the Infinity Core to Naga!

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:12.985
Wavern! Wait!

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.423
Whoa, some story...

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:20.993
Wavern is Naga's twin sister.

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:23.729
Hmm, interesting, but not surprising...

00:19:23.762 --> 00:19:25.898
So, where did this Wavern disappear to, Joe?

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:27.866
Sorry, but she just vanished...

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.401
Ah man...

00:19:29.434 --> 00:19:31.169
SHUN: Interesting.

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:32.471
This means we don't have to look for

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:33.705
the Infinity Core anymore.

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:37.709
As long as the Infinity Core stays hidden

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:39.778
inside Wavern...

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:42.414
it's another level of protection against Naga.

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:44.049
And that means there's one thing all of us

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:45.717
have to do...

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:47.152
Our Bakugan have to evolve

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.555
into their Ultimate form before Hydranoid!

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:51.790
To protect us from Naga nabbing the Infinity Core.

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:57.629
Boy, I sure wish I could go with you guys...

00:19:57.663 --> 00:20:00.399
But I'm stuck in here for the next couple of days...

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:02.167
Don't sweat it!

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.169
From here on out you're a part of the Brawlers!

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.571
I showed everyone the cool video warning

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:08.240
you posted on your website!

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:10.275
And you're forgetting we really need you to help us

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.978
track down Wavern and the Infinity Core.

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:15.881
I told you you were part of the team, Joe!

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:16.949
It's means you're a Brawler...

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:18.216
forever!

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:24.323
I don't know what to say...

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:26.892
But thanks...

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:27.893
Welcome aboard, Joe!

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:28.927
Yeah...

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:33.699
[chuckles]

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:35.133
DAN THINKING: You just wait Masquerade,

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:36.702
we're gunning for you.

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:37.936
And when we find you, you're going down!

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.243
That is good news, Doctor.

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:45.877
Joe's good to go!

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.846
Perfect health...

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:50.082
In fact, he passed all his tests with flying colors!

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:51.283
Oh Joe!

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:52.517
Ah mom, please...

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.122
JOE: Now to get on with my new job...

00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:58.523
finding Wavern!

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:11.870
Alice here, and on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:13.505
it's time for a little stretching

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:15.340
and maybe a casual stroll through town.

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:17.275
Wait! Who's that?

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:19.978
It's Christopher who hates to Bakugan Battle!

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:21.446
You see, his friends used to force him to play

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.415
and he'd always lose.

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:25.751
That left him totally bummed about Bakugan.

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:27.886
I mean, who would want to lose all the time?!

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.788
But I've got a plan!

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.423
What if I played him and let him win!?

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:33.659
But who's playing who here!?

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:35.327
You'll have to check it out to see!

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.195
On the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers! See you there!
