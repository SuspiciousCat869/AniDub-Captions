WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.440
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.111
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.012
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.716
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.017
That's when we realized

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.687
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.755
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.224
from another world!

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.426
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.194
Runo...

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.530
Marucho...

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.469
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.738
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.540
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.941
Bakugan!

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.415
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.484
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.486
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.654
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.689
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.791
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.926
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.094
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.129
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.300
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.939
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:13.973
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.745
Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.858
So, ya chicken?

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.227
Ahhh- another lackey of Masquerade's?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.329
Yeah, this is starting to get old...

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.132
But just for fun, let me show him who's boss!

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.934
No way, I call dibs on this creep!

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.569
Hey, no fair!

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.671
Dan, wait!

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:47.040
Field Open!

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.183
Come on, Drago... Defense!

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.156
Must... resist...

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.390
Drago!

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:05.558
Hold on!

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.130
No fair!

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:12.165
You're butting in, Dan!

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.236
You just got lucky, that's all!

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.438
I'll be back, ya freaks!

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.039
So I'm guessing you beat him?

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.041
Way to go, Dan!

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.943
I had total confidence you could do it!

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.912
Ah, it was nothin'...

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.180
I had him on the ropes...

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.818
Dan, no!

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.219
Are you okay?

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.220
Can you hear me?

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.255
Wake up, Dan!

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:41.761
Man, that was way up there on the freaky scale...

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.164
I remember I beat the dude, but after that,

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.665
it's a total blank...

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.734
Oh that was so hilarious, Dan!

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.102
The way that wanna-be Brawler ran with his tail

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:50.803
between his legs!

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.605
Well, it is kinda your own fault,

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.607
Mr... Butt-Inski!

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.343
I knew this would turn into a snoozefest!

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:58.978
I'm just lucky that Drago was tough enough to take

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.780
that chump out when he did!

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.715
According to my data,

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.517
we will face much stronger opponents...

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.185
I might suggest our strategy should reflect this

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.887
in any future battles...

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.556
In English...

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.791
Meaning a Bakugan is at his peak

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.326
when all of its six attributes

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.194
are in perfect alignment...

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:18.197
Dan's Bakugan is Drago and it's a Pyrus...

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.499
a Fire Attribute...

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.067
Yours is a Haos...

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.635
a light Attribute...

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.604
And my Preyas is classified as an Aquos...

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.406
That's Water.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.941
But the problem is, combined,

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.142
we don't have enough Attributes to fight

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:30.610
at full power...

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.545
Add on Julie's which is Subterra,

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.113
the Earth Attribute...

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.115
That means we're two short.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.617
Darkus, with it's Darkness Attribute

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.652
and the Wind, Ventus.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:40.887
Hey, guess who has Ventus!

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.455
Shun!

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.090
Correct, Dan...

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:45.959
Right now, Masquerade is stronger than us...

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:48.027
I suggest we align ourselves with Shun

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.996
to increase our power and defeat Masquerade.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.264
Brilliant!

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:52.799
With Shun on our team,

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.267
we'll be a force to be reckoned with!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.868
No one will even come close to beating us!

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.103
Not to mention Shun's a real hunk!

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.705
Right Dan?

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.540
This is the most impeccable proposal

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.075
I believe we have ever engineered!

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:03.076
What do you think, Dan?

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.777
No!

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.813
But Dan, we need all the help we can get!

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.817
Or maybe you're...

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.918
\u266a jealous...

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.553
I am not!

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.021
Besides, I don't need any help!

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.422
From him or anybody else, including you, Runo!

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:17.890
You got that?

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.826
Yep, you're jealous...

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.561
DAN: Girls! Who needs 'em!

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.865
MARUCHO: Boy, if Dan finds out what we're doing,

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.167
he is going to be sooo mad!

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:29.569
RUNO: Relax, Marucho.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.471
We have to ask Shun to help us.

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:33.272
And trust me, Dan will thank us!

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.141
MARUCHO: I hope so...

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:37.944
I wonder why Dan is so dead set against Shun?

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:40.546
I remember they used to be the best of buds.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.282
They were even the ones

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.383
who came up with all the Bakugan rules...

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:45.852
Wow!

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.654
That's almost interesting!

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:49.555
Call me crazy, but I thought for sure

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.524
Dan would want to hook up with Shun again...

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.159
Look, Runo.

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:54.193
I believe that's Shun's house down there...

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.398
According to my research, the Shun Family owns

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:01.267
the largest estate west of Bay City.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.502
RUNO: Big bucks and good looks!

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:04.804
Hello Shun!

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.806
Runo, we're here on business...

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:09.008
Besides, what if Shun decides

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:11.277
he's not interested in joining us?

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.012
Our whole mission would be a failure!

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:14.847
And worse, we could lose our Bakugan!

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:16.683
Quit being such a worry wort!

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:18.651
Now let's get this over with!

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:19.919
Hey Shun!

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:22.522
That was fast...

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.670
I wouldn't want to be the one who has to vacuum this place...

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:39.338
You think anyone's at home?

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:41.340
No clue.

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:44.010
But let's keep looking...

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:46.012
This place reminds me of your house, Marucho.

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.413
One big over-sized mansion

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:48.781
with never enough bathrooms...

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.283
[rattling]

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:51.718
What'd I do?

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:59.592
Let's get outta here!

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.968
[screaming]

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.911
This house is one big booby trap!

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:20.446
You can say that again!

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.115
[voice laughing]

00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:24.484
Well, well, what have we here?

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:26.686
A couple of snoopy little kids who have the gall

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.255
to break into my house!

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:31.290
If you two little whipper-snappers think

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:33.292
you're smarter than me...

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.862
Then you have got another think coming!

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.798
Ya got any clue on the old dude in the sweat pants?

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:40.500
That's Shun's grandfather

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.201
who used to be a famous Ninja Warrior

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.103
back when there used to be Ninja Warriors.

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.772
You're kiddin'?

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:47.540
State your business here!

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.976
Or prepare to face my...

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.445
Wooden stick!

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.780
Please, put down the stick!

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.848
We come in peace!

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:57.950
Yeah, we're friends of your grandson Shun...

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.018
W-We just want to see him...

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:00.353
My grandson?

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:01.988
You say you're friends?

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.524
My name is Runo and this is Marucho...

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.192
Hey, what are you doing?

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:07.226
Trying to give me a wedgie or something?

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.930
See?

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:12.265
Show this to Shun and he'll explain everything to you.

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:14.033
No!

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.301
Please! What did I do to you?

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:22.375
Oh yes...

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:24.343
You're what they call Bakugan Brawlers...

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.245
I know all about you...

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.613
And you're here to get Shun

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:30.016
to play this silly game again?

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.617
Well yeah, that's kinda what we were thinking...

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:32.618
That's what I thought!

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.253
He's not interested!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.222
Now leave the premises at once, intruders!

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:37.790
Please, please, please!

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:38.891
Can we just see him for five minutes?

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.526
Please?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.195
You're starting to get on my nerves, kid!

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.863
Now beat it!

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.531
This isn't working.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.600
But I've got an idea...

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:51.204
Okay grandpa, if you refuse to bring Shun to us,

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.738
we'll just go find him ourselves then!

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:54.540
Yeah. And just one thing.

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:56.509
You mind giving me back my Bakugan?

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.110
Sure, what do I care?

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.312
Not again!

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.749
[coughing]

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:05.451
Didn't you hear me?

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:07.253
Leave!

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.921
[screaming]

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.401
PREYAS: Where are we?

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.003
TIGRERRA: A battlefield...

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:26.672
I accidentally opened the field...

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:28.140
So, do you guys wanna battle?

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.509
Are you nuts?

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:33.212
Wait a minute, I've got an idea.

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:34.914
You stopped time when Shun's Grandpa

00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:36.849
was about to attack, right?

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:38.684
All we have to do is find the exact spot

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.253
where we were standing!

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.687
I think I catch your drift...

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:44.223
Yeah, let's do it!

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:46.492
I do believe we were standing right about here.

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.329
Okay, we'll just move over here.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.564
Are you ready?

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:52.732
You got it.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:53.766
Field... Close!

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.673
This is going to leave a mark...

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.284
Oh honey bun...

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:13.552
Did you put the cat out?

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:18.624
[laughter]

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:25.564
[\u266a]

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:26.565
Shun!

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:28.367
Hey Shun!

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.536
We found you!

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:32.605
I was beginning to get a little worried back there...

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:34.140
It is so nice to see you again!

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:37.476
Why did you come here?

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.178
We know it's short notice Shun,

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.880
but we kind of need your help.

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:42.381
I don't know if you know this,

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.150
but there's this really freaky dude

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.918
who calls himself Masquerade and he's been...

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:47.386
well, sending kids' Bakugan

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.422
to the Doom Dimension forever!

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:51.223
Yeah, and we have to stop him!

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.959
He's challenged us to a battle

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:54.660
and before we agree,

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:57.430
we need you and your Bakugan to boost our power.

00:09:57.463 --> 00:10:00.366
Without you, we all could lose our Bakugan!

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.234
So what'd ya say Shun, you in or out?

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.269
Well?

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:08.741
Well?

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:11.310
Sorry, I don't play on a team...

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:12.378
Now leave...

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.719
Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:25.458
Back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:29.962
Now what?

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.031
Shun, open up!

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.300
Didn't I tell you kids?

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:37.036
My grandson doesn't want anything to do with you two!

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:40.006
Now skedaddle, before I get all Ninja on you!

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.708
[laughter]

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.777
Oh man, this old creep's giving me the creeps!

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.245
C'mon Shun, let us in!

00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:48.114
Please Shun, open up!

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.849
If you don't, then all the Bakugan rules

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:52.451
that you and Dan created will be destroyed forever!

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.886
You just gotta let us in!

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:55.755
At least let us take you on in a battle!

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:57.490
Shun!

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:06.098
SKYRESS: Are you sure you want them to leave, Shun?

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:09.168
If they do, I don't think they'll ever come back again...

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:11.837
They came a long way just to talk to you ...

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:15.508
Yeah...

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:17.176
Oh Shun...

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:18.878
It's okay, Skyress...

00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:21.847
If you're worried about me, don't.

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:24.550
Everything will be fine...

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:28.454
You must stop running away from what's in your heart.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:30.056
After all, there will come a day when you will have

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.792
to face up to it.

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:35.461
And this just may be that time...

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:51.110
Boy, I can't believe what happened back there...

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:52.178
I know.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:53.913
First Dan blows us off...

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:57.083
And then Shun doesn't want anything to do with us.

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.485
If there's one thing I'll never figure, it's boys!

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.253
Hey Runo...

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.055
Think we should go back and try again?

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:06.826
S-Shun...

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:08.527
Did you change your mind and decide to join up with us?

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:22.341
Only if you can defeat me...

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:24.110
Sounds like a blast!

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:25.144
I'm up for it!

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.545
No, let me, Runo.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.913
I have a better chance

00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:30.015
pitting my Aquos against his Ventus.

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.851
You gotta trust me on this one.

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:34.653
I'm ready when you're ready...

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:36.856
I'll take you both on.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.624
You can't be serious?

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:40.759
Yes! Field... Open!

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:47.066
He doesn't know what he's doing...

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:48.501
he's crazy...

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:49.935
Two against one!

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:51.403
He doesn't stand a chance!

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.605
Gate Card...

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:53.706
Set!

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:57.476
MARUCHO: Okay, I'll go first!

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.245
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.114
Terrorclaw Stand!

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:09.688
Falconeer Stand!

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.932
Okay, Bakugan! Gate Card Open!

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:26.672
Ability Card Activate!

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.641
Tornado Pandemonium!

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.151
Im-Impossible!

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:44.390
This isn't over yet!

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:46.825
BAKU-POD: Saurus 290 Gs.

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.761
But that's not enough Gs!

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:50.829
And that's exactly what he's thinking!

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:53.699
All I have to do is throw down my Saurus character card

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:55.401
and double my power!

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:00.606
BAKU-POD: Falconeer... 320 Gs.

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:03.409
He didn't attack us!

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.747
We've got to be careful and come up with a plan, Marucho...

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:09.782
I got it!

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:12.985
You know, crazy as it sounds,

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:14.453
it just might work!

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:16.822
Okay Limulus, game on!

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:19.391
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:20.626
Limulus Stand!

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.898
BAKU-POD: Limulus has entered the battle.

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:27.833
No other data available.

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:29.468
We're looking good, Marucho!

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:31.103
Now time for phase two!

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:32.504
You got it!

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.907
Ability Card Activate!

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.176
Holograph Divide!

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:39.111
With this defense shield, Limulus' power

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:41.347
will increase as the battle intensifies!

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.448
That's because he'll absorb the power

00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:44.817
used against him!

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.086
And that makes our plan virtually unbeatable!

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:48.120
This is so cool!

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:50.823
Oh yeah?

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:52.424
BAKU-POD: Falconeer Two has entered battle.

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.263
Didn't see that coming!

00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:58.564
Back to the drawing board...

00:14:58.597 --> 00:14:59.598
TIGRERRA: Well...

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:00.599
looks like it's my turn.

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:01.934
What?

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:03.569
What are you saying, Tigrerra?

00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:05.671
Shun's Bakugans are on the verge of attacking.

00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:06.839
I know their moves.

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:08.374
Trust me.

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:10.376
Atta a boy, Tigrerra!

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:12.411
You get in there and show 'em who's boss!

00:15:12.444 --> 00:15:13.946
This just might work!

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:15.314
Let's do it!

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:17.616
Okay Tigrerra, we're all counting on you!

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.752
Gate card Set!

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:20.953
BAKU-POD: Introducing new player.

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:23.756
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:25.758
Tigrerra Stand!

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.496
If I need you...

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:31.897
are you there, Skyress?

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.866
SKYRESS: Yes.

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.134
This is it!

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:39.271
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:40.673
Skyress Stand!

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:57.323
What is that?

00:15:57.356 --> 00:16:00.459
The Ventus Skyress!

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:02.328
Ability Activate!

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:03.629
Winds of Fury!

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:21.580
BAKU-POD: Tigrerra Power Decrease by 100 Gs.

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:32.358
Oh no!

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:33.625
C'mon Tigrerra!

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:35.194
You can't quit now!

00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:36.395
You've gotta get back in there!

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:39.031
We can't lose!

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.266
My battle is ended...

00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:47.706
Is it over?

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.775
Completely...

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:52.578
And that includes Limulus and Saurus!

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:54.513
Shun's Winds of Fury Attack knocked us out

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.048
with one blow!

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:58.283
Unreal!

00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:00.052
He launched his Skyress last so his Falconeer's

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:01.987
could run interference!

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.756
Hey Runo, I just figured out his attack!

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.257
PREYAS: Yeah!

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.759
But hang in there Runo, it's not over

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:08.494
until the pleasantly plump lady sings!

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:09.762
Yeah!

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.063
You mean...

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.898
we still have a chance?

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:14.767
Now we know his move, we can counter it and beat him!

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.702
PREYAS: What he said...

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:17.903
We need a surprise attack.

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:19.371
We need you, Preyas!

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.540
You're our last hope!

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:23.642
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:24.843
Preyas Stand!

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:29.348
I heard there's a little soiree happening

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.349
and I thought I'd just...

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:32.451
pop in and play!

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:33.852
Shall we begin?

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.988
Now what do I do?

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:38.056
BAKU-POD: Preyas at 300 Gs.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.726
Falconeer remains stable at 320 Gs.

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:42.961
This doesn't look good...

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:45.364
Don't worry Marucho, I've got it figured out...

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:47.533
You sure you know what you're doing?

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:49.034
I have to get Tigrerra into the battle

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.136
to help Preyas.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.106
But Runo, once a Bakugan loses in a battle,

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:56.208
the rules clearly state you can't use it again!

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:58.010
Yeah, but I think I found a loophole...

00:17:58.043 --> 00:18:00.345
Just leave it to me, 'kay?

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:01.947
But here's what you can do...

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.715
You keep Shun's Skyress busy with Preyas!

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.217
Yeah, sure...

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.351
Are you ready?

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:10.122
Gate Card Open!

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:12.391
Positive Delta!

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:13.826
You've gotta be kidding!

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:15.360
Oh crud!

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:17.796
Change of Attribute!

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.231
Darkus!

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.034
Ta da!

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:23.035
What?

00:18:23.068 --> 00:18:24.136
Attribute Change?

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:26.104
No way!

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:28.974
BAKU-POD: Typhoon Power Reduction to 120 Gs.

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:30.642
But how?

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:32.744
This is soo cool, Runo.

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:34.646
Shun's Positive Delta steals power

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.116
away from Water, Light and Fire Attributes.

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:39.151
BUT, when it's attacked by Wind, Earth and Darkus,

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:41.186
it works in reverse!

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.956
In other words, my Preyas is sapping Shun's Typhoon dry!

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:45.557
Oh yeah!

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:47.860
That's because Preyas changed his attribute!

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:49.027
Way to go, Preyas!

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:50.796
That was sweet!

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:53.465
Yep, it's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it!

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:57.302
All right! Incoming!

00:18:57.336 --> 00:19:02.608
So, there is a Bakugan who change his own Attribute...

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:03.942
BAKU-POD: Skyress enters Battle.

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:09.515
Whoa!

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:10.516
Okay Griffon...

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:13.418
Bakugan Brawl!

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:15.554
Ability Card Activate!

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:17.389
Venomous Beast Torrent Attack!

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:23.562
Whoa...

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:31.069
Nice job!

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:33.238
TIGRERRA: Thank you, for giving me a second chance...

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:35.774
I didn't realize you could morph your Bakugan...

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.577
That's how you got Tigrerra into the battle again.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.679
RUNO: Let's talk about that later, Marucho.

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:42.447
We still have one more battle to win...

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.082
Bakugan Brawl!

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:46.084
Preyas Stand!

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:47.753
Ability Card Activate!

00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:49.555
Water and Wind Combine!

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:50.956
RUNO: Ability Card Activate!

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:56.461
Savage Edge!

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.497
Gate Card Open!

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:02.501
All right Skyress, let's lock and load!

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:04.236
BAKU-POD: Accessing strength.

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:07.239
Skyress Power Surge to 720 Gs.

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:09.841
Preyas Increase to 400 Gs.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.878
Tigrerra to 340 Gs.

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:16.148
And once you add that up we're at 740 Gs!

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:19.885
We are the champions! We are the champions!

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:21.053
Let's finish this!

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:26.225
Shun!

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:28.026
Don't worry Skyress, I still haven't played my ace yet!

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.861
Ability Card Activate!

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.063
Fire Storm!

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:40.372
BAKU-POD: Skyress Power Increase detected.

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.741
Combined reading at 920 Gs.

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:47.879
We're in trouble...

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:58.190
Game over...

00:20:58.223 --> 00:21:00.659
...You lose our bet...

00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:01.960
B-But...

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:02.995
Oh no...

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:10.469
Hey, this is Dan.

00:21:10.502 --> 00:21:12.104
Coming up on Bakugan.

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:14.139
I find out Masquerade is ranked number one

00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:16.375
while Shun has dropped down to 6th!

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:18.844
And Shun is one unhappy camper!

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:20.779
Then he finds out his mother is sick so,

00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:22.748
he decides to quit playing Bakugan!

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.216
But I've got a sneaky little plan

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:26.418
to get him back into the game!

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:29.054
Trust me, this one's going to be a real wild west showdown

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:31.790
and you'll have to watch to see who wins!

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.425
Hey, be there!

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:34.693
Bakugan Brawl!
