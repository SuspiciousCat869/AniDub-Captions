00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.416
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in, \"It's A Long Shot\".

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.119
[screaming]

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.692
Drago...

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.627
I wish that... he was...

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.229
still here... with...

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.363
with us...

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.971
Are you going?

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.141
I am...

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:51.077
It's my duty as a Battle Brawler to help out Dan.

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:04.224
Well...

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.825
it seems we're here...

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.260
Are you sure you're ready?

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.496
Yes... I'm ready.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.284
I beg you...

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.752
please Masquerade...

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.787
Please give me strength...

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:01.915
Hmph...

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:11.291
This pathetic human-loving Bakugan

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:13.960
is somehow supposed to save the world?

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.665
How ridiculous!

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.439
Who did that?

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:40.887
[\u266a]

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.489
Wait... isn't that...

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:45.925
I hope you liked the calling card I just sent you.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.395
Not very subtle I admit, but effective don't you think?

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.198
I am none other than Masquerade.

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.967
Masquerade...!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.303
Alpha...Hydranoid!

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.605
Pathetic.

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:01.908
You're a sorry sight compared to the last time we saw you.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.877
I guess it's up to us to help you out of this...

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.146
Then... does this mean...

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.648
that you'll...

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:14.053
Just this one time.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.056
Thank you...

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:21.527
I wish I could say that we didn't need your help...

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.429
but that is not the case.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.865
Will you please help us?

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:27.367
With pleasure.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.402
Naga's underlings I see...

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:32.205
Be prepared cause I will be your next opponent!

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:33.306
Humph!

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.708
Listen to the filthy traitor!

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:38.678
And I do so despise traitors...

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.934
They're not much I know, but I don't see any point

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:05.304
wasting my stronger Bakugan on the likes of you ...

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.011
Hold your fire!

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.080
These poor Bakugan are just being used!

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:15.381
Don't worry...

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.517
... I'm using my lowest energy level.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.918
Good thinking...

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.387
Okay, cover me!

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:27.460
On your mark... get set...

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:28.828
...Go!

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.902
Let 'er rip!

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.637
Ultimate Dragon!

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:44.510
What?

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:45.578
Huh?

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:48.247
Close, but no CIGAR !

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:53.019
[screaming]

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.625
That's gonna leave a mark...

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.694
Hydranoid... incoming!

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:02.895
Huh?

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:04.764
Time to teach you a lesson!

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:09.869
Oh come on...

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:11.237
I hope you can do better than that !

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.411
Masquerade!

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:20.880
There's no way we can do this separately...

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:24.150
Let's combine our powers - my Pyrus and your Darkus -

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:25.852
and take these jokers out!

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:29.255
Pyrus and Darkus together?

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:30.490
Yeah!

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:32.525
We'll give these guys a battle they won't forget!

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:34.794
Hmph. Count me in.

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:37.230
Ability Card Activate!

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:39.565
Pyrus! Darkus!

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.033
Unite!

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:50.810
Ultimate Dragon!

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.019
Pyrus Reflector!

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.829
What? How the heck did he do that ?

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.597
He used the Pyrus Reflector...

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.733
It is a Counter Ability that deflects any kind

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:15.902
of Pyrus attributed attack.

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:20.840
If that is the extent of your pathetic human abilities,

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:23.543
then I'm afraid you two are in trouble.

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.580
Book it!

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.962
Man, those guys are pretty tough...

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:45.598
Even Drago and Hydranoid working together

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.133
couldn't defeat them!

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:48.701
Listen to me Dan....

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:50.536
Okay - I'm all ears.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.838
I think...

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.406
I may have an idea....

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:57.043
[grunting]

00:07:57.076 --> 00:08:00.746
[screaming]

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.255
[screaming]

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:11.424
[laughing]

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:12.758
That's it...

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.260
Gate Card Set!

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.501
Get on!

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:28.407
Ya want some more?

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:33.179
Ability Card Activate!

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:34.747
Dragon Plus!

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:47.326
I think I may have an idea.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.396
When the time's right I'll set up a Third Judgment Gate Card.

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.531
How will you know when the time's right?

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:55.401
When Hydranoid and Centorrior are close together,

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:58.237
then you lure Druman in.

00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:00.540
The fact is only one Bakugan

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:02.842
can survive the Third Judgment...

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.577
and with Hydranoid's superior strength

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.779
we'll take down both of them at once.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.917
You're a disgrace to the Darkus name...

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.184
Pathetic....

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.519
I'll finish you!

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:22.862
Looks like you're a bit tied up !

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.197
Good... now pull him over!

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.367
Come on now...

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.736
quit putting up such a fuss...

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.241
My new shoes!

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:36.676
That's a good Bakugan...

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.711
Nice work... Hydranoid...

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.447
Third Judgment!

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:47.420
Argh! What have you done?

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.088
Okay Drago. Now!

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.356
This should do it...

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:52.024
Boosted Ultima!

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:03.035
The Third Judgment's been activated.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.039
All the pieces are in place...

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:09.175
Time for the coup de grace...

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.877
There can only be one victor...

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:13.446
And so...

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:15.081
Go forth Alpha Hydranoid...

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:19.185
Let those vile creatures receive their just reward!

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.055
You will never...

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:24.657
... win against us!

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.025
Oh really... ?

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.766
Here we go Alpha Hydranoid...

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:36.335
Destroy Vanish!

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:39.005
Say goodbye!

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:40.806
[laughs]

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.775
Nice try...

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:46.345
Did you really think it would be that easy?

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:49.315
Eyes of Destruction!

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.552
Oh no... What happened to the Destroy Vanish?

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:55.488
Grand Down.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.465
Oh no... They're going after Hydranoid!

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.700
Stay away!

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:08.968
Masquerade...

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.203
I can't let you do this alone!

00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:14.140
Ultimate Dragon!

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:16.208
Pyrus Reflector!

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:30.523
[screaming]

00:11:30.556 --> 00:11:32.725
Masquerade!

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:36.829
Stay tuned for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:40.466
Welcome back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:47.673
Oh no, Masquerade!

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:51.610
Hmph...Looks like two down and two to go!

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:58.684
Now you've got our undivided attention.

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.188
Why you...!

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:05.558
Hm...

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.428
But Dan...

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.930
Third Judgment is just a cover

00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:12.932
and not our real plan of attack.

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:13.933
Huh?

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.734
And if I get taken down...

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:18.437
Dan... you have to cut and run.

00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:31.217
Come out, come out, wherever you are...

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:37.890
[laughs]

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:40.860
You can run, but you can't hide!

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:43.729
Ultimate Dragon!

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:47.733
Pyrus Reflector!

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:50.903
You can try and try, but your feeble attacks

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:53.005
won't even leave a scratch on me!

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:04.950
[screaming]

00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:10.623
Ha!

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:18.364
[screaming]

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:20.766
Havin' a bad DAY over here...!

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.709
[screaming]

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:36.815
Impressive, but a waste of time.

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:45.658
[laughter]

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:51.030
Can't... run... any more...

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.041
That's as...

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:04.777
far as I can go...

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.979
Well, well, well...

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:10.416
have you finally given up trying to avoid your doom...?

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:12.351
Something like that...

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:18.624
I should've expected you to turn tail and run

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:20.859
when things got dangerous.

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:23.929
Humans are such cowardly creatures...

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:26.365
[laughs]

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:29.735
What could you possibly find amusing?

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:31.704
I wasn't running away...

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:33.839
I just needed to get you to stand on the \"x\"

00:14:33.872 --> 00:14:36.375
And I intentionally used my weakest attack...

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:40.045
just so that I could bring you here as well.

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.213
What?

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:54.793
Now for our real plan of attack.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:57.029
Let's see who survives this time!

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:59.098
Trident of Doom!

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:05.037
Final Destruction!

00:15:16.782 --> 00:15:18.651
Dan... hurry!

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:20.452
Right!

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:30.162
This... isn't... possible...!

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:32.665
[screaming]

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:42.341
What was that?

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:49.748
I could've sworn the shot came from way over there...

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:52.484
The Darkus long-range attack!

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:55.754
You had this planned all along!

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.757
Ha! Guess we suckered you guys, huh?

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.026
And if I get taken down...

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.296
Dan... you have to cut and run. Huh?

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.398
You've gotta somehow lure them into a wide,

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:08.834
open area with no obstructions.

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:11.070
Then Hydranoid will take aim and shoot

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:13.605
with his long-range attack.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:16.909
So then Hydranoid and Masquerade being taken down

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:18.544
was all an act ?

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:19.912
Precisely.

00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:22.581
Once that was accomplished, we predicted you would use

00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:25.217
a Pyrus attribute to fight me off.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.920
And so to prolong things, I lowered the strength

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:30.356
of my attacks and chased you here!

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:40.933
You two were far too self-absorbed to realize!

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:42.501
We've been tricked!

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:44.169
Let's finish this, Drago!

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:46.004
Ultimate Dragon!

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:47.606
Exceed!

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:57.683
[\u266a]

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:03.722
[\u266a]

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.457
That oughtta do it!

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.530
Well done, Dan.

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:17.669
Thank you Masquerade...

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.138
for all your help.

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.739
You really saved our bacon!

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:22.908
This doesn't have to be the only time though...

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:25.644
we should get together and do this again sometime!

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:28.680
I already explained to you...

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.150
I can't do that - it is not my destiny.

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:33.519
ALICE: No!

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:37.556
Don't go...

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:41.393
Please, we still need your help... Masquerade!

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:42.528
I cannot help you...

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:44.930
That destiny is yours alone.

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:46.465
No, I can't...

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:47.833
not all by myself...

00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:49.134
It's just...

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:51.103
I've only begun to learn about Bakugan...

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:53.939
and I still feel so inexperienced...

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:57.176
It all seems too much for me...

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.744
You will be fine...

00:17:58.777 --> 00:18:00.112
I know you can do it.

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:01.380
But... how?

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:02.514
Don't you know?

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.983
It's because I am you , Alice.

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:09.855
But, Masquerade....

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:20.165
And so this is our final farewell.... Dan.

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:22.334
Masquerade...

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:27.239
I am glad that my final battle was alongside you....

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.746
I wish you good luck.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.082
Masquerade, wait!

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.131
Alice...!

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:56.468
Goodbye forever...

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:58.570
I'll never forget you...

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:07.479
RUNO: Dan!

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:14.753
Hey!

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:16.522
Hey Guys! What's up?

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:19.558
Hey, wait... ... is that...?

00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:21.593
It is! It's Alice!

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:23.262
What is she doing in Vestroia?

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:24.563
Alice!

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:25.998
Runo....

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:28.200
Oh, where were you?

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:30.469
I was so worried about you!

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:32.471
[crying]

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:36.175
I'm sorry to make you worry... Runo....

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:45.584
I really must apologize to all of you...

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:46.885
Don't mention it...

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:50.188
after all, we are your friends aren't we... ?

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:56.161
But can someone tell me why Alpha Hydranoid is here?

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.063
SHUN: And tell us why he's on our side?

00:19:58.096 --> 00:20:02.367
That's because he's my Bakugan now.

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:04.736
Isn't that right... Hydranoid?

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.905
From this day forth...

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:09.975
... Alice... I battle with you .

00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:13.946
[laughter]

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:16.615
I just realized - Now we have them all!

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:19.618
\"Them all\"? All who ?

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.019
Aquos...

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.688
... Ventus...

00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:24.556
... Pyrus...

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.091
... Sub Terra...

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:27.326
... Haos...

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:30.128
...and now Darkus!

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:33.899
As of this moment, we have all six Bakugan attributes!

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:35.334
All six attributes...

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:36.702
Marucho's right!

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:40.505
[laughter]

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:43.709
All right...

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.010
This is perfect!

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:49.314
Now we're ready to go take down Naga!

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:52.484
[cheering]

00:20:57.889 --> 00:21:00.025
[laughter]

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:01.360
Perfect.

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:05.964
Just as Naga planned.

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:11.403
DAN'S MOM: Hi there Dan, my special little guy...

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:12.671
Are you OK?

00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:13.939
How is everything going?

00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:15.440
I hope you're minding your manners and remembering

00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:17.075
to brush your teeth.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.644
You know Dan, after you left,

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.679
all kinds of those \"Bakugan\" thingies appeared

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.214
all over the world.

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:24.549
Maybe this is that nasty ol' Naga's doing.

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:27.352
Please come home soon - the world needs your help!

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:29.721
There's no turning back now, Dan,

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:31.823
and I know you'll always do your very best!

00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:33.258
Make your mother proud!

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.060
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:36.595
I think that's how you say it...
