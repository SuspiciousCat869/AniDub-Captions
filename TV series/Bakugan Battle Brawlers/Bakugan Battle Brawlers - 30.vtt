WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.607
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.908
when all these random cards

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.277
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.179
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.614
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.850
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.318
That's when we realized

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.887
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.055
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.324
from another world!

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.559
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.328
Runo...

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.697
Marucho...

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.000
Julie...

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.636
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.838
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.707
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.108
Bakugan!

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:45.378
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.548
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.651
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.753
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:54.788
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.856
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.924
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.194
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.229
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:07.434
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.503
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:13.039
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.074
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:21.481
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"I Am Marucho, Hear Me Roar!\"

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.419
MARUCHO: The Brawlers were all sent

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.254
to the \"World of Trials\"

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.089
by the Six Legendary Soldiers of Vestroia that we met

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.692
in the Doom Dimension in order to be tested.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:33.726
I wonder what my test will be...

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.933
[screaming]

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.501
I think I'm gonna be siiiiiiiccckkkkk !

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.539
Dan! Shun! Runo! Julie! Where are you?

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.478
I'm beginning to think those guys were sent somewhere else...

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.847
I bet we're the only ones in this wretched place -

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.049
doomed to spend our remaining days wandering aimlessly...

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:57.951
Wait a sec...

00:01:57.984 --> 00:01:59.152
is it just me or do you hear something strange?

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.087
[groan]

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.255
Probably just my stomach...

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.823
I haven't eaten in ages...

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.325
Could you move two feet to your left?

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.630
I am so sorry...

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.631
Are you okay, whoever you are?

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:12.899
Yes...

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:13.967
I mean no!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.201
I need water... water!

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.469
Sure...

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.171
but where do I find it?

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.939
Beyond that mountain...

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.275
is another mountain, beyond which there lies a spring

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.743
deep in the woods.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:24.744
There you'll find water...

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.546
Hang in there!

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.414
I dunno...

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:29.482
it kinda sounds like it's a long way away...

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.385
Just ignore him...

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:33.386
we'll go to the spring for you!

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.721
Take this...

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:35.855
you can bring water back in it.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.056
Great!

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.191
We'll be back in a jif...

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.626
PREYAS: Wait...

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.894
you're not serious are you?

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.363
[coughing]

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.365
[laughing]

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.473
Whew. I'm beat...

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.708
Well, we finally made it up the second mountain pass...

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.943
Oops... that was the third one...

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:58.278
guess we went too far...

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.948
Oh-oh...

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:08.555
[screaming]

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:15.995
Cooooollld!

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.399
Coldcoldcoldcoldcold...

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.334
If this outfit shrinks I am gonna be some ticked off !

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.303
I'm all wet too...

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.871
Huh?

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.576
Preyus... Look! It's the spring!

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.610
No kidding...

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:35.481
Here you go. Drink up!

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:36.849
Oh!

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:37.884
Still cold!

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:42.188
Ha!

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.528
That's better!

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.863
Hey! I know you...

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:54.801
...You're the ancient Aquos Soldier...Frosch!

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.769
You have a pure heart that is willing to help others

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.605
in need.

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.039
I daresay you just may have what it takes

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.342
to become one of the new soldiers.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:03.810
Huh?

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:05.578
Ohhhhh... you sly old devil, you...

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.513
I think I get it now.

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.315
This was my test, wasn't it?

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.484
No. Sorry.

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.653
Your real test begins riiiiightttt...

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:14.687
...Now!

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.658
Water?

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.692
I think I got splashed a little...

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.062
Oh nooooooooooooooooo!

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.866
I am SO sending him my dry cleaning bill...

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.174
Hup!

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:37.410
Well my little castaways, if you entertain the slightest

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.878
hope of ever seeing your friends again,

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:41.347
you must defeat my warrior!

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.188
Hey hang on...

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.190
if you're here, then how come you're over there too?

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.492
Ahhh!

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:53.926
There's two of you!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.695
No, don't be ridiculous Preyus.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.530
There can't be two of me...

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:59.799
That one's got to be an imitation of me.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:01.100
The hair looks good...

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.169
Thanks - I thought so too...

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:05.304
Now! Let's begin!

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:07.006
Good... This'll be fun!

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.043
Gate Card... Set!

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.344
Oh well, I guess I don't have a choice...

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:12.545
Gate Card... Set!

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.984
Why not start with Aquos Warius.

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:19.052
'Kay...

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:21.988
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.623
Aquos Warius Stand!

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.729
As an Aquos soldier it's only natural that you'd

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:32.198
choose to brawl with a Water attributed Bakugan.

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:33.633
I'm gonna do the same.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.002
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.470
Aquos Limulus Stand!

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.408
BAKUPOD: Bakugan ready.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:43.409
Let's see...

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.610
use Aquos Siege!

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.079
Yes... a wise choice.

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:48.314
Gate Card... Set!

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:49.982
Get ready for this!

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.818
You haven't seen anything yet!

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.620
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.055
Aquos Siege ... Stand!

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:05.898
BAKUPOD: 400 G's versus 350 G's.

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:07.100
I can change that !

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:08.768
Gate Card... Open!

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:09.802
Energy Grab!

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.608
BAKUPOD: 100 G's of Aquos Siege's power

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:17.710
transferred to Aquos Limulus.

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:20.847
Aquos Limulus' power level now at 450 G's.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.449
In yer face Aquos Siege!

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:26.486
Didn't your mother teach you that it's not nice to steal?

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:27.787
Ability Card Activate!

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.056
Aquos Javelin!

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.457
Aquos Siege! Look alive!

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:40.600
BAKUPOD: Gate Cards exchanged.

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:42.068
Aquos Javelin can interchange

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:43.436
adjacent gate cards.

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:44.470
Pretty nice, huh?

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:48.808
But...

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.243
but he just stole my \"Energy Grab\" card!

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:51.844
You thief !

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:53.713
BAKUPOD: 100 G's transferred back

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.515
from Aquos Limulus to Aquos Siege.

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:56.649
And now...

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:59.285
Gate card open!

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.053
Because this is Aquos Siege's character card,

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.288
his power level doubles!

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.330
Unreal...

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:12.999
I've never seen an ability like that one before...

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.970
Good boy .

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.139
That's my little Marucho.

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:22.742
You are such an obedient child , aren't you?

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.210
I certainly hope so.

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:26.012
What ever !

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.380
That little puppet is just doing

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:29.115
what the old guy tells him to!

00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:31.150
C'mon Marucho, don't listen to any of this hooey.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:32.552
You're not like that imposter!

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:34.287
\"Good boy\"?

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.589
\"Such an obedient child\"?

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:37.657
I expect you to win the next round too .

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.458
Yes...

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:40.960
I promise I will live up to your expectations.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.563
Then... he's...

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:44.997
Spit it out, kid.

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:46.365
You're makin' me nervous...

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:48.201
That Marucho's not an imposter...

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.203
That Marucho is every bit as real as I am...

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:52.004
That's just crazy talk.

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:53.439
If he's the real Marucho

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:54.440
and you're the real Marucho, then...

00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:55.975
He's a different Marucho...

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:57.944
He existed a long time ago...

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.580
And I... I thought he was gone...

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.154
Marucho dear...

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.989
Your Economics tutor

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.891
will be arriving later this afternoon...

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:13.626
Please come straight home

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.494
as soon as you're finished school, alright?

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.563
Yes mother. Of course.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:18.931
I know you'd rather play, but you have to apply

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:19.966
yourself to your studies.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:28.674
[kids laughing and playing]

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:29.675
FATHER: You don't have time to fritter away

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.277
like the other children.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.812
I'm sure you understand, don't you Marucho?

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:33.913
-Yes, father.

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:35.281
I understand.

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:44.757
[\u266a]

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.293
I know it seems unfair, but it's important.

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:48.661
The future of the Marukura family name

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:51.531
is in your hands, my son.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.266
Yes...

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.134
I promise I will live up to your expectations.

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.711
Stop it! Just stop it!

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:07.013
Wipe that obedient smile off your face!

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.781
Ho ho!

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:11.150
Looks like we touched a nerve, doesn't it?

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:13.052
Tell me: What's wrong with the old \"you\"

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:15.755
that obediently fulfilled all your parents' expectations

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:16.789
and did his very best to please them?

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:21.794
So that's it!

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:23.896
I think I get it now!

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.132
My test is to learn to deal with my past, am I right?

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:29.235
Hm? Hm...

00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:30.670
In that case, I'll show the two of you just how much

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:31.871
I've changed !

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:33.139
Whoa, dude...

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:34.907
Gate Card... Set!

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.047
Hey... hang on a sec... I...

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.282
I'll show you that I'm not the same as I was back then!

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:45.551
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:46.619
Here comes lunch again!

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.989
Don't touch that remote kiddies!

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:54.827
Here we go with more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.299
Preyus! Stand!

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.268
Marucho!

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.869
Whaddya think you're doing ?

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.438
I'm not feeling very good today...

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:06.505
Bleccch!

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.474
And for some reason...

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:09.976
I'm craving sour food...

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.877
Pay attention Preyus!

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:13.312
I need you to change to your Darkus attribute!

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:15.181
Huh?

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:17.049
What the heck's up with you today, Marucho?

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:19.618
I mean, you're not your usual fun-lovin' self...

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:21.520
I cannot lose this battle, quit messing around, got it ?

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:22.622
Yeah yeah, I got it...

00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:26.826
All right, ya big lug...

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:29.695
Attribute Change!

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:32.732
Darkus!

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:34.734
Check it!

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:36.102
Now you think you can win by using an Attribute change,

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.571
is that it?

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:40.840
If you keep this up you'll never win against my Marucho!

00:10:40.873 --> 00:10:42.675
No matter how his Attribute changes,

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.277
Preyus is always Preyus!

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:48.014
He's still my best friend in the whole world!

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:50.049
There's no way that Preyus would lose to the old \"me\".

00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:52.718
He's worthless and weak!

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.154
Well why don't we just see about that?

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:58.758
Gate Card Open. Switchback!

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.359
What the heck's goin' on?

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:01.360
Switchback's not good , right?

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:02.928
Huh?

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.663
Oh no...

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:06.165
Switchback has made me turn back to Aquos...

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:08.234
...and that's bad !

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:10.002
I'm talkin' \"bad\" as in really really bad!

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:14.573
Ability Card Activate!

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.242
Blue Stealth!

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:18.811
I'm disappearing!

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:20.446
BAKUPOD: 50 G's transferred from Siege to Preyus.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.186
Oh, how the mighty have fallen !

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:31.323
Oh man...

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.059
I feel even worse than before...

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:35.327
Sorry, Preyus...

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:36.695
but it's like he sees through all my tactics

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:38.064
and anticipates my every move!

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:41.367
Well of course.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.569
You are battling yourself after all...

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:46.138
Past or present, you are completely the same.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.040
I am not the same!

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.809
I am nothing like the boy who mindlessly did

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.844
everything his parents told him to!

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:54.013
Do you really hate the old \"you\" that much?

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:55.381
Yes I do!

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:58.451
I despise him!

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:01.620
No matter how hard I worked, it was never enough.

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:04.056
And when I wanted to tell my parents how I felt...

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.958
... all I could do was smile that fake,

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:07.960
meaningless smile...

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:09.862
But the moment I came across the Bakugan,

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.497
everything changed!

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.765
When I met the Brawlers...

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:14.366
...and then Preyus...

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.901
I learned to think for myself...

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:17.403
I learned to Brawl...

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:18.871
...and to laugh...

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:22.508
...and to live life to the fullest!

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:23.576
So you understand why there's no way I could lose

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:25.111
to the old \"me\"!

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:28.314
Foolish boy...

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:30.883
is that really all you've learned from your friends?

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.351
I would like to go with the Triple Battle.

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:33.385
Hm.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.488
Gate Card... Set!

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:38.023
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.725
Aquos Siege Stand!

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:45.364
Let's do everything we can to pass this test, okay?

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:46.899
Yeah okay, but...

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:48.734
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:50.769
Preyus Stand!

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:53.839
Hey, I told you I wasn't feeling good...

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:55.808
So sour, but so good...

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:57.376
I can't fight two Brawls in a row!

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:58.444
Don't you worry...

00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:00.146
just leave everything to me!

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:01.514
BAKUPOD: Siege: 400 G's.

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:03.549
Preyus: 340 G's.

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:05.084
Quick! Hit me with an Ability!

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.485
Right, I'm on it!

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:07.820
Ability Card Activate...

00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:09.321
-Water Refrain. -Huh?

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.356
Wait, I wasn't finished...

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.028
Marucho's Ability Card was pre-empted by that other

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:17.429
creepy Marucho...

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.697
And that means...

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:22.034
...I'm in trouble...

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.869
Preyus, no!

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:27.106
Not looking good for you...

00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:34.313
Preyus! Oh no!

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:35.681
You can do it!

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:37.249
I'm...

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:38.717
I'm sorry ol' buddy...

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.586
I...

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:42.588
guess I couldn't live up to your expectations...

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:44.723
No, it's my fault...

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:46.425
I was so caught up in my own problems I didn't listen

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:47.760
to you tell me yours...

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:50.362
Its okay, Marucho.

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:52.198
You know I'm just happy to have battled alongside you...

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:53.899
\"Preyus is always Preyus\"...

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:55.801
Thanks for saying that...

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.369
But...

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:58.370
if that's true then doesn't it mean that Marucho

00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:59.805
is always Marucho?

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.141
Huh?

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:03.943
You weren't just blindly doing what your parents wanted...

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:06.345
I think that back then you honestly wanted to make

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:09.448
your parents happy and proud of you.

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:11.584
You're a generous person Marucho...

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:12.751
you were then...

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.920
and you are now.

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:17.923
I'm sure you made sacrifices.

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:19.191
But if that smile you put on your face

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.326
made your parents happy,

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.394
then there's no way it could have been

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:24.096
anything but sincere.

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:26.799
You had to make all those sacrifices just so you could

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:28.934
grow and become the plucky little guy you are now.

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:31.804
The guy we all like.

00:14:31.837 --> 00:14:34.673
So please remember never to forget your past okay?

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.075
Do that for me...

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:41.247
Good, I'm glad...

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.248
Just keep being the Marucho that we all...

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:43.816
that we...

00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:45.784
...Oh no!

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:48.020
I...

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.054
can't hold it!

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.829
Whew...

00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:58.597
So that's what it was...

00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:00.499
I thought it was a bit strange that I wasn't

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:03.168
feeling well but now it all makes sense.

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:05.571
It's no wonder I was craving sour foods like that.

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.306
Uh... so then...

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.008
are you feeling better now?

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.210
Are you kidding?

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:12.778
I feel fantastic !

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:14.513
I'm on top of the world!

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:18.284
One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two...

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:19.785
I am so relieved!

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.053
Enough of this!

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:22.521
We have a battle to finish!

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:24.690
Are you ready my brother?

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:25.724
\"Brother\"?

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.461
You called, brother dear?

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:37.936
Aquos Preyus...

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.740
Angelo ! At your service.

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:42.975
Whaaaaaat?

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:43.976
I don't believe it...

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:45.511
It's true !

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.646
Y'see, my evolution involves multiplication!

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.114
Evolution?

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:50.749
Wait... are you saying...

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.551
No flies on you .

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:54.486
Y'see, your test was to recognize and accept

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.288
the old \"you\", Marucho!

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:57.990
When you were finally able to do that,

00:15:58.023 --> 00:15:59.725
then I was finally able to evolve and multiply.

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:01.260
Kapisch?

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:03.228
I think I get it.

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:05.464
So I suppose that means you are the Evolved Preyus?

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:07.199
Oh, uh...

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:09.134
goodness - where are my manners .

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:10.302
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:13.038
I'm Aquos Preyus Angelo.

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:14.640
I look forward to battling with you, young master.

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:17.209
Uh... yes, nice to meet you.

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:19.845
By the way, I am Water attributed but I have

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:22.681
the powers of a Light attributed Bakugan as well...

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:25.117
This is probably as good a time as any to mention

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.853
that I get tired easily and require frequent breaks.

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:29.288
I get every second Monday off...

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:30.422
Oh, and I don't do windows...

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:32.157
Uh... right...

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:34.927
Are you sure this is a good idea, Preyus?

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.862
Angelo steps up to the plate when it counts!

00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:39.531
Show 'em, brother!

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:41.100
Yes sir, Preyus, sir!

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:42.835
Let's show 'em together !

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:44.036
Pfft... big deal...

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.771
Oh, by the way...

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.606
The Triple Battle Card has been activated.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.640
What? Not good...

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:55.180
BAKUPOD: Preyus' power level increased to 400 G's.

00:16:55.214 --> 00:16:57.049
Oh man, I am feeling great!

00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:59.017
I mean, just check out these pipes!

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:00.319
I hate to interrupt, brother dear...

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:01.653
but we have work to do!

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.889
Oh yeah!

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:05.357
BAKUPOD: Preyus and Angelo total power level: 800 G's.

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:06.392
Humph!

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:13.866
Yeahhh! We did it guys!

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:15.501
Well well...

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:17.503
It looks like you're finally getting serious.

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:18.537
Time to break out the secret weapon!

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:27.546
You know what to do.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.014
Don't let me down.

00:17:29.047 --> 00:17:30.315
Don't worry, I won't...

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:31.316
Bakugan...

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.718
Brawl!

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:34.053
Frosch Stand!

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:36.655
Rrrribbit...

00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:38.023
Aiyiyi!

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:39.224
What the heck is that thing?

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:40.526
Don't worry...

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:44.430
That's just his true form.

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.699
I bet you're about to use a Triple Battle Gate Card.

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:50.736
You're so predictable...

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:52.738
You think you're so clever, do you?

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.573
Well then I'd hate to disappoint you!

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:55.607
Preyus Stand!

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:58.577
Ooo... eee...

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.745
someone's got fly breath...

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:01.246
Gate Card... Open!

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.081
Triple Battle!

00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:04.249
Get ready, Angelo...

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:06.485
Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:06.518 --> 00:18:07.653
Angelo Stand!

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.564
I am Aquos Preyus...

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:19.898
...Diablo.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.000
In the flesh!

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:23.869
So...

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.971
which one of you jokers woke me up from my nap?

00:18:26.004 --> 00:18:27.940
Whoa!

00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:29.575
Who's this guy and what happened to Angelo ?

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:32.878
Y'see, Diablo is Angelo's alter ego...

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:34.580
It's sort of like getting two Bakugan

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:35.781
for the price of one.

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:36.882
Of course, how silly of me...

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.984
Well...

00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:39.985
there's just the one opponent to deal with right now...

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:41.820
so...

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:43.121
Why don't we see what you're made of, Diablo?

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:45.190
You gotta be kiddin' me.

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.692
You woke me up to brawl with a frog ?

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:48.694
What a waste of my time.

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:50.262
I'll give him one of these ,

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:52.164
one of these and a whole lotta this !

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:55.234
Hey, if Diablo's power level is also 400 G's...

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:58.036
BAKUPOD: Preyus and Diablo total power level: 800 G's.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.306
Frosch's power level: 500 G's.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.574
All- right !

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:04.877
We can take him down no problem!

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.912
Don't count your chickens till they're hatched...

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:08.547
Ability Card Activate!

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.549
Aqua Cyclone!

00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:13.051
See what I mean?

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:15.621
BAKUPOD: Frosch's power level increased by 200 G's.

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.956
Preyus and Diablo decreased by 100 G's.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.691
Sorry to break it to you...

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:21.593
but you're about to be sucked up by my water tornado!

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:24.696
But... this can't be!

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.198
Don't just stand there!

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:28.066
Use the Diagonal Relation Ability Card!

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.868
\"Diagonal Relation Abili...\" ?

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:31.803
I have Nova attributed powers too!

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.972
If my brother changes to a Darkus,

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:36.508
then you can use a Nova and Darkus Diagonal Relation.

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:37.743
If you don't snap to it and do something fast,

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:39.478
I'm going to get real angry!

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:40.746
Right... sorry 'bout that...

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:44.182
Here goes...

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:46.351
Darkus Attribute Change!

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:53.191
Ability Card Activate!

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:55.894
Nova and Darkus Diagonal Relation!

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:56.929
BAKUPOD: Preyus and Diablo total power level

00:19:56.962 --> 00:19:59.364
increased to 800 G's.

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:01.300
Oh nuts...

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:02.334
Alright! Do your thing, guys!

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:06.705
Save some for me !

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:08.006
Yikes...

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.942
Bye-bye FROGGIE !

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:10.943
Oh Yeaaahhh !

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.210
Our work here...

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:13.612
... is done!

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:20.218
So whaddya think Marucho?

00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:22.087
He'll be feeling that tomorrow!

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.622
Glad I could be of service to you.

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:27.059
Hey, wait!

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:28.794
What.

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:31.897
I'm sorry about how I behaved, old \"me\".

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.100
Thanks to Preyus I think I understand things now.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.302
From this moment on I promise I'll be happy

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:39.338
with the person I used to be.

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:41.707
So thank you...

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.809
and I hope we can be friends if there are no hard feelings.

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.019
Very well done, my boy, very well done.

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:55.787
Huh?

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:57.956
You won the battle and you passed the test!

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.758
Thank you Frosch.

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:01.093
I will now send you back to your friends...

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:03.128
my new Aquos Soldier!

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:04.162
Goodbye!

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.403
SKYRESS: We are sent to a city where the sun doesn't set.

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.071
The laundry's hung out to dry...

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:15.073
the streetcars are running...

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:17.342
And the Hatodome Tower is under construction...

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:19.277
But there are no people living here.

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:21.380
It is an empty, deserted city.

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.914
A girl appears and challenges Shun

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:24.816
to a Bakugan Brawl.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.184
The sun that never sets...

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:27.686
Is it merely an illusion?

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:29.354
Or something else...

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.823
Coming up on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers:

00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:33.292
\" The Sunset is Crying!\"

00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:34.726
Wake up, Shun!

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.761
You do not belong in this world!
