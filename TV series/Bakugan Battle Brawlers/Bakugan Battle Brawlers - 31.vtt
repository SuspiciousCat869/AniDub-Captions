WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.607
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.975
when all these random cards

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.277
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.179
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.614
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.850
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.318
That's when we realized

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.887
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.022
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.324
from another world!

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.559
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.328
Runo...

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.697
Marucho...

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.000
Julie...

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.636
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.838
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.707
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.108
Bakugan!

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:45.378
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.548
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.651
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.720
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:54.754
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:57.924
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.194
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.263
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:07.434
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.503
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:13.039
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.074
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.781
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"A Place Far From Home!\"

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.852
SHUN: At the edge of the Doom Dimension

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:29.389
we met the six legendary soldiers of Vestroia.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.224
We told them that we wanted to stop Masquerade

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.026
from destroying both our worlds

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.462
but they wanted us to prove ourselves.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.796
So they sent us to the \"world of tests!\"

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.233
Shun!

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.873
Everything's all right Shun!

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.575
We're here?

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:51.511
I guess so...

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:55.148
The last thing I remember is the legendary six soldiers

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.116
and then I woke up next to you.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.418
What?

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.220
A train?

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.361
This isn't what I imagined the \"world of tests\"

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:11.030
would look like at all.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:13.266
This could be any place back home,

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.335
except of course that there's no one around

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.337
but you and I...

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:27.147
It's like a ghost town!

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.048
Look, everything is so run down.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:40.693
I wonder if the other Brawlers are around somewhere?

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.695
No we're supposed to be here alone.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.831
Then let's keep moving!

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.035
I don't know why those legendary soldiers

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.337
sent us here...

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.506
...but I do know we're in this strange place for a reason.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.008
Yeah.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.976
If being alone is the \"test\"

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.112
then this is way too easy...

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.713
It doesn't bother me being on my own.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.654
I don't need anybody...

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.222
I can take care of myself, no problem.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.259
Oh hello!

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.695
I guess your train was late huh?

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.730
Uh, you were expecting me?

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.208
Yeah I was getting bored...

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:31.210
I need someone to play with?

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:32.412
Play what?

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.083
How about tag!

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.818
You're it!

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:39.919
Come on!

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:41.854
Try to catch me!

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.957
Catch you?

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.327
\u266a You can't catch me! You can't catch me! \u266a

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.695
Who is she?

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.229
I don't know but she seems to know you.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:52.465
Yeah she does...

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.866
Well I guess it wouldn't hurt to play along for awhile.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.539
If this game is part of the test

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.673
then we've already passed for sure!

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:03.943
I'm over here!

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:19.892
Now you're it!

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.029
Uh-uh.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.998
You have to step on my shadow to win!

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:27.000
What?

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.801
Those are the rules 'cause we're playing shadow tag!

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:31.404
Just kidding!

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:34.407
Hey wait!

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.887
Now I got ya!

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.856
Hey you're fast!

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.124
Okay!

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.458
Onto the next game!

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.626
Another one?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.961
Yeah!

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:57.263
Kick the can!

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.732
Come on! Follow me!

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.467
She sure seems happy to have you here.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.635
I'll say...

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.304
You're up!

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:05.872
It's your turn now!

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:07.740
Okay here I go!

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:13.946
That was a good one!

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.782
It's more fun to play with someone than it is

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.151
to be alone all the time!

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:19.485
Sometimes...

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:20.653
You mean you like to be alone?

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:22.321
Yeah it's okay...

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.457
Oh?

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.328
I have a bunch of friends.. But they can be a handful.

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:32.298
You're lucky.

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:34.967
I don't think I've ever heard you laugh before Shun...

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.502
It's good to see this side of you!

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.304
Hey look over here!

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:40.573
This is my favorite place of all.

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.042
I always come up here and look at the sunset.

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:45.712
As long as the sun is in the sky I never feel lonely.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.648
It makes me really happy.

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:50.817
Shun...Don't you think it's beautiful?

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.452
Yeah..

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:54.787
I haven't seen a sunset like that..

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.723
Well since I was your age...

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:59.392
This really brings back a lot of memories.

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.594
Something's not right about all this.

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.730
And what's that?

00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:05.865
I'm not sure how long we've been here but the sun

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:08.601
is still in the same position in the sky.

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:11.204
It's as if it's never going to go down!

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.905
Yeah it isn't moving?

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.174
I wonder what that means?

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.777
I know!

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.713
If the sun always stays up in the sky..

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:22.915
We can keep playing forever if you want to...

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.654
Hey.. Mom I'm home!

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:32.258
Mom? Mom?

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:36.729
[coughing]

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.731
Oh no! What's wrong?

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.208
Wait Shun...I thought you were going over to Dan's

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.777
to play after school today?

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.179
No, not today Mom!

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:55.214
Oh come on...You know you can't fool me!

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.551
Well I...?

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.419
There now...It's my job as your Mother to know

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:02.655
what you're up to.

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:05.258
I'm sorry...I knew you weren't feeling well

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:07.160
and I didn't want you to be here all by yourself.

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:10.229
Thank you Shun.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.432
Oh look at that...

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:16.569
When I was young I used to wish the sun would never set..

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.971
That way I could play as long as I wanted too.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:20.873
I had so many friends back then,

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:22.909
almost as many as you do now...

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.311
That was a really happy time.

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:26.913
My friends and I would play all kinds of games.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.148
We had so much fun!

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:31.083
Sunsets like that don't last forever

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.885
so enjoy them while you can.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.153
She's just like...

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.255
My Mom...

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.824
Don't let it get to you.

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:39.826
This is only part of the test!

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:41.527
I'm glad you're here...

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.396
I've been really lonely without any one to talk to.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.236
When I got here, there was nobody around...

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.872
I looked everywhere but I couldn't find anyone..

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:56.042
I tried to keep myself busy but pretty soon I got bored.

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.344
...It's not much fun being alone..

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:02.114
Oh well at least I had the sunset to look at!

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.951
Then I saw you..

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:07.386
And I hoped you'd stay and play with me!

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.988
Please?

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.923
What are you going to do Shun?

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:13.459
Please Shun...

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:15.127
I have another really good game we can play now!

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.796
Look at this!

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.164
-Bakugan? -This is it!

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:19.799
This is the test

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.768
Oberus the Vestroia soldier was talking about!

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.871
And you're going to have to battle this little girl!

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:26.138
You wanna play!

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.274
It's lots of fun?

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.776
Shun..If this little girl is your Mother...

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.278
Then you're going to have to focus

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:33.312
if you want to make it through this!

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:39.085
I'll try Skyress...

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:42.521
But this test just got a lot harder all of a sudden.

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:44.724
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:50.496
And now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.599
GIRL: Okay Shun!

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.368
It's time for a showdown!

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:56.869
Let's play Bakugan!

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.716
Gate card set!

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.554
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:17.256
Ventus manion stand!

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.560
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.229
Ventus Ravenoid stand!

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:27.867
BAKUPOD: Bakugan recognized!

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.201
Ready!

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.903
Gate card open!

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:32.038
Ability card activate!

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.006
Character!

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.741
BAKUPOD: Manion power level has doubled to 700 G's!

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:37.576
Ability card activate!

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.312
Storm breaker!

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.717
BAKUPOD: Manion power level now at 350 G's!

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.827
Oh wow! Great move!

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.430
You used a Ventus ability card?

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:58.598
And that instantly cancelled out the effect

00:09:58.631 --> 00:09:59.799
of my \"character\" ability card!

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:04.136
Okay let's see you beat this!

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.373
Here! Gate card set!

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:09.308
Bakugan brawl!

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:10.743
Ventus bee striker stand!

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.881
Bakugan brawl!

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:16.916
Ventus Ravenoid stand!

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.685
You're setting her up?

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:21.554
I have got to win this!

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:23.222
I don't think your strategy will work!

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:25.491
Why not?

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:26.692
Because I know you're thinking of using the Ventus

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:27.960
Triple Chain.

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:28.995
That's a bad move!

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.964
How come?

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:33.766
Oh because, it's just so easy for me

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.568
to tell what you're thinking!

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.169
Remember..It's my job as your Mother to know

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:39.071
what you're up too!

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:41.340
Shun are you okay?

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:43.209
Now it's time to find out how good you really are!

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:45.111
Bakugan brawl!

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:46.379
Oberus stand!

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:55.655
[\u266a]

00:10:55.688 --> 00:11:03.963
[\u266a]

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:06.032
BAKUPOD: Bakugan Oberus recognized!

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.266
Oberus is one of the legendary soldiers

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:08.834
who sent us here!

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.302
He's very powerful Shun.

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.370
Be careful!

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.172
I will!

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.741
BAKUPOD: Oberus' power level is at 500 G's.

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.576
It currently dominates the Bakugan field.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.146
Gate card open!

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:21.280
Quartet battle!

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:32.058
[\u266a]

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:34.493
So you think you beat me in a quartet battle do you?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.095
You're wrong again!

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:37.930
Ability card activate!

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:38.964
Turmoil!

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:46.572
What? Turmoil?

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.708
BAKUPOD: Oberus' power level has increased to 700 G's!

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:49.942
Whoa!

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:50.976
I can't beat that!

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:55.748
Oh no!

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:02.054
Good! At least you've still got Monarus!

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:09.095
Oh I guess I should have told you that Turmoil

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.630
is an ability that only Oberus has...

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:13.365
It can attack with an increased power level

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.734
of 200 G's automatically

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.737
but it can only defeat one Bakugan.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.006
And that's why you got to keep Monarus!

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.242
But I could have lost both my Bakugan in that battle...

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.411
You're good...

00:12:25.444 --> 00:12:26.712
Why didn't you use an ability card that would

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.614
defeat both of them?

00:12:28.647 --> 00:12:33.119
Because I want to keep on playing with you.

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:38.724
Oh come on now... We'll have lots of fun!

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:40.059
Snap out of it Shun!

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:41.160
Wake up!

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:46.932
Gate card set!

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:48.767
Bakugan brawl!

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:50.469
Monarus stand!

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.912
Oh wow!

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.714
Hey let's have a race next!

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.048
A race?

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:05.050
Yeah!

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:06.819
My Bee Striker versus your Monarus and we'll see which

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:09.021
one can fly higher okay?

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:11.724
Ability card activate!

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:12.892
Scarless twister!

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:20.866
[\u266a]

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:28.641
[\u266a]

00:13:28.674 --> 00:13:30.810
You lose!

00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:33.112
The Scarless Twister lets me pull the opponent I'm battling

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.980
into my area of the Bakugan field.

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:36.882
Pretty neat, huh?

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:39.652
Shun! Put me in the game!

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:40.920
Okay!

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:43.255
Bakugan brawl!

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:44.857
Ventus Skyress stand!

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:57.803
[\u266a]

00:13:57.836 --> 00:14:00.673
You're so pretty!

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.608
But that won't help you beat me!

00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:04.710
Bakugan brawl!

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:06.378
Bee striker stand!

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:08.514
[\u266a]

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:10.482
Go get 'em Bee striker!

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.550
BAKUPOD: Advantage Bee Striker!

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:12.685
That's it!

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:15.421
Gate card open!

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:16.488
Trade off!

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:23.762
Oh no, with the trade off ability card the Bakugan

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:25.864
with a power level higher than 400

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:28.267
automatically loses...!

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.569
This battle isn't over yet!

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.571
The sun's still up, we can keep playing!

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:35.307
You in?

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:36.542
She's a real brawler just like you!

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:41.747
Can you handle this Shun?

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.215
Hey Shun!

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:45.451
I always know I can trust you

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:47.019
no matter what battle you put me in...

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.254
But now I think it's time for you

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:50.089
to put your trust in me!

00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:51.090
I trust you...

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:52.992
Prove it.

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:54.560
Gate card set!

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:58.464
Ready Skyress?

00:14:58.497 --> 00:14:59.665
Always...

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:03.235
Bakugan brawl!

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:05.771
BAKUPOD: Oberus and Skyress enter the Bakugan field!

00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:11.277
You've underestimated both me and my friend!

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.045
I don't think so!

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.247
Gate card open!

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:17.483
Energy merge!

00:15:17.516 --> 00:15:19.718
This is the gate card that takes 100G's of power level

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.620
from the Bakugan that entered the battle last

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:24.390
and adds it to the first Bakugan on the field!

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:25.958
BAKUPOD: Power exhange from Oberus to Skyress recognized.

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:32.498
I bet you didn't see this coming did you Oberus!

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:34.733
It's no use Skyress!

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.568
I've seen all your tricks before!

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:37.836
We'll see!

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.605
Try and stop this!

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:40.639
Ability activate!

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:41.674
Turmoil!

00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:47.179
BAKUPOD: Oberus's power level 600 G's!

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:49.415
Noooooo!

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.884
You've flown right into my trap Skyress!

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:53.919
[laughter]

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.020
You're finished!

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:56.288
Skyress!

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.357
That won't help!

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.059
There's no way you can win this battle

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:01.293
so what do you want to play next?

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:03.529
Next?

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:07.599
I know lots of games

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.734
and we can play as long as we want to here...

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:12.538
The sun never sets!

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:15.908
Shun stay here with me...

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:19.578
Of course I'll stay Mom.. Nothing else matters now..

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:22.681
I can take care of you.. Everything will be all right..

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:24.650
Things will be just like they used to be..

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:26.452
There's nothing to worry about anymore...

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:29.088
It'll be just you and me, forever and ever...

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:34.993
SKYRESS: Shun!

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:36.995
The little girl is just a mirage...

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.597
Oberus is playing tricks on you.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.567
Skyress...No?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.168
Listen! This is not where you belong!

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.803
You have to get back to your own world!

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.905
The world where your friends are!

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:48.674
Oberus has just been testing you!

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:49.708
Don't listen to her Shun!

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.811
[Skyress screams]

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:56.482
Shun!

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:05.691
I want to stay...

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:07.359
You can't Shun!

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:08.827
You have to get back in the battle!

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.433
Skyress!

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:15.467
NO!

00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:18.003
Don't let that bother you.

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:19.838
Everything's okay.

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.141
You can stay here forever and ever!

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.742
No way!

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:26.545
I really don't belong here...

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:28.647
I've been alone too long...

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.551
I need to see the friends I have back in my world...

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:35.320
And I need Skyress!

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:37.156
But Skyress had to sacrifice everything

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:38.924
for me to realize all that!

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:39.958
...Everything...

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:44.329
[crying] I'm sorry Skyress...

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:56.575
BAKUPOD: Skyress power increase recognized!

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.746
Whoa!

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.281
BAKUPOD: Skyress power level at 550 G's!

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.288
I don't believe it!

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:11.457
Skyress has evolved!

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.592
She has become Storm Skyress!

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:17.429
You're back!

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.364
And to think I almost gave up on you!

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:21.033
Remember I told you

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:23.469
all you had to do was get back in the battle,

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.671
well I'm just taking my own advice!

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:28.474
It's sounds simple but it's true.

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:31.543
You don't have to face every battle on your own Shun.

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:34.112
Your friends need you as much as you need them.

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:35.814
And I know you know this now,

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:37.716
but we're much stronger when we're together

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:38.750
than when we're apart!

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:41.253
My ability card?

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:43.088
...It's changed...

00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:45.290
Let's finish this battle!

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:47.392
Ability card activate!

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:48.994
Destruction Meteor Storm!

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.664
It's time for the sun to set...

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:54.066
Right now!

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:58.971
The past is gone Oberus!

00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:00.639
We're moving into the future!

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:02.040
This test is over!

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:03.809
It's time to let us go!

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:05.811
You can't hold us here any longer!

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:08.313
We've already broken free!

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:11.216
BAKUPOD: Storm Skyress increase to 650G's!

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.186
You can't leave until I say you can!

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.509
Looks like you win.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.448
[screech]

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.684
[laughing]

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.057
Whoa! Look at that, the sun is finally setting.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.760
Well anyway I had fun playing with you Shun.

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:56.528
Yeah thanks.

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:57.663
Maybe I'll see you again someday!

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.164
I hope so.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:01.900
Bye Bye!

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:04.369
Goodbye! Take care!

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:06.405
Goodbye.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.242
Everything is going to be okay...

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:11.944
I know what I have to do..

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.912
And I've got my Mom to thank for it...

00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:16.248
And you too of course Storm Skyress!

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:18.050
Hey that's what friends are for!

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.893
What happened? Where are we now?

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:30.062
STORM SKYRESS: I don't know but this looks familiar to me.

00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:31.863
Look around you!

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:35.033
This is what my world Vestroia looks like now.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.502
I sometimes wonder what kind of future there will be

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:38.971
for this place but I haven't given up hope yet.

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:40.372
Please don't...

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.307
I know tomorrow will be better...

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:44.710
Hopefully for both of our worlds...

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:45.877
STORM SKYRESS: You can trust him Oberus.

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.879
I know I can.

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:50.382
Thank you.

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.584
You and your friends have many more battles

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:54.853
ahead of you Shun.

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:57.990
If you are true to one another you will win them all.

00:20:58.023 --> 00:21:00.058
Good luck.

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.736
Coming up on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers...

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:12.537
Runo must face her test

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:14.773
from the six legendary soldiers of Vestroia

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.508
but what she doesn't know is that

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:19.678
it will be a test of her courage as well as her mind.

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.013
It's going to be her ultimate challenge

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:23.315
and if she succeeds

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:25.651
it will mean the Brawlers will be stronger for it.

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.919
But if she fails

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.722
it will spell disaster for her world as well as mine.

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.557
Failure is not an option!

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:35.594
So don't miss the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
