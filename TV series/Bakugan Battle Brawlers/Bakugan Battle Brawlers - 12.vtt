00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.340
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:08.708
when all these random cards

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.912
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.214
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:16.616
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:17.917
That's when we realized

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:20.587
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.788
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.157
from another world!

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.326
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.094
Runo...

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.463
Marucho...

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.733
Julie...

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.369
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.638
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.440
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:41.841
Bakugan!

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.111
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.451
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.553
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:54.554
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.589
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:57.690
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.826
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.027
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.062
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:07.200
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.270
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:12.806
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:13.840
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.513
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"BAKUAN STALL\"

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:29.789
[door opens]

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:30.824
I'll be right with you.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.161
'Kay... one non-fat expresso...

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.798
Sorry for the wait, guys...

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.266
but here you go...

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.601
Excuse me...

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:42.902
but, do you hear the fire alarm?

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.571
Uh... no. Why?

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:47.040
'Cause... you're smokin'!

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.441
ALL: Smokin' HOT!

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.109
[laughter]

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.512
Easy boys!

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.746
[thinking] Hmmm, I wonder if I told Runo

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.648
that my grandfather is HAL-G

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.584
would she ever speak to me again?

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.352
Oh, I wish I could tell someone... anyone!

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.254
Oh wow...

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.922
that waitress is sure good for business...

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.791
Your place is packed!

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.759
It's just too bad I can't say the same thing

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:07.861
about your food!

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:11.197
[laughter]

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:12.532
You're a regular comedian, aren't ya?

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.134
Listen up...

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.469
Not so loud, my daughter Runo might hear ya!

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.538
Runo. You seem so distant.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:19.572
What has you troubled?

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:22.675
SHUN: Game over!

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.514
Help Mother!

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.716
[screams]

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:34.721
Game over!

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:37.156
At least for you it is.

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:42.195
Oh Runo...

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.265
Huh?

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.766
You have a second to talk?

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.801
Uh... what about?

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.138
Oh. Uhhhhh...

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:02.482
Shun...are you alright?

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.117
I don't know.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:14.961
.BAKU-POD: Dan, ranked 97 of 100

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.429
What?

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:18.164
What's Runo doing in there,

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.333
how did she move up so fast?

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.268
And, at number one for the most consecutive weeks

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.370
as a jerk- Masquerade!

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.005
Shun?

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.174
You're really letting yourself go,

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:31.177
slipping into sixth place.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.112
Dan, Is it true that he was number one

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.582
before Masquerade came along and beat everyone?

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:39.819
Yah, he ruled the game.

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.020
Until he dropped the ball and never bothered

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.789
to picked it up again.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.290
He no longer battles Bakugan?

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:46.125
Yeah...

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:53.199
DAN: Shun and I used to be the best of friends.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:55.902
We did absolutely everything together.

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:58.037
You couldn't tear us apart.

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:03.710
And when Bakugan started up,

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.144
we were the ones who laid down the law

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:07.747
and wrote the rules together.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.849
Shun was lead in breaking down all the moves.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:12.285
Okay, how about for the wind attribute;

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:15.221
we invent a backdraft ability to force out

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:18.458
any opponent left standing on the battle field?

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.160
Totally blowing away the competition.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.195
DAN: He was on a roll.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.401
And then he started pulling this disappearing act.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:31.204
Sometimes leaving right in the middle of a jam session.

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:33.072
Well Shun? What'd yah think?

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.507
Sorry.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.541
I have to go now.

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.978
Uh-But-Shun?

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.419
Yah know, it was weird,

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.820
like something changed in him

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:48.855
when his mom went into the hospital.

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:58.064
Shun, I wish you wouldn't beat yourself up over this.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:11.444
[beeping]

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.446
Mom, you okay?

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.014
Oh, Shun?

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:16.382
You're here?

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.483
Yes.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:18.785
Shun?

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.486
Yes?

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.789
Could you...go get my purse?

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.058
I have something...

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.859
that I've been saving that I think you'll like.

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:27.927
But...

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.262
I don't...

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.930
Just give my purse, silly...

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:32.231
But I don't want anything...

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.801
Yes, I know...

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.302
but sometimes a mother wants to give her son

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:38.538
a gift just because she loves him...

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:40.139
Now go home and get my purse

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.607
before I get all emotional...

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.743
You're such a good boy...

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:46.112
SHUN: Boy, I wish my mom

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:47.547
would quit worrying about me so much

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.649
and look after herself.

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.317
She practically does everything for me

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.686
and now when she needs me the most,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.988
she's still trying to make sure I'm happy.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.891
Man, I feel so useless...

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.493
When she gets out of here,

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.195
I've gotta step up to the plate...

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.439
[chiming noise]

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.942
Shun! Still there?

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:18.344
Stop goofing off and get back here now!

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.079
Things are gonna change under my house rules!

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.983
SHUN: No, he's not the boss of me.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.819
[panting]

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:30.123
He makes me so mad!

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:32.391
GRANDPA: Things are gonna change under my house rules.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.029
If I had my way,

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.898
he would spend less time playing with his friends

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.667
and more time studying to be a real warrior!

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.770
SHUN: Change of plans old man.

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:53.646
[beeping]

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.414
It looks like... she's stabilized.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.251
Shun.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.372
You finally came back.

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:20.907
Didn't think you'd have the guts to show up...

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.144
...since you're so out of practice.

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:26.179
Still ready to play?

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:30.716
Oh I'm game...question is are you?

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.685

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.151
It's your name...and it's spelled out \"loser\".

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.344
What?

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:32.745
All talk and no show again?

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:34.247
Fine then I'll start!

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.583
But, first, I need some reinforcements.

00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:39.485
Been a while since we've had face time.

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:44.590

And let this be a lesson in the mastery

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:10.416
of ultimate kung fu moves.

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:11.484
Humph!

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:13.019
Not so fast grasshopper!

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.353

Awh!

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.111

What is this, chess?

Battle Begin!

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:18.951
Gate Card! Open!

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:29.929
BAKU-POD: G level up 100.

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.464
Agh!

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:32.665
Amateur!

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.967
Ability Card Activate!

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:52.151
There!

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:53.185
Ball's in your court!

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:55.821
Gate Card Set!

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.156
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.259
Ravenoid Stand!

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:07.600
Arrrgh! Don't just stand there!

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:08.601
Move!

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.136
Hey!

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:11.337
Quit stalling and show me you got game!

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:15.975
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:17.176
Griffon Stand!

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:24.083
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.960
DAN: What is up with him?

00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:37.163
He should be wiping the floor with me by now.

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:39.365
Then wringing me out and wiping again.

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:40.499
But we're just butting heads?

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.967
Somethin's goin' down.

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:51.143
Gate Card! Open!

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:00.352
BAKU-POD: Gs approaching 520.

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.362
DAN: Still slacking off?

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.264
This is one messed up game plan!

00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:20.039
More action comin' up!

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:26.512
Let the real games begin!

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:33.352
Come on Shun!

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:35.121
Let's brawl!

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:37.723
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:50.903
What?

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:52.304
You gotta be kidding me?

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:53.472
Oh well!

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:55.040
Bring it on!

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:56.142
Ability Card!

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:57.643
Activate!

00:13:03.015 --> 00:13:05.518
Okay, how about for the wind attribute;

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:08.454
we invent a backdraft ability to force out any opponent

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:10.890
left standing on the battle field?

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:13.792
Totally blowing away the competition.

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:15.828
What is up?

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.496
Is blowing me off part of your strategy?

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.331
I have my reasons.

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:21.734
Why, are you getting tired?

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:24.136
Yah! Tired of you goofin' around!

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.671
Saurus stand!

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:33.779
Ability Card! Activate!

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:34.947
Backdraft!

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.152
What the heck?

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:41.854
Are you trying to trick me!

00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:43.889
Just keep playing...

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:46.358
'cause I don't ever wanna stop.

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:47.459
But...

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:48.694
Why?

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:49.795
What's going on?

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.031
Let it go.

00:13:52.064 --> 00:13:53.966
You wouldn't understand.

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.768
Oh, come on!

00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:57.970
Look, it can't be that bad.

00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:00.573
We can talk after we finish the game.

00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:02.408
No don't, if my mom stays in the hospital

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:04.076
it's game over for me...

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:06.979
That is, if my grandfather has any say.

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:09.348
So stop stalling and keep playing!

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:10.916
Ravenoid stand!

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.489
Gate Card! Open!

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.569
But why?

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:31.637
All we're doing is shadow boxing.

00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:37.509
This isn't even a real game.

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:40.613
You're just using me to avoid your stupid grandpa.

00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:42.615
But what's worse is your mom's paying for it.

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:43.816
[gasp]

00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:47.586
There!

00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:52.124
[beeping]

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:58.998
Arrh!

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.766
No, he's wrong!

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:02.735
I must continue the game.

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:04.236
Argh!

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.437
He has the Pyrus Saurus...

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.906
concentrate...

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.375
I'l l use the air battle ability.

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.944
Whatever it takes.

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:13.545
Hey, your little plan isn't working,

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:14.680
so just throw in the towel and go, 'kay?

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:18.517
Bakugan...

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.321
erh...ah...

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:23.656
Brawl!

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:27.026
Huh!

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:28.227
I over shot!

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.500
Gate Card! Open!

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:57.589
I think its game over for both of us.

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:07.032
Oh geeze, finally after 2 hours the perfect spot!

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:09.668
Uhgh!

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:11.036
What the!

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.204
-Da-an?

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:13.339
Dad- Quick!

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:14.873
To the hospital!

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:23.315
[engine revving]

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:24.450
[brakes squealing]

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:28.053
Thanks Dad!

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:30.255
Hunh? Shun?

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:35.661
He'll be here shortly...

00:16:35.694 --> 00:16:37.663
At least I brought you your purse.

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:38.931
Mom!

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:39.965
Hunh?

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.334
Mom!

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.704
Mom?

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:52.344
Shun.

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:54.446
What took you so long?

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.148
I was just about to go under...

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.182
Thank goodness you made it...

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.984
Gasp!

00:16:59.017 --> 00:17:01.153
Sleepy...

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.766
Don't worry, son, your mother will be fine.

00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:17.903
Shun.

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:21.640
The doctor's right, Shun, I'm be fine.

00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:24.176
You go home and Grandpa will look after you.

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:26.378
But here, I've got something for you...

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:30.015
It's what I wanted to give you...

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.451
I know it's what you really love, Shun...

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.722
Now go have some fun...

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:42.995
Hmmm? Really?

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:46.865
You wanted to give me a Bakugan?

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.801
Well duh!

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:51.003
But you are not going to get a chance to play with it

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:53.639
because you'll be practicing Ninja moves with me!

00:17:53.672 --> 00:17:55.774
And under my house rules

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:57.543
you'll be coming home from school and staying home.

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:58.977
None of this disappearing act.

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.579
And none of that Bakugan Business either!

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:02.514
Do you hear me?

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.883
Now it makes sense... why it was so important.

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.620
She knew all along

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:11.023
that Bakugan is what I really wanted to do.

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:13.592
Man, how could I have been so blind?

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:16.228
I guess sometimes you just have to listen to your gut...

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:18.430
SKYRESS: So what's your plan now, Shun?

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:19.798
SHUN: My Grandpa wants me to be a 'Ninja Superstar'

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:21.166
like him...

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.001
But why did you shut out your friends?

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:24.403
You love to battle.

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:26.405
And one day soon you will.

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:28.073
Shun?

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:30.042
Shun are you even listening to me?

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:31.410
Well, the day will come

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:33.545
when you must make up your mind.

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:35.080
I'm sure you'll make the right decision...

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:40.953
That is an unfortunate story.

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:42.821
Yah, sure is.

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:44.623
I still haven't seen him.

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:47.326
Or heard from him for that matter.

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:48.660
Folks say he just moved in with Grandpa

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.662
and then disappeared.

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:53.765
Never to touch a single Bakugan ever again...

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.000
as far as I know...

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:57.035
I think.

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:59.738
Anyway the game won't miss a no show has-been,

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:00.772
and neither will I.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.345
MASQUERADE: Perfect.

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:08.413
More battlers are joining daily

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:10.849
but which Bakugan holds the highest power level?

00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:14.052
Filter on.

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:23.762
Excellent, my Hydranoid is still in the lead.

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:27.399
HAL-G!

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:34.306
Of course you're in first place.

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.074
All these so called battlers you send out

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:38.510
keep getting beaten.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:42.281
Explain yourself, for Dan and his crew

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.283
are gaining considerably in power.

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:46.485
I have my reasons.

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:48.187
Those kids were just disposable pawns

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.289
in our overall strategy.

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:51.723
They gave of themselves willing

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:53.859
out of their own greed.

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:55.227
And their sacrifice will help us create

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.529
the ultimate in opponents.

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:59.665
We need the highest evolved Bakugan

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:02.134
to get to the infinity core.

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:03.902
And, as you know, the more power you achieve

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:06.138
the more evolved you become.

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:11.910
We need to pool our resources into one central entity.

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:13.779
And so what if it is Dan's?

00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:16.949
He's so cocky and sure of himself,

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:19.084
he'd be willing to blow it all in one shot;

00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:22.087
he wouldn't see it coming 'til it was too late.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.189
But making one player so powerful could prove fatal.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:30.729
And Naga is anxious for one loss in particular.

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:34.933
[growling]

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:36.668
NAGA: The fate of doom must be sealed

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:39.438
for that little Snake in the Grass.

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.906
Snake in the grass?

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:42.808
He speaks of Pyrus Dragonoid,

00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:45.010
the one they call Drago.

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:46.645
For some reason he has a grudge

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:49.147
against this particular Bakugan.

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.516
So this calls for, a different kind of player.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.285
A battler they'll never suspect.

00:20:56.955 --> 00:20:58.890
And I know the perfect one.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:01.326
The perfect one!

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.762
[evil laugh]

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:10.936
This is Dan!

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:13.272
Filling you in on the DL for what's coming up!

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:16.174
Did Runo and Marucho really loose it with Shun?

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:17.909
I mean battle wise...

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:21.246
Has my old friend Shun finally got back in the game?

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:22.814
Or he has become a card carrying member

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:25.717
of club Masquerade?

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:28.487
Either way I couldn't let it go without a fight.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.857
Get ready for some serious brawlin'

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.093
coming up on Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.728
So are you in?
