WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.440
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.775
when all these random cards

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.111
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.979
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.716
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.017
That's when we realized

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.687
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.755
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.224
from another world!

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.426
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.194
Runo...

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.563
Marucho...

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.867
Julie...

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.503
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.738
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.540
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.941
Bakugan!

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.415
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.486
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.654
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.689
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.857
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.893
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.094
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.129
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.300
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.939
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:13.973
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:21.214
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in Fight or Flight!

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.353
You know what's really cool is when you use the ability cards

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.222
to block a move!

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.057
Sure but what I'm really stoked about is using

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.892
the ability cards in a combination attack!

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:33.993
Good idea!

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.995
Mui! Come here!

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.531
We'll show you a couple new Bakugan Battle tricks!

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.467
Yeah check it out! They're really cool!

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.502
Sorry...

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.237
I wasn't listening guys... It wasn't important, was it?

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.242
It's okay

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.577
we know you're thinking about your little brother again...

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.611
Say something!

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.613
Uh yeah!

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.515
You're out here everyday waiting for him to show up!

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.851
Hmm. I know...

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.658
See ya later...

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:08.261
Hurry...I'll be waiting for you...here.

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:14.334
MASQUERADE: Waiting won't bring you anything...

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:15.368
You have to make things happen!

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:19.772
I can grant you any wish...

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.441
With these...

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:22.575
...All you have to do is use them...

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.616
[panting]

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.319
Hey! Alice!

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.192
Alice you must be beat after that long flight?

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:41.027
Not really...

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.695
I slept on the plane all the way from Moscow

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.597
so it didn't feel like it took that long!

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.599
Had you made prior arrangements with me

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.668
I could have got you a seat on our private plane...

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:51.804
I believe that your journey would have taken half as long.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.406
So you're Alice huh?

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.775
Wow you sure are pretty!

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.343
Why thanks...So are you Preyas!

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.315
My lady you are indeed a sight to behold....

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.350
Aw come on, give the poor girl a break you guys!

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.553
Oh that's right...

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.888
I brought both of you something from back home.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.557
For us? You shouldn't have!

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.558
Oh yes she should have!

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.126
I love presents!

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.161
Huh? What's that?

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.196
Here's some fresh battle simulations...

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.631
They're set up to match your attributes...

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.300
You like them?

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.868
You can use them the next time you do battle!

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:22.869
Yeah...Great.

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:25.004
Lucky!

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.774
You see Alice is the brains of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:30.176
She knows more about the game than any one of us!

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.477
She doesn't battle but if you ever want to know anything

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.080
about the game she's the one to go to for the info!

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.515
You don't say...?

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.183
Uh....Hey?

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.885
...Is Dan around?

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.219
[giggling]

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.821
Aw this bites!

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.356
Where did they go?

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.391
How could they get lost in an airport?

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.527
DRAGO: You should know all about that Dan.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.662
Haven't you noticed we've been walking in circles?

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:51.064
DAN: Hey I just went to the restroom

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:52.665
and forgot which direction we were walking in!

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.335
That sounds like \"lost\" to me.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.537
DAN: Uh technically yes but... Ah forget it!

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.439
We all came here together

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:01.241
but I guess Dan must have wandered off somewhere.

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:03.910
Dan will never change will he?

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:05.945
Hey Alice if you don't mind me asking,

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.847
what made you decide to pay us a visit here so suddenly?

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.515
Are you here on important business?

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.852
No Marucho I just felt like seeing all of you in person.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.823
Runo thanks for letting me stay with you!

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.758
No problem-o!

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.493
You know you're welcome at my house any time Alice...

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.028
My Mom and Dad were totally stoked

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.896
to hear you were coming for a visit...

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.432
My Mom even made a big vat of tuna surprise just for you!

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.368
Yeah you're lucky Alice.

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.103
That's the one thing Runo's Mom knows how to make.

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:31.671
You'll be eating tuna for breakfast,

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:34.240
lunch and dinner and even dessert too if you're lucky!

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.575
I don't eat it myself so I'm sure they're be lots left over

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.277
to take home with you...

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.645
I guess I'll have to eat pizza again!

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:40.380
Total bummer!

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:41.748
Don't feel sorry for yourself.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:42.882
You're lucky!

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:44.584
Yeah I know...Hey!

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.452
You want a couple of slices?

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.388
DRAGO: For the sake of your world and mine.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.290
We must find the human who corrupted Naga's mind...

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.992
I remember his name...

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.961
His name is Michael...

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:57.330
It's Michael.

00:04:57.363 --> 00:05:00.066
JULIE: These visions I keep having... What do they mean?

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.801
And what does Grandfather Michael have to do with it all?

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.736
...Is he somehow connected to Masquerade

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.638
and the potential destruction of Vestroia,

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:07.140
the home world of the Balugans?

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.708
...It doesn't make any sense...

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.009
I could tell my friends about this

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.177
but what would they think of me?

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.178
Funny.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.212
Hey you!

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.184
You're Dan Kuso's buddies, right?

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:19.952
That's right who are you?

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.357
RUNO: They were sent by Masquerade?

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.328
This is the place!

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:30.363
DRAGO: ...But where are your friends?

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:37.937
I am lost!

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.873
MARUCHO: Runo do you really think we can beat these two?

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.241
Maybe we should go find Dan before we start to battle.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.010
No-way!

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:45.011
We don't need Dan here!

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:46.379
Look!

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:48.014
I know we can take these two...

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:49.849
Besides we've got Alice to help us!

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.017
But uh...?

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.251
RUNO: There's two of us!

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.653
And two of them...

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.221
So we're good to go!

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.756
Let's get it on!

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.658
Takashi, did you hear that?

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.993
Yeah, this oughta be fun.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.495
Finally we've found some decent competition.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:05.231
Hey guys... You sure about this?

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:06.599
You don't want us to battle?

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:08.468
Mui if we beat them...

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:09.569
You get to see your brother!

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:13.239
MARUCHO: That girl must be

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:15.074
planning their strategy for them...

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.709
Hey quit yappin'! And let's brawl!

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:20.313
Field Open!

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:39.198
Doom Card Set!

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.872
Gate Card Set!

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.811
I wonder what attack we should use first?

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.980
Let's try this one!

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:55.314
Bakugan brawl!

00:06:58.484 --> 00:06:59.919
Robotallian stand!

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:09.729
Yeah! Go get 'em!

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:11.330
An Aquos Robotallian?

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:13.065
I'll try this..!

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.234
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.570
Darkus Robotallian stand!

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.177
A Robotallian!

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.978
PREYAS: Oh no!

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.613
You know what that means...

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:28.614
BAKU-POD: Calculating Darkus Robotallian power levels...

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:30.449
620 Gs

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:33.252
And now...The Ability Card...

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.253
This will give my Robotallian the abilities of Darkus

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.823
and Aquos!

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:39.425
BAKU-POD: Bonus power level of 200 Gs added.

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:42.328
Darkus Robotallian's power level just spiked majorly!

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:44.130
The combination of \"Darkus and Haos\"

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:45.198
is a powerful force indeed.

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:56.075
Wha? ...Oh no! My Robotallian!

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.245
Poor Bakugan.

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:10.022
You're gonna pay for this!

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:12.725
Bakugan brawl!

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:15.228
Saurus stand!

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:20.867
I know this will shut them down!

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.103
Gate card set!

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.508
Bakugan brawl!

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.112
Pyrus Serpenoid stand!

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:40.753
BAKU-POD: Calculating power levels...

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.989
He's going with a Pyrus Serpenoid...

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:45.224
And his power level is at 320!

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.726
Yeah! Well I know what to do!

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.394
Wait!

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:50.329
Don't be so eager to rush into battle...

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.831
Look what you're up against.

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.833
Whatta ya mean?

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.201
They've activated a diagonal relationship

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.769
between Pyrus and Darkus.

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:58.938
Don't just focus on their ability cards,

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.373
be more careful with the gate cards they use as well...

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:01.407
Let's brawl!

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:05.645
Understand?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.549
Brains as well as beauty!

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:10.750
Now that's some good advice Alice!

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:12.618
Yes impressive...

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:15.354
And you should be working together as a team...

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.456
Believe me you'll get ahead faster if you do!

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.025
It'll work, trust me.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.828
Do you think they're taking a time out?

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:24.196
Maybe?

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.231
Gate card set!

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:28.801
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:31.804
Terrorclaw stand!

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:42.281
Terrorclaw...

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.183
This oughtta take care of him!

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.284
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:47.820
Fear Ripper stand!

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:53.693
Yeah! Gate card open!

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:57.029
BAKU-POD: Calculating power levels!

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.834
Ability activate!

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:04.403
Diagonal relationship between \"Pyrus and Darkus!\"

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:09.909
Fear Ripper power level... 450 Gs!

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:15.748
Saurus!

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:18.651
Yeah!

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:26.492
Hey! Gate card set!

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:28.027
Bakugan brawl!

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:30.730
Griffin stand!

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:36.969
Come on!

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:38.371
Let's see what you got!

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:40.973
She still wants to play...Newsflash!

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:42.341
Just because you're on top of your own card

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:43.709
doesn't give you the advantage!

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.478
Watch this!

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:47.446
Bakugan brawl!

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:51.350
BAKU-POD: Bakugan power levels stable....

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:53.252
Ability Card Activate!

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:54.653
Rapid fire!

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:03.963
What kind of move is that?

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:06.098
He just cut in on his partner's battle!

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:10.636
BAKU-POD: G level increase... Garganoid!

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.872
He-ha!

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.173
That ability card lets your team mate join the fight...

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:16.042
Now we're twice as strong.

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.676
A combination play!

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.545
That's impossible!

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:21.313
This calls for drastic action!

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.314
What the...?

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:23.883
Gate card open!

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.184
Trade off!

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:31.223
Oh no!

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:32.358
He beat our Bakugans?

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:36.996
Ahem!

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:38.931
How'd you like that?!

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:40.366
\"Trade Off\" is a command card,

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.534
which can overthrow any Bakugan with a power level

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:43.569
above 400 Gs!

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:45.171
TIGRERRA: Well done Marucho...

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:46.972
PREYAS: That's using your brain!

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:48.908
So, are you boys paying attention?

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:49.909
[grunting]

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:51.010
Incoming!

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.281
Bakugan brawl!

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:57.950
Terrorclaw stand!

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:02.688
Terrorclaw again... Then I'll use this...

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:06.058
No way!

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:07.226
MARUCHO: Water refrain!

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.064
Huh? ...What's happening?

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:13.866
You're out of luck!

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.000
You can't activate your ability card right now

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.302
because I've sealed it!

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:18.003
Nice move!

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:19.438
But there's no way you can win this battle!

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:21.107
That's right..

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.609
We're gonna win this so Mui can see her brother!

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:26.112
Kosuke...Takashi...

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:29.014
Bakugan brawl!

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.951
Robotallian stand!

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.087
You're using that one again?

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:41.794
What's going on?

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:42.795
I thought they were on the same team?

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:43.829
It can't be?

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:50.503
This is totally whacked.

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:52.204
...Who's fighting who here?

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.442
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back.

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:02.047
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers are back...Battle on!

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:06.952
Gate card open! Now!

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:16.896
Why are they battling each other?

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:17.930
I don't like this!

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.567
They're trying a battle sham!

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.801
What's that?

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.082
MARUCHO: No... Our Terrorclaw!

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:46.926
Kosuke that's what I call a comeback...

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.461
A choice \"Stray Shot\" like that lets the winner

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:51.163
send other Bakugan to the Doom dimension.

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:53.432
It's the ultimate fake out

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:54.800
and my Bakugan gets to stay in the battle!

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:58.204
So that's why it's called a battle sham!

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:00.206
I see...

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:02.541
It's a bit of a reckless strategy if you ask me.

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:04.143
So what!

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:06.078
We're gonna do what ever it takes to win!

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:09.448
We're doing this for Mui and Makoto!

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:11.283
Mui and who?

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.451
...Makuto?

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:16.055
Makoto is Mui's brother...

00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:17.723
Their parents have separated

00:14:17.756 --> 00:14:19.291
and we don't know where he lives now

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:21.660
but we've found a way to bring them together.

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.996
Makoto loves Bakugan and when we win this battle

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.798
it'll raise our ranking and wherever Makoto is,

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:27.366
he's sure to notice us.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:28.901
And to make Mui happy again

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:31.770
we made a deal with Masquerade.

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:33.072
MASQUERADE: Waiting won't bring you anything...

00:14:33.105 --> 00:14:35.207
You have to make things happen!

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:37.209
I can grant you any wish... with these cards...

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:38.844
All you have to do is use them...

00:14:38.877 --> 00:14:43.115
That's so sad... Poor girl...

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:46.485
Maybe my Grandfather Michael can help her....

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:47.786
So we'll do anything to win!

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.088
Yeah!

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:50.556
Anything for our friend Mui!

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:52.057
Oh boo-hoo!

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:53.058
You're breakin' my heart!

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.460
Let's battle!

00:14:54.493 --> 00:14:56.195
Send me in my lady... I'm ready...

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.463
Okay Tigrerra!

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:58.497
Do your stuff!

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.898
Bakugan brawl!

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.768
Tigrerra stand!

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.608
If you want a battle you shall get one!

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:10.876
Great!

00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:12.177
I'm gonna step it up a notch

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.178
'cause I was born to play this game!

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:14.747
Battle!

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.856
BAKU-POD: Griffin's power level is 290 Gs...

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:26.258
Falconeer at 340 Gs.

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:27.459
You don't have a chance!

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:28.794
Oh yeah!

00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:29.862
We'll see about that!

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:31.463
Gate card open now!

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:41.640
It's a quartet battle!

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:43.008
Oh goodie!

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.511
Finally I get my turn!

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.313
BAKU-POD: Calculating power levels....

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:49.014
The power levels haven't changed...

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.249
We're still ahead!

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:52.051
Yeah! Not for long!

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:53.852
Ability Card Activate!

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.587
Cut and Saber!

00:15:57.489 --> 00:16:00.159
Been waiting for you Tig!

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:02.494
The wait is over!

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.901
We gotcha!

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:16.909
I don't believe it!

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:18.477
No way! Let's go!

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.712
No! Please stop!

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:24.583
Please... stop this!

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:28.320
[crying]

00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:30.022
Please stop...

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:32.591
Makoto means a lot to me but not like this...

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:34.360
Not at the price of all these Bakugans...

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:35.728
Mui?

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:38.430
What's wrong...Mui?

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:40.933
Makoto loves Bakugan.

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:43.102
And he thinks the world of you two

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:45.671
because you have so much respect for the game...

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:46.972
I don't know what happened but today you're playing seems

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:48.006
cruel and mean.

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:53.679
[laughter]

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:55.647
Something's wrong...

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:57.616
This game, used to be so much fun.

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:58.784
Yes she's right...

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:01.954
Darn!

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.291
Doom card return!

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:11.263
We're calling it quits huh?

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:12.598
Doom card return!

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:18.470
It appears they're giving up.

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.672
Takashi...Kosuke...

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.408
We got a carried away.

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.877
We tried to make you smile but instead we made you cry.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.678
We'll get you and Makoto together somehow.

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.447
Yeah!

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.883
RUNO: Is this soap opera over yet?

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:32.885
We still have a battle to win over here!

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:34.787
We can't let you quit on us!

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.788
That would be way too easy!

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:37.890
Let's go!

00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:40.059
Yes! If you're up for it!

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.894
We'll start again and have a real Bakugan battle.

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:42.928
Yeah!

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:48.534
[laughter]

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:55.307
Bakugan brawl!

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:01.346
After all that we lost anyway.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.182
Oh well...

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:05.751
Hey we're sorry if we caused you any trouble

00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:06.985
but I guess we really wanted to win and we thought Masquerade

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:09.121
could help us!

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:11.857
Ah don't sweat it, things get said in the heat of battle!

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.060
MARUCHO: And may I say your Bakugan skills are quite good.

00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:16.495
They're almost as good mine.

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:22.701
Mui!

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:23.936
I'm sorry for upsetting you earlier and I hope you meet up

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:25.370
with Makoto soon.

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:28.073
Me too... I'm sorry!

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:30.008
Aw thanks...

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.176
I know you two meant well and I really appreciate it.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.048
Kosuke and Takashi.. You're the best.

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:39.418
My goodness...

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:43.055
Don't forget about me!

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:44.957
[laughter]

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.592
PREYAS: What? Is it my breath?

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.660
....Come on, just one on the cheek!

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.462
Makoto..Take care...

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:52.130
I'll see you soon little brother.

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:54.666
[laughter]

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:11.617
You know I once heard about a guy that got lost in an airport

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.852
for a whole year.

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:15.420
I hope that doesn't happen to us.

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:18.257
DRAGO: Well if it does, it'll be your fault.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.758
Hey don't blame me!

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:21.493
Wow! That's cool!

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:23.428
I heard your Bakugan talking to you!

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:24.630
You're lucky!

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:30.569
Do you like playing Bakugan?

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:32.671
My sister's friends Takashi and Kosuke

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:33.872
taught me how to play the game!

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:35.741
You should see them play.

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:37.009
I bet they're two of the best Bakugan players

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.243
in the whole world.

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:39.645
Yeah...

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.380
Well if they're that good

00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:42.381
I wouldn't mind battling them sometime.

00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:44.550
Oh!

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.351
I forgot...I have to go meet up with my sister right now.

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:47.653
Your sister?

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.555
My sister's name is Mui

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:51.356
and she lives here in this city...

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.358
I asked my Dad if I could come visit and that's why I'm here.

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:55.060
Gotcha...

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:56.762
Well say \"hi\" to your sister for me..

00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:58.897
And tell Takashi and Kosuke to keep on battling!

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:01.366
Sure!

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.568
Goodbye!

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:07.673
RUNO: Ah-ha! There you are!

00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:10.475
Oh hi...

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:12.945
You mean you were battling the whole time!

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:14.580
What? You couldn't wait for me?

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:15.581
Thanks for nothing guys!

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:16.982
Don't blame us!

00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:18.216
It's your fault for getting lost.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.218
Don't fight you two...

00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:22.421
So...Sounds like you did all right without me...

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:23.722
Or did you have some help?

00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:24.856
Was it Alice?

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.226
Oh no...

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:28.493
Maybe now I should tell everyone

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:30.028
about my Grandfather Michael

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.697
and the strange dreams I've been having...

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.966
Guys there's something I want to talk to you about...

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:36.101
So Runo what was that you were saying about Masquerade?

00:20:36.134 --> 00:20:38.437
He was messing with Mui's emotions

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.671
just so he could take our Bakugans!

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:43.976
That dude has no class and he'll do anything

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:44.977
to get his own way!

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.813
Uh wait Dan...

00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:50.215
He's joined forces with that guy Michael...

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:52.317
They're planning to wipe out Drago's home world Vestroia

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:53.352
but we won't let that happen!

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.489
What's wrong?

00:20:57.522 --> 00:20:59.524
Uh?

00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:02.461
Oh...It's nothing Runo.

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:03.829
MARUCHO: I'm famished!

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:04.830
Let's go to Runo's house for tuna surprise!

00:21:04.863 --> 00:21:06.064
Who's in?

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:10.936
Coming up on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:12.371
Dan has Drago... Runo's got Tigrerra

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:14.506
and Marucho's got Preyas!

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:16.942
But look out, a new Bakugan has arrived!

00:21:16.975 --> 00:21:20.012
And even though Julie thinks all Bakugan are cute and cuddly

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:22.948
she's about to find out that they can have a real dark side.

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:26.051
When a boy named Billy shows up and challenges her,

00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:28.420
he brings with him a Bakugan with a real bite!

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:30.155
So get your rest 'cause you're gonna need it,

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:31.990
because you never know when or where a Bakugan brawl

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:34.159
will break out.

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:35.427
And make sure you don't miss the next exciting episode

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.895
of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
