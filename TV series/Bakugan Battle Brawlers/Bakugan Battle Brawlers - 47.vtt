00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.815
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"R Is For Revenge\".

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.189
[distant siren]

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.925
[screaming]

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.193
All right then...

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.427
there's gotta be at least a few good-lookin' guys

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.995
around here...

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.298
Then again... I could be wrong...

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.966
Get a hold of yourself Rabeeder...

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.202
you're here to get the Infinity Core.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.003
Everything else is just gonna have to wait.

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:47.040
[screaming]

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:49.843
Hey kid... You're goin' the wrong way!

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.846
So, that's Rabeeder....

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.650
Christopher!

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.622
I wonder if Tricloid is makin' out okay by herself?

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:05.158
I sure hope she's obeyin' Naga's orders.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.459
Get ready...

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.827
you're goin' down!

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.895
Huh...?

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:10.697
Come on - you're just a kid...

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.800
but I guess I better fight ya.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:15.768
I gotta take this way more seriously,

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.537
or else Naga'll have my head!

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.005
I'm with you Christopher!

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.507
Thanks so much Alice!

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.377
Where'd you go anyway...? You had me so worried....

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.812
I'm really sorry...

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:28.214
I promise I won't leave you again!

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:31.150
So are you two just gonna stand there or what...?

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.620
I guess my battle's started...

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:37.457
and not as Masquerade, but as me!

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.559
HYDRANOID: Okay, let's do this.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.628
I'm with you all the way, Alice!

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.796
That's great... Thank you Hydranoid.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.133
Let's knock her off that throne!

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.135
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:50.603
Juggernoid! Stand!

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.473
Hydranoid! Stand!

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:57.343
You ready to do this Hydranoid?

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.179
Oh YEAHHHHH!

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.682
We'll never let Naga have...

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.651
...The Infinity Core!

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:08.555
We no longer serve the likes of him !

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:12.258
So you're the Bakugan I heard about...

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.260
that dared to turn his back on Naga?

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.828
You sure you picked the right side there,

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.030
buddy-boys...?

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.998
Enhancement!

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.738
Hey Alice - are you okay?

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:26.873
Yes I am...

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.341
thanks Christopher.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.109
Back to work Juggernoid!

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.244
Gotcha!

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:35.548
Ability Card! Activate! Depth Tornado!

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:38.718
Say what...?

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:42.722
All right!

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.658
Our turn Alice!

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.061
Right... Ability Card Activate!

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:49.729
Lash and Blast Extreme!

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.571
I'm guessin' this isn't a hug...

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.977
[screaming]

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.312
She's lookin' for love in all the wrong places...

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:07.313
Oh well...

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:08.715
y' can't win 'em all...

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.950
Wow, you're unbelievable Christopher...

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.619
You've become so strong!

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:13.686
I guess...

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.356
My ranking as a Battler's gone up quite a bit...

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.758
and It's all thanks to you, Alice.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.159
Why you...!

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:22.095
She doesn't look too happy...

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.672
Poseidon Tornado!

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:36.209
Aquos Quadruple Chain Attack!

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:37.577
Blue Lagoon!

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.045
Power Gate!

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:48.021
TAYGHEN: That's... not... possible!

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:52.592
[screaming]

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.630
Good - byeeee...

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.766
You're not getting' away that easily...

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.167
Sinister Smash!

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.673
Yoweeeeeeee!

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:08.508
Hey Gorem - try this!

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.876
Grand Impact!

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.644
Now this is gonna hurt me ...

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:14.580
A lot more than it hurts you !

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.786
Somehow I find that hard to believe...

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.524
KATO: Come in Master Dan...

00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:25.725
can you hear me?

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:26.859
I hear you.

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:28.594
Master Marucho has beaten Tayghen,

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:31.130
and Miss Julie has defeated Tricloid.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.198
Su-weet!

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.434
That's the best news I've heard all day!

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.603
Miss Alice is battling Rabeeder as we speak...

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.272
And unfortunately....

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:43.342
...Hairadee, Druman and Centorrior are approaching

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:45.812
Wardington rather quickly.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.380
Please be careful Daniel!

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:48.815
Give 'em what for son!

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:50.983
So that's two down...

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.652
and four to go....

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.520
We've still got a lot of work to do.

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:57.924
But don't you worry - we'll beat them all.

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.058
Yeah, that's right!

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:01.994
We'll never let those guys get the Infinity Core!

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.563
Isn't that right, Drago?

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:06.132
Huh? Drago?

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:13.606
WAVERN: I fear that my brother Naga will find me.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.877
He will take the Infinity Core and then do away with me ...

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:23.750
It doesn't matter to him that I am his twin sister...

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:27.253
Yes... I'm afraid that would not deter him.

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:32.325
I also fear that I lack the strength to battle my brother.

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:35.595
Every time the Infinity Core inside me

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:37.964
emits some of its positive energy...

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:43.336
my own life energy is drained away....

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.071
Please don't worry.

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:46.606
You leave Naga to us.

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.041
We won't let him touch you.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.011
Thank you...

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:53.646
But listen...

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:54.781
Hm?

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:57.917
If it looks like Naga can't be stopped...

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.019
like he is going to get to me...

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.420
then Drago...

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.890
I want you to do it before he does.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.024
Do what ?

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:08.161
I want you to process the Infinity Core

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.163
before my evil brother has the chance.

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:11.697
Don't be foolish!

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:13.533
But... It's impossible!

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:14.801
Ridiculous!

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.669
How could you even ask that...

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:17.870
Drago.

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:21.207
I ask because it is you .

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.441
Bad news...

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.011
Hairadee has been sighted above Wardington city.

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:26.813
Obviously, Centorrior and Druman

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:28.948
cannot be very far behind. Yes.

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.750
Right... let me go after Hairadee.

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.084
Sounds like a plan to me...

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.252
kick it!

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:38.524
Okay, let's do this up right...

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.193
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:42.028
Skyress Stand!

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:45.064
Yeah!

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.770
C'mon Dan - we should go too!

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:53.539
Yeah... but I gotta find Drago first.

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.374
Right here my friend.

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:57.276
Where the heck did you go?

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.845
Sorry.

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.214
Wavern... I can only promise this:

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:03.216
I will protect you from Naga.

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.585
Nothing more... nothing less!

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:07.453
Let's rock!

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:09.956
Drago...

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:21.067
[screaming]

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:27.673
Ability Card Activate...

00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:30.076
Blinding Spice!

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:35.381
What? This smells like oregano ...

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:36.816
Christopher! We're up!

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.384
Ability Card Activate...

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:39.886
Super Shard!

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:44.857
Did it work?

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.325
Not quite...

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.161
Diamond Reflect!

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.563
Oh no...

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:52.031
she blocked our attack!

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:53.099
My turn...

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:54.834
Gate Card Set!

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:58.671
Bring it on!

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.873
KATO: Sorry to bother you, Miss...

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:02.508
Yes? What is it?

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:05.011
Shall I have Master Marucho and Miss Julie come around

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:06.746
to help you out a little?

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:08.881
Master Marucho has defeated Tayghen and Miss Julie

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:11.450
has defeated Tricloid.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.519
No thanks, I'll be okay...

00:09:13.552 --> 00:09:15.955
I'd much rather have them protect Wavern.

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:17.857
Roger that... over.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.492
Hey !

00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:21.160
What did he just say to you?

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:22.194
Uh...

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:25.064
Did he say they defeated Tricloid ?

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.365
Well... kinda...

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.135
It can't be...

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:31.337
My poor little... Tricloid...

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.773
[sobbing]

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:35.241
I'll get you for that!

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:37.576
I'll make you all pay with your lives!

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.080
Juggernoid! Are you okay?

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:44.917
Gate Card Open!

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.191
Darkus Destroyer!

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.533
What is this...?

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:02.301
My strength is failing!

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:06.072
Well...

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:07.473
I thought I might shed a little light on things

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:08.841
around here...

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.810
And light counteracts your Darkus powers...

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:14.380
All that's left is to turn you to stone!

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:16.349
Petrify!

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:17.850
Hydranoid!

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.223
You shut down my Darkus powers...

00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:25.925
with your Haos powers...

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.527
...and now you're turning me into a statue?

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.963
[laughter]

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:32.398
You're next in line...

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.599
so get ready!

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:36.902
How can I protect Juggernoid?

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.704
VOICE: Use Dive Mirage!

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:39.772
That's right ...

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:41.507
Ability Card Activate!

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.809
Dive Mirage!

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:45.144
Ha HAA !

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:48.014
That saved him!

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.148
Hey...

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:50.850
Who said that anyway ...?

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:56.622
It looks like I got here just in the nick of time...

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.491
But... how did you...

00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:00.626
Who are you? Tell me!

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.961
My name is...

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:05.264
Klaus Von Herzen!

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:07.800
Stay tuned for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:13.205
And now, more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:14.874
Klaus it's you !

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:16.642
I'm glad you're okay...

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.477
Alice.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.613
I hadn't planned on helping you battle

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.248
until I won against you myself...

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:23.516
but what with the Earth in danger,

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:26.018
I figured I could put aside my own concerns.

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:27.887
It is time...

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.955
for the world's finest Battlers to come together

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:31.590
and combine forces.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:34.260
\"Klaus Von Herzen\" ... hey, wait a sec...

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:36.128
you mean the \"Klaus Von Herzen\"...

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:38.397
The world's top-ranked Aquos Brawler...

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.965
someone pinch me... !

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:41.801
So I gather from your knowledge that you're

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:43.502
an Aquos Brawler too...

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.071
That's very commendable.

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:46.739
And now I will show you...

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:49.742
how to engage in the perfect Aquos battle.

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:52.578
You see, it's all in the wrist !

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:57.349
Humph...

00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:00.219
I gotta admit, you're actually pretty cute...

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:02.955
Any other time and I'd be all over your action...

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:06.492
but unfortunately, I'm not in a good mood right now...

00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:08.327
Time for revenge...

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.763
for what you did to my poor sister Tricloid!

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:13.199
I am going to destroy each and every one of you!

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:16.669
Maybe you should take a sec and look down...

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.038
Ability Card Activate.

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.372
Deep Sea Dive!

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.608
Don't wanna get wet - don't wanna get wet -

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:25.277
I hope you brought a change of clothes...

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:29.215
[laughter]

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:33.219
I can't resist being pulled deeper!

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:34.420
Let me go !

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:35.855
I'm gonna drown!

00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:37.189
It's okay - don't worry...

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.958
This water isn't actually real...

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:40.693
It's just an illusion created

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:42.728
by the \"Deep Sea Dive\" Ability Card.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:43.762
Oh wow!

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.297
It's like I can breathe underwater!

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.032
I'll get you out of this.

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:48.033
Hang in there.

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:50.169
It's not like I have much choice.

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:51.937
Now go! Right!

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:55.608
Alice, you should go too.

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:58.043
Is that kid okay on his own?

00:12:58.077 --> 00:13:00.079
Oh yeah, Christopher will be just fine!

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:01.614
More importantly...

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:03.883
we have to do something about getting you free.

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:06.118
But what ...

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:11.957
Gate Card Open!

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:13.025
Accelerate!

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:22.501
Hey! I only have Haos and Subterra powers!

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:24.803
Dontcha think this is a bit unfair ?

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:26.772
Forcing one's opponent into a situation

00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:28.507
which is to one's own advantage...

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.543
and using the field's characteristics to increase

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:32.144
one's chance of winning...

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:34.747
These tactics are just common sense...

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.016
any good Battler can tell you that.

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:39.151
Christopher... why don't you do the honors?

00:13:39.185 --> 00:13:41.253
My pleasure - You ready Juggernoid?

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:43.155
Ready and willing...

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:44.990
Water Slap!

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:50.462
Oh my... This can't be good...

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.164
Ability Counter!

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:55.434
That's better...

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:56.936
but my hair's a dis aster ...

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:58.037
Oh no !

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.405
She got out somehow!

00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:01.941
So I see you managed to counter my \"Deep Sea Dive\" Ability...

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:06.779
Let's see how you deal with this !

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:08.614
Gate Card Open!

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:11.016
Aquamerge!

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.085
That changes every Bakugan's attributes

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:15.020
except for Subterra into Aquos!

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:20.226
No!

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:21.961
I see you really do have a lot to learn...

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.395
Lesson two:

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.364
If your Field Card has been beaten...

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:28.300
make your opponent's attributes the same as your own.

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:29.602
Sirenoid!

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:31.403
Coming right up...

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:32.705
Wave Blast!

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:37.877
[scream]

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.944
Christopher...

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:40.980
Why not deliver the coup de gras?

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:42.815
Do your thing Juggernoid!

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:45.050
Depth Tornado!

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:50.623
We did it!

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:52.758
Don't speak too soon there, girly!

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.493
She survived ?

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:56.295
Oh, I've still got a thing or two up my sleeve -

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:58.564
like maybe even a Subterra ability !

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:01.300
I'll chew you up and spit you out like a bad burrito!

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:04.503
I'll avenge Tricloid if it's the last thing I do...

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:08.340
...and then after that I'll avenge her again !

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.442
Terracrunch!

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:14.847
[screaming]

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.315
Sirenoid!

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:17.883
Juggernoid!

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:20.719
If only I could move!

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.821
It's no use Sirenoid - come back!

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.623
You too Juggernoid - and hurry!

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:30.829
SIRENOID: Please accept our deepest apologies....

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:33.499
JUGGERNOID: ...We've failed you...

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:34.700
No way...

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:36.335
You two did your very best.

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:37.536
And so did...

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:39.271
Poor Hydranoid.

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.840
Oh no... Hydranoid...

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.709
A Bakugan who can only move his head isn't gonna be

00:15:43.742 --> 00:15:46.278
a whole lotta use, now is he...

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:48.614
I have three heads.

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:51.016
Oh, so then ya figure there's strength in numbers?

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.252
Then try this on for size!

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:02.061
[loud laughter]

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:03.862
It's hopeless...

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:06.532
What am I supposed to do now ?

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:09.068
Shall I have Master Marucho and Miss Julie come around

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:10.869
to help you out a little?

00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:12.771
No thanks, I'll be okay...

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.474
I'd much rather have them protect Wavern.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:16.508
I was wrong...

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:18.110
I should've asked them to help me.

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:21.046
Why didn't I ask for help when I had the chance?

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.382
Now Hydranoid's in trouble and it's too late!

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:25.417
Get hold of yourself... calm down!

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:26.585
Oh, wots da madder...

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:28.721
is somwun feewing outnumbered...?

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:31.256
[laughter]

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.125
It's... no use...

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:36.161
We can't win all by ourselves...

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:37.496
Snap out of it Alice!

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:39.298
Just listen to yourself!

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.433
It doesn't matter how many opponents there are -

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:42.935
if you believe in yourself!

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:44.837
\"...Believe in myself\"... ?

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.739
The most important thing to a Battler...

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:50.843
...is to believe in yourself and to believe in your Bakugan!

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:53.412
The most important thing in a battle...

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:56.081
isn't skill or knowledge...

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:57.850
What matters is belief and trust...

00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:00.686
how much you believe in and trust your Bakugan.

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:03.088
\"What matters is belief and trust ... \"

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.289
I see now...

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:07.726
Believe in yourself, and have faith in your Bakugan...

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.827
You're right...

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.129
just have faith ...

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:14.600
Christopher... thank you!

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:15.701
Enough talk...

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:18.270
It's time for revenge !

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:21.440
Sorry Hydranoid...

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:22.808
I believe in myself...

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:25.677
and I believe in you too, so don't you ever forget it okay?

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:27.913
Thank you Alice...

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:29.415
that means a lot to me.

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:33.352
Together we can not be stopped!

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:36.422
Ability Card Activate!

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:37.990
Trident Of Doom!

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:44.763
Oooooo... So close...

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:46.865
...yet so far.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:47.933
Pathetic...

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:50.135
you couldn't hit a duck in a water bucket!

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:52.004
Feeling a little stiff , are ya?

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:55.174
[laughter]

00:17:56.642 --> 00:17:58.043
Hang on...

00:17:58.076 --> 00:17:59.511
This isn't supposed to happen...

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:03.515
He's gonna get every last one of... ...us...

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:10.756
Unbelievable!

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:12.958
That's quite a technique...!

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:18.997
Ow... I broke a nail.

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:24.636
As long as I have a puff of breath left in my body...

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.506
I can still Brawl circles around you .

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:29.374
You've underestimated me!

00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:33.178
So... I guess this is it...

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:34.179
All I ask...

00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:36.315
is that you do it quickly.

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:38.484
Couldn't be quick enough for me !

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:39.852
Don't do it!

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:41.053
What?

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:42.588
What are you waiting for?

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:45.491
Masquerade wouldn't have hesitated for a second!

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:49.328
Rabeeder is just doing what Naga has commanded her to do

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:50.796
so ease up, okay?

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:52.331
Listen to me...

00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:54.700
Please promise that you'll stop obeying Naga

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:56.835
and won't try to take the Infinity Core!

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.337
You gotta be kidding...

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.906
You take away Tricloid and then have the nerve to ask me this ?

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.745
[laughing]

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:07.946
Tricloid...?

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.981
Huh...?

00:19:09.014 --> 00:19:10.115
Yippee!

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:12.618
My sister, it's you!

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:15.521
Y-you're alive !

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:16.822
Yuppers!

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.957
Julie saved Tricloid!

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.527
I never thought I'd ever see you again...

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.363
I never thought I'd ever see you again either ...

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.231
[loud sobbing]

00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:27.533
I don't know...

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:30.035
I think I'm getting a cavity...

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:32.004
Let's never be apart again, okay?

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:33.405
Never !

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:34.640
Please listen!

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:36.909
You have to stop being Naga's minions...

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:38.844
I think...

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:41.346
You should go back to your home in Vestroia!

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:44.650
Tell me Tricloid -

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:46.084
what do you wanna do?

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:48.287
I wanna go home with you, Rabeeder...

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.721
Sounds good...

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:50.989
let's go home!

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.658
I'm just so happy to have Tricloid back,

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:54.693
that all the fight's gone outta me...

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:55.894
Awww...

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:57.462
you say the sweetest things...

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:58.964
I guess...

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.999
this makes me a traitor too .

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.235
Yes... Welcome aboard.

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:05.938
Now that that's decided, I think we better get going...

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:07.973
Naga's not gonna be a happy camper

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:10.042
when he finds out about this .

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:11.577
See ya! Toodles!

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:18.550
Wow, they're going back home...

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:19.618
That's right...

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.553
They'll be happy together in Vestroia.

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:24.690
Well that was an interesting way to battle.

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:25.724
Huh... ?

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:27.426
It wasn't the way...

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:29.394
Masquerade would have done things...

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:30.562
Instead...

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:32.764
it was your own way....

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:35.367
I think I've learned something here.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.902
I'm glad.

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:38.670
[clatter] Huh?

00:20:43.108 --> 00:20:45.177
Grandfather? Hang on!

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.112
Grandfather!

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:52.117
Please wait!

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:57.623
Is that you?

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:09.935
The next opponent we have to face is Heriday.

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:13.205
He's no ordinary Bakugan 'cause he has both Aquos

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:15.374
and Ventus attributes!

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:17.709
We thought we'd taken care of him back in Vestroia,

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.711
but apparently, we were wrong.

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:22.147
I made a grave error, and so have been captured.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.982
Heriday uses his surprise attack,

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.951
and I'm trapped like a bird in a cage!

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:27.953
Even so, I still have my fighting spirit

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.655
and my wits about me.

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:31.590
I know you'll come and rescue me, Shun.

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:33.158
This battle isn't over yet!

00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:34.760
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:35.894
See you there!
