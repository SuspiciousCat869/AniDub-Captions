WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:21.448
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"The Final Brawl!\"

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.186
DAN: It didn't take long for Naga to send his Bakugan

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.721
to Wardington to try and steal the Infinity Core

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.591
from Wavern so he can control the universe!

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:35.929
But what that freak Naga doesn't realize

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:39.065
is that the Brawlers aren't going down without a fight!

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.533
You see, kids we fought against in the past

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.602
have signed up to help send Naga and his crew

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.237
back to their world.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.039
I know it's not going to be easy, but right now,

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.674
we don't have a choice.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.442
If Naga snags the Infinity Core...

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:53.980
you can kiss the world as we know it sayonara for good!

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.150
But before we can get to Naga,

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:00.119
we had to take care of Centorrior and Druman first!

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.355
Or at least that's what we thought!

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:06.559
Guys, look!

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:07.861
It's Naga!

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:09.629
No way! Now what, Dan?

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:12.765
DAN: Man, how stupid!

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.434
Chasing Centorrior and Druman

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.702
was all just a diversion!

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:18.004
Naga wanted us out of the way so he could go after

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.806
Wavern himself!

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.075
And if that creep gets to Wavern...

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.477
then we lose and the Infinity Core is his!

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:35.188
[\u266a]

[grumbling]

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.602
Vortex Dark Flame!

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.672
Brace yourself, Julie!

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.045
[screaming]

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.152
Julie! No!

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.691
It's my turn!

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.259
Feather Storm!

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.164
How pathetic, Sirenoid!

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:21.234
Forcing Wind!

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.402
What?

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.575
Right Gigante!

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.414
[groaning]

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.485
Yesss!

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.486
[laughter]

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.555
This is far from over...

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.824
In fact, we're just getting...

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.192
warmed up!

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:50.830
[laughter]

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:51.998
Impossible!

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:53.266
Nothing works!

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.400
I Hate to tell ya...

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:55.768
but if we don't get to Wavern,

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.136
we're all done for, kid!

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.938
I guess we'll just have to hope Shun can get it done

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.473
by himself!

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:01.975
Say what?

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:03.343
I thought you knew?

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.044
Shun took off while you were battling

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.813
to protect Wavern from Naga.

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.748
Shun must have realized this was all a rouse

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.350
to give Naga time...

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.318
Now I'm worried!

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:13.987
Man...

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.222
You be careful...

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:17.857
Shun...

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.532

Phase of Rage!

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:48.021
I, Fourtress, will scorch any enemy who dares

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:50.990
challenge me with my awesome rage!

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.966
Darkus Riot!

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.437
Hey! Back off!

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.039

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.611
Go ahead, give me your best shot, Naga!

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.614
No matter what you throw at me, I will survive!

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:17.517
I am Fourtress and my Phase of Grief Ability

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.252
is impenetrable!

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:20.887
I hate drama!

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:30.196
Fourtress...

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.631
Naga!

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:32.865
No!

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:34.100
This madness has to stop!

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:36.069
I'm the one you want!

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:39.005
So you're finally ready to concede defeat!

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:40.073
No Joe!

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:42.175
Don't let Wavern get involved in this fight!

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.476
Quick!

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:44.977
Call her back inside her ball!

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.713
I'm trying, it's not working!

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.381
Naga's sent out a signal

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:50.083
to the Infinity Core inside Wavern!

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:51.684
And that signal is blocking all the commands

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.319
from my Baku-Pod!

00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:54.921
What do we do? I don't know!

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:57.523
[evil laughter]

00:05:57.557 --> 00:06:00.359
Soon, Naga will possess the Infinity Core.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:04.297
Now to sit back and enjoy the show!

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.506
We're trapped inside the battlefield

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.341
that Centorrior created!

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:16.976
We can't get to Naga!

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.213
Then it's time to take Centorrior down!

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:21.848
Let's do this, boys!

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.551
No one gets past me! Huh?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.654
Okay, tough guy!

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:30.323
Here's a boot to the head!

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.263
[screaming]

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.270
Alright Drago, Centorrior's all yours!

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:45.805
I'm on it, Preyas.

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:46.873
Are you ready, Dan?

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:51.010
Yeah! Ability Activate!

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.313
Dragonic Ogre!

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:58.718
[roaring]

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.721
Diablo's Shield!

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:07.894
No! No, this isn't over!

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.029
You can't defeat me, Drago!

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:12.265
Ultimate Dragon!

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:14.767
Exceed!

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.673
[screaming]

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.311
Alright! The force field's gone!

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:28.581
Centorrior! No!

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:31.350
Ah...You fools will pay for what you've done!

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:33.119
Vortex Dark Flame!

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.322
Noo!

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:37.657
Look out, Harpus!

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.893
[screaming]

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.395
Ah! Harpus!

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:43.596
Sirenoid!

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.600
[screaming]

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.337
Drago!

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.139
You must go help Wavern now!

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:54.507
Dan you too!

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.842
You're our last hope!

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.243
Alright!

00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.712
Hold on!

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:06.018
We're coming, Wavern!

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.457
Oh no!

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.459
Wa-vernnnn!

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:14.827
No more, Naga...

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.662
please...

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.099
It's too late for that!

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:22.001
Listen very carefully, dear sister!

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:23.636
The only way for the Infinity Core

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.538
and the Silent to come together

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:28.407
is if you willingly surrender it to me...

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:31.377
And once they've merged, that you will be destroyed

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:35.414
and I shall become supreme ruler of the universe!

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:37.416
This is my destiny, Wavern!

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.418
You have no choice.

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:42.822
Those Bakugan who choose to serve me will survive

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:46.859
and those who don't will be eliminated!

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:48.828
But you will be alone, Naga!

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.531
I don't know of any Bakugan who would serve you!

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.499
You will be eternally lonely

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:56.102
and there is no fate worse than that, my brother!

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:59.438
If that is your destiny, then I pity you!

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.474
I don't need your pity, Wavern!

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:03.109
But I will offer you this.

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:06.212
If dare join me, your life will be spared.

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:10.850
Then you will help me rule the cosmos beyond the end of time!

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:13.319
That's never going to happen, Naga!

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:15.721
I would never surrender my morals

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.623
to join the Dark Side!

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.126
Very well, dear sister,

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.461
now I must answer the call of fate!

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:24.630
Give me the Infinity Core!

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:26.465
Naga! Noo!

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.367
Unhand her!

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.136
Drago!

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:33.172
This doesn't concern you!

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:37.510
Destroy Force Down!

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:44.884
What's going on?

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:46.786
I can't move!

00:09:46.819 --> 00:09:48.020
Tigrerra!

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:49.288
Ha ha ha!

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:53.259
I hope you fools like pain because I can do this all day!

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:55.528
[screaming]

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:58.064
Ability Activate!

00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.899
Haos Freeze Attack!

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:06.272
What the?

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:07.974
Now's our chance, Tigrerra!

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:09.809
Velocity Fang!

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.790
Good will always defeat evil...

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:27.860
More Bakugan Battle Brawlers after these messages!

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.965
Now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:38.871
Alice, can you hear me?

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:40.639
Hey Shun, are you okay?

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:42.808
Yeah I... think so...

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:45.411
DAN: Are you ready, Drago?

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:46.479
Yes!

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:48.547
Ultimate Dragon!

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:50.082
Exceed Now!

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:05.164
How did he survive that?

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:08.134
Oh please, is that all you've got?

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.302
I believe now it's my turn!

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:13.239
Bottom Zero!

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:14.340
[screaming]

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:15.408
Drago!

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.245
Dan!

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.314
[screaming]

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:27.319
[roaring]

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.488
That should take care of those two.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.991
Now, hand over the Infinity Core!

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:33.392
DRAGO: Wavern! Don't!

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:35.227
[roaring]

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:36.462
Huh?

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:37.696
Drago!

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.932
No, the battle is lost...

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:41.434
Please, you must go!

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:42.601
Now!

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:43.803
It's not over, Wavern!

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:46.072
There is only one way to prevent Naga

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:48.374
from getting the Infinity Core...

00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:49.675
No Wavern!

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.310
I won't hear of it!

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:53.546
The only way we can save the universe

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:55.915
is for you to destroy me, Drago...

00:11:55.948 --> 00:11:57.983
Then Naga will never have the chance to unite

00:11:58.017 --> 00:12:00.519
the Infinity Core with the Silent Core...

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.921
I could never...

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:05.491
We have no choice, Drago!

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:07.993
Give me the Infinity Core!

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:09.428
Silent Down!

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.930
Ultimate Dragon!

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:13.933
You fool!

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:16.802
Haven't you learned your attacks are useless?

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:17.903
What?

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:19.305
[gasping]

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:22.775
[screaming]

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:24.243
Nooooooo!

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.853
Wavernnnnn!

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:36.689
Don't blame Drago, Joe...

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:38.224
I asked him to...

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:39.992
We didn't have a choice...

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.594
But why?

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:44.330
This is good-bye, Joe...

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:45.865
No...

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:47.833
Wavernnnnnn!

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:53.639
[\u266a]

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:55.574
WAVERN: Here, Drago,

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.844
the Infinity Core is now yours.

00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:08.854
And I will do everything in my power

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.656
to protect it, Wavern...

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:15.261
Thank you, Drago...

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:18.097
Until we meet again, my dear...

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.368
Wavernnnnnn!

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.472
I'll miss you, Wavern,

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:29.341
but I'll never FORGET YOUUUU!

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.179
It's okay, Joe...

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.814
See ya...

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:36.916
[growling]

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:39.118
How dare you, Drago!

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.220
The Infinity Core would have been mine by now

00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:44.089
if it wasn't for you!

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:45.591
Enough, Naga!

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:48.127
Never in a million years will I ever forgive you

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.196
for what you've done!

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:52.865
[roar]

00:13:52.898 --> 00:14:02.942
[\u266a]

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:12.585
[\u266a]

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:16.155
Wow! Check it out!

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:19.191
Looks like Drago's merged with the Infinity Core!

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.426
And become...

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:22.194
the Ultimate Bakugan!

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:24.263
Now he's Infinity Drago!

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:27.233
Nicely played, my friend...

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:30.402
Now it's the Infinity Core against the Silent Core

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:32.972
in the Ultimate battle where the prize is...

00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:35.341
control of the universe!

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:36.508
And I shall be...

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.210
VICTORIOUSSSS!

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:40.279
If you think you can defeat me,

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:43.382
you're an even bigger fool than I thought!

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:48.387
[\u266a]

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.689
This is insane!

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.458
Drago!

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:54.493
Dan, what'd ya think your doing?

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:08.974
Dan!

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:11.844
Drago!

00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:14.313
Dan, please! Let me take care of Naga!

00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:16.482
Hey, don't just blow me off, Drago...

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:19.585
Remember, we're a team and we always battle together!

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:22.521
But this time may be different....

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:24.256
Oh, come on, Drago,

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.558
let the little whipper-snapper get in on the fun.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.494
But just make sure he knows the rules...

00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:30.663
Are you in or are you out?

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.197
Quick stallin', let's play!

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:34.400
ALL: Bakugan... Brawl!

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:44.476
[\u266a]

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:51.817
[\u266a]

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.019
I've never seen a battle like this!

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:56.188
And chances are you never will ever again!

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:00.659
BAKUPOD: Ultimate Battle engaged.

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:02.061
Opposing powers at equal strength...

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:04.229
1000 G's.

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:07.566
It won't be long before I owe the universe, Drago!

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:09.668
Bottom Zero!

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.605
Power decrease of 300 G's.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.541
Ah Snap! Drago's losing power!

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:17.509
Don't worry about me, Dan!

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:19.578
Flame Striver!

00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:24.983
But that Dragonoid should be down for the count!

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:26.185
Hang in there...

00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:27.453
you can do this...

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:30.255
Light Attributed means that was a Haos Ability...

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.256
That's it!

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.624
Now that you're an Ultimate Bakugan,

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:35.060
you can use other Abilities like Pyrus!

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:36.261
You're right, Dan!

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:39.231
An Ultimate Bakugan has no Ability limits!

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:41.033
Dive Fleet!

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:46.638
Surprise!

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.240
Holy cow!

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:49.842
Now he's using an Aquos Ability!

00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:52.945
Ahhh!

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:54.713
There is too much at stake to be playing

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:57.049
your annoying little game, Drago!

00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:59.952
Darkus Riot!

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.086
Heads up!

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.554
Gate Card Open!

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:04.056
Wall Rock!

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.657
This battle's mine!

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.493
Fire Grandam!

00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:18.203
Alright!

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:20.939
That last blast from Drago was a Subterra Ability!

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:26.779
Aero Dragon!

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:29.348
Amazing!

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:31.583
Now Drago's shifted to a Darkus Ultimate Ability!

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:34.820
Sai-Curious Shield!

00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:38.123
[roaring]

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:50.936
You must pay for what you have done, Naga!

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:56.208
I've never seen anything like this ever!

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:59.044
An entire city is floating in mid-air!

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.346
And bizarre creatures from somewhere are locked

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.482
in what looks like a battle!

00:18:03.515 --> 00:18:04.516
[gasps]

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:18.163
Right now we're flying in for a better look!

00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:19.398
Wait a minute!

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:21.867
It looks like some kind of 'goblin' creature!

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.102
And a young kid!

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:25.437
That's Dan!

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.909
Why are you doing this, Drago?

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:34.313
Join me and together, we can rule the universe!

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:37.416
I want nothing to do with the likes of you, Naga!

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:39.351
Besides, it's payback time for what you did

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:41.386
to your sister Wavern!

00:18:45.023 --> 00:18:47.593
You must be destroyed, Naga!

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:50.129
You're blaming me for what happened to Wavern?

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:51.363
You fool!

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:53.899
You're the one who sent her back to Vestroia!

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.300
Because of you!

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:57.136
Burning Dragonia!

00:18:57.169 --> 00:19:02.841
[screams]

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:05.911
That oughta show 'em, Drago!

00:19:05.944 --> 00:19:06.912
What the?

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:09.248
I've got to revive Naga and quick!

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.519
Paladin Appear!

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:14.820
Bakugan Brawl!

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:18.724
Paladin Army Stand!

[growling]

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:33.839
Huh?

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:35.440
Whoa! We're hooped!

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:38.243
HAL G: Say hello to Naga's personal Royal Guard...

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:39.878
the Fifth Paladin!

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:41.113
Incredible!

00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:42.548
No fair, Hal-G!

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:45.317
This brawl was supposed to be a one on one battle!

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.653
Don't be such a fool, boy!

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:50.556
Since when has anything in life been fair?

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:52.291
There is only one rule...

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:54.393
and that's to win at any cost!

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:55.460
Naga!

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:57.829
[laughs]

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:01.099
Our time is now, my minions!

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:09.241
Ability...

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:11.643
Activate!

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:13.145
Melting Burst!

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:19.484
Burning Dragonia!

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:26.358
[\u266a]

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:27.726
What?

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:37.803
[\u266a]

00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:47.446
[\u266a]

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:56.888
Drago!

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.529
Draaaggggoooooo!

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:11.069
DAN: It's down to the final fight

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.472
on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:15.741
It begins with Drago down for the count

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:17.309
and there's a good chance

00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:19.044
we won't be able to save the universe

00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:20.579
from that freak Naga.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.314
But the Brawlers come through!

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:25.117
And man, that's when the battle really heats up.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.419
We've only got one chance to keep the Infinity Core

00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:29.187
out of the hands of the Dark Side

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:32.024
and you'll have to watch to see how the battle ends!

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:36.028
That's all on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:37.262
Later...
