WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.307
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.842
when all these random cards

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.144
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.046
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.649
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.184
That's when we realized

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.787
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.921
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.157
from another world!

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.459
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.228
Runo...

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.530
Marucho...

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.900
Julie...

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.369
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.738
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.607
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.008
Bakugan!

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.448
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.653
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:54.654
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.756
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.857
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.859
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.094
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.196
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.200
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.437
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.972
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.007
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.681
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Duel in the Desert!\"

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.551
JULIE: Where are they?

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.019
Where are they?

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:28.054
What is keeping them?

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.423
You're late!

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.792
Oh, you guys are like in sooo much trouble!

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:33.893
They're here...

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.597
It's about time!

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.334
Whoa...!

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.608
Whoa! We finally made it!

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.477
So we have, Daniel.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.511
JULIE: Hey you guys!

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:52.979
Huh!

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.814
You don't know how glad I am to see you!

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:55.949
Welcome to...

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.617
the Bakugan Valley!

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.751
It's where I call home!

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.653
Gee, thanks...

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:01.955
That's enough, Julie!

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.456
Nice to see you too, Julie...

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.825
I smell cat fight...

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.160
I'm so glad you all could make it to my humble

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.828
corner of the world...

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.964
Especially you Dan!

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:11.998
It's so nice to meet you in the flesh!

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.170
PREYAS: She's gonna blow!

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.105
Listen up...

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.807
Our mission is to find where the Infinity Core is!

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.808
So...

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:22.942
Ready guys?

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.177
ALL: Yeah!

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.445
DAN: Let's do it!

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.047
Man...

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.883
This place is gi-normous!

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.284
And kinda creepy!

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.952
It's like it's almost alive!

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.954
This is where the Infinity Core lies.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.223
What we seek, Daniel.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.925
It's down there somewhere...

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.126
Right... Julie?

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.161
Yes!

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.864
And then, maybe we can get some alone time...

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.366
I've been waiting for this forever, Dan!

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.400
Isn't that right, Gorem?

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.804
Hey, something just rolled under my foot!

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.173
Oh, that's just my Bakugan Gorem.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.341
Hello.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:56.876
Hi...

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.211
Oh Gorem...

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.345
stop being...

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.981
such a little stinker...

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.183
Isn't he the cutest Bukugan ever?

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.652
And...

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.954
he's mine...

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.423
GOREM: I'm not overly comfortable with this situation, Julie...

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.358
My name is Gorem...

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.194
Hi... Go-rem...

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:17.263
JULIE: This is the Bakugan Valley,

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.265
but I guess you guys already knew that?

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.834
Anyway, the Infinity Core is here somewhere,

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.337
but I don't have a clue where it is!

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.206
Let's just hope we're goin' the right way.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.876
The last thing I need is to get lost down here...

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.612
Hey, wait just one minute...

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.147
I think we should try this way, gang...

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.648
Oh great...

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.317
Einstein thinks she knows...

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.218
Hang on a sec, are you jealous, Runo?

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.520
Don't you dare flatter yourself!

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:41.921
Hey...

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.489
you better back off sister

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:44.524
if you know what's good for you...

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.225
He's mine, you got that?

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.794
Don't tell me what isn't mine!

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:49.429
You-you big flirt!

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.631
Oh! I'm a flirt? I am so not a flirt!

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.900
Oh, and by the way...

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.568
nice hair!

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.303
Whatever!

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:01.674
And let's face it, we're lost!

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.476
We need to get out of here!

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.478
BATS!

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.448
[screaming]

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:12.418
[screaming]

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:23.663
[screaming]

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:28.301
Wow!

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:30.169
This is amazing!

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:31.771
The lighting is perfect for make-up!

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.840
This is the place...

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.408
Drago!

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.576
[children gasping]

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.121
W-What's happening?

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.489
No clue!

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:51.524
This is too freaky!

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.726
Calm down, there's got to be a simple explanation...

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.395
Is this?

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:56.462
DRAGO: Yes...

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.097
Our dimension!

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.265
You sure?

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.172
Now what?

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:07.173
TIGRERRA: This is Haos...

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:08.675
where I was born.

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:09.709
But it's...

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.511
changed...

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.746
Where are we?

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.915
PREYAS: Welcome to Aqua-town...

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:18.318
But who re-arranged the furniture?

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:21.587
Gorem... what's going on here?

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:24.057
GOREM: Our world is morphing into evil...

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:32.432
Bizarre!

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.534
SKYRESS: Don't worry, Shun, you're safe.

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:37.470
We do not exist in this dimension...

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.372
We are merely observers here.

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:45.645
DAN: Okay Drago, fill me in on what's happening...

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:47.547
Our two worlds are colliding with each other

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.816
causing Vestroia to collapse.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.884
For real?

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:52.985
It's all because that creep Naga, isn't it?

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:56.122
Ah!!

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:00.693
Could someone... explain?

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:01.894
No kiddin'!

00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:03.463
Yeah...

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:04.797
I must admit, I'm totally stymied!

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:05.832
Vestroia!

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.104
DAN: Run!

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:13.139
This place is caving in!

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:14.707
C'mon guys, hurry!

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:17.810
[screaming]

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:19.479
ALICE: Get me out of here!

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:24.450
[screaming]

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:26.486
MARUCHO: That was too close for comfort!

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.321
DAN: You've got that right, Marucho!

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:29.956
There has got to be some kind of link

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.492
to this valley and Vestroia

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:36.028
and we've got to find out what that link is.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.264
Could be a portal to the Bakugan world...

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:40.767
But how did it show us Vestroia?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.435
And I guess Alice didn't see it

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.537
because she doesn't have a Bakugan.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.472
What surprised me is the rate

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:49.175
at which Vestroia is being destroyed.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.877
[sigh]

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.779
Hey, what'd ya think you're doing down there?

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:53.980
Who are those dudes?

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.718
What's the deal?

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.156
Billy!

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.425
What in the world are you doing here?

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.362
I wasn't aware this remote environment was inhabited?

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.663
Yeah!

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:12.265
These are my neighbors!

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:14.066
Billy's the blondie and that's Komba!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.802
Hey Brawlers!

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:17.436
What'd ya doing way out here, snoopin' around?

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.040
Wait a sec...

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:22.475
You losers up for a little game?

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:24.710
Well, are you chumps?

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:27.547
It's the Doom Card!

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.916
You must be Masquerade's lackeys!

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.851
Why would you join up with that creep, Billy?

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.119
Because your friends here...

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:35.121
are wimps!

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:37.423
And we're gonna give 'em a lesson in Bakugan!

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.392
So, which one wants to lose first?

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:40.626
Why you little...

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.928
This one's mine...

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.262

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.430
[laughing]

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.366
Billy!

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.335
Hey there!

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:51.671

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:54.473

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:46.752
This battle isn't over, Ninja freak!

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.222
Nice one...

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.424
That's why you're ranked sixth...

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:52.458
But not for long!

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.494

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.465

Too bad...

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:47.947
Your pet paki-derm is no match for my Blow Away Ability

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.316
'cause it neutralizes your lame Ability!

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:52.184
[screaming]

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.656
[roar]

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:58.290
Oh snap!

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.592
That kid's Bakugan has landed

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:00.993

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:02.194

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.213
Tough luck...

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:22.581
But that's what you get for playin' the best!

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:23.916
That's me!

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:25.885
Zip it!

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:28.287

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:41.734

Pretty smooth move, Shun...

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:24.677

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:37.623
KOMBA: Sorry, pal, but my Ability trumps yours big time!

00:12:37.656 --> 00:12:39.024
BAKU-POD: Brawler Power reduction...

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:41.026
to 280 G's.

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.700
They even beat Shun's Falconeer!

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:49.502
What do we do now, Tigrerra?

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.570
Even I don't have the answer...

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:56.342
Hope you don't mind if I give you rookies

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:58.077
a little hint.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.411
In the Bakugan big leagues,

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.647
you go up against big abilities!

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.549
Now let me give you a little hint...

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:06.051
This game is about strategy

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:07.486
and that you don't get.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.421
[laughing]

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.690
It's time to put these clowns away, Komba...

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:13.259
Enough tough talk, Billy!

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.527
Let's battle!

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.830

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:32.378

BAKU-POD: Battle continues...

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:42.721
Oh, Cycloid see yummy Bakugan for lunch!

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.223
Enough!

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:46.425
Don't think I'm afraid of a one-eyed

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:47.993
overgrown freak of nature!

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:49.962
Gate Card Open!

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:52.031

00:13:52.064 --> 00:13:54.800

Left Gigante!

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:04.510
Ahhh!

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:09.815
Oh no, I forgot about that move!

00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:12.117
BAKU-POD: Left Gigante negates Character.

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.086
I'm the Subterra master,

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.788
and girl and you're going down!

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:17.189
It's hammer time, Cycloid!

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:22.962
Rattleoid!

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.296
[crying]

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.965
Julie...

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:28.500
KOMBA: Man, that was a total snooze-fest...

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.069
Rumor had it that you were good.

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:34.840
Sometimes rumors are true...

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.545
Oh really?

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.413
Well, if you're so tough Ninja boy,

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:42.681
let's see you back it up!

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.583
Shut your yap!

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:47.519

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.188

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:02.601

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:03.969
El Condor Stand!

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:08.307
Julie...

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.044
Dry your tears.

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:15.414
Don't worry, I shall end your sadness.

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:18.083
Thanks Gorem... thanks a lot...

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.318
You're a sweetie...

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:23.589
Let's do it.

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:27.559
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:37.903
Gorem Stand!

00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:45.277
Gate card Op-en!

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.413

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:58.657
Alrightttt!

00:15:58.691 --> 00:15:59.658
-Yaaa! -Sweet!

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:00.793
Hold on!

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:02.261
The Gate Card!

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:03.495
Gorem!

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:04.496
He's not safe!

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.798
Get out of there!

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:07.032
What?

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:09.668
W-What's happening?

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:11.270
Noooo!

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.538
Oh yeah!

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:13.939
I love this game!

00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:16.075
That's frozen quicksand!

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:18.677
When a Bakugan lands on that specific Gate Card,

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:21.347
it gets swallowed up by quicksand.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.049
BILLY: Looks like your useless Bakugan

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:26.952
is up to his armpits in trouble!

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:28.954
It's like I told you...

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.023
I'm the Subterra master and I dominate earth!

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.962

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.067
We've got to do something!

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.736
[laughs]

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:45.003
Adios Gorem!

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.542

00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:01.920
No! This can't be happening!

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:03.722
BAKU-POD: Gorem has returned to his card safely.

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.023
Thanks.

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:06.558
I owe you one.

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:10.963
Shun!

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:11.997
You sacrificed Monarus!

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.200
KOMBA: Whoa! That was stupid!

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:19.438
Gate card set!

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:21.340
What a total waste of a Bakugan...

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:24.643
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:26.078
Bee Striker Stand!

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:29.948
Ventus Bee Striker!

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:32.484
Now for my Triple Chain Wind move.

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:33.685
JULIE: Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:47.366
Card Gate Open!

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:49.835

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.109
to Earth!

00:17:57.142 --> 00:18:00.045
BAKU-POD: Brawlers' Power Increase to 480 G's.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.280
You're kidding?

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.319
Whoa...

00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:09.154
GOREM: You don't control the Earth Element.

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:10.956
You feed off of it.

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:11.957

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.525

It's looks like it's me against you sister.

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:53.799

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:57.736

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:06.545
Show some respect, Harpus!

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:07.546

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:09.615

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:37.776

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:46.084
Say good-bye to your Cycloid, Billy!

00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:48.787
Aaaah!

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:56.028

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:40.973
You just got lucky is all!

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:42.274
But Billy?

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:43.642
You just wait...

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:45.811

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.954

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:57.656
Billy...

00:20:57.689 --> 00:20:59.391
It can't end this way...

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:05.831
[crying]

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:10.135
Hi, Dan here.

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:12.104
And coming up on Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:14.406
we fuel up for a little Bakugan Battle action.

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.074
It's like mom always says,

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.342
'Never play on an empty stomach!'

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:18.977
But forget food...

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.512
it looks like one of the Brawlers might be a spy!

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:21.847
But who?

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.282
Oh, and that's Chan Lee.

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:24.449
Ranked number three in the world.

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:25.784
Could she be the spy?

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:27.786
Or is it one of our Bakugan?

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:28.954
The battle heats up, especially when Runo wants

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:30.922
to challenge me!

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:31.923
So don't forget to check out the next

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.358
