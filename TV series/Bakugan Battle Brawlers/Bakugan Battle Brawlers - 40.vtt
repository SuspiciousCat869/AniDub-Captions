WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:21.781
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in A Fish Called Tayghen!

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:25.819
RUNO: There! That's it!

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:27.554
TIGRERRA: Yes, and I can feel the negative energy

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.255
flowing from its core!

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.323
PREYAS: Oh goody!

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.724
We're so close!

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.460
ANGELO: Well I don't like this one little bit!

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.329
DIABLO: That's because you're a whoss, Angelo!

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.999
Okay guys, you ready?

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.501
ALL: Yeah!

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.239
[screaming]

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:51.811
[screaming]

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.597
Whoa!

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.764
W-What is that?

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.535
It couldn't be?

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:18.271
Is that Vestroia?

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:27.213
[screaming]

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.448
Dan!

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.816
Runo!

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.684
Shun!

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.920
I've got you, Julie!

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.355
You saved my life, Gorem!

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.559
Don't worry Marucho, I'll save you!

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.462
[screams]

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.608
[chuckles] All clear, guys!

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.777
I don't detect any negative energy!

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.747
Huh? Are you sure?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.049
Well, I guess we should check this place out.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.651
Good idea, Runo.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.387
[cross-talk]

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.089
Yeah, well at least I think it's safe...

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.391
For your sake!

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:12.392
Wait!

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.527
Is this really Vestroia?

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.695
TIGRERRA: No!

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:18.598
It's never been an Aquos Attributed Dimension...

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:19.899
PREYAS: Indeed.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.335
And I do sense a strong Aquos presence...

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.204
SKYRESS: Yes and I can sense the power of Ventus!

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.406
That would be...

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.907
both water and wind.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.076
I believe this may be a new dimension

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.912
where those elements have mixed together to form one.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.814
Huh? You serious?

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.616
Never more, Daniel.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.819
Vestroia was originally a world unto itself

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.487
where the six attributed dimensions

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.423
co-existed in balance.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:46.492
But now Naga has seen fit to disrupt that balance.

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:49.729
One explanation maybe that new worlds have formed,

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:53.232
created from the overlapping of the original dimensions.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.467
Wow!

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.169
We're in a whole new world!

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.271
DAN: Okay, let me get this straight, Drago.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.973
Does that mean we have to...

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:03.176
to travel through different worlds just to get to Naga?

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.577
DRAGO: I believe so...

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:05.745
Ah man!

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:08.314
All this thinkin' is givin' me a giant headache!

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:11.117
Hey, there is no point getting frustrated, Dan...

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.386
I say we should just keep going!

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.587
She's right!

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.055
We're on a mission!

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.256
Right?

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:27.500
[screaming]

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.202
DRAGO: Are you alright?

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:33.840
PREYAS: Yeah, that looked major-league nasty!

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:34.874
Oh wow...

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.309
That was a smooth move, Dan!

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.810
Hey! It's not my fault!

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:39.345
DRAGO: Take a look at this!

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.323
Whoa! Check out the Baku-Cicles!

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:53.159
Those Bakugan have Water and Wind Attributes!

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:54.727
But who did this?

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:56.062
I'll bet you Naga is behind it

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.897
and we've got to stop him!

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.032
Hang on...

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:01.100
Do you know which way we go?

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.635
Gee, I never thought about that...

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.203
Let's see.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:06.506
The center of Vestroia was a restricted area

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.776
where even we Bakugan were not allowed to set foot.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.545
But that was when the balanced power

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:15.415
of all six attributes were protecting the core.

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:17.417
I believe that has all changed.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.318
And it would appear Naga did it with the help

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:22.021
of Hal-G's power!

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.056
Okay, hang on.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.490
You're saying the power protecting the core

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:26.292
has been disrupted?

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:27.593
Yes.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.328
And that may be a good thing because it just might allow us

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:30.897
to enter the core.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.299
But for now, we should see if we can find the entrance

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.001
to the next world.

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:38.104
Unless we do, our whole mission could be in jeopardy!

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:40.139
Right, we must begin with baby steps...

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:44.110
Yeah but, how are we supposed to find the next entrance?

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:45.812
Allow me to direct you.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.814
I'm picking up a faint signal!

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.248
But from where, Gorem?

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.583
That way!

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.724
Oh, how beautiful!

00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:00.293
I didn't know there were Auroras in Vestroia!

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:02.228
And they exist because of one thing...

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.364
Auroras are powered by a magnetic field.

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:05.765
Are you sure?

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:06.866
I get it...

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.668
It might be that magnetic field could be having

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.604
an effect on all dimensions in Vestroia.

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.206
Of course! Yes!

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:15.675
Okay, let's check it out, guys!

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.144
All right, move out!

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:27.320
Hey! Look up there!

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:28.688
MARUCHO: It appears to be a worm hole...

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:29.922
GOREM: Yes!

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:32.558
And that's where the signal is coming from!

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:34.460
I may be guessing but...

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:35.695
You think that could be the entrance

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.964
to the Center of Vestroia?

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:39.132
Yes.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.333
But we better hurry.

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:42.835
Once the Aurora disappears, so too will the entrance

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:46.339
of the next dimension!

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:47.440
Oh no!

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.475
We gotta get moving pronto, you guys!

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:50.977
It's closing! Come on!

00:06:56.582 --> 00:07:00.319
[crying]

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:01.387
What?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.122
Is that some kinda mirage?

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.490
You must help me...

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:05.658
please...

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.527
Do not leave all me here alone...

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.630
RUNO: Let's be careful, guys!

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:12.165
DAN: Who are you?

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:14.000
And what'd ya doin' way out here?

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.234
I swam...

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.769
You swam?

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:18.037
Is this a joke?

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.172
Come on!

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:21.541
Quit wasting our time with your smart mouth, kid!

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:23.509
I am a Water Attributed Bakugan.

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:25.077
See?

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.348
What do you think?

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:31.350
[scream]

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:33.152
I am Tayghen.

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.922
I understand your journey has been a long one.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:38.357
Why not stay here and rest a while!

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.893
We are the gatekeepers of this world

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.595
and we have a job to do...

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:45.164
and that's to protect our leader Naga!

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:46.232
Naga!

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.401
You're gatekeepers?

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:50.036
You must be Aquos and Ventus!

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:53.239
And I get the funny feelin' you two were expecting us to come!

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:54.507
Forget them!

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.842
They're not so tough!

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.810
Come on kids, we're wasting time!

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:00.213
If you insist on continuing...

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:02.415
then you must first defeat us in a battle...

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:04.116
Let's go! Air Attack!

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:08.287
DRAGO: What are you doing, you fool?

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.790
Drago! Nooo!

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:11.958
Stay out of this!

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.426
Blow Away!

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.397
Where did he get such power?

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.999
Now it's my turn!

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.434
Aquos Cyclone!

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:29.008
Noo! My Marucho!

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:30.142
Runo!

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.618
Help!

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.359
Preyas! Now!

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:47.760
Do it nowww!

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.495
That's a big ten-four, good buddy!

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.963
Aquos Bubble!

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:56.802
Thanks you guys!

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.775
Boy, are you guys ever out of shape!

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.744
Whoa... thanks Preyas!

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:07.914
The signal from the Inner Core is starting to fade...

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:12.818
That means we've gotta step on it or we'll be stuck

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:14.987
in this dimension forever!

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:16.422
But there's no time!

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:17.456
Marucho!

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.692
Do you think you and Preyas could find a way

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.427
to lure Tayghen underwater?

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.628
Do you have...

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:23.763
some kind of plan?

00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:24.964
Yes.

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:26.999
And Skyress, you and me will lure that other overgrown

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.768
freak onto the shore.

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.436
The one they call Hairadee?

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.939
Wait a minute, I think I'm starting to get it...

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.140
That's it!

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:36.309
One is Aquos and the other is Ventus!

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.177
We trick them out of their elements!

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.211
You're right!

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.513
That gives us the advantage!

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.747
What a heavenly plan!

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.015
Simply heavenly, Shun!

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.750
With them battling outside of their element,

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.385
this should be a snap!

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.553
'Kay Skyress...

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.322
Time to get this show on the road.

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:50.423
You know what to do!

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:52.091
It shall be done!

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.361
Gate Card... Set!

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.469
Now it's my turn!

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:05.604
Ha! Mind your own business!

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:08.774
Gate Card... Set!

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:17.216
It's now or never, you guys!

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:18.384
You ready to play?

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:19.618
You bet!

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:22.321
As it is written, let's get this little party started!

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:23.522
Now!

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:25.891
Bonzai!

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:27.059
Hey kids!

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:30.062
More Bakugan Battle Brawlers after these messages!

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:32.798
The battle continues on Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:44.010
Hey Tayghen!

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:46.245
Think you're pretty tough, huh?

00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:48.080
Well, there's a new sheriff in town!

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:50.149
Bring it, Preyas!

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:51.651
With... pleasure!

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.352
Gate Card Open!

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:54.754
Triple Battle!

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:58.524
Huh? What's this? I can't move forward!

00:10:58.557 --> 00:11:00.459
Okay Angelo! Time to morph!

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.794
Gotcha!

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:04.296
Aquos Preyas!

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.232
Diablo Descends!

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:07.900
Oh, this is going to be so much fun!

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:08.901
Thanks, kid!

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:10.236
I promise I won't let you down!

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:11.303
Okay...

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.205
Let's give these grunts a taste of the Preyas

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:14.507
Combination Attack!

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:18.477
Attribute Change!

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.746
Darkus!

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.049
Eww, I'm all tingly!

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:25.651
Feast your eyes!

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:26.652
Is it a bird?

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:27.753
Is it a plane?

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:30.689
No, it's only me, Preyas the Magnificent!

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:32.458
Ability Activate!

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:35.461
Diagonal Relation between Pyrus and Darkus!

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:38.164
I can feel the power surge!

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:42.601
Excellent! Two birds with one stone!

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:44.403
Ability Activate!

00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:46.572
Water Refrain!

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:49.742
Hey Tayghen, that move just nullified your Ability!

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:52.545
Oh no! I- I can't attack!

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:54.346
Incommiiinnnnng!

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:58.551
Noooo!

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:06.425
Ha!

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:07.526
What now?

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.195
Are you giving up, Skyress?

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.329
Now Shun!

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:12.064
Gate Card Open!

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:14.033
Energy Merge!

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:19.605
Huh? What's wrong... I'm losing my power...

00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:20.840
Why you little...

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:22.274
you can't do this!

00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:24.543
I just transferred all of your power to Skyress!

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:27.213
I'd try to explain it to you, Hairadee but...

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.148
I'm running out of time!

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:31.016
Now to finish what we started!

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:38.924
[screaming]

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.726
Sweet! We did it!

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:47.233
And that's a wrap, folks!

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:49.568
PREYAS: And I didn't even break a nail!

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.538
Okay kids, it's time to blow this popsicle stand!

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:53.606
Wow!

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:55.341
I can't believe we pulled that off, you guys!

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:56.742
Well it was all thanks to you Shun

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.644
and your amazing little plan!

00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:00.312
That was incredible!

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:03.983
The old switcher-roo and I fell for it...

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:07.052
But if you think I'm washed up, you're sadly mistaken!

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:08.287
[scream]

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.655
But I thought she was...

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:10.823
Blow Away!

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:17.763
No way! She's using a Wind Attribute!

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:18.931
But Shun...

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:21.300
I didn't think that a Bakugan could do that?

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:23.035
Aquos Bow Jet!

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.505
Back to water!

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.507
Hang on... I think I get it!

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.309
This must be a world where Water and Wind

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:31.644
have come together!

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:34.146
So both Bakugan can use either Attribute

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.614
whenever they want!

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:36.682
Are you sure?

00:13:36.715 --> 00:13:39.185
I always thought that was impossible!

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:41.353
Oh no! Marucho!

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:44.924
Guys!

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:46.992
We have to finish him off or we'll be stuck here forever!

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:50.062
A Wind Attribute Bakugan can't beat us underwater!

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:51.697
Totally impossible!

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:58.871
The impossible just became possible!

00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:00.573
Dive Mirage!

00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:01.707
Oh crud!

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.042
He's a Ventus Bakugan!

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:04.210
He can't do that!

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:05.978
We're done for!

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:06.979
Yeah!

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.180
And it ain't gonna be pretty!

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.519
Nice seeing you again boys!

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:15.354
Freezing Wave!

00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:19.658
Whoa! Intense!

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.794
What Attribute is he using now?

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:23.863
Now look! The water is turning to ice!

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:24.997
Marucho!

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.966
He's freezing us in!

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:29.001
How is he doing that?

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.936
We're doomed!

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.738
Marucho!

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:34.840
C'mon guys, we've got to do something and fast!

00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:35.975
DAN: Marucho!

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:37.309
Maruchooo!

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:40.446
So that was your brilliant little plan, hmm, humans?

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:42.715
Sorry but you're no match for the likes of us!

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:43.983
Yes.

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:46.619
This whole battle has been nothing more than child's play!

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:47.987
Oh, and one more thing...

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.356
Who's wants to be our next victim?

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.790
Why you cretin!

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:54.260
Fool...

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:55.794
Aquos Bow Jet!

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:06.839
Aquos and Ventus together.

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:08.907
It doesn't make sense.

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:11.610
Wind and Water are two totally different Abilities

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:14.446
and a Bakugan can only have one...

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.782
Man! This is my fault!

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:19.518
I should have come up with a better plan!

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:20.819
Oh no!

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:24.323
Look everyone, the worm-hole is closing!

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:27.459
GOREM: The signal from Vestroia's core is fading!

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:28.560
Dan!

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.729
We have to hurry or we'll all be trapped here!

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:31.864
We can't!

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:33.098
Not without Marucho!

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:35.401
We have to save him before we leave!

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:37.036
Ability Activate...

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:39.204
Blow Away!

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.574
What in the world's happening?

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:43.575
F-Freaky!

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.576
Huh?

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.577
Hey!

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:46.879
What'd ya think your doin', Shun?

00:15:46.912 --> 00:15:48.681
I've got to finish this, Dan!

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:50.482
You three make a break for it!

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:52.951
No Shun, that's just crazy!

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:55.287
We battle as a team, remember?

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:56.588
Shun!

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:57.823
Shunnnn!

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:01.960
He...

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:03.362
must feel responsible for Marucho

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:04.863
and the others being trapped.

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:06.265
DRAGO: What now, Dan?

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.133
We leave!

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:10.969
At this point, we don't have time to turn around...

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:12.905
We have to trust Shun at his word...

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:15.641
We gotta believe he can get Marucho and his Bakugan

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:16.942
out of there safely.

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:19.345
But Dan, that's crazy!

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:20.679
Come on!

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:37.796
Let's get this over with, Tayghen!

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.998
What do you think, Hairadee?

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.867
Is this human worthy to battle us?

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.135
Well he...

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:44.770
probably isn't, but why not?

00:16:44.803 --> 00:16:47.673
I've got nothing else on my schedule this afternoon...

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:51.009
Besides, I haven't had a good laugh in a few decades!

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:53.212
No, the joke will be on you, pal!

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.751
What an entertaining little man.

00:16:58.784 --> 00:16:59.852
Enough chit-chat.

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:02.087
If he wants a fight, then he'll get a fight!

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:05.958
Skyress, counter attack!

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.827
Now! Gate Card Set!

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.562
Forcement Wind!

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:11.597
Huh?

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.731
What happened?

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.333
I-I can't move!

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:15.934
Let me explain it to you!

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:18.237
My Forcement Ability allows Skyress

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.606
to nab your Ventus Attributed power...

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:22.808
And because you can switch attributes,

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:24.643
I can just as easily steal them!

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:25.811
Thanks, Shun!

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:27.813
I'm powered up and ready for battle!

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:32.785
Playtime is over, Skyress!

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:36.021
You're dreaming if you think you can defeat both of us!

00:17:36.054 --> 00:17:38.056
Ha! Just wait and see!

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.058
For what?

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:40.159
Skyress!

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.593
Here's the plan!

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:42.928
Scan the ice!

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:44.229
Find the weak spot!

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:45.564
I'm on it!

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:51.003
That's it!

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.838
I've had all I can take!

00:17:52.871 --> 00:17:54.807
SHUN: Storm Stinger!

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:08.687
Whoa! What happened?

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:12.524
I thought we were goners back there!

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:14.560
Hey Marucho... you okay?

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:15.861
I'm good...

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:17.029
Oh please!

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:18.831
Quit pretending you're some kind of hero!

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:21.433
For your info, the Brawlers fight as a team!

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:23.101
So, you ready Marucho?

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:24.336
Yeah!

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:26.104
Hey Diablo...

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:28.073
If we're going to battle, I need Angelo.

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.074
Ah man!

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.310
I was looking forward to a fight!

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:33.545
Aquos Angelo reporting!

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:34.980
Here to serve and protect!

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:36.315
Just tell me what to do master

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:37.749
and your wish is my command!

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:43.155
Diagonal Relation between Ventus and Haos engage now!

00:18:43.188 --> 00:18:46.658
Now Skyress and Angelo's powers are jacked up to the limit!

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:48.093
Oh goodness.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.896
I can feel the surge!

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:52.798
Let's do this, Skyress!

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:58.170
So... are you ready for battle, guys?

00:18:58.203 --> 00:19:00.139
Oh yeah... I'm in!

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:02.040
And I'd like to start with my Wind and Light

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:03.475
Friendship Attack!

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.114
Marucho! Phase Two!

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:11.583
Right! Preyas, you're up next!

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:13.385
I thought you'd never ask, kid!

00:19:13.418 --> 00:19:16.622
Attribute Change!

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.357
Darkus!

00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:22.528
Am I cool or am I cool?

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:24.029
Ta da!

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:25.998
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille!

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:27.733
Make sure you get my good side!

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:28.901
Diablo!

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:30.402
You're up!

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:33.739
Alright, but what's with all the changes, Marucho?

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:35.974
I'm not sure if I'm coming or going!

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.676
Diagonal Relation...

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:40.345
between Pyrus and Darkus Activate!

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:42.381
Preyas and Diablo, power boost!

00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:45.117
Shall we, Diablo?

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.187
You know me! I'm always ready!

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.731
Where did that come from?

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:00.799
Incredible!

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:02.834
Shun! Your turn!

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.337
You got it! Gust of Wind Blow!

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.573
Destruction Meteor Storm!

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:35.667
We won!

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:39.304
Boy, that was fun...

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:40.839
Can we go on again?

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:43.308
Yeah ma, one more time please?

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:48.780
-Thanks, Shun... -No sweat.

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:50.616
Alright!

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:52.651
So... ready to go?

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:54.186
Yeah, you bet, Shun!

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:01.827
Hmph!

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.862
I can't believe we lost to humans!

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:05.831
Don't worry, this fight isn't over!

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:10.002
This is Runo

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:11.903
and on the next episode of Bakugan Battle Brawers,

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:15.274
Dan, Julie and I end up in another strange world.

00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:17.009
It's like this real bizarro place

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:19.911
filled with weird stalactites and psychedelic lights.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.513
And just like the last episode,

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:23.315
we have to battle of a couple of creepy Bakugan

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:25.317
before they let us leave their world

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.753
and continue on our quest to find Naga!

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.688
I rooting for Dan and Drago.

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:30.889
Hope you are too!

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:33.458
So join me and gang on the next episode

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:35.360
of Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:36.795
Bakugan Brawl!
