00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.913
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.714
\"Here's Mud in your Eye!\"

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:32.225
[singing happily]

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:36.129
Ah gee, making mud balls on the beach all by yourself

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.431
isn't any fun at all...

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.200
NAGA: Hello Tricloid...

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.704
Master Naga!

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.310
Very few of my Bakugan are worthy of immortality.

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:53.246
You, dear Tricloid, are one of the chosen ones.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.914
But there is a catch.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.317
In order to live forever, you must first help me

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.986
carry out my plan of ridding the universe

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:04.123
of those irritating humans who call themselves 'The Brawlers!'

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.124
Yes!

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.993
I wanna play!

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:09.062
Once you destroy the Brawlers

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:11.598
and help me obtain the Infinity Core,

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:16.236
then you shall be reunited with Rabeeder!

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.938
I will help Mr. Naga!

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.040
I want to see my sister again!

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.076
I will get the job done!

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.211
I will destroy the Brawlers!

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.014
Hey, just go to her...

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.484
She's your only sister isn't she?

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.086
You know we have to get out of here but at least you

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.721
always have your sister.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.235
Where is Tricloid hiding?

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.472
I can't sense her yet, but I will continue scanning...

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.874
She has to be out there somewhere!

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.847
Tricloid really isn't an evil Bakugan...

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.216
But if she thinks she can steal the Infinity Core

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.318
just because Naga told her to...

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.453
then she better watch out because we'll take her down,

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:08.788
right Gorem?

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:09.889
Right!

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.427
JULIE: What is that?

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.929
Tricloid?

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.297
Bizarre!

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.066
Yahoo!

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.669
[laughing]

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.504
Whoa, look it's Billy!

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:25.939
And Cycloid!

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:33.746
Yo yo, Julie, hope you don't mind the intrusion...

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.215
but I thought you guys might need a hand!

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.450
Hey boss...

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.686
Why don't you just admit you wanted to come here

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.421
and help your little girlfriend!

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:42.889
Hey zip it, ya big lump!

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:44.724
I came here to help the Brawlers, got it?

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.326
Oh, yeah, right...

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.660
[giggling]

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:49.562
It doesn't matter why you're here, Billy,

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:51.064
I'm just glad you came!

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.267
Thank you, Julie...

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:02.542
Okay, now I get it...

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:05.278
So all the Brawlers decided to battle on their own.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:06.679
That's right.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:09.215
It was a tough decision, but we thought it was the right one...

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:10.583
That's why I came here

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:12.518
to protect this neighborhood from Naga.

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:16.255
Well, now that I'm here, I've got you covered!

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.423
Wait!

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.459
You're not going to try and be a hero, are you?

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:23.029
It's just that, well, ever since I've known you, Billy...

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.030
you get some...

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:25.932
pretty weird ideas into your head.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:26.966
Oh come off it!

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.901
Are you sayin' you're gonna protect me?

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.405
You and I both know I'm a better battler than you are!

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.706
No way!

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.441
The only way you could beat me in battle

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:36.576
would be in your dreams!

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.577
Hey... Back it up!

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.878
Anytime or anywhere!

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:39.946
Let's do it!

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.214
Ready when you are!

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.448
Okay! You're on!

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.350
Oooh! You are so busted!

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:45.718
Humans...

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.420
I hear ya, Gorem...

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:50.390
NENE: You're all... acting like babies!

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:52.058
You... hear something?

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.027
Yeah, it's some kinda creepy voice...

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.328
Come on, show yourself!

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.063
I'm right here.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.568
Oh... hello...

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.304
Sorry, we didn't see you down there.

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:05.738
Hey buddy!

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.240
Are you calling me short?

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:10.510
I am Nene, the greatest Bakugan Battler!

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:13.012
Do not mock me!

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:15.181
Nene?

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:16.549
I know what you're thinking.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.451
I'm just a little kid who loves to brag about

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.253
how great a battler she is.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.088
Well, I am and I can prove it!

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.557
Hey, actually, I think I've heard your name before...

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.093
I know Dan and the Brawlers personally!

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.628
Come to think of it, I believe it was Dan

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.397
who bragging about you.

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.766
You're Julie and he's your boyfriend, Billy!

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.268
Right?

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:37.103
I'm what?

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.471
You're creepy!

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.273
No, I'm cute!

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:42.308
Listen, Billy's not my boyfriend,

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.776
he's just a friend, that's all!

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.546
Oh great, now all of a sudden she wants to break up with me!

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:47.947
Women are fickle!

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.849
Somebody just shoot me...

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.150
There you are!

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.785
Nene!

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.321
Where have you been?

00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:58.124
Hey, sorry if our little sister here scared you, guys,

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:01.327
but trust me, her barks just worse than her bite!

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.528
Little sister?

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:04.997
Yeah, Akira and Shuji just happen to be

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.165
my big brothers.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.134
Oh great...

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:11.237
Well I guess we'll have a battle some other day then...

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.773
But you I warn you, don't mess with me

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:15.875
'cause I'll take both of you down, got it?

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:17.744
And take my advice, dorks.

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:20.246
Quit pretending you don't want to go out with each other!

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.647
You tell 'em, sis!

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.616
Atta girllll!

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.752
C'mon, we gotta get home.

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.787
Yeah Nene, mom will be worried.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.789
Catch you guys later!

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:34.160
What a nightmare!

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:36.629
That is one very very disturbed child...

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:39.098
[thunder]

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:40.433
CYCLOID: Hey Boss...

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:43.136
Look's like a storm's brewing.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.104
And it looks like a nasty one.

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.672
What's a little rain?

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:49.909
[thunderclap]

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.612
Oh my hair...

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:53.780
Julie! Hurry!

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.715
This was not in the forecast!

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:01.254
Oh ah...

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:02.855
Billy...

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:08.761
That was weird...

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.863
That storm came outta nowhere...

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:13.432
B-Billy?

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:14.534
Huh?

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:15.802
What is it, Julie?

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:21.808
[nervous laugh]

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.543
JULIE THINKING: Oh my...

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:26.012
why is my heart beating so fast?

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:29.215
I've never felt these feelings before...

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:32.151
BILLY THINKING: Ah man, somethin' crazy is happenin' to me!

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.620
Is it hot out here or what?

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.157
[both sigh]

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:40.693
I don't think I'll ever understand humans...

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:43.095
I think we should just change the subject.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.865
Okay, so tell me, when is this Tricloid character

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:47.700
supposed to show up here anyway?

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:52.605
I'm on my way, Brawlers!

00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:57.577
So, umm...

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:09.055
So, ah, Julie...

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:10.523
You remember when...

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:13.359
we were kids and we'd go out and play in the rain?

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:14.460
Yeah...

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.829
I remember this one time it was just pouring out...

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:18.631
you were so scared!

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.733
Every time you saw lightning or heard thunder,

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:23.502
you'd hide behind me!

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:25.838
Wait a minute, you got that backwards!

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.406
It was you that was scared!

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.742
Give me a break, Billy!

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:31.377
You were crying your eyes out!

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.079
Sniveling like a little baby!

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:34.847
You were the one who was bawling!

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.215
No, it was you!

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:38.818
No, you!

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.653
You are soo stupid!

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:51.864
Well...

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:53.466
I guess it stopped...

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.268
Yeah, I guess so...

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.637
I'm glad that's over...

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.239
An earthquake!

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:03.276
What the? Oh no!

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:06.979
It's like a volcano!

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:09.582
I'll bet it's Tricloid!

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:14.587
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand...

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:19.158
Yes... I won't let go.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:25.831
If you ask me, looks like we got company! Yes.

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:31.504
Peek-a-boo, Tricloid sees you!

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:33.039
I was right...

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.173
she's here!

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:35.908
Are you happy to see me?

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:40.479
Oh no!

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:41.514
[screaming]

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:56.495
Tricloid?

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:59.598
[giggling]

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.635
You look, I don't know, different

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:04.337
from the last time I saw you...

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.640
Because now Tricloid's here to beat the Brawlers

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:11.077
until they are all gone bye-bye, little Julie!

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.912
You can't be serious!

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:14.046
Or are you?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.781
Oh, you bet I am!

00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:19.251
And when I win, then I can see my sister Rabeeder again!

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.786
[laughs]

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.989
Was it Naga who told you that?

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:24.323
Yes he did!

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:25.458
[laughs]

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:28.361
Now, Tricloid would like to battle you.

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:29.662
You ready, Julie?

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:34.233
Who's side is she on?

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:35.668
Good question...

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.170
it looks like she's gone to the darkside!

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:39.538
That's not good...

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.943
Oh great, let's hope she's the only one who's a traitor...

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:47.580
That freak Naga's making me angry!

00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:49.615
What is it?

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:51.751
Here's what I'm thinking!

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:53.652
Let me take this three-eyed creep on!

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.187
I'll show her who's boss!

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:00.092
Hey, ya overgrown lump!

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.360
Listen up!

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.029
I'm gonna show you what I think of rejects

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:04.530
who switch teams!

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:05.665
Yaaaa!

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:07.199
I like to play!

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:08.667
Playing is fun!

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.102
She's nuts!

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:14.073
Tricloid has been exposed to Naga's negative energy!

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:16.308
Oh no!

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:17.810
How could this happen?

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.615
How could you do this to us, huh?

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:24.216
I'm tired of all this fighting and I'm going to

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.685
put a stop to it!

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.387
You ready, Billy?

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:30.890
Yeah, good to go!

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:39.832
More Bakugan Battle Brawlers coming right up!

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:43.836
Now back to the action on Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:49.809
Okay, are you ready to battle?

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.277
I'll go first!

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.545
Muddy Road!

00:11:58.584 --> 00:12:01.754
Man, talk about fighting dirty!

00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:04.423
Now it's my turn, Tricloid!

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:15.034
Hey, what'd ya do that for?

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:17.002
You're a meanie, Gorem!

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:19.205
A big meanie!

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.841
Now you made me mad!

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:30.983
[sobbing]

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.052
What's happening? Don't know.

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:38.157
She's beginning to annoy me!

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:41.494
She created a mud pit!

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:42.628
Cycloid!

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:44.096
You've got to help me!

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.165
Quick! We've got to do something!

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.200
Hang in there!

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:49.301
I gotcha covered!

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.272
Grand Slide!

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:57.843
I think someone's a little angry with me...

00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:01.080
I've had enough of your games!

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:08.154
Thank you, Cycloid.

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.588
I owe you my life.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.158
Whatever I can do to repay you, I will.

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.093
Ah, it was nothing...

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:16.228
You would have done the same for me, Gorem...

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:18.464
We're in this together!

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:19.899
Surprise!

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:21.300
Did you miss me?

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:25.304
We've got to finish her off permanently!

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.672
No problem!

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.541
You guys just kick back while Cycloid and I

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:29.575
have some fun.

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:31.777
You sure?

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.978
Yeah...

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:35.648
I'm not gonna let a 'lil blob of muck get in our way!

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:38.717
C'mon Cycloid, let's finish this!

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:41.086
I'm tired of playing your stupid game.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.621
I'm going bye-bye!

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.590
Bye bye!

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:47.726
Oh no!

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.562
Now where's she going?

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.097
Wait a minute.

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:53.532
You're not getting away this time.

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:55.067
You ready cycloid?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.635
Yes boss!

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:59.305
Ability Activate!

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.840
Stared Evil Eye!

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.616
You can run but you can't hide!

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:14.987
Owie, owie!

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.655
Watch where you're hammering!

00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:20.960
Hey, that's smarts!

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.863
So, you wanna play do ya?

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:27.032
That's fine by me!

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:28.901
Cut it out!

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:31.870
We'll quit when you surrender to our side, Tricloid!

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:34.406
No! I promised Naga I'd beat the Brawlers

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.642
and he promised I'd see my sister!

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:38.978
And that's exactly what I'm going to do!

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:42.014
Now what's she doing?

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:44.683
You won't like me when I'm angry!

00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:51.523
Incredible!

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.891
That's insane!

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:55.394
Something tells me we're in a whole lotta of trouble!

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:59.698
You okay, Julie?

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.367
I'm fine, Gorem...

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.002
Ability Activate!

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:04.570
Grand Impact!

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:12.311
My hammer!

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:14.747
She's made of mud and she just sucked it in!

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.682
I guess it's our turn again!

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:18.017
You ready, Cycloid?

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.385
You bet, boss!

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:25.524
Ohh, that tickles!

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:26.925
Not again?

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:29.128
Yippeee! I won again!

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:31.363
Thanks to my Saturn Balloon Ability I can absorb

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:33.732
all the abilities you can throw at me!

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.000
This is bad!

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:36.568
She has the power to nullify

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.504
anything and everything we throw at her!

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:39.772
We're doomed!

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:43.108
Okay, let's see what I have in my bag of tricks!

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:49.715
Yabba-dabba-Yippee- kay-yayyy!

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.658
[screaming]

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:00.759
Julie!

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:03.796
Julie!

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.935
Juliieeee! Bossss!

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:13.839
Looks like I win!

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:16.975
NENE: Not so fast, Tricloid!

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:18.577
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:30.255
Well, you two are sure lucky I came along

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.590
and bailed you out!

00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:33.125
You're not kidding!

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.760
You were awesome, Nene!

00:16:34.793 --> 00:16:36.995
But don't think I'll save your bacon again!

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.897
So why did you come back here, Nene?

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:41.367
Well, I guess you could say I kinda got lost...

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.302
But that's a whole other story!

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:45.571
Right now the only thing I care about

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.005
is playing Bakugan against anyone

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.907
who thinks they're good enough to take me on...

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:50.142
Like Tricloid.

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:51.977
I like playing...

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.379
GOREM: If you ask me Cycloid,

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:56.515
some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed...

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:58.550
Look! Tricloid's back!

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:01.053
And she's packing our Bakugan into a mud ball!

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:02.588
Hey you!

00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:04.256
You better stop that now!

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:06.458
Or else you'll be very, very sorry!

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:08.093
If it isn't the little princess!

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.629
Try anything sister, and you'll be the one who's sorry!

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.931
Do you realize who you're talking to?

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.868
Watch 'cause I have the power of Darkus to back me up!

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:19.371
Hope you're ready for a beating you overgrown mudball!

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.140
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:22.741
Ravenoid Stand!

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:25.043
Ability Activate!

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:26.445
Blow Away!

00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:28.947
Now it's your move, ya king size mud-cicle!

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:32.851
Free at last!

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:36.321
No thanks are necessary, guys, just doing my job!

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:38.290
It's hard being the best battler but...

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:40.959
I guess someone has to be the one and it might as well

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:42.895
be little ol' Nene!

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.399
Thanks for saving our Bakugan, you were great!

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.334
Hey, I appreciate the compliment...

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:52.304
It's nice when one of your peers shows you a little respect!

00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:54.573
Say, how old are you anyway, Nene?

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:55.908
Oh come on now!

00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:58.377
Haven't you learned never to ask a lady her age?

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.478
Hey kid!

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:02.381
Since when are you a lady?

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.983
Hey boss, we've got to figure a way to bring down

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:06.718
that mud puddle once and for all!

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:09.021
She takes a licking and keeps on ticking!

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:11.490
GOREM: She's like a bad rash!

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:12.825
Hmm....

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:16.728
[giggling]

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.130
That's it!

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:19.665
I got a plan, you guys!

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:21.834
'Kay, listen up...

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:22.968
Hey, no fair!

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:25.270
Whispering is just plain rude!

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:27.206
Alright, you all know what to do...

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:29.308
Hey dirtball, you ready to battle?

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:30.542
Remember...

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:33.078
we just get rid of her negative energy...

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:35.047
so follow my lead.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.348
Okay...

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:37.549
JULIE THINKING: Wow!

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:38.750
He's so different when he takes command.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.552
He's so brave!

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:42.554
Hey Tricloid, listen up!

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:44.623
We're gonna take you down, but it's not personal,

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:45.824
got that?

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:47.159
It's for your own good!

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.894
You've been programmed by that creep Naga

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:51.230
and we're going to break his hold over you!

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:52.498
Naga isn't bad.

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:53.699
Naga is good.

00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:54.933
He told me so himself!

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.768
Hey, you're not getting away this time!

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:58.337
Left Gigante!

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:05.344
Gorem! It's our turn!

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:07.279
Grand Impact!

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:08.514
I'm on it!

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:10.616
You're going down, Tricloid!

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:17.389
It's time to put the icing on the cake!

00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:20.225
Ability Activate!

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.427
Air Battle!

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:27.399
Ahhh!

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:32.704
Eww, that's got to hurt!

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.510
Hey, you big meanies!

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:40.579
That's not very nice!

00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:43.315
Alright, looks like your plan worked to perfection, Billy!

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:46.151
Didn't I tell you it would, Julie?

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.320
... And I think she's on our side now.

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:49.955
Naga lied to me!

00:19:49.988 --> 00:19:53.825
He's a very bad Bakugan!

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.827
Well, I guess this is good-bye.

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:58.130
Maybe we'll get to play again some day...

00:19:58.163 --> 00:20:00.999
but next time on the same side!

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.135
Bye bye everyone!

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:05.604
Bye, and I hope you hook up with your sister...

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:07.005
Rabeeder!

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.541
GOREM: I have a feeling it's only a matter of time, Julie.

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:13.612
You know, I got the same feeling too...

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:14.913
Billy...

00:20:16.448 --> 00:20:18.383
I guess you two are a couple again.

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:19.651
Am I right or what?

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:22.788
It's okay with me, Billy...

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:24.356
So ah...

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:27.125
do you wanna go out with me sometime?

00:20:28.126 --> 00:20:29.628
Okay...

00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:31.430
Oh my, how touching...

00:20:31.463 --> 00:20:33.966
you two kids finally admitting to the obvious!

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.267
Nene!

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.401
There you are!

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:37.469
You're safe!

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:39.371
Man, we were looking all over for ya!

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:41.173
We thought you mighta got yourself

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:42.541
into some kinda trouble!

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.076
Would you two just zip it!

00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:46.511
For your information, I just played cupid!

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:50.315
[laughter]

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:51.984
Hey Julie?

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.952
I wonder what Dan's up to?

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.420
Hey silly Billy,

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:56.989
if you're worried that Dan's going to be jealous

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.223
of you and me...

00:20:58.256 --> 00:21:00.759
Forget it because from here on out the only boy for me

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:02.227
is you Billy!

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:04.363
And I want the whole world to know it!

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:05.597
Forget Dan.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:07.065
BILLY: I think they know now, Julie...

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:09.901
ALICE: On the next episode of Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.370
I get back into action!

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:14.172
Rabeeder shows up and it's up to me to take her down.

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:15.774
But do I battle as Alice

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:17.709
or do I pull out my Masquerade mask?

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.244
Even I'm not sure!

00:21:19.277 --> 00:21:21.380
Hopefully Christopher can back me up.

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.681
You don't want to miss it,

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:25.217
because it's going to be the toughest fight ever!

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.319
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.956
All that and a few bizarre surprises coming up

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:34.426
on the next exciting episode of Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.794
We'll see you there!
