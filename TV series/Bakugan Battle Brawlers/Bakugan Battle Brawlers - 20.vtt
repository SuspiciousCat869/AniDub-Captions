WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.207
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.408
when all these random cards

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:11.411
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:12.912
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.481
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.282
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.084
That's when we realized

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.653
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.654
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.290
from another world!

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.159
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.495
Runo...

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.997
Marucho...

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.933
Julie...

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.536
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.438
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.440
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.009
Bakugan!

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.044
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.114
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.050
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.520
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.721
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.389
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.557
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.526
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.094
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.162
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:07.167
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.003
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.705
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:17.177
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.046
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.748
\"A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS!\"

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.525
Even losing one battle is one too many!

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.327
And boy, did you ever lose!

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.663
Zip it!

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:38.631
I hope you realize it's all your fault we lost, Harpus!

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:42.435
I'm a baaaaaaad Bakugan...

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.804
Ahhhhhhhh nuts!

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.940
I hate you, Shun!

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.642
How'd ya pass me!

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:54.347
What in the world?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.916
It's time.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.855
I have a little job for you, Komba...

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:05.225
All the top ranked players were invited?

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:07.694
It was like this humongous bash and only

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.195
the best of the best Bakugan battlers got to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.097
go check it out.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.766
Wow, I didn't know they even existed!

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.835
I guess that a perk of being a top gun!

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.238
Oh please, Dan, Billy's just pulling your chain!

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.573
'Kay, now I'm confused...

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.142
Yes, well, if you ask me.. I believe it's all

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.676
just one big trap.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.278
What!

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.279
I fear Marucho is right...

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.947
So do I...

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.549
Because I was one of those stupid enough to

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:31.384
fall for it...

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:32.819
W-Who are you!

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:37.524
My name is Maquerade...

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:44.764
He took us to a different dimension...

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:49.068
A dimension he called Vestroia...

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:52.939
He must have shown you Naga and the Silent Core.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.174
Please, you must tell me the state Naga was in at

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.210
the time you saw him!

00:02:57.243 --> 00:03:00.446
And you mustn't leave out any details!

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.482
Well gee, I only saw him for like a second.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:03.750
But from what I remember, it seemed like he

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:05.652
couldn't move...

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.021
Hmm, that seems rather strange...

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.590
Perhaps he is trapped within the Silent Core?

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.058
Yes!

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.993
And if your theory is correct,

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.962
that means that Naga has not evolved into the

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.830
Ultimate Bakugan yet!

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.233
I'm telling you, it was really weird!

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.569
When I saw him, I felt this bizarre power kinda

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.305
wash over me, and next thing I knew all I wanted

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:29.576
to do was destroy every Bakugan that I could find!

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.578
It's like I couldn't control myself!

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.680
Billy, maybe it was the negative energy of the

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.348
Silent Core that was manipulating you.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.283
Yeah, that's gotta be it!

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:39.452
Thanks you guys, but I wish there was some way I

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:42.355
could tell you how sorry I feel for what I did...

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.123
Hey, don't worry about it!

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:49.829
After all, we know it wasn't your fault!

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.364
It looks like we will be arriving shortly at

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.666
Bakugan Valley.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.568
All departing passengers prepare to deplane...

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:56.603
That is all!

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.186
All ashore that's going ashore!

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.121
Okay, I'll walk Billy home and

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.155
catch up with you later!

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.790
Alright, but be careful!

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:20.560
Later dudes...

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.161
Man, that freak Masquerade is really

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:24.731
gettin' under my skin!

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.798
What's the matter?

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.134
I'll tell ya, Runo!

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:29.602
Ya remember the battle we just had against Klaus

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.638
and Chan?

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:32.639
Let's face it, they're puppets being manipulated

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:34.641
by Masquerade!

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.175
And that means we have to stop that creep from

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.444
brainwashing everyone!

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:41.547
Well yes but...Easier said than done, Dan.

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:42.849
I know it's hard, but it has to be done and we

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.951
have to do it!

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.486
I know but.. I'm just saying we...

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.888
Hey, take it down a notch!

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:51.324
We don't even know where these Battlers are and

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.559
until we find them, we can't do a darn thing!

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:54.661
And don't forget, we still haven't found the

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:56.596
Infinity Core!

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.698
I know we haven't found it yet!

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:01.234
I'm just sick and tired of Masquerade's little game!

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:02.602
And I want to nail that jerk so bad I can taste it!

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:03.603
So does everybody else, but we're not all

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.038
flipping out!

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:08.174
- What! - Stop it!

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.275
I hate to see such good friends arguing...

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:11.010
Seriously!

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:14.113
Who said we were friends?

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.182
But I thought...

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.483
You guys were...

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.118
Hey!

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.186
Where'd ya think you're going, Shun?

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.088
Wait up!

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.623
You can't just walk away without tellin' anyone

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.358
what the heck you're doin'!

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:27.193
Is there something wrong, Shun?

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.227
I don't care what happened to the others...

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.996
I look after myself!

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.097
Ah give me a break!

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.099
You cannot be serious!

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:35.535
We have to work together to beat Masquerade!

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:37.770
So get off your high horse and listen to me!

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.707
And just who elected you captain?

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.608
Man.. with your temper, you couldn't beat a child...

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.977
What!

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.479
In fact, I could take you down with my eyes closed...

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.880
Excuse me!

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:52.785
What'd ya just say!

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.055
I'm sick and tired of pretending we're friends.

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:57.223
Shun, wait!

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.224
Go ahead and leave!

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:59.359
Who cares!

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:00.626
And who needs you!

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.928
Daniel!

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.930
What'd you want!

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:04.931
What is wrong with everyone around here!

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:08.067
Ahhhhh!

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:12.472
Don't leave, Shun...

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.840
Where will you go?

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.209
I don't know...

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:18.211
But are you sure you're doing the right thing?

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:19.278
Wait, Shun!

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:23.049
Wait up!

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:25.918
You can't go, you just can't!

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:28.554
You know we're all depending on you, Shun!

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:30.490
We're a team!

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:32.492
Please Shun, reconsider...

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.393
Your quest is the same as Dan and the others.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.429
To unmask Masquerade...

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.569
Who cares?

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:45.638
Let that poser leave.

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:47.273
Bottom line is, I didn't need him before and I

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:49.242
don't need him now!

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:52.211
Ahhh, who am I kidding...

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.547
You brought this upon yourself, Daniel.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.748
Maybe it's you who isn't a team player...

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:57.784
Oh great!

00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:59.485
I guess now you're taking his side!

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.487
I'm not taking anyone's side.

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:02.855
I'm just concerned about the way you've been

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:08.361
acting towards your companions.

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:10.229
You must admit Daniel, you haven't been a very

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:14.267
good friend lately...

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.570
Yeah.. I guess you're right, Drago...

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:20.173
What was I thinking?

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:21.574
Man, I'm such an idiot!

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:22.875
Aahhh - humans.

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.446
Oh that Dan!

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.682
Who does he think he is, anyway!

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:32.585
You're nothing but a big baby, Dan!

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:34.220
Acting out your frustrations, Runo,

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:35.688
will not further your emotional journey and as

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:40.226
an observer...

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.128
Hey, stay out of my business, Tigrerra!

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.303
Preyas.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:53.472
Sent to Doom Dimension.

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:58.277
Oh Preyas, I miss you so much!

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.413
I'm afraid Shun feels the way everyone has been

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:03.816
acting lately, none of you could ever defeat Masquerade.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.519
That is why he has left.

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:09.889
He feels it is now up to him to rescue all the Bakugan.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:11.691
But Shun...

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:16.395
It's the only way to win, Alice...

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:19.298
And if I can not defeat him.. everything is lost!

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:27.139
Preyas.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.475
I really miss you...

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:32.511
For some reason I feel this is my destiny...

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:35.047
From now on it's up to me to take Masquerade on!

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:37.049
Shun, no...

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.918
You can't do this, Shun!

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.220
You can't beat him all by yourself!

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:43.723
You need your friends.. You need to work as a team!

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:47.860
I work alone...

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:52.265
KOMBA: Well, well, if it isn't Mr. Tough Guy himself!

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:55.968
I heard everything!

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:58.804
You really think you got what it takes to beat Masquerade!

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.606
You're a regular comedian, Shun!

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.942
I love it!

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:08.981
Just one thing.. You gotta beat me first!

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:14.320
The Bakugan Brawlers will be right back after these messages!

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:18.357
Now back to Bakugan Brawlers!

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:25.164
Just one thing.. You gotta beat me first!

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:28.100
Ah, is the wittle baby scared to battle?

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:30.369
Don't worry, I won't hurt you!

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.439
I'm just going to eliminate your Bakugan!

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.608
Here, check out my Baku-Pod!

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.343
I'm almost at your level even though you beat me once!

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:39.579
Remember that Shun?

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.180
Shun ranked in top ten.

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:43.449
No other data.

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:45.084
And you only won that battle because you got

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:47.420
lucky, that's all...

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.589
I want revenge for that day!

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:51.958
And the only way I can get it is if we battle!

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:53.659
Hey, just forget about Masquerade!

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.728
Soo, what'd ya say!

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.096
Are you ready to rumble in the jungle with me!

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.097
Pl-ease!

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.832
Pl-ease!

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.067
Why don't you go get lost, kid...

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.869
'Cuse me!

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.871
Are you brushin' me off because you think I'm a weakling?

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:07.773
Well, let me tell you.. the only reason I lost to

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.875
you was because I was teamed up with Billy

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.844
who's completely useless!

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:12.845
That guy couldn't fight his way out

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:14.647
of a wet paper bag!

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.083
Later dudes...

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:19.452
So.. does Billy talk trash behind your back

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:20.553
like you do about him?

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:22.555
Stoppp itttt!

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:24.523
This is totally ridiculous!

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:26.192
I don't care what Billy says about me,

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:27.293
I just want to battle you!

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:28.294
Can't you get that through that

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:29.628
thick head of yours!

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:31.530
You don't need friends.

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.432
You think you can do this all by yourself.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.601
Hmmm, sounds interesting...

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:36.769
- Gasp! - What?

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:50.583
Alright kid, I accept your challenge...

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:51.651
Shun!

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.019
No Shun!

00:10:53.052 --> 00:11:00.092
This is going to be fun!

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.761
Field Open!

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:17.410
Doom Card.. Set!

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:21.847
Gate Card.. Set!

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:23.082
This time you're going down, Shun!

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:24.116
SHUN: I don't think so...

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.052
'Cuse me?

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:27.820
I know all your little tricks...

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:29.588
So there's no way you can beat me!

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:32.792
Gate card set!

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:36.295
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:38.698
Ravenoid Stand!

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:41.534
Ventus Ravenoid!

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:43.636
Hmph!

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.204
If you think that poor excuse for a chicken will

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:47.473
beat me, you've got another thing coming!

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:50.943
Gate card set!

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:54.346
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.116
El Condor Stand!

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:01.320
Ventus El Condor!

00:12:01.353 --> 00:12:03.689
Let the game begin...

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.324
No turning back now, chump!

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:08.027
Gate Card Open!

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.528
Additional Task!

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:19.905
You don't have what it takes to play in the big leagues.

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:22.875
This isn't over yet!

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:26.212
Sorry, Shun's right.. His Additional Task Ability

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:28.848
forces the last Bakugan thrown to go directly

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:31.150
back to the players who put it into battle.

00:12:31.183 --> 00:12:32.685
You just got lucky!

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.954
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:39.825
Bee Striker Stand!

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:41.594
The Battle Resumes...

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:43.395
Sting 'emmmm!

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.431
Nowwww!

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.500
Ability Card.. Activate!

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:55.341
Blow Away!

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:57.243
Ah!

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:59.678
I didn't get a chance to battle!

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:01.647
You mind at least letting me make a move!

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.316
I told you before.. Against me,

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.818
you're out of your league, pal...

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:07.486
C'mon Shun!

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.523
You gonna battle or what?

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:12.224
Your move, Shun...

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:16.061
Bakugan...Brawl!

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:26.005
Ventus Monarus Stand!

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:28.107
Oh, a butterfly!

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.376
You got me shaking in my boots, Shun!

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:32.578
Battlefield ready for action.

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:34.814
Okay, his moves are limited.

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:36.515
And even if he does attack,

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:40.586
I can always counter with my Triple Chain Wind!

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:42.555
I'd say it's about time to show Mr. Big Shot how

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:43.822
this game is really played!

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:47.526
Bakugan...Brawl!

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.865
El Condor Stand!

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:57.937
Gate Card Open!

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.740
Tabulating Power...

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.576
Now it's your turn to lose!

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:05.277
Ability Card Activate!

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:09.248
Solar Plexus!

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:12.318
Monarus power reduction to 280 G's.

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:14.253
Show us what you got, El Condor!

00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:16.155
Destroyyyyy!

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.123
Ability Card.. Activate!

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:26.165
Blow Away!

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.867
You gotta be kidding!

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:29.935
Why can't you play this game like it's supposed

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.370
to be played?

00:14:31.403 --> 00:14:33.038
Gate Card Open!

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.840
Mine Ghost!

00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:36.709
When two Bakugan land on this card,

00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:37.977
it doesn't matter what side they're on,

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.745
they both lose!

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:48.554
Not.. again?

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:51.557
That was amazing, Shun!

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.727
You didn't give Komba even one opening to attack you.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.928
Now I know why you used to be ranked number one

00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:58.697
in the world!

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.232
But what's up with your obsession to totally

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:04.036
dominate your opponent!

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:05.037
How could this happen!

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.639
That's it!

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:08.507
I'm tired of your ambush strategy, Shun!

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.212
From now on, no mercy!

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.114
I need you, Skyress.. Let's end this..

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:16.949
Don't hold back on him..

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:22.054
SKYRESS: I'll do what must be done.

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:25.991
Bakugan.. Brawl!

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:27.359
Skyress Stand!

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.109
Shun leads battle with two games.

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:47.379
Komba, Zero victories...

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.615
Go ahead and activate your stupid Triple Chain Wind.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.216
I'm ready for you!

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.484
Here goes nothing!

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.553
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:57.856
Harpus Stand!

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.894
Ta-da!

00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:03.829
Well, it looks like it's my turn to play...

00:16:03.862 --> 00:16:05.664
It's Skyress!

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:06.665
You are looking good, girlfriend,

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.500
but not for long!

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:10.569
Ability Card Activate!

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:12.237
Feather Storm!

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:16.141
Harpus to 570 G's.

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:27.019
Blow Away!

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:28.587
I was blindsided!

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.588
Get back in there, Harpus!

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:30.989
And make it quick!

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:33.525
So how have you been?

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:35.627
Don't play cute with me, sister!

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.029
This is what happened to me last time and trust

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:43.969
me, it won't happen again!

00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:47.606
I've had enough of you, Harpus!

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.808
For an old bird, you've got a lot of fight left in you.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.077
But you're no spring chicken!

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:54.813
Too bad, Shun.. Seems to me like you played all of

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:58.050
your Ability Cards.. And without anymore power,

00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:00.953
I guess there's only one thing left to say,

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:02.721
I just whooped your butt, Shun!

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:06.191
Think again, Komba!

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:08.527
If you're wondering why I don't waste time in

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.163
battle, it's because I'm not willing to lose my Bakugan!

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:13.298
It's nothing personal!

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.234
Man, you are one crazy dude!

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:18.504
Shun still has one more Gate Card Left!

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:20.839
Gate Card Open!

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:25.511
Reloaded!

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:32.151
Watch as all the wind power is drawn toward Skyress.

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:34.953
Reloaded is the Gate Card that increases your power

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:36.522
by a hundred times the number of your Bakugan on

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:40.125
the battlefield!

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:41.827
Skyress Power Increase detected.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.165
Power to 560 G's.

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.366
Do something!

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:51.737
Are you nuts!

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:57.810
I don't like this!

00:17:57.843 --> 00:18:00.779
Oh no, I think I broke a nail!

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:02.981
No!

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:05.451
There's no way I could have lost again!

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.953
Noooo!

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:08.954
I can't believe this!

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:10.522
It must be a dream!

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:11.857
How could this happen!

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.425
I want a rematch, Shun!

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.461
Ya hear me!

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:17.796
Not to be too forward or anything,

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.531
but how about you let me sit out the next battle?

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:21.200
Why you little!

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:25.704
This is all your fault!

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:29.108
Let me give you a little advice.. practice..

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:30.309
and maybe stop running your mouth off before you

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:32.044
start another battle.

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:34.880
I messed up bad...

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:36.548
You can always rely on your friends kid,,

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:38.250
that's real important!

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:43.388
Yeah, you're right...

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:46.458
It's something that I forgot about myself...

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:48.861
You mean your friends?

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:50.329
I never realized it before but there was one

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:52.564
friend in particular..

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.933
We were both so passionate about Bakugan,

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:57.469
but, I lost my friend...

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:03.775
Brawl!

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:07.146
But why is winning such a big deal to you, Shun?

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:10.115
His passion becomes apparent when he battles...

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:14.052
It makes him feel alive.

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:16.255
Watching you trying to be so tough made me realize something.

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:19.024
You can't do it by yourself,

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:22.628
you have to rely on your friends to help.

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:24.730
DAN: That was awesome SHUN: Hun?

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:26.431
There you are!

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:29.601
ALICE: Dan!

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:30.903
Hey you guys.. where in the world have you been?

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:33.572
Hidin'?

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:36.275
I believe young Daniel has something to tell you Shun.

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:39.912
Hey, hold on.. He's right, Shun, I do, Gee,

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:42.114
I'm sorry for saying we didn't need you.. In fact

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:44.783
you're probably the one we need the most..

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:47.219
Anyway, I don't know if I've told this before,

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:49.254
but just listen to me for a second.. You're the

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:50.389
best friend I've ever had Shun,

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:52.424
and I really mean it, bud!

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:53.525
How touching!

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.928
Come back, Shun!

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:57.462
Please, Shun!

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:58.864
What'd ya say, Shun!

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:00.399
Man, this is too much!

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:02.834
I can't stand the suspense!

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:09.408
C'mon Shun, do the right thing!

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:10.742
It would be my honor, Dan...

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:11.944
Yes...

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.879
Oh Shun!

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:15.247
You da man, Shun!

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.915
Hey!

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.383
What do think you're doing!

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:19.685
I know I've been a real pain and you probably

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:21.620
think I'm just some little creepy kid,

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:23.055
but I want to be your student!

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:24.856
I want to learn from you, Shun!

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.758
And I'll never leave your side, ever!

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.994
Is this kid joking!

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:30.329
He wants to learn from YOUUUUU!

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:32.564
That's completely crazy!

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:33.999
Mind explainin' what happened here?

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:36.301
I must have missed somethin'!

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:39.171
Well.. I suppose it is kinda weird...

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:41.607
That's putting it mildly...

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.342
I'm dead serious, Shun, you gotta teach me,

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:49.481
man.. Say you will!

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:52.451
He wants you to teach him!

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:54.486
Hey!

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:58.523
Cut it out, guys, this isn't a laughing matter!

00:20:58.557 --> 00:21:01.193
Could someone please explain to me how I ever

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:04.429
got into this mess?

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:11.770
That creep Klaus and his buddies Chan and Julio

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:13.972
challenged us to battle!

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.707
Runo, Marucho and me accept!

00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:17.976
But there is a problem.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.911
Runo still hates me and Marucho is still bummed

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.446
out about his Bakugan Preyas being sent to the

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.048
Doom Dimension.

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.117
But here's the rub!

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.653
Klaus shows up with Preyas as his Bakugan!

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:30.055
And now we're all trying to figure out how he

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:32.257
brought Preyas back from the Doom Dimension!

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.425
I guess there's really only one way to find out

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.093
what happens.

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:37.095
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:38.130
See ya there!
