00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.374
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.742
when all these random cards

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.044
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.946
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.381
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.549
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.084
That's when we realized

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.653
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.755
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.057
from another world!

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.192
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.128

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.497

Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.436
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.605
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.440
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:41.841
Bakugan!

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.178
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.348
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.486
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.587
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.623
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.690
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.759
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.027
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.062
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.270
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:12.806
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:13.840
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.881
Bakugan Battle Brawlers - A Perfect Match!

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.052
Hey, Julie!

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.654
I am gonna clean the floor with you today

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.889
and you wanna know why...?

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.425
Because me and my Bakugan are a precision team!

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.493
and we're in the top 20 of the World Ranking

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.861
Bakugan players!

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.729
Yeaaah!

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.299
Woooooowww! Cool.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.533
Is that really true Billy?

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.236
You bet your Baku-pod...

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.504
Am I right Cycloid or what?

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:45.805
Oh yeah...

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:47.440
You said it!

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:50.376
Together, you and me are unstoppable!

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.480
So you might as well go run home to your MAMA!

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:55.114
What? How dare you!

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.649
I'm not goin' anywhere!

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:57.650
I can't believe you've actually got

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:58.651
a talking Bakugan!

00:01:58.685 --> 00:01:59.652
Where did you find him?

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:00.954
Yep...

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.489
We're a perfect match...

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.357
So I hate to say it Julie...

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.725
...but you're toast.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.161
That's it !

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.329

Okay, Bak-u-babe !

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.183
Why don't you show me what you've got?

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.584
What did you just call me?!

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.353

I know we've been friends a long time Billy,

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:13.493
but I need to teach you a lesson!

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.296
Ha...

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.864
That was just a warm up.

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.699

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.875

This doesn't look too good...

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:37.283
Go! Hyenoid!

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:38.851
Take him out!

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:45.758
BILLY: Ha!

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:46.859

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.796

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.540

Character Card still in effect.

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:53.559
No way !

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:56.062
It'll continue to decrease as long as he keeps battling .

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.231
BAKU-POD: Hyenoid's power level still decreasing...

00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:59.832

He beat me.

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:27.713
I lost!

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.916
Allright, we did it, Cycloid!

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.818
I'm tellin' ya, you are the man !

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.986
No, you're the man!

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.489
Did you see how the two of us worked together?

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:37.490
The very moment I found him deep in the heart

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.325
of Bakugan Valley...

00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:41.093
I knew we were meant to be together.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.628
In Bakugan Valley?

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:43.896
You betcha!

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.531
In a remote corner...

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.567
In the deepest cavern...

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.604
There he was, just waiting for his destiny...

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.406
And then we took you down!

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.907
You were lucky!

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:56.943
I don't need a \"perfect match\" anyways!

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.045

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.314

JULIE: I can't stand him!

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.454
I lost a Bakugan battle today

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:10.857
to my childhood friend, Billy!

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.025
Oh no - that's the real loudmouth guy isn't it?

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:14.293
Yeah...

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.895
Aw, that bites.

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:17.897
Of course it did!

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.265
Billy can be a real jerk sometimes

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:21.167
and it makes me wanna scream.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.735
To top it off his Bakugan is just as bad!

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:24.403
PREYAS: Oh really?

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:25.805
What is his Bakugan's name?

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.173
Um...

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:28.507
I think it was \"Cycloid\".

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:29.709
PREYAS: Interesting...

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:31.644
Tigrerra, do you know this \"Cycloid\"?

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.079
TIGRERRA: No. I don't know him.

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:34.447
DAN: How about you, Drago?

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.715
DRAGO: Yes.

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.950
A rather big fellow as I recall.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.418
DAN: I'd sure like to throw down

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:41.287
and see who's tougher, huh Drago?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.656
We could show 'em what a real team brawls like!

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:46.225
DRAGO: Yes... sounds great...

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:48.294
DAN: I gotta say Julie; you don't know what you're missing

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:50.263
not having a Bakugan you can talk to.

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:52.465
I'm sure you'll meet one any time now

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.000
and the two of you will get on famously!

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.801
I'm perfectly fine...

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.603
I'm happy just the way I am, thank you...

00:08:57.637 --> 00:08:59.338
I don't need a talking Bakugan

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.207
to feel good about myself.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.642
Well goodnight everybody - talk to ya later...!

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.847
The truth is...

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.849
I'm not \"perfectly fine\" at all.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.421
Huh?

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:18.891
This is for you.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:20.092
Wow!

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:22.061
Thank you so much Billy!

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.529
You and me are gonna be best friends forever,

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.964
I can just feel it!

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:25.998
Yeah!

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.805
[sigh]

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:35.374
I'm not too happy that I lost to Billy this afternoon.

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:38.144
Oh well...

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.447
BILLY: I met Cycloid...

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.481
...deep in the heart of Bakugan Valley!

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:45.885
Bakugan Valley?

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:50.056
I do have a day off tomorrow

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.258
and I suppose I could go to Bakugan Valley...

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.893
Like I said, I don't need a talking Bakugan

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.095
to feel good about myself...

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.096
But everyone else seems to have one, and I...

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.130
I think...

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:03.402
[scream]

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:09.742
[scream]

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.043
Somebody get me out of here!

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:12.311
I hate this place!

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.846
I hate it I hate it !

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.114
I don't need a talking Bakugan!

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:16.415
Not if it means putting up with icky caves

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.450
and icky bats and icky bugs and other icky stuff!

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.487
Stay tuned for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:25.324
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers are back!

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:26.359
Battle on!

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.363
[sigh]

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:32.264
I wasted my entire day off

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.767
running around Bakugan Valley...

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.002
... and I have absolutely nothing to show for it.

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:39.538
Oh well...

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:41.040
I'm happy just the way I am...

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:42.675
I'm fine battling without a companion -

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.411
I don't need any talking Bakugan...

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:47.913
I'm fine...

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:50.349
just 'cause everyone else has one...

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:52.151
I'd sure like to throw down

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:54.220
and see who's tougher, huh Drago?

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:55.921
We could show 'em what a real team brawls like!

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:57.156
Yes...

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.324
sounds great...

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:02.628
But the... truth is...

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:03.796
I want to have a Bakugan to talk to

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:05.698
more than anything...

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:07.633
...More than anything in the world...!

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.368
[sobbing]

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:10.836
GOREM: Julie...

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.906
I'm here...

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:16.942
I'm here for you.

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.978
For me ...?

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.247
Like you, I have longed for a companion

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.417
with whom to share my joys and my sorrows...

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.420
I began to despair that it would ever come to be...

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:30.389
But finally a pure and sincere voice reached me...

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:31.857
Your voice!

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:34.026
I think I get it...

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.128
Until now I was not being honest with myself...

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:38.130
my voice wasn't pure and honest enough

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:40.066
to be heard by you...

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.901
But you were there...

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:45.304
Now that barrier that separated us is gone...

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:48.007
I feel as if I've known you for ages,

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.375
though we've only just met...

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:50.943
Yes!

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:52.378
It's like we're best friends already!

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:54.313
My name's Julie...

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:55.681
May I ask what your name is?

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:58.451
I am Subterra Gorem.

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:00.286
Subterra Gorem?

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:01.654
You can just call me Gorem.

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:04.824
Oh, Gorem...

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.392
Let's be friends for ever...

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.227
And ever and ever!

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.328
Sound good?

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:11.297
Sounds good.

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:18.938
JULIE: You're goin' down, Billy!

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:21.907
You gonna teach me another lesson today?

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.476
You're the one who never learns !

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.444
Well today you might find things

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.079
are a little different, Billy-boy...

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:28.681
Because...

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.616
I have finally found my \"Baku - partner\"!

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:32.118
Oh good!

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:33.619
you finally managed to find yourself

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:36.155
a talking Bakugan.

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:37.289
Well in that case...

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:38.958
It's time to Brawl!

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:39.959
All right !

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:41.627
It's show time!

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.728
Field... Open!

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:47.233
Gate Card S et !

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:52.738
Okay Julie...

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:53.806
time for the second inning.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.209
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:57.243 --> 00:12:58.878
Hyenoid, Stand!

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:03.082
M y turn!

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.887
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.889
Tuskor, Stand!

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.727
BAKU-POD: Tuskor's power level: 350 Gs.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.795
Ability Card Activate!

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:18.264
Nose Slap!

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:23.469
With this, he can reach out and attack the Bakugan

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:24.703
standing on the next card!

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.808
All right Tuskor, take him out!

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:36.949
Pretty good, Julie...

00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:40.653
But not good enough !

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:41.720
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:45.124
Wormquake, Stand!

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:53.799
BAKU-POD: Wormquake's power level: 340 Gs.

00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:58.537
Ability Card Activate!

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.006
Sandtrap!

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.649
Come on, Tuskor's power level is 350 Gs...

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.918
You won't beat him with a lame attack like that !

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:14.653
Here's a little tidbit for ya...

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.989
Y'see, the cool thing about \"Sandtrap\"

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:18.591
is that it knocks down the opponent's power level...

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:20.659
check it!

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.895
BAKU-POD: Tuskor's power level decreased by 50 Gs.

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:24.797
Now Wormquake is stronger!

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.645
Please, help me Gorem!

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:42.882
I think I'm in real trouble here...

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.517
I need you... Help me !

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.287
Don't worry - I will do my very best to help you.

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:52.558
So then, where's this new Bakugan you were so proud of?

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:55.694
Okay, Gorem!

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:57.997
Show me your stuff!

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.199
Gorem, Stand!

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.667
Gorem...?

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.505
Oh no Gorem, what's the matter?

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:08.007
Did I do something wrong?

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.375
The time isn't right.

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:10.743
\"Not right\"?

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:11.744
What are you talking about?

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:12.878
Trust me.

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:14.446
Oh no!

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.447
Then what on earth am I gonna do ?

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:16.448
[laughing]

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:17.716
Huh?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.285
Looks like it's my turn!

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:20.853
Gate Card Set!

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:24.223
Okay...

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:25.658
...batter up...

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:27.026
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.296
Cycloid, Stand!

00:15:33.932 --> 00:15:36.435
Ability Card Activate!

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:37.503
Stare Down!

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.439
You're in for it now!

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.174
With this ability,

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:43.742
my Bakugan can decrease the power level

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.644
of every Bakugan on every card

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:48.080
within the red border by 50 Gs.

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:49.348
Then I'll just add a card outside it!

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:50.582
How d'ya like that ?

00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:54.820
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.023
Manion, Stand!

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:01.760
Ability Card Activate!

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:03.929
Copycat!

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:06.765
\"Copycat\"?

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:07.800
Then that means you can...

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:09.268
That's right...

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:11.203
I can copy Wormquake's ability, \"Sandtrap\"

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.237
and use it against him!

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:18.944
Pretty good...

00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:20.979
Now try this on for size!

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:23.282
Ability Card Activate!

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.516
Grand Slide !

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.292
BAKU-POD: Manion moved within \"Stare Down\" perimeter.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:35.594
Manion power level decreased by 50 Gs.

00:16:35.627 --> 00:16:37.730
Oh, nooo!

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:39.531
Get ready, cause this just might hurt !

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.203
No! Manion!

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:47.606
Okay.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.341
I've waited long enough, Julie.

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.210
Time to meet this new Bakugan of yours...

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:53.012
I wanna new playmate!

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:56.915
JULIE: What should I do?

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:58.317
Gorem said to trust him and wait!

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:02.254
GOREM: Julie, I cannot bear to see you

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.288
tormented like this.

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:07.960
I told you I wanted to share

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:10.062
your joys and sorrows...

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:11.764
Gorem...

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:13.699
Julie, throw me in.

00:17:13.732 --> 00:17:15.534
What?

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:18.237
But I can't risk losing my perfect match...

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.405
GOREM: Trust me.

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:21.707
The time is now.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.409
But... I...

00:17:23.442 --> 00:17:25.010
Don't worry...

00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:26.979
Now that I've found you I won't abandon you.

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:30.649
Thank you so much, Gorem...

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:32.518
thank you for finding me...

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:35.220
I promise that I won't let you down either...

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:37.089
Thank you Julie.

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.123
Come on!

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.660
Okay, here goes...

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.128
Bakugan...

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:44.363
Brawl!

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:47.166
Heads up!

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.374
Gorem, Stand!

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:01.613
Wha...what is that ?

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.148
That... is Gorem!

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:06.685
He's...

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:08.053
Gi gan tic!

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.762
Oh Gorem!

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:19.364
You are incredible!

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:21.600
You are the best Bakugan a girl could hope for!

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:22.868
I don't know...

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.670
he doesn't look so tough...

00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:27.473
I'll have him saying \"uncle\" in no time!

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:28.740
Well Cycloid...

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.175
let's see if you're right...

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:32.411
Ability Card Activate!

00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:33.912
Mega Impact!

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:37.583
What's going on?

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:39.818
BAKU-POD: Gorem's power level increased by 50 Gs.

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:42.287
430 Gs?

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:43.889
No messing around, Cycloid.

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:45.657
We gotta take this guy out fast !

00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:47.192
I hear ya big time on that...

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:48.527
Gate Card Open!

00:18:51.129 --> 00:18:52.698
The \"Level Down\" Command card decreases power

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:53.799
by 100 Gs!

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:00.706
BAKU-POD: Gorem's power level reduced to 330 Gs.

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:02.641
Okay Cycloid, here's your chance!

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:04.510
The bigger they are the harder they fall!

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:05.777
JULIE: Gorem...!

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:07.746
I'll be fine Julie...

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:09.248
just watch...

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:10.782
Okay...

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.284
It's Hammer Time!

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:16.155
This is bad...

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:17.589
That shield is too strong and Cycloid' power level

00:19:17.623 --> 00:19:18.924
goes down with every blow!

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:22.327
Oh oh...

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:24.696
BAKU-POD: Cycloid power level reduced to 270 Gs.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.399
[loud yell]

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:30.869
What?

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:31.970
This is it Gorem!

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:38.177
Gorem you big beautiful Bakugan,

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.445
you did it, you did it!

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:41.480
[cheering]

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.122
Billy...?

00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:53.992
Good job Julie...

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.394
you two battle well together!

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:57.462
Thank you...

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:58.530
I think Gorem and I are a perfect match

00:19:58.564 --> 00:19:59.831
for each other!

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.167
Good job out there, Gorem.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.002
You too, Cycloid...

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.038
Okay Cycloid, come on...

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:08.006
we need to start training!

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.908
I think we're gettin' soft!

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:12.110
And we can't have that now can we?

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:14.012
Gotta keep in tip top Brawlin' shape!

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.914
Yeah! See ya Julie!

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:17.749
See ya Billy!

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:18.784
I can't wait till we get to Battle each other again!

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:25.224
Hey everybody!

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:27.292
I'd like to introduce you to my new special friend...

00:20:27.326 --> 00:20:28.694
his name is Gorem!

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.329
Wow Julie!

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:31.997
You finally found a talking Bakugan?

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.198
You bet I did!

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.633
Aw that's great!

00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:36.034
I'm so happy for you!

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.569
PREYAS: Hi there Mr. Gorem.

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:39.137
I'm so pleased to meet you.

00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:41.440
I'm Preyas, and this is Drago.

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:43.242
GOREM: \"Drag\" what ?

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:45.210
\"Drag- o \".

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.912
My Bakugan is called \"Tig \".

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.280
Say hello, Tig.

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:49.348
Tig ...??

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:51.249
Call me \"Tigrerra\".

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:53.352
Gorem, you have lots of friends now.

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:54.987
Isn't that great ?

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.188
Looks like you two are best friends.

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:57.656
You bet.

00:20:57.689 --> 00:20:59.191
Gorem and I are the best friends

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:00.192
in the whole wide world...

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:02.261
isn't that right Gorem?

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:03.829
Not in front of people...

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:05.897
[all laughing]

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:07.099
TIGRERRA: Welcome aboard, Gorem.

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:11.269
Marucho here.

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:13.272
Coming up later on \"Bakugan Battle Brawlers\",

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:15.274
we all think that it would be a great idea to get

00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:18.243
a little help from Shun, the Master of Ventus,

00:21:18.276 --> 00:21:19.678
especially since things are really heating up

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.713
with Masquerade.

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:24.216
But for some crazy reason, Dan doesn't agree with us.

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:26.551
Then suddenly, Dan passes out!

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:28.086
Please come back and help us Shun!

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.488
What's that?

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:31.023
You will but only if we win?

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:32.824
Come on, Preyas...

00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:34.092
I'm depending on you!

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:36.128
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:37.229
Let's do this!
