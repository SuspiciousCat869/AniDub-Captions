WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:22.449
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in Ground Control to Major Dan!

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:27.187
We've finally detected all six Attributes!

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.422
What's that... Marucho?

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:33.293
It means that our mission to Naga is almost complete!

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.394
You're right!

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.762
We're on our way!

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.698
Now to bring down that creepy clown!

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.001
ALL: Go Brawlers!

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:53.847
[\u266a]

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.915
I think I'm going to be sick, Preyas!

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.750
Just turn your head please!

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:01.321
Excuse me but, are you sure we're going the right way?

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.790
Ah, I don't think now's the time to stop for directions!

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.658
Don't worry about it, you guys...

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:08.962
Nobolion said it was this way!

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.264
And I'm sure he'd know the way!

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:14.234
What do we do when we find the Silent Core?

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.336
We take it away from Naga!

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.304
Follow me!

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.652
DAN: Whoa! So this is the center of Vestroia!

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.888
Talk about a whole lotta of freaky!

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.489
RUNO: Wait a minute...

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.158
ALICE: There's nothing here!

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.093
MARUCHO: It appears to be deserted!

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.161
Where are you, Naga?

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.531
Where are you hiding?

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:50.303
I don't sense his presence...

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.671
I know!

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.907
He was probably tipped off we were coming after him

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.376
and the gutless creep took off running!

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.746
Lucky for him because I was ready for a work out!

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.648
Yeah, a workout on his face!

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.550
[laughter]

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.919
I don't think he'd run!

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.387
There's something not right here...

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.688
I agree!

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.991
[static]

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.194
JOE: Dan! Dan! Can you read me?

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.662
Come in, Dan! Come in!

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.663
Hello?

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.997
... Can anyone read me?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.432
Yeah Joe!

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.500
I can hear you!

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.869
You've gotta come back! Hurry! Hurry!

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.137
You serious?

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.706
REPORTER: It seems the recent world-wide weather

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.374
catastrophes have settled down.

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:29.876
But while things are returning to normal,

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.545
there is no official word on what may have caused them.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.213
From the Channel 8 NewsCopter,

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:36.115
this is Tiffany reporting!

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.951
Whoa! That giant hole in the sky just...

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.719
just disappeared!

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:40.853
And look!

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.689
So did the one in the Pacific Ocean!

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.724
Well if you ask me, I think the government's

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.526
behind the whole thing!

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.161
It's aliens I tell you!

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:49.629
Aliens!

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:51.831
[laughs] That's right my pets...

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.199
The time has come...

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:59.372
for all in the world to feel the supreme wrath of Hal-G!

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:04.777
[evil laughter]

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.314
[bell tolling]

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.049
Arise...

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.552
my Bakugan!

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:22.629
[\u266a]

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:27.700
[\u266a]

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:31.471
[crowd screaming]

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.074
Hmph!

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.977
So this is the human world!

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:49.022
[crashing]

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:51.090
My car!

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.959
Oh I am so sorry...

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:54.794
correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure I had dibs

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.896
on that parking stall!

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:11.911
Gargonoids!

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:15.014
This shall be our new playground!

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:30.897
[evil laugh] The fun is about to begin!

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:38.905
REPORTER: That's right, Chuck,

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:40.707
it looks like some kind of invasion!

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.608
And reports from our affiliates around the world

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:45.445
say bizarre creatures are popping up everywhere!

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:46.779
And this just in!

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:49.315
They've even been spotted out on the high seas!

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.317
It's a nightmare!

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:54.887
I'm guessing here, but...

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.622
Those are Naga's Bakugan...

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:58.658
I just wish I knew his plan!

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.660
I believe I know what Naga's up to...

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.195
Hey hang on!

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:04.330
Did he create the Hole just to lure the Brawlers

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.733
away from here and into Vestroia?

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:07.934
Exactly!

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:10.703
With the Brawlers and their Bakugan out of the picture,

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.538
coming after me to get the Infinity Core becomes

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:14.774
that much easier for Naga!

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:16.609
We're virtually defenseless!

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:18.211
So what'd we do?

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:19.579
REPORTER: This just in, Chuck!

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:22.181
A new hole has opened directly over the Pacific Ocean!

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.817
And believe you me, it's gi-normous!

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:26.285
We've gotta do something!

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:30.289
We're above the hole now and a nuclear sub

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.425
is being sucked in!

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.993
No wait! It's turning!

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:35.528
It's turning!

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.030
WAVERN: Oh no!

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.199
It's... it's Naga himself!

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.400
He's here!

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:44.771
He's come for me...

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:46.606
and the Infinity Core...

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:02.855
Welcome to my world, oh great Naga!

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.191
What a strange place indeed...

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:09.162
Now, explain to me our next move, Hal-G...

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:11.864
First and foremost we must find Wavern.

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:13.432
That means all your Bakugan

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.101
must cover every square inch!

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:18.638
There can be no success without the Infinity Core

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:20.706
in our possession!

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:23.342
Then make it so!

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:25.678
My Bakugan are at your disposal!

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:29.782
Bring Wavern to me and then, the universe shall be mine!

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:34.187
Oh Infinity Core!

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.189
Come out, come out where ever you are!

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:37.323
[laughs]

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:41.894
Locked on target!

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:44.330
Hit 'em with everything you've got, boys!

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:50.603
Good job, men!

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:52.672
Oooohh, that was fun!

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:54.340
But Tricloid wants to play some more

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:56.576
with little planes!

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:57.844
Mission complete!

00:07:57.877 --> 00:07:59.278
Let's head for home!

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.949
What the? ... Eject!

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.451
I'm hit! Eject!

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:06.652
EwwwWeee!

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:10.056
Tricloid likes playing with iddy biddy toy planes!

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:13.226
REPORTER: The entire world is in a state of pandemonium!

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.228
Military force is useless against these invaders

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:18.698
and political leaders are at a loss at what to do next!

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:20.666
Whoever or whatever these creatures are,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.468
they are bent on destruction!

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.506
WAVERN: This is all happening because of me!

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.309
Millions of innocent people are at risk!

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.446
Naga will stop at nothing until he finds me!

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:35.848
We gotta lay low, Wavern, we just gotta!

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:38.150
If we head out now, Naga will find out

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.785
and it'll be the end of everything!

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.254
But...

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.623
We've got to do something!

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.628
What are you thinking about, Joe?

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:51.264
I'm a Brawler and we've gotta fight back!

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:53.699
Calling any and all Bakugan Battlers!

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:56.302
Come in please, we need you!

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.404
Our world and our Bakugan's world Vestroia

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:00.339
are being destroyed!

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.641
Naga...

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:04.243
he's the one after the Infinity Core...

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:07.179
If he and his human cohort Hal-G get a hold of it,

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.116
the entire universe as we know it, will be destroyed!

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:13.619
We've gotta band together and fight back!

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.358
Please! I need your help!

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.294
We must protect our world and Vestroia

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:23.696
before it's too late!

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.137
I'm counting on you guys!

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.705
I must go.

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.007
With the power of the Infinity Core inside of me,

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:37.843
I'm our best chance of defeating Naga...

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:40.646
Thank you for everything, Joe...

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:45.017
Wait!

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.953
I'm going with you.

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:49.255
Joe...

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:52.458
CHAN: Hey you two, cut it out!

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:55.194
Joe... I got your call... I'm in!

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:56.429
Chan!

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.998
Hey Joe, you can count on me too, buddy!

00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:00.866
And me!

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.002
Whatever you need, I'll be there for ya!

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.737
Hey Joe, it's me Komba!

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.005
Sign me up too, pal!

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:07.707
Sweet!

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.876
Hope I'm not too late to join!

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.014
[overlapping voices]

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:16.849
Hey guys...

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:18.284
thanks so much...

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.558
Where are you, Wavern?

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.927
Give me the Infinity Core and maybe I can convince

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.495
Naga to spare your life!

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:31.964
Answer me, Wavern!

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:34.133
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:40.373
Hmph!

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.108
What a bunch of ignorant fools!

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:43.876
Speaking of ignorant fools...

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:45.778
...welcome to planet earth, Tayghen!

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.380
If I'd had known you were coming I'd have arranged

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.115
a welcoming committee!

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.549
Correction.

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:51.684
I'd have made it a fish fry!

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:58.391
Hey, ya lump of sushi, ya ready to fight?

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.433
What's going on?

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:10.036
I thought we'd be greeted as liberators?

00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:14.707
You think your one-eyed horned headed goon...

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.208
can beat me?

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:18.377
You gonna take that from her, Cycloid?

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.413
Not a chance, boss!

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:25.584
\u266a La la la la la...

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:31.524
Oh my, that wasn't very nice, now was it?

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.661
Hey, what'd you looking at?

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:37.296
If you thought it'd be a cake walk

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:38.798
without the Brawlers...

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:39.999
you're wrong!

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.674
[loud roar]

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.076
Use your words big guy...

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:52.311
And tell me you want to surrender!

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:05.958
Who did that?

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:13.099
Listen up all those who follow Naga!

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:15.367
I cannot let you pass!

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.769
Oh please!

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:18.571
You can't be serious?

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.840
Just what do you think you are doing?

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:22.942
She's protecting the Infinity Core...

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:24.310
And for your information,

00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:26.445
that's precisely what we're all doing!

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.848
Alright!

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:31.183
With this many Battlers joining in to fight Naga...

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:32.852
we'll win in no time!

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:35.588
Joe, we can never underestimate Naga...

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:36.655
Never!

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:48.400
Hmph!

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:50.002
Now what, Naga?

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:56.675
Stay tuned!

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.744
More Bakugan Battle Brawlers coming up!

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:04.016
Now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:05.918
Aquos Tornado!

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:08.420
Oops! You missed me!

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.156
I'll wipe that smirk off your face!

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:12.124
Nice try for an old girl!

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:13.225
But you...

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:14.760
might wanna use your brain...

00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:16.162
'cause that brawn thang ain't working!

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.463
You're mine!

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:20.933
Ability Activate Now!

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.434
Right Gigante!

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.945
I can't believe how strong you are!

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.880
And smell isn't everything...

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:36.015
is that it?

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:38.350
Feel the power of Cyloid!

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:40.786
Oh yeah?

00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:42.521
REPORTER: The fighting continues,

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:44.857
but now it looks like some of these creatures

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.725
are protecting earth!

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:48.460
That's it, get 'em!

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:50.129
You leave our world alone!

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:51.664
Or you freaks are gonna be sorry!

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.934
REPORTER: It appears children from all over the world

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:57.036
and these...these bizarre creatures are battling

00:13:57.069 --> 00:14:00.206
together to protect earth against this alien invasion!

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:01.473
Look dear!

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.976
Those kids have Bakugan just like Dan's!

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:07.546
And they all look so determined win this battle!

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.881
For our sake...

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:10.683
let's hope they can...

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:18.891
KLAUS: Anthemusa!

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:25.798
[screaming]

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:32.671

Dive Mirage Now!

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:41.847
Okay... now what's happening?

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:47.453
Forcing Wave!

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:56.362
Looks like we win, doesn't it?

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:58.697
Why don't you creeps just surrender?

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:02.067
[laughs] Ah, I think that's my line!

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:03.402
No way!

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:12.244
How dare you fools defy me?

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:16.482
Now you will feel the supreme wrath of Naga!

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:26.558
[\u266a]

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:36.201
[\u266a]

Wavern!

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:45.377
[struggling]

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:47.046
Wavern! You've gotta hang on!

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:48.380
You've just gotta!

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:50.282
For everyone!

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:56.855
I don't think you realize who you're dealing with, do you?

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:59.091
[scream]

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:07.466
[overlapping cries]

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.939
Hang on, Cycloid!

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:17.242
Ah, monster fall down and go boom?

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:18.811
Tentaclear!

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:24.883
Hope you got a kick out of that!

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:26.051
Fortress!

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:29.988
[screaming]

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:34.126
I'm so sorry I disappointed you, Klaus...

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:35.861
forgive me...

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:37.730
Sirenoid!

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:56.648
[Wavern screaming]

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.983
Wavern!

00:16:58.016 --> 00:17:00.119
Naga's Negative Energy is attacking the Infinity Core

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:01.920
inside me!

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:03.589
I can't hold on...

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:05.457
I can't, Joe...

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:09.261
I can't hold on any longer...

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:19.471
Yes!

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:21.940
I've found it at long last!

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:25.544
Soon the Infinity Core and the universe

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:28.414
will be all mine!

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:31.350
Go my pets!

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:33.685
And bring me the Infinity Core!

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:38.290
And then, we shall be triumphant over all!

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:41.927
No...

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.062
Is there... anything we can do?

00:17:56.675 --> 00:18:04.983
[horns honking]

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:07.219
Hey, this isn't over yet!

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:09.321
Nene's right...

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:10.456
it ain't over 'til it's over!

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:11.890
Got it?

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:14.693
Don't forget folks...

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:17.696
There's still time to call in the Brawlers!

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:18.697
Yeah!

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.199
Dan and his crew will know what to do!

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:23.268
[overlapping chatter]

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:26.038
There's still time to call in the Brawlers.

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.842
But are you sure there's enough time?

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:32.044
They're our last hope, Joe...

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:34.213
Try to make contact again.

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:35.380
You got it.

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:38.484
The Brawlers are our last hope to survive!

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:39.518
[static]

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:42.654
Dan... Dan...

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:43.689
Can you read me?

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:45.491
This is Joe?

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:47.426
Dan? Are you there?

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.094
Please come in... Dan!

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:51.129
Come in!

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.265
Yeah Joe...

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:54.733
I can read you...

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:55.734
Hurry, Dan!

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:56.735
You've got to come back!

00:18:56.768 --> 00:18:57.870
You copy?

00:18:57.903 --> 00:18:59.204
Come back?

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:01.006
Naga's in our world!

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:03.275
And he's brought all of his Bakugan!

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:05.844
You've got to hurry, the earth is under attack!

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:07.946
Dan, if you can read me, hurry!

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.449
We've got to get back there and help!

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:13.185
Then this has been just a diversion!

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.987
Naga tricked us!

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.355
It's a war zone here, Dan!

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:18.957
If you don't get here soon, we won't last much longer!

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.859
You've got to hurry, Dan!

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:22.160
Please, Dan!

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:23.929
Get the Brawlers back pronto!

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.198
Hey Joe!

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:27.499
Come in, Joe!

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.701
What's our plan of attack, Dan?

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:31.770
I don't think we even have a choice!

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:33.805
We've gotta go back and help out!

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.474
Yeah... but how?

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.976
If we go back the same way we came,

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.511
it will take too long!

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:41.179
And what if that transmission

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:42.915
is the real trap, guys?

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.716
TIGRERRA: I suspect Naga's already closed up

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.585
the Dimension Vortex.

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.353
PREYAS: Oh no, this doesn't look good!

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:50.289
There's gotta be a way outta here!

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:51.423
There just gotta be!

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:53.525
Aw man!

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.327
WAVERN: Drago...

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.395
Wavern!

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:57.529
Dan...

00:19:57.563 --> 00:20:00.265
Dan, I just hear Wavern's voice!

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.767
Are you serious, Drago?

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.169
Drago...

00:20:14.813 --> 00:20:17.916
That's the light from the Infinity Core!

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.484
T-That's Wavern!

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.787
Wavern's here? Ya sure, Drago?

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.455
The Infinity Core!

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:25.657
I can sense it too!

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:26.892
Hang on!

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:29.227
Does that mean the light somehow connected to our world?

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:30.529
She may be right!

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:32.331
Yeah, of course!

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:34.399
I always knew Drago and Wavern had some kinda

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:36.335
special connection!

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:37.703
Sweet Preyas!

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.104
There's still hope yet!

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:40.539
Yes, come in?

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:41.873
Okay gang...

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:44.176
Looks like the Brawlers have got a job to do!

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:45.344
Yeah!

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:47.613
We gotta hightail it home and show that creep Naga

00:20:47.646 --> 00:20:50.315
who's boss around here!

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:54.152
Move out!

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:56.622
Up, up and away, Drago!

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:11.770
MARUCHO: In the next episode of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:14.806
we face off against everything Naga has to throw at us!

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.441
He's desperate to get to the Infinity Core

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:18.076
that's inside of Wavern,

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.545
but it's the Brawlers' job to see that doesn't happen!

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:23.482
Let's see what you've got, Naga!

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:25.384
I'm first up and with Preyas,

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:27.486
there's no way I can lose...right?

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:29.054
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is going to be the easiest

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:32.057
battle of my life!

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.358
Who am I kidding?

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:34.960
This is going to be one wicked war!

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:36.995
So make sure you don't miss the episode!
