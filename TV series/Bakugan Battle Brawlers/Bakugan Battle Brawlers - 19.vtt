00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.440
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.775
when all these random cards

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.111
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.979
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.716
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.084
That's when we realized

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.720
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:21.921
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.224
from another world!

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.426
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.194
Runo...

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.530
Marucho...

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.503
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.738
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.540
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.941
Bakugan!

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.245
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:48.415
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.486
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.621
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.689
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.857
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.893
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.094
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.163
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:07.333
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.972
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.007
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.281
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"JULIE PLAYS HARD BRAWL\"

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.555
MARUCHO: Surf's up!

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.657
Hey! Check it out!

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.092
I can barely touch the bottom over here!

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:36.196
Cool! I'll dive right in!

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.097
Just as soon as I find water past my ankles!

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.800
Belly-flop!

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.203
Oh-wedgie! Stop that!

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.904
This umbrella came with my drink!

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.473
Hey look at me!

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.674
I'm king surfer!

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.945
[laughing]

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:54.113
Oh yeah who crowned you? Your board?

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:01.387
Where-where did you go?

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.523
Preyas! Stop goofing around!

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.358
Where are you! [echoes]

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.866
[Gasp]

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.234
Oh no!

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:19.606
[crying]

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.040
It was just a dream.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.876
Breakfast!

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.477
Come and get it while it's hot!

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.912
Come on Shun!

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.053
Whoa! Real Sausages?

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:36.422
Hunh?

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:38.958
Yeah, so pretend you have real manners...

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.026
Oh?

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:43.930
Ee-r-uh-hh ! Morning...

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.431
Marucho?

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:48.434
Oh... good morning Runo.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.342
You know I've been thinking,

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.211
remember that world wide data we saw?

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.480
It showed Hydranoid was dangerously close

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.515
to becoming the Ultimate Bakugan.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.716
But that's...

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.319
Masquerade's Bakugan.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:08.054
The infinity core needs to fuse

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:09.889
with an ultimate Bakugan.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:12.425
So we gotta up our game and build one fast-

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.260
before they beat us to it.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.762
Can I have some of that?

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:19.532
SKYRESS: We have to stop Masquerade

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.135
from getting to the Infinity Core!

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:24.637
TIGRERRA: Or else Naga will get his hands

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:27.106
on both the Infinity and the Silent Core.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.341
DRAGO: Putting Vestroia and the Human World

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.810
into jeopardy...

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.312
we must act swiftly!

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.682
Drago's right!

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:36.983
All we've been doing is shredding tread!

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.685
We need action!

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:41.888
And I say we make Drago our ultimate Bakugan!

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.323
Well as long as we all agree-

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.291
Agreed!

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.026
We'll ditch this tea party and get some real action!

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:52.432
And I know just the place to get the brawl rolling,

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.033
Masquerade's European lair!

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.468
Yes!

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.437
We'll take it by storm!

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.571
That's if Marucho can pinpoint a location!

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.007
Dan!

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.875
MARUCHO: Uh... no?

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.177
DAN: If Masquerade doesn't get taken out soon

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.079
it could be the end for all of us.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:08.381
I-Uh, I can't remember...

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.849
Marucho you've got to remember!

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:10.850
Come on!

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.385
Snap out of it!

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.886
RUNO: Da-an!

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.389
I'm-I'm sorry...

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:18.725
but I can't deal with this right now...

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.460
But... Marucho?

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:21.728
Come back!

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.229
Leave him alone.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.731
I think he's gone through enough,

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.766
without you harassing him like a criminal.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.668
He just lost his best friend Preyas.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.036
What do you expect?

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.504
Oh come on!

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.339
He's got to man up and move on,

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.842
Masquerade's destroying Bakugan as we speak!

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.277
It's a tough break but we're on a mission

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.478
so he'll just have to get over it.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.213
Nice attitude?

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:41.381
Geeze, why don't you get over it

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.282
and cut him some slack?

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:44.951
Cause we're not running a daycare,

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:47.020
so maybe we'll just roll without him.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:48.054
How can you even think of blowing him off at

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.656
a time like this?

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.025
Maybe Marucho should stay behind.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.026
Huhn?

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.627
What?

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:57.664
I know he'll pull through, he always does.

00:04:57.697 --> 00:04:58.931
But right now isn't the time to wait for him

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.466
to come around.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.868
We have to move on.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.337
Julie!

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.539
JULIE: You don't understand Billy was my best friend forever.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.541
Growing up he was always there for me.

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.376
So I've got to be there for him

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.645
now that he's under Masquerade's control.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.547
I just can't sit around here waiting for things to happen

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.783
when I know there's something I can do.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:17.917
Marucho's friend may be lost but there's still

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.752
a chance we can save Billy.

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:20.887
So I say we leave without him.

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.123
You?

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.158
You're there for your friends?

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:27.193
What about Marucho?

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.995
Runo...

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:30.663
Spare me your lame excuses.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:31.731
You've made your choice.

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:33.066
Now go!

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:36.002
Fine!

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.904
'Cause I've had enough, of your melodrama!

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:39.505
Common let's go Julie!

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:42.675
[crying]

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.578
Wait come back here...

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:46.979
Dan!

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:49.816
SKYRESS: Shun?

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.851
Go get him,

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:54.020
it's your responsibility as a brawler.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.157
Oh she... makes me so mad!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.592
I could just yell-

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.527
Huhn?

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.763
[crying]

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:04.897
Not you too.

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:10.236
You've got some-make-up that's running down your face -

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:11.537
here's a hankie.

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.672
No, no take it.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:13.673
I won't want it back.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:14.874
Trust me.

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:18.077
I am so FRUSTRATED!

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.679
I don't know where we're going!

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:20.713
Or even where are!

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.182
Hoah!

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.217
Whoa!

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:27.820
Geeze, what is this?

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:29.756
When petting zoos attack?

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.391
[laughing]

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:36.129
Well look what we found, your sense of humour.

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:39.132
I know, and your silly reaction has given me an idea?

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.234
I think I know where we can look for Billy?

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:43.336
Uh, exactly how?

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:46.005
Oh, you'll see.

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.607
Dan gets me so frustrated

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.575
when he goes totally alpha dog on us!

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:50.977
Why do I even care?

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.478
And that Ju-lie .

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:53.713
Chasing after him like a lost puppy,

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.815
following him everywhere!

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.917
Look I know you're upset, but don't you think

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.419
you're being a little hard on them?

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:03.156
I mean really, all that Julie wants is to get

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.591
her friend back from Masquerade.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.059
I know 'cause I felt the same way when it happened

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.228
to Grandpa and me.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.164
So I understand what Julie is going through,

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.566
trust me it's hard.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.635
Well maybe seeing your friends take sides is harder.

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:16.869
Runo...

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.871
I'm sorry.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.740
I think I'll go check on Marucho.

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:25.511
I can't believe this.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:27.713
We should-we should be coming together

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.549
to help Marucho not be fighting over it.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:32.652
I mean if I, I, if lost Tigrerra.

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:35.755
I don't, I don't know...

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:36.856
TIGRERRA: My Dear.

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.891
Now tell me something.

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:41.093
Didn't Daniel once lose his temper?

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.595
And ended up throwing his Drago into the river?

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:44.697
Wha'?

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.433
I'm just saying that Dan already knows what it's like,

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:49.335
to have lost his own personal Bakugan.

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:51.003
Huhn?

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:53.172
Hmm, perhaps I give him too much credit.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.240
Because losing it temporarily-

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:55.675
and losing it forever-

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:56.809
are two very different things.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.111
Hmm!

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.453
DAN: You actually said to Billy

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:09.822
that Germany is beside Australi?

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.557
Uh-hun and your shocked look so reminded me of his.

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.861
BILLY: Hey Julie,

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:15.895
if you could be any where in the world right now

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:17.163
where would it be?

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:18.965
Uhm? Japan I think.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.566
Good call.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.001
What about you Billy?

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:24.770
Me? I pick Germany.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.772
That's when he mentioned this soccer field,

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.841
where he could catch a cool game.

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:31.010
He always wanted to come here,

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:33.613
I'm surprised I could remember the place.

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.781
BILLY: I'm surprised you remembered too!

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:38.317
Well look what the cat dragged in!

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.619
Always on top of your game?

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:40.887
Aren't you?

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.054
Oh you asked for it!

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:43.823
Wait!

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:45.625
Look you may have been best buds at one time,

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.960
but this ain't one of those times.

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:49.562
And being ranked number ten,

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:51.030
he's out of your league.

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:53.666
Sorry, Daniel.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:56.402
But I'm taking him down solo!

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.271
Are you whacked?

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:01.440
Oh puleeze- you think you know everything.

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:04.176
Well you don't- when it comes to winning people over.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.646
This requires a slightly different tactic.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.714
Masquerade may have a grip on Billy

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.149
but I'm gonna loosen it one thumb at a time.

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:11.817
Uh-Hun.

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.286
Field... Open!

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:19.659
Doom card... set!

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.262
Gate card... set!

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:30.036
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.437
Manion Stand!

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.474
[roar]

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:37.843
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:39.712
Centipoid Stand!

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.955
He's out to bust a move...

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:50.323
wild style.

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:52.158
Gate Card... set!

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.027
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.863
Tuskor... Stand!

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.368
Ability Card... Activate!

00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:04.537
Attractor Activate!

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.306
Here it comes!

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.508
And there it goes circlin' the drain.

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:12.445
Looks like you fell for my sand trap.

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:13.946
What the?

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.281
Not Quite!

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:18.050
BAKUPOD: Centipoid leading.

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:20.419
Gate Card Open!

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.421
Magma card fuse!

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.697
Ha!

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.037
Explain?

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.605
Simple, he just smoked a Bakugan and two cards

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:41.974
in one totally killer move.

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:44.510
You gotta love that magma fuse card,

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.779
I like how it wipes out all the other cards

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:49.648
after a fresh battle, leaving a clean scent behind.

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:51.150
You should clean up your own act!

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:52.451
'Cause you've been fighting dirty.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.020
Ha!

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:55.021
Well you don't make it into the top ten

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:56.489
by playing nice!

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:58.290
Playing Nice?

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.291
More like you were playing Masquerade's

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.426
Sucker instead.

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.528
So what?

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:05.297
Now, my game's shootin' right off the Richter scale.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.099
And you're completely off your rocker!

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.167
I want the old Billy back!

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:11.771
And we'll be back in a flash!

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:12.972
You heard me!

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:17.943
Let's par-tay! Yee-haw!

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.517
Oh! Tuskor!

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.619
Ha!

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:27.820
Looks like you'll have to forget about him ...

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:28.854
ha-ha-ha!

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:31.957
Gate Card Set!

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:33.893
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:35.027
Centipoid Stand!

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:42.234
BAKUPOD: CENTIPOID AT 750 Gs.

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:44.770
This means I've only got one left.

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.739
Gorem you're my only hope.

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:47.907
Then let's show'em how it's done.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.408
Game on!

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.010
Gate card set!

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.481
Come on Gorem!

00:11:57.683 --> 00:12:01.654
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:03.956
Ability card Activate...

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:05.324
Mega Impact!

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:14.834
BAKUPOD: Both Bakugan power level up by 100 Gs.

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.671
[Grunt] Centipoid!

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:19.705
Don't, wimp out early!

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:33.953
BAKUPOD: Centipoid down 50 Gs.

00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:37.022
CENTIPOID 360 Gs, GOREM 530 Gs.

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:38.924
Go! Go! Get him!

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:02.114
Yes!

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:03.182
THINKING: Humph!

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.517
Nice play...

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.751
into my hands.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.453
Wha? What gives?

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.021
Why is he smiling?

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:10.823
Didn't he just blow a game?

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:13.726
Unless, this some sort of set up.

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:15.961
Go shake'm down! Rattleoid!

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:23.736
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:29.041
Gorem Attack!

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.442
Gorem Stand!

00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:35.748
[Roar]

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:41.687
BAKUPOD: Rattleoid Level 310, Gorem 380.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.189
Ability card Activate!

00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:44.456
Poison Fang!

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:49.528
Huhn? -He-e-eh!

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.363
BAKUPOD: Rattleoid up 50 Gs, Gorem down 50.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:56.569
Hee-e-eh! Hy-yah!

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:01.840
Ability Card Activate!

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:03.809
Gate Building!

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.078
One more card and I'll and double down?

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:08.280
Gate Card Open!

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:10.749
Grand Spirit Activate!

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:12.585
Grand Spirit Card?

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:14.186
What the heck?

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.622
That Card revs up the G force by 50

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:18.858
for every card you have on the field.

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:21.293
DRAGO: So if she already has two cards?

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:22.294
DAN: Then she really did double down her 50

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:24.363
to make 100?

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:26.999
BAKUPOD: Gorem up 100 Gs.

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:29.101
So how do you like getting your hands dirty?

00:14:29.134 --> 00:14:30.436
Under Earth Attribute?

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.037
Hra-a-ah!

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:33.472
Huh-ha!

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:39.812
Gasp! Score!

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:41.113
Aw-yes!

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:42.581
Dan wait!

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.483
He's smiling again?

00:14:44.516 --> 00:14:45.818
What is his damage?

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:48.087
This is the last card

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.488
and we both have just one Bakugan left.

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:54.727
So how about we finally settle this all or nothing?

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.995
You game?

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:57.263
No way!

00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:58.664
Don't fall for it Julie!

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.165
It looks like a trap!

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.533
Okay!

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:02.968
Then bring on your worst!

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:04.470
With pleasure!

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:06.505
BOTH: Final shot!

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:08.974
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:09.975
Ability card activate!

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:11.944
Copy Cat!

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:13.712
JULIE: Ability card activate!

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.014
Mega Impact!

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.721
Say what?

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:23.889
Gorem!

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:26.025
I admire your specialty.

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:27.559
Mind if I take it?

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.665
That was real slick keeping his copy cat card

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:33.699
on the d.l.

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:35.301
Of course!

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.769
That's why...

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:38.937
He sacrificed Centipiod...

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:40.773
To copy the previous ability of Mega Impact!

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.244
Why so shocked?

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.646
You were the one whining about an equal playing field?

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.882
Hummnnnn-Yoohhhhh!

00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:51.216
Errrrrrr!

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.285
Huh-ay-ay-ay!

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:55.254
HUHN!

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:56.255
Hutt!

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.256
Ha!

00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:58.257
Hutt!

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.258
Ha!

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:00.392
Ee-e-e-e-e!

00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:02.528
Huhn?

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.196
With both of their Mega Impacts canceling each other out

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:06.031
they've both gone down 50 Gs.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:07.433
But Gorem is still in the lead.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.001
Go Gorem!

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:11.337
BAKUPOD: Gorem down 50 Gs.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.338
JULIE: What?

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:14.540
Ha! Ha!

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:17.209
Seems Rattleoid has left behind a little parting gift.

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:18.844
The Poison fang's starting to kick in.

00:16:18.877 --> 00:16:20.512
Gasp! Poison fang?

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:21.947
JULIE: Oh no!

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.382
It's taking over!

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:24.416
This could be fatal.

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:28.587
JULIE: Gorem!

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.789
GOREM: Julie! You must leave now!

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.391
No!

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:35.094
We're in this together big guy!

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:38.230
We're gonna stand our ground and fight to the very end.

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:41.233
But Julie, one more blow and I'm finished.

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:43.435
And you know what that means.

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:45.571
Come on, what are you waiting for?

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.773
Do it already Cycloid.

00:16:47.806 --> 00:16:49.942
Are you, sure?

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:51.510
Ah, Because I would be sending him

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:52.978
straight into the Doom Dimension

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:55.247
accompanied by that foolish humanoid?

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.615
Hehn!

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.517
I know she's just bluffing!

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.618
She wouldn't have the guts to pull off

00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:00.652
something like that!

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.020
[laughing]

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:03.856
Hey Julie!

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.090
Why don't you drop the bravery act and get off

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:07.292
so we can end this fight properly.

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:09.294
NO-o-o-o!

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:11.397
I don't care what you say!

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.664
I'm gonna to stay right here with Gorem!

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:13.832
I mean it!

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:14.900
Hehn?

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:17.403
So! Go On!

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:18.404
Send me into the Doom Dimension if you think

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.606
winning is so important.

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:21.673
Why won't she give up?

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:22.975
It's over?

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:24.977
She's testing him.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.646
Finding out if the Billy she once knew still exists.

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:30.849
Forcing him to choose between triumph and defeat.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.384
Because the real Billy would sacrifice victory

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.620
over harming a friend.

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:37.122
DAN: Yeah, but this ain't no after school special.

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:40.292
Seriously, what happens if he gives the word to attack?

00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:41.860
If that happens...

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.729
Then Julie will be banished

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:44.963
to the Doom Dimension for all eternity.

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:46.532
You mean like...

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:47.966
forever?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.601
And Ever!

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:54.239
Yes. [laughing]

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:56.708
What are you waiting for?

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.043
Masquerade?

00:17:58.076 --> 00:17:59.912
Go on- finish what you've started!

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:01.814
Errrrhhhh!

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.449
If you defeat her, I'll move you up a notch

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.184
to ninth place.

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:06.919
No way? Do you mean it?

00:18:06.952 --> 00:18:08.153
Yes.

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:09.655
He-he-he-he!

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:11.323
That'll shut them up.

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.125
They won't be calling me double digits anymore!

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:14.660
Go on Cycloid!

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:16.862
Finish them off!

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:18.430
Count me in!

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:23.202
[Roar]

00:18:24.803 --> 00:18:27.906
[scream]

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:32.044
Huhn?

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:37.282
No-o-o-o!

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:39.485
Julie! Go!

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:42.154
I can't hold out much longer!

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:45.123
Billy do you remember? That toy!

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:46.391
You gave it to me when we we're in kindergarten!

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:47.593
Oh!

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:50.863
It's for you.

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:53.232
Wow, that's so nice of you.

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.100
Keep this up and I can tell-

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:57.002
you and I will become the greatest of friends.

00:18:57.035 --> 00:18:58.537
Yeah! M-m-mhmmmm!

00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:03.675
Listen to me!

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:05.744
Billy you're my only chance to survive this!

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.383
Julie...

00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:13.886
Julie you have to get off! Now!

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:17.222
Grrrh-uh!

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.624
I knew this was a mistake!

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:22.294
Grr-rrr-rrrr!

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:23.795
Call it off!

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:26.665
Or I'll bust your grill!

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:28.367
You're already too late.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.002
Outta the Way-y-y!

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:38.810
Noooo-oooh!

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.312
Billy!

00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:45.117
Doom card! Out!

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.151
Excuse me?

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.065
Oh!

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:04.770
Yeah!

00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:06.738
My Billy's Back!

00:20:15.847 --> 00:20:17.849
Sorry.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:18.850
Yah think you can find it in your heart somewhere

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.819
to forgive me?

00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:23.355
I know I was being like a total jerk and everything.

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:26.024
But I was so focused on winning and raising my rank

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.726
that I didn't even see what I was really about to lose.

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:30.195
So don't be mad at me?

00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:31.930
No problem!

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:33.298
I can't stay mad at anyone ...

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:36.235
except Masquerade.

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:38.003
You're the one destroying the game!

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:40.839
[laughter]

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:42.574
But you don't even lift a finger,

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:44.009
you just send in other Bakugan players

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:45.911
to do your dirty work!

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:47.479
She's right!

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:49.147
I've never seen this poser in battle!

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:50.816
So what are you afraid of slacker?

00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:57.856
[laughter]

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:11.103
Coming up on Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.671
The sky's the limit, our gang is heading in

00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:14.973
for a crash landing.

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:17.175
Frustration mounts as everyone is getting

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:19.745
on each others nerves, especially Shun's.

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.980
Who left over a heated battle of words with Dan,

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.415
saying he couldn't stand being fake friends

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:25.317
any longer.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.719
Meanwhile, Komba, a sore loser and former rival

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.721
of Shun's has a score to settle.

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:31.757
Will Shun count on his friends?

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.660
Or is he about to go from Hero to Zero?

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:36.695
Oh Shun, don't you know there's safety in numbers?
