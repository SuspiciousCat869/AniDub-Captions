WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.307
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.742
when all these random cards

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.111
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.012
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.414
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.649
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.184
That's when we realized

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.720
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:21.821
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.124
from another world!

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.259
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.194
Runo...

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.497
Marucho...

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.700
Julie...

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.503
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.671
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.507
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.908
Bakugan!

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.744
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:48.081
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:51.084
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.153
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.187
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.289
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.390
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.426
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.627
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.762
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:06.866
\u266a On the inside

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.969
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.505
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.540
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.479
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.014
in A Combination Battle!

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.185
DAN: Aw don't be a wimp Runo!

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.020
Let's do Extreme Mountain next!

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:28.254
I want to ride the Ferris Wheel!

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:29.522
Ex-treme Moun-tain!

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:30.557
The Ferris Wheel!

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.125
Oh whoopee!

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:33.126
A big wheel that goes round and round!

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.461
Whatta blast!

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:35.462
Just because it doesn't go up and down

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.729
at a 100 miles an hour

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.730
doesn't mean it won't be fun!

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.265
Yeah it'll be boring!

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.467
Well I've got six tickets in my pocket!

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.534
How many do you have left?

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:43.203
No you wouldn't...

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.004
Ah!

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:46.005
I guess you shouldn't have wasted your money

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.408
on all those gnarly corndogs...

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.843
I'll share my tickets if we go on the Ferris Wheel first!

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.478
You are so brutal!

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.012
I knew this would turn into a snooze fest!

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.948
You spent your whole allowance!

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.216
You've been stuffing your face with junk food all day...

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.084
You've got no money left.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.186
You want to get to on Extreme Mountain you be nice to me!

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.788
A corndog...

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.289
I bought you a corndog,

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.290
that's gotta be worth something.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.658
A corndog!

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.527
Listen up buddy!

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.362
We're going to go on the Ferris Wheel next!

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.464
If you want any of my tickets do as I say!

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.567
[loud arguing]

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.302
...There they go again.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.805
These humans are indeed a curious species...

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:19.806
Exteme Mountain!

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.407
Ferris Wheel!

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.510
[applause]

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:24.544
What's happening over there?

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.314
Awe-some!

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.816
Ladies and gentlemen can we have two volunteers

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.818
for our next illusion?

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.353
Anybody out there interested?

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:35.021
Yo! Right here! Pick us!

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.089
You two!

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.090
Come on up here!

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:38.258
Oh yeah!

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.325
Here we come!

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.161
Ta-dah!

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:43.930
We'll start with a card trick!

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:46.633
Go ahead pick a card, any card!

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.067
Right...

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.636
Which one should I choose... ?

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.171
Dan... Pick a card...

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:52.739
Come on buddy... I don't have all day!

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:55.675
Chill... I'm thinking.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.745
I... pick this... ...card here!

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:02.849
A Doom Card!

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:04.250
That's twisted!

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.485
Yeah ya know why?

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.886
Masquerade's behind this!

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.454
You're right...

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.756
Allow me to introduce myself and my brother!

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:10.957
I'm Kenta.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.158
I'm Kenji...

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.693
You're Runo right?

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.495
And you must be Dan Kuso...

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.130
Masquerade says you're the one to beat.

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:18.197
You up for a battle?

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.732
Always...

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:20.833
Dan, I can handle these two.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.435
What?

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:24.637
This is all a set up by Masquerade...

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:27.073
He's watching you and if you take part in this battle

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:28.608
you'll be playing right into his hands.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:29.709
Yeah maybe...

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:30.944
But so what...

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.212
I can't back out of this.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:33.846
You have to!

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.949
They challenged me, not you!

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.650
What about the magic show?

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.052
Are you two up for a combination battle?

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:40.420
What?

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:41.955
A combination battle?

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:43.256
The two of you against the two of us!

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.624
That way the odds are even.

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:45.725
That sounds fair doesn't it.

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:47.293
Sounds crowded...

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.761
Sure! Let's do it!

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.796
Ready when you are!

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:52.665
Bakugan!

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:53.833
Field open!

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:00.974
Doom card set!

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:04.944
Throw the gate card!

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.279
Set!

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.385
Bakugan...

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.987
...Brawl!

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:16.889
Bakugan stand!

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:22.328
Ability Card activate!

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.497
Robotallian enforcement!

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.965
BAKU-POD: Power level 380Gs

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.700
Ha!

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.402
What a bonehead maneuver!

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.770
He's using a fire attribute just like me!

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.305
Wait Dan!

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:33.339
What if it's some kind of trap!

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:34.607
A trap?

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:36.776
Get with the program!

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.044
Haven't you learned anything from Drago?

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.512
Yeah sure I have...

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:41.748
I know that if I send my Griffin in

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.349
he's got the skills to go one on one with his Robotallian!

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:44.917
Bakugan...

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.120
Brawl!

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:48.521
Bakugan stand!

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.325
You're up Kenji!

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:53.326
Now go!

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.460
Bakugan...

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.029
Brawl!

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:58.264
Bakugan stand!

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:03.770
Ability card activate!

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:04.971
Marionette!

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:10.376
Check it out brother!

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.944
The Marionette is an ability card that lets you move

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.147
any standing Bakugan to any part of the battlefield you want!

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:17.583
Ah not yet!

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.120
No Griffin!

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:24.424
[evil laugh]

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.626
You should put your Bakugans in show business...

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.361
They do a great vanishing act!

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:29.796
[laughing]

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.497
Your move!

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.900
That was some mean hocus pocus!

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:35.635
What's next, he gonna pull a rabbit out of a hat?

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:37.203
That was just one of their cards,

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:38.838
and it cost you a Bakugan!

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:40.473
Who knows what else they have up their sleeves?

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.741
Thanks!

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.376
You're a big help!

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.877
Remain calm.

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:46.913
Utilize the Bakugans you have.

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:48.514
You can do this.

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:50.349
Make your move my lady...

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:51.617
His Mantris is tough but he's got to have a weak spot

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:53.019
somewhere.

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.021
His power level is at 350.

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:56.522
And I'm pretty sure that gate card

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.458
can boost the power of Darkus.

00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.926
And that's just the kind of juice I need.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.461
There's only one way to find out!

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:02.929
Bakugan brawl!

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:07.600
Ability card activate!

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.035
Combination of Haos and Darkus!

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.873
A light attributed Bakugan can spike its power level

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:16.976
by a 100Gs against a Darkus attributed Bakugan!

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:17.977
BAKU-POD: Calculating Serpenoid power level...

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.378
400Gs...

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:22.181
That won't help you!

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.383
I'll show you why!

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.351
Gate card open!

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:26.385
Level down!

The \"level down\" command card

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:35.528
forcibly decrease the power level by 100Gs

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:38.064
once your Bakugan's level goes over 400.

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:40.299
You wasted the combination of Darkus and Haos

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.467
and now you'll pay!

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:42.935
Mantris!

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.103
Send him off the field!

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.678
No! Snakie! Come back!

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.247
Smooth move Runo!

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.381
You really know how to dish it out!

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.550
That's what you call a trap?

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:58.551
Well you should know!

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.620
Stop it you two!

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:01.687
Your fight belongs on the battlefield!

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:02.755
Not here!

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:05.057
Stop this!

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.092
Kenta!

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:07.660
Yes brother!

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:11.230
Gate card... Set!

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.599
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.170
Bakugan stand!

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.978
Oh no you don't!

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.582
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:34.887
Bakugan stand!

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.291
BAKU-POD: Saurus power level...

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:40.126
290Gs.

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.794
You're taking a chance...

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:43.129
Are you sure you wanna risk it?

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:44.330
You know it!

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.465
Go!

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:56.142
You are gonna get played now magic man!

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:57.510
That was the\"power charge\" ability card and it just

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:00.780
zapped Saurus's power level by a 100Gs!

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.448
In the next battle he can attack anywhere on the field!

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.483
Wow...

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:05.785
Slammin' move and you thought of that all by yourself?

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:06.953
Hey watch it!

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.087
Bakugan...

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.422
Brawl!

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:11.891
Bakugan stand!

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:15.661
Ability activate!

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:19.532
Pyrus versus Darkus!

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.567
I've never heard of that before...

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.202
It's another combo ability card...

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:25.104
Don't sweat it!

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:27.340
It won't do much good against Saurus's jungle breath!

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.577
BAKU-POD: Adjusting power levels...

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:34.547
Suarus at 390Gs

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.082
Turn up the heat Saurus...

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:37.516
Gate card open!

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:42.822
That'll pump us up another 50Gs

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.257
BAKU-POD: Adjusting Saurus power level...

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.825
440 Gs

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:47.193
Now squash that bug!

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.865
What's gives?

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.401
Saurus has got way more juice than that creepy crawler!

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:56.903
Look at this...

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:58.905
Centipoid's power level is spiking!

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:00.306
BAKU-POD: Adjusting Centipoid's power level...

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:02.408
Stabilizing at 460Gs!

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.978
Pyrus and Darkus are opposites.

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:07.647
When I use them together,

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.482
on a fire attributed Bakugan like yours

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:12.585
it pushes my power level up 100Gs.

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:14.420
Combined they can be a powerful force.

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:15.655
It's all in the cards!

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:18.190
[evil laugh]

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.293
This is what I call a combination battle!

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.194
You said it brother!

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.696
Your Bakugan's time is up Dan!

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:24.697
Centipoid!

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.932
Finish him!

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.834
No!

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:29.869
Saurus!

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:39.645
Saurus! Come back!

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:43.783
[evil laughter]

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:44.884
Yeah!

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.854
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.092
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers are back!

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.126
Battle on!

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:57.129
Dan you can't win!

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.998
You've got one Bakugan left.

00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:00.733
Darn!

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:02.735
I can't take another knock-out!

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.537
We need to scheme something real fast!

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.772
Hey... I know...!

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:08.441
This should do the trick!

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:10.142
Gate Card set!

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:15.247
Bakugan brawl!

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.716
Bakugan stand!

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:22.955
BAKU-POD: Haos Saurus recognized...

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:23.956
Calculating power level...

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.725
290Gs.

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.360
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.029
Bakugan stand!

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.266
Wait Kenta!

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.668
Don't worry brother!

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.737
Ability card activate!

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.939
Siege! Take it!

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.474
Fire sword!

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:43.175
Arm yourself!

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:45.277
Go Siege! Battle!

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.379
Finish them!

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:50.116
RUNO: I knew you were gonna do that!

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.517
What?

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.285
All right! Gate card open!

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.187
Triple battle activate!

00:10:58.057 --> 00:10:59.658
Now to get this fight really kickin'

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:02.194
we need a third Bakugan on the battlefield!

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:04.196
Dan, if you're good to go we need you!

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.698
All right!

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:07.967
I see where you're coming from!

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.835
With two Bakugans we can pull off some sweet moves!

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:10.836
Yeah!

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.937
Ah wicked!

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:13.105
Let's slam 'em!

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:14.140
Right Drago!

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:17.076
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.450
Battle!

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:32.191
Hey Siege! Above you!

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:33.692
Ability card activate!

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:36.829
Boosted Dragon!

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:45.971
We did it Dan!

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:47.306
Yeah!

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:48.941
Congratulations...

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:49.942
That was an excellent strategy my lady.

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:52.211
Well done.

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:54.313
You caught your opponents off guard!

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:55.314
Wha?

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:57.249
My Siege.

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:58.951
You should have listened to me.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:00.052
Huh?

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:01.253
You had your chance brother.

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.089
Now it's my turn...

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:05.324
With this card I'll take control of this battle!

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:07.059
Gate card set!

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.462
Whoa Kenji!

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:10.563
Bakugan!

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.531
Brawl!

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.467
Bakugan stand!

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.205
The Reaper!

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.706
Uh Dan you take ugly...

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:21.707
I'll handle the other one...

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.442
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:32.084
Shade ability activate!

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:37.590
BAKU-POD: Adjusting Siege power level...

00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:39.792
330Gs.

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:42.561
\"Shade ability\" is one of the choicest cards ...

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.230
It can squash all the other ability card effects

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.198
that are happening on the battlefield!

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:47.800
They've got us again!

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:48.868
Wait Kenta!

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:50.836
No Kenji!

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.172
I'm the one who taught you how to play Bakugan!

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:54.707
I know the game way better than you do!

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.242
Kenta?

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:57.610
Bakugan! Brawl!

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.621
[roar]

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:10.289
Gate card open!

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:13.926
This is it!

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:15.961
Ability card activate!

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:17.229
Backfire!

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.401
That makes the gate card you threw down useless!

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:23.402
BAKU-POD: Power level drop detected...

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:24.637
Adjusting level...

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.406
Haos Saurus now at 290Gs!

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:28.407
Garganoid!

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.842
Attack!

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.477
Come n' get it!

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.745
Ability card activate!

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:34.513
\"Cut-in-Saber!\"

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.918
[high roar]

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:43.222
What is she doing?

00:13:43.255 --> 00:13:45.524
How did she put Tigrerra in the battle?

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:47.026
You can thank the \"Cut-in-Saber\" ability card

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:48.260
for that!

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:49.829
Right!

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:50.930
Time to clean house!

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:52.264
Go!

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.101
Oh no!

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.107
Awesome!

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:04.076
Nice move Runo!

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:06.345
Thanks Tigrerra!

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:08.380
You sent that big bad Garganoid packin'!

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:09.815
Ha! That's nothing!

00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:11.150
Drago...

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:12.451
You fightin' machine...

00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:13.919
-Turn it on! -I'm ready!

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:16.822
Bakugan! Brawl!

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:18.190
Yeah! Right onto Reaper's orb card!

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:19.525
Bakugan stand!

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:24.296
He's no match for the Reaper!

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.598
Gate card open!

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:32.304
So we meet again Drago.

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:33.973
Traitor!

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:35.708
I'll make you pay for your betrayal!

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:37.710
Let's brawl!

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:40.346
Masquerade has got you fooled Reaper...

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.914
You're only being used!

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:43.549
What do you know?

00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:45.818
Masquerade gives me everything I want...

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:48.387
If I have to destroy my own kind then so be it!

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.289
And you're next on my list Drago!

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:53.492
Oh yes I can taste the power!

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:55.160
BAKU-POD: Power level... 420Gs

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:56.929
I - will - stop - you!

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:58.297
Take him down!

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.698
Boosted dragon!

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.839
Yeah that's it!

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:08.374
Take that demon to school Drago!

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.575
Gate card set!

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.911
Bakugan! Brawl!

00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:15.381
Bakugan stand!

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:21.620
Mantris's power level is 350Gs.

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:23.922
My next Bakugan will have to be choice!

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:25.357
I'd better go with one that has a pumped up power level!

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:26.358
Runo!

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:27.493
Hold on...

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:28.694
Why?

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:29.695
What gives?

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:31.297
It's weird...

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.665
Kenji's Centipoid has a power level of 360...

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.533
And...

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:36.101
the power of Mantris is at 350!

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:38.337
Oh!

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.438
They must be trying to fake us out with the gate card!

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:41.006
Yeah!

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.042
That's why Kenji put Mantris in!

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:44.743
All right...

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.178
We'll need an ability card!

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:47.746
Runo! You're up!

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.248
Put Saurus in the game!

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:50.516
You first...

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:51.884
Then me!

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:52.885
I gotcha!

00:15:52.918 --> 00:15:55.921
Gate card set!

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:58.357
Bakugan brawl!

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.492
Come on!

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:05.964
Gate card set!

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:07.900
Bakugan brawl!

00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:09.735
Go Drago!

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:12.504
Boosted dragon!

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:17.309
BAKU-POD: Centipoid eliminated!

00:16:19.244 --> 00:16:20.379
It's over!

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:23.582
Done like dinner!

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:26.018
THINKING: No we're still in this...

00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:27.986
I have a command card...

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.489
All I need to do is get rid of Saurus with my next shot!

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:34.993
Bakugan! Brawl!

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:36.595
Bakugan stand!

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:41.300
Busted.

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:43.168
Of all the cards left to play

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.803
you had to roll up onto that one...

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.972
You scammer...

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:48.507
Your tricks don't work on us anymore.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.808
Okay...

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.077
Let me guess what that card is

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:53.379
...The \"quartet battle\" card maybe?

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.847
Oh no!

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.014
The \"quartet battle\" card

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:57.816
starts a four-way battle.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:58.884
Each team has to throw in one more Bakugan

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:00.953
once the battle starts.

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:01.954
You were going to use your ability cards

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:03.322
to increase Mantris's power

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:04.390
and have Centipoid there for back up

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:06.225
weren't you smiley!

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:08.327
Drago and Tigrerra would be toast if it worked...

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.495
You were gonna give them a one way ticket

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:10.529
to the Doom Dimension!

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:11.897
Admit it!

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.399
How did you know?

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:15.334
Because...

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.269
You were so stoked for a combination battle with us!

00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:19.037
We knew you had a \"quartet battle\" card!

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:21.140
Yeah! You still won't win this battle!

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:23.275
Gate card open!

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:24.410
Quartet battle!

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.861
We got 'em!

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:44.930
All we have to do now is deal with Mantris!

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:46.365
That's one down! One to go!

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:48.200
[laughs]

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:50.402
Hey pal! What's so funny?

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:52.771
It's a little to early for a victory party...

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.807
I actually do have a card up my sleeve...

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.242
And guess what, it's an ability card!

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:58.577
Which one is it?

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.612
Ability card activate!

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:01.647
Twin machete!

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:08.454
BAKU-POD: Mantris power level increase...

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:10.155
450 Gs

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:12.057
Dan!

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.293
The Boosted Dragon only gives us 440 Gs!

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:15.761
We can't beat him!

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:17.429
No...

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.131
It might look messed up but it's not!

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:21.100
If the quartet battle card activates

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:22.568
everything will be cool!

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:23.635
We'll be back on top after that!

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:25.170
Yeah!

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:26.205
But what if it doesn't activate?

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:30.109
Drago!

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:31.777
Goes to the Doom Dimension!

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.579
Don't worry about me...

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.080
Your concern is appreciated but this battle

00:18:35.113 --> 00:18:36.882
is too important to lose.

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.617
Whatta ya mean by that?

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.219
I can't explain right now but if you have to let me go

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:42.688
then don't hesitate.

00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:44.723
When the time comes you will know what to do...

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:46.391
Trust yourself and trust me!

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:47.626
Drago?

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:49.027
I trust you...

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:50.362
You know that.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.097
Let's do what we have to do!

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.532
Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:56.268
Bakugan stand!

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:01.807
Here we go Drago!

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.976
Bakugan stand!

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.283
Battle!

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:18.857
Drago... Hang in there!

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:21.059
Your Bakugan puts up a good fight

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:23.228
but it won't do any good.

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:24.796
Mantris still has the higher power level.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.831
See for yourself.

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:32.871
Don't worry about me...

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:33.972
Drago...

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.274
Hang on!

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:36.441
It's time!

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:37.876
Mantris!

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:38.944
Send him to the Doom Dimension!

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:40.212
Noooooo!

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:41.613
Are you ready Dan?

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:43.615
You know what to do.

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:46.385
The time has come...

00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:49.288
This battle is ours!

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:51.290
Quartet battle! Activate!

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.061
I don't believe it...

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.095
You tricked me!

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:01.700
Not two against one!

00:20:09.508 --> 00:20:11.176
What was that?

00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:12.477
It's over now... We lost!

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:16.949
[spattering of applause]

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.985
We did it Drago.

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:21.553
Yeah we won!

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:23.422
To a well timed attack...

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:25.524
...and a strong team!

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:27.559
That battle was intense.

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:28.694
Whatta ya say we chill out for a while

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:29.695
on one of these rides Runo?

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:30.862
Your pick!

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.898
Sure.

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:35.000
So... Let me guess the Ferris Wheel?

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:37.002
Are you still stoked about Extreme Mountain?

00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:38.604
Oh I can go on that next time...

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:40.205
Right now I feel like kickin' back

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:41.506
on that big ol spinning wheel.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.408
Not me...

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:44.643
I'm in the mood for Extreme Mountain!

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:46.445
No way...

00:20:46.478 --> 00:20:47.846
I said we'll try that out next time...

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:49.147
Come on, let's go...

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:50.616
the Ferris Wheel.

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:51.617
I say Extreme Mountain!

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.618
Ferris Wheel.

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:54.286
Extreme Mountain!

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:55.988
Ahhh, I suppose this was bound to happen...

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:58.323
I'll never understand these humans...

00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:04.930
[arguing continues]

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:09.534
RUNO: On the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers...

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:11.470
A new Bakugan arrives in town

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:13.038
and things really take off for him.

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:14.973
But he soon finds out that the city can be

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:16.775
real confusing and it sure helps to have a friend

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:18.310
to show you around.

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:19.311
Luckily he hooks up with a group of girls

00:21:19.344 --> 00:21:21.780
who just love Bakugan.

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:23.515
Unfortunately they take the game a little to seriously

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:24.883
and when a battle breaks out our little friend really

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:28.120
has to step up just to keep his head above the water.

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:30.088
It a full on showdown and you sure won't want to miss it!

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:32.557
Next time on Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.359
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.028
Hey look! Giraffes!
